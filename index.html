          <p>An early morning explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood resulted in one fatality and two injuries. The blast caused the partial collapse of three rowhomes and damaged at least seven properties, leading to the evacuation of nearby residents. Officials have launched a comprehensive investigation into the cause, which will involve a slow, methodical "brick by brick" search of the rubble to prevent any secondary collapses. The city has established support services, including mental health resources and a fund for impacted families, at a local elementary school.</p>

EnrÃ­quez expressed frustration with the World Boxing Council for a lack of opportunities to unify her title, accusing the organization of protecting the current champion. Feeling her boxing career had stalled, she made a successful MMA debut in March and will now focus on this new discipline. This move reflects a growing trend of boxers transitioning to MMA when they feel disrespected or sidelined within their original sport, seeking the opportunities and attention they feel they deserve.</p>

          <p>The UK punk duo Bob Vylan has drawn widespread condemnation for leading chants of "death to the IDF" during their Glastonbury Festival performance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled the act "appalling hate speech," and festival organizers stated the comments "very much crossed a line." The BBC, which broadcast the set live with a warning, confirmed the performance will not be available on its iPlayer service.

Filings show Huang recently sold about $15 million in shares as part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 6 million shares. Despite the insider sales, Nvidia's stock has continued to perform strongly, recently regaining its position as the world's most valuable company. (not investment advice)</p>

Recent Chinese export controls and invasive licensing processes are highlighted as evidence of this leverage.

He highlighted potential negative impacts on rural hospitals, health insurance access, and food assistance programs.

          <p>An intense, early-summer heatwave is sweeping across Europe, breaking temperature records in several countries. Spain recorded a new national high for June at 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities, including Rome and Venice, on high alert. Authorities in Greece issued fresh wildfire warnings, and London is expected to experience its hottest day of the year. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to human-driven climate change, warning that such extreme weather events are becoming the new norm and are having a tangible impact on both human life and biodiversity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising temperatures, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take extreme precautions, as exercising dogs in hot weather is a leading cause of heat-related illness. The RSPCA advises against walks in the heat, as dogs can only sweat through their paws and can overheat quickly. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and difficulty breathing. Experts recommend checking pavement temperature with the back of your hand and walking dogs only in the very early morning or late evening. For super-hot days, keeping dogs indoors with air conditioning or a fan is the safest option.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran could restart significant uranium enrichment in "a matter of months." Following recent U.S. military strikes on its nuclear facilities, Grossi believes the damage was not total and that Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to quickly resume its program. He also noted the possibility that Iran may have moved enriched uranium to secret locations before the attack. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic talks and for international inspectors to regain access to the sites.</p>

          <p>Norway's state-owned gambling company, Norsk Tipping, mistakenly informed several thousand Eurojackpot players that they had won millions of kroner. The error was caused by a technical glitch in the currency conversion from euros to Norwegian kroner, which multiplied the prize amounts by 100 instead of performing the correct calculation. The company's CEO, Tonje Sagstuen, has since resigned, issuing an apology for the breach of trust and the disappointment caused to those who briefly believed they were millionaires. No incorrect prize money was paid out, and the correct, much smaller winnings were later updated.</p>
