          <p>The Israeli military launched an attack on Sana'a International Airport in Yemen, claiming it was used by Houthi militants, following a Houthi missile strike near Tel Aviv airport. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated the airport was used for weapons transfer and terrorist activities, leading to its shutdown. Israel also targeted power stations and a concrete factory allegedly used for military infrastructure, issuing an evacuation warning before the strike. This action underscores the ongoing conflict dynamics in the region, with Israel asserting its right to defend against perceived threats from Iranian-backed groups.</p>

          <p>States have been using taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to increase federal matching funds, a tactic congressional Republicans are now considering curtailing or ending. This maneuver, called a Medicaid provider tax, allows states to inflate Medicaid spending on paper and collect more federal funds, saving the federal government an estimated $600 billion over the next decade. While legal, some Republicans and conservative think tanks criticize the payments as gimmicks and scams, but some states, particularly Republican-led ones, heavily rely on this strategy to finance their Medicaid programs.</p>

          <p>Newark Airport is facing significant delays and cancellations due to an air traffic controller shortage and equipment failures, with multiple controllers on trauma leave after a recent communication outage. An equipment issue caused controllers to temporarily lose radar and communication with planes, leading to stress and trauma.

Labour's spokesman stated there would be no change to the policy, which restricts eligibility for the annual payments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged voter dissatisfaction with the cuts but defended them as necessary for public service investment. Former cabinet minister Louise Haigh criticized the cuts as a key issue for voters, while Liberal Democrats condemned the government's tone-deaf response.</p>

However, rates could decrease later in the year if the Fed implements anticipated rate cuts, although the decline is not expected to be significant. Some analysts suggest that savings account yields could rise if tariffs increase, leading to higher inflation. Consumers are advised to consider high-yield savings accounts and CDs to maximize earnings, with local community banks and credit unions potentially offering better yields.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:22:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz stated that President Trump's tariffs on China are unlikely to bring toy manufacturing back to America, but will instead lead to price increases for consumers. He explained that while toy creation and design occur in America, producing products in other countries allows for quality products at affordable prices. Mattel has been diversifying its manufacturing base for a decade to reduce reliance on China, with plans to source less than 40% of its products from the country by year's end.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A slump in U.S. exports, particularly in the agricultural sector, has widened to encompass nearly all U.S. exports due to President Trump's trade tariffs, according to supply chain data. Ports are experiencing significant decreases in exports, with the Port of Oregon seeing a 51% drop and the Port of Tacoma a 28% decrease. This decline is linked to fewer containerships coming to the U.S. and changes in global demand. The data suggests that small businesses are pausing orders, leading to potential "lean" retail inventories in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The United Nations and its partners have criticized Israel's plan to allow international aid into Gaza under its control, citing that the conditions would turn aid into a military pressure tactic and violate neutrality principles. This proposal comes after Israel barred aid deliveries for months, prompting international calls to end the blockade. Aid groups argue that the plan would leave parts of Gaza without supplies and allow Israel to control aid as leverage, while Israel claims it is pressing Hamas to release hostages and prevent aid diversion.</p>
