UCLA will distribute $20.5 million in revenue sharing while maintaining Olympic sports programs and current scholarship limits. The revenue sharing arrangement is expected to allocate the majority of funds to football players, followed by men's and women's basketball players. The ability to pay players directly could help UCLA compete with other Big Ten Conference schools, and the school is seeking a third-party partner to secure NIL opportunities.</p>

          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took her first flight from the nest. The eaglet, sister to Sunny, was seen flapping her wings and soaring off into the air after some practice. Gizmo's flight occurred at 89 days old, following Sunny's first flight earlier in the week. While the eaglets will eventually leave the nest, they are expected to return periodically over the next few months, according to Friends of Big Bear Valley.</p>
