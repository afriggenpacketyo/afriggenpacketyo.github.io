          <p>Former US president Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Biden sought medical attention for urinary symptoms, revealing a high-grade cancer characterized by a Gleason score of 9 out of 10. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options, with his office noting that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. This news follows Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 US presidential election due to health and age concerns, marking a significant turn in his post-presidency life.</p>

          <p>Russia targeted Ukraine with a large drone bombardment, primarily aimed at Kyiv, resulting in one civilian death and several injuries, including a child. The attack involved an estimated 273 drones and decoys, with Ukrainian forces intercepting 88 of them, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. This show of force occurred just before a scheduled call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, as Trump pushes for a cease-fire deal. President Zelensky met with Vice President JD Vance in Rome, signaling a potential attempt to ease tensions and focus on cease-fire negotiations, with Pope Leo XIV offering the Vatican as a venue for peace talks.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the commencement of extensive ground operations throughout the northern and southern Gaza Strip, aimed at pressuring Hamas amid ongoing cease-fire negotiations. Simultaneously, the Israeli government stated it would allow a basic quantity of food to enter Gaza, reversing a 10-week blockade implemented to pressure Hamas into extending a previous cease-fire. This policy shift follows mounting international pressure and concerns about a looming famine in Gaza, with Prime Minister Netanyahu's office citing an operational need to expand the military operation to defeat Hamas. Despite these developments, indirect talks between Israel and Hamas continue in Doha, Qatar, seeking a broader deal to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailing ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and drifted into the bridge, causing its masts and rigging to smash. New York City officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, responded to the scene, with investigations underway to determine the cause of the accident. The incident prompted a brief closure of the Brooklyn Bridge, with structural inspections confirming no major damage to the iconic landmark, while injured crew members received medical treatment at local hospitals.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, secured a narrow lead in the first round of Poland’s presidential election, a vote viewed as crucial for Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s efforts to reverse hard-right policies. Trzaskowski, a member of Tusk’s Civic Platform, garnered 30.8 percent of the vote, narrowly edging out Karol Nowrocki, backed by the Law and Justice party, who received 29.1 percent. With no candidate securing a majority, a runoff election is scheduled for June 1, presenting Trzaskowski with a potential challenge given the combined support for right-wing candidates, as the Polish presidency holds veto powers that could impact Tusk’s agenda.</p>

          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's ruling Democratic Alliance (AD) is likely to win the most votes in Sunday's election; however, it is projected to fall short of securing an outright majority. The AD is expected to garner between 29% to 34% of the vote, necessitating coalition deals with smaller parties to achieve a majority in the 230-seat parliament. This election, the third in as many years, follows the collapse of the previous minority government and is dominated by issues such as housing and immigration. The far-right Chega party is anticipated to exceed pre-election predictions, potentially complicating coalition negotiations.</p>

          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, stating he had nihilistic ideations and was against bringing people into the world against their will. Bartkus is believed to have died in the explosion, which the FBI is treating as an intentional act of terrorism. The bomb was a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, with the blast felt more than a mile away, with investigators believing Bartkus attempted to livestream the bombing. The community and officials have expressed grief and concern, with assurances that there is no ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration's policy granting refugee status to White South Africans, stating people should celebrate the move. The policy allows South Africans of European descent, particularly Afrikaners, to resettle in the U.S., based on claims of oppression and land seizures. President Trump signed an executive order halting aid to South Africa and has claimed a genocide is underway, though crime figures are not released by race. Despite criticism and tensions with the South African government, Rubio asserted that these individuals are fleeing threats to their lives and property.</p>
