          <h2>US Concerned Over China's Military Training and Aid in Africa</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 04:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Pentagon is expressing concern over China's increasing military training programs for African military officers, with General Michael Langley of AFRICOM noting that China is replicating US training programs like IMET. This concern arises as the US shifts its approach from direct military aid to encouraging African countries to be self-reliant. China has become a major supplier of military equipment, particularly in the Sahel region, as junta-led leaders move away from Western partners. The IMET program has trained thousands of Africans, but recent US foreign aid cuts have impacted its effectiveness.</p>

Additional hazards include frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds.

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka was omitted from England's squad to face Andorra in a World Cup qualifier, alongside Conor Gallagher and Ollie Watkins, with Watkins returning home due to a minor injury.

Saka, who has 43 caps for England, had previously missed three months due to a hamstring injury and it is uncertain whether he will play in the friendly against Senegal.

Iran views the policy as a violation of international law, depriving millions of the right to travel based on nationality or religion.
