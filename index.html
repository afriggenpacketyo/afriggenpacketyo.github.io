          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth testified before a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, facing scrutiny over the administration's immigration raids in Los Angeles and the deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to the city. This appearance marks the first time Hegseth has faced lawmakers since the revelation of his use of Signal to discuss military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen. The chats included top Trump officials and his wife, who is not a government employee. The questioning is expected to address the legality and ethical implications of these actions, given the sensitive nature of the information shared and the potential for security breaches.</p>

          <p>David Huerta, president of the California division of the Service Employees International Union, was charged with felony conspiracy to impede an officer after being arrested during anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. The protests, which followed ICE raids, led to President Trump deploying the National Guard over Governor Newsom's objections. Huerta was released on a $50,000 bond and is scheduled to appear in court in July, facing a potential sentence of up to six years in federal prison if convicted. Newsom and other Democratic leaders have denounced the arrest, with Newsom calling Huerta a respected leader and advocate for working people.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged £14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear project, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and enhance energy security, although Prime Minister Starmer stated he is "not writing a blank cheque" for the project. The project, which is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, has faced opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts. The government hopes the investment will attract private funding, reducing reliance on other countries and tackling climate change. However, concerns remain about the project's total cost, with some estimates suggesting it could double the initially projected £20 billion.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is cutting 3.5% of its workforce, citing challenges in the U.S. economy and the decline of linear television, as the company prepares for a merger with Skydance Media. The layoffs will primarily affect U.S. workers, with potential impacts on international staff later. This move follows a 15% workforce reduction last year as Paramount aims to cut costs and improve profitability amidst shifting consumer habits towards streaming. The company is also awaiting regulatory approval for the merger, while facing a lawsuit from President Trump regarding a CBS "60 Minutes" program, which the network denies as meritless.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a partial reversal of the government's decision to withdraw winter fuel payments from most pensioners, citing an improved economy as the reason. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of £35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. This decision follows pressure from charities, unions, and backbench MPs, after the government initially limited eligibility to only those receiving pension credit or other means-tested benefits. The government estimates the change will cost around £1.25 billion and will be detailed in the autumn Budget.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to their comments on Gaza, which the UK considers to have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. The sanctions include a ban from entering the UK and the freezing of any assets they hold in the country. This decision reflects growing international pressure on Israel regarding its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, with the UK also breaking off trade talks with Israel.

          <p>Pakistan has significantly increased its military spending, despite facing severe economic challenges, following recent clashes with India. The defense budget has been raised to 2.55 trillion Pakistani rupees ($9 billion), marking a 20% increase compared to the previous fiscal year. This decision comes as the country grapples with high inflation and relies on International Monetary Fund bailouts. While the military's popularity has surged after the recent conflict, analysts suggest the increased spending may lead to cuts in welfare and social sectors.</p>

          <p>Apple's annual developer conference featured a significant software update, introducing a new design language called Liquid Glass, but it underwhelmed Wall Street due to a lack of splashy AI announcements. The Liquid Glass interface represents the first major redesign of Apple's iPhone operating system since 2013, promising a fresh look across all of Apple's devices. However, investors were hoping for more substantial updates to Apple Intelligence, the company's AI system, but the rollout has been slower than expected. Analysts suggest that Apple needs to make bigger changes to its AI strategy to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests in response to recent immigration raids, with dozens of arrests made after days of clashes. President Trump has deployed thousands of National Guard troops to the city, sparking outrage from Democrats and leading to a lawsuit from the state. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in areas with large Latino populations, leading to confrontations, property damage, and freeway blockades. The situation has escalated tensions between state and federal authorities, raising concerns about the use of military force in civilian law enforcement.</p>

The state is suing the president for deploying troops without the governor's permission, arguing it is a violation of the US Constitution.

          <p>As Republicans weigh cuts to the Affordable Care Act, a poll finds that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA health plans identify as Republicans. This presents a potential conflict as the proposed legislation could cut billions in funding for the ACA, potentially causing millions to lose their health insurance. Experts suggest that the higher enrollment among Republicans may be due to the ACA's role in providing coverage for the self-employed and the fact that many red-leaning states did not expand Medicaid.</p>
