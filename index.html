          <p>The CEO of data operations company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has resigned after a video of him and the company's head of human resources went viral. The two were shown on a concert's 'kiss cam' in an intimate moment, which led to a formal investigation by the company. Astronomer, which recently raised $93 million in a new investment round, stated that its leaders must meet high standards of conduct and accountability. The company's cofounder will serve as interim CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>An underwater search has been initiated by police in Cheshire, UK, as part of the effort to find a missing 38-year-old woman named Rachel Booth. She was last seen by her family in the village of Barnton early on Saturday morning and was later captured on CCTV at a nearby garage. Police believe she may have traveled to the village of Oakmere, near Delamere Forest, where the search is now concentrated. A local water park has temporarily closed to assist with the investigation as police express growing concern for her welfare.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to take his family on a holiday to the United Kingdom, with a stay in the Cotswolds region. The trip is expected to take place next month, following President Trump's visit to Scotland. This comes after Vance made critical comments about the UK and European governments earlier in the year, accusing them of suppressing free speech and failing on immigration. His planned visit to Scotland may be met with a different reception, as he specifically criticized the Scottish government's policies on abortion clinic safe zones.</p>

          <p>Scottish ultra-runner Anna Rutherford achieved a remarkable victory in a 100-mile race, finishing more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor. The 43-year-old mother-of-three completed the Rat Race from Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh in 17 hours and 23 minutes. She ran the final 50 miles of the race entirely by herself and was reportedly back home in bed by the time the rest of the field began to cross the finish line. Rutherford credited her intense training and mental fortitude for the incredible performance.</p>

          <p>Ten officials in China's Gansu province are under investigation after a probe found that the provincial disease control agency and a local hospital faked test results in a major lead poisoning scandal. The investigation revealed that testing procedures and results for children at a kindergarten were deliberately manipulated. The provincial government issued a formal apology to the affected children and their parents, vowing to cover all medical costs. The incident has caused shock across the country and has led to a high-level disciplinary investigation into senior health officials.</p>

          <p>While companies often cite 'restructuring' or 'optimization' for recent job cuts, employment experts suspect artificial intelligence is a larger factor than is being publicly admitted. Firms like IBM and Klarna have been transparent about replacing roles with AI, but many others may be using vague terminology to avoid backlash from employees and the public. Experts believe that roles in customer service, content, and HR are particularly susceptible to AI-driven workforce reshaping. This strategic silence allows companies to manage optics while transitioning to greater automation behind the scenes.</p>

          <p>The family of an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident, Luis Leon, reports that he was secretly deported to Guatemala after he visited an immigration office to replace his lost green card. Leon, who was granted U.S. asylum in 1987 after fleeing Chile, was detained by ICE officers during the appointment. His family was unable to locate him and was later falsely told by someone claiming to be a lawyer that he had died. They eventually discovered from a relative that he was alive but hospitalized in Guatemala, a country to which he has no known connection.</p>

The Royal Ballet and Opera called the protest a 'spontaneous and unauthorised action' and stated it was inappropriate for a curtain call.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office has adopted a more combative and aggressive social media strategy, directly targeting President Trump and his allies with sharp, often personal, insults. This marks a significant pivot from the traditional Democratic approach of taking the 'high road,' with Newsom's aides stating the goal is to match the tactics of their opponents and punch back against what they call 'cruelty.' The strategy includes using memes and confrontational language, which has led to a massive increase in social media engagement but also risks alienating voters who prefer more respectful political discourse.</p>

This is the latest in a series of attacks that have caused travel chaos in Russia.

          <p>Multiple sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The meeting could occur on the sidelines of the summit, or potentially during a visit by Trump to China beforehand. Relations between the two nations have been tense since Trump's return to office and his threats of heavy tariffs on Chinese goods. However, recent high-level talks and a preliminary trade deal suggest both sides are working to stabilize the relationship.</p>
