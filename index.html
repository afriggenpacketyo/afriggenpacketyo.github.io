          <p>Global Energy Monitor reports that China is leading in repurposing decommissioned coal mines into solar power projects, with 90 former mines operating as solar facilities and additional projects planned. This trend aims to advance clean energy while potentially mitigating the surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. Outside of China, several countries are also pursuing similar conversion projects, though most are in early stages. These projects offer a chance to combine land restoration, job creation, and clean energy deployment, transforming 'abandoning' into 'rebuilding' in a symbolic energy transition.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested for allegedly assaulting an immigration official but was released within hours, leading to accusations of a staged political event. Critics like Joe Borelli suggest the arrest was timed to gain headlines and strengthen Lander's liberal credentials before the upcoming election. Video footage shows Lander questioning ICE agents about a judicial warrant during the arrest. Lander maintains he was standing up for due process rights for immigrants, while Republicans criticize his actions as supporting lawbreakers and obstructing law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reversed its recent decision to pause immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, allowing ICE to continue worksite enforcement operations targeting unauthorized immigrants. This policy shift follows concerns from industry leaders about the impact of immigration crackdowns on their foreign-born workforce. A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman stated that there would be no safe spaces for industries harboring violent criminals or undermining ICE's efforts, emphasizing the importance of worksite enforcement in safeguarding public safety and economic stability. This reversal aligns with the administration's broader vow to deport millions of immigrants living unlawfully in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity on passport applications and includes the option to select "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for Americans to self-select their gender on their passport application. The ACLU, representing transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued the policy was discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met on the sidelines of a G7 summit, aiming to reset relations after nearly two years of dispute over New Delhi's alleged involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist. Modi expressed hope for renewed cooperation with Ottawa, while Carney emphasized the importance of Canada-India ties based on mutual respect and the rule of law. The meeting comes after Canada accused India of involvement in the 2023 assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a charge India denies.</p>

An unnamed Canadian official stated that the U.S. wanted to water down the language, which the other six member countries felt was unfair to Ukraine. President Trump has repeatedly declined to blame Russia for invading Ukraine and has claimed that G7 members were responsible for starting the war by expelling Russia from the group in 2014.</p>
