        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares experienced a significant decline, plummeting as much as 7%, after the company reported third-quarter earnings that fell below analyst expectations. The streamer attributed this miss primarily to an unexpected expense stemming from an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities, which notably impacted its operating margin. Despite this immediate financial hit, Netflix reassured investors that it does not anticipate this specific matter to have a material impact on its future financial performance, suggesting the issue is contained rather than indicative of broader operational weakness. This article details the reported earnings per share of $5.87 against an estimated $6.97, although revenue met forecasts, underscoring the specific nature of the earnings shortfall.</p>

          <p>A targeted enforcement traffic stop in Los Angeles resulted in a shooting that injured both an undocumented immigrant and a law enforcement officer. According to a Department of Homeland Security official, the immigrant allegedly attempted to evade arrest by ramming a law enforcement vehicle, which prompted officers to fire defensive shots, striking him in the elbow. A U.S. marshal was also injured by a ricochet bullet in the hand, with both individuals receiving hospital treatment for their injuries. The DHS emphasized that the undocumented immigrant had previously escaped from custody, underscoring the inherent dangers law enforcement faces during such operations and the broader implications for public safety.</p>

          <p>With mortgage and home equity rates at multi-year lows and further Federal Reserve rate cuts widely anticipated for the end of October and December, homeowners are weighing options for home equity loans. The article advises that locking in a fixed home equity loan rate now might not be beneficial if rates fall further post-Fed meeting, as some lenders may have already priced in the expected cut. Instead, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) with its variable rate could be a more advantageous option to capitalize on future rate reductions, despite its inherent volatility. This article emphasizes comparing both options carefully based on individual financial needs and risk tolerance before taking action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has demanded $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice for its criminal investigations into him following his first term, as reported by The New York Times. These administrative claims specifically relate to probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election and his retention of classified documents after leaving the White House. Notably, any potential settlement might require approval from officials he appointed during his second term, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as his defense attorney in criminal cases. Trump alluded to these lawsuits, acknowledging the unusual position of suing an entity he now leads.</p>

          <p>Retirees are increasingly considering reverse mortgages to access home equity without incurring new monthly payments, an appealing option amidst rising living costs and persistent inflation. The article details three main types of reverse mortgage loan options. Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) are federally insured, offering built-in protections and flexible payout choices. Proprietary reverse mortgages, or jumbo loans, cater to high-value homes with higher borrowing limits but come with fewer government protections. Lastly, single-purpose reverse mortgages are affordable, limited-use loans typically offered by state or non-profit organizations for specific expenses. Understanding these distinct options is crucial for retirees seeking financial breathing room and peace of mind in their later years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis report that Trump administration tariffs, imposed on various nations and industries, are fueling inflation, particularly for widely imported goods like furniture and car parts. Their analysis suggests companies are currently passing on about 35% of tariff costs to consumers, with Goldman Sachs predicting this could eventually rise to 55%. These levies added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate between June and August, contributing to inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.

          <p>A significant Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage caused widespread global disruptions, taking major sites offline for hours and reigniting debate about over-reliance on a few U.S. tech firms for critical infrastructure. The article highlights that Amazon and Microsoft collectively corner a large share of the cloud market, creating "nested dependency" where even small outages can ripple through the global economy. Experts acknowledge the economic benefits of hyperscalers but warn against assuming their inherent resilience, as demonstrated by this event. The outage underscores the urgent need for greater IT resilience and diversified cloud providers, prompting calls for government intervention to boost competition in the concentrated market.</p>

          <p>A new study by Jobs for the Future reveals that six in ten U.S. workers believe their jobs fall short of "quality" standards, which encompass fair pay, stable schedules, career growth, and a respectful workplace culture. Only 40% of over 18,000 surveyed workers reported having quality jobs, with 62% experiencing unpredictable schedules and nearly a third struggling financially. The article emphasizes that official labor statistics often fail to capture the complete picture of job quality, which also includes agency and voice in decisions. This research highlights significant gaps in financial well-being, growth opportunities, and worker influence across the American workforce, disproportionately affecting younger, female, and non-White employees.</p>

          <p>The priceless jewels stolen from the Louvre museum in a recent brazen heist were not privately insured, as confirmed by France's Ministry of Culture. French law prohibits national museums like the Louvre from insuring their property, considering their collections state property for which the state alone bears responsibility, except when pieces are moved or loaned. Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau estimated the stolen crown jewels' monetary worth at 88 million euros ($102 million), emphasizing this figure does not account for their inestimable historical value to France. This article highlights the unique legal framework governing state-owned cultural assets and the financial implications of this lack of private coverage following the robbery.</p>

          <p>A new study by investment firm Schroders reveals that 90% of working Americans plan to ignore common financial advice by claiming Social Security benefits before age 70, despite understanding that waiting yields significantly higher monthly payments. Only 10% intend to wait until 70, while 44% expect to file before their full retirement age of 67. The article attributes this widespread disconnect to the harsh financial realities facing many workers, who need immediate income upon retiring, and growing concerns about the future solvency of Social Security. This highlights a critical gap between recommended financial planning and practical necessities for most Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

The article emphasizes that pairing these plant-based iron sources with vitamin C-rich foods is key to enhancing absorption, as non-heme iron is less readily absorbed than heme iron from meat.

          <p>A Colombian court has acquitted former President Alvaro Uribe of bribery in criminal proceedings, overturning his 12-year house arrest sentence for witness tampering and procedural fraud. The Bogota High Court stated the charges were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing "methodological errors, fallacies of interpretation and biased evaluation of evidence" in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, had been accused of bribing members of right-wing paramilitaries to lie about his alleged links to the groups during investigations. This article notes the ongoing appeal against the procedural fraud charge and the broader US-Colombia rift, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's support for Uribe.</p>

          <p>As personal bankruptcy inquiries rise due to mounting debt and high living costs, many borrowers consider Chapter 7 bankruptcy to discharge unsecured debts. However, eligibility for this option depends on an income "means test," which compares an applicant's average monthly income over six months to their state's median for their household size. If an individual's income is above the median, a more detailed calculation factoring in allowable expenses determines qualification.
