          <h2>China Tests High-Power Microwave Weapon with Vacuum Tech</h2>

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully tested a compact high-power microwave (HPM) system capable of firing over 10,000 times without failure, marking a significant advancement in directed-energy weapon technology. The technology uses vacuum-sealing to overcome durability and miniaturization barriers, potentially shifting the balance in the global race for next-generation warfare systems. The microwave gun, developed by the Northwest Institute of Nuclear Technology, is powered by a three-gigawatt pulsed current and is comparable in size to a Gatling gun, representing a notable reduction in weight compared to traditional HPM weapons.</p>

          <p>IBM has announced a $150 billion investment in the U.S. over the next five years, including more than $30 billion to advance American manufacturing of its mainframe and quantum computers. CEO Arvind Krishna stated the investment underscores IBM's commitment to American jobs and manufacturing, ensuring the company remains at the forefront of advanced computing and AI. The announcement comes after President Trump unveiled a "reciprocal" tariff policy aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing, although chips and other tech devices are currently exempt from these tariffs. IBM's investment aims to accelerate America's leadership in computing and stimulate the national economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has struck over 800 targets in Yemen as part of an ongoing air campaign against the Houthi militia, targeting command-and-control facilities, air defense systems, and weapons manufacturing and storage sites. Operation Rough Rider, initiated six weeks prior, has focused on destroying Houthi stockpiles of anti-ship missiles and drones used to attack ships in the Red Sea. Congressional officials estimate the campaign's cost to be over $1 billion, raising concerns about the rapid rate of munitions usage. The U.S. Central Command oversees these military operations in the Middle East, aiming to degrade Houthi capabilities and deter further attacks.</p>

          <p>A 14-year-old girl has been sentenced to 15 years in detention after being found guilty of attempted murder for stabbing two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Carmarthenshire, Wales. The teenager, who brought a weapon to school daily, attacked Fiona Elias, Liz Hopkin, and a 14-year-old pupil, causing serious injuries. During the sentencing, both Ms. Elias and Ms. Hopkin shared their victim impact statements, detailing the physical and emotional trauma they endured, with Ms. Hopkin stating that she believed she saved both the teenager and Ms. Elias that day. The judge noted the girl had not shown remorse and had attacked the three for attention.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is expanding its drone program, "Line of Drones," as a strategic response to uncertainties surrounding continued U.S. military support and potential cease-fire talks with Russia. The initiative emphasizes domestically assembled unmanned systems, particularly small exploding drones operated from shelters, to maintain combat effectiveness. This approach is crucial for Ukraine to sustain its defense capabilities should the cease-fire talks fail or U.S. arms shipments be discontinued. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day cease-fire in Ukraine next month as a potential goodwill gesture, adding further complexity to the ongoing conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is facing challenges as pay review bodies recommend higher pay rises for teachers and NHS staff than initially budgeted, potentially straining public finances. The recommended pay rises of about 4% for teachers and 3% for NHS staff exceed the government's planned 2.8%, leading to potential cuts and efficiency savings. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the government would review the proposals, while unions threaten strikes if pay rises lead to cuts or layoffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces tough decisions balancing pay increases with fiscal constraints, potentially requiring tax rises or spending cuts.</p>

He also suggested that European nations are likely in a panic over the strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar and may cut rates to weaken their currency.

While the report concluded that there is not a widespread "toxic" culture, it highlighted instances where powerful individuals abuse their power, making life difficult for colleagues. BBC Chairman Samir Shah emphasized that those who abuse power or behave badly have no place at the corporation and pledged to introduce reforms. The reforms include a more robust disciplinary policy, strengthened code of conduct, and improved mechanisms for staff to complain without fear of reprisals.</p>

The cicadas, known for their loud buzzing and large numbers, will primarily appear in Kentucky and Tennessee, with smaller populations in other East Coast states. These cicadas spend 17 years underground as larvae before emerging to mate and lay eggs, which will then hatch and burrow back into the soil. While cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, they can be a nuisance due to their noise and potential harm to young trees.</p>

          <p>Japan is considering simplifying safety and environmental screening processes for more imported cars to potentially gain concessions in tariff negotiations with the United States. The proposal involves enhancing Japan's Preferential Handling Procedure, which applies to imported vehicles sold in small quantities. This may be discussed alongside increasing U.S. farm imports during the next round of tariff negotiations. The U.S. has criticized limited access to Japan's automotive market, citing non-tariff barriers such as non-acceptance of certain U.S. standards. Japan does not impose tariffs on imported cars, trucks, or buses.</p>

          <p>The push to broaden access to private equity for retail investors raises concerns about their preparedness for the complexities and risks involved. Retail investors, often targeted to fill capacity, may receive less desirable opportunities compared to institutional players. The opaque nature of private equity and limited liquidity can leave retail investors vulnerable, particularly during market downturns. While FOMO can be a motivator, retail investors may underestimate higher fees, longer lock-up periods, and limited liquidity, making careful consideration essential before investing.
