          <p>Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, is suing the Department of Justice to be reinstated as a federal prosecutor. Her lawsuit alleges she was unlawfully terminated from her role, where she worked on cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, without explanation in July by the Trump administration. The suit claims her firing was politically motivated due to her father's identity or her perceived political beliefs, a pattern seen with other DOJ employees during Trump's second term. Comey has warned that such actions could instill fear and suppress independent thought within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals across various industries have been fired or disciplined for their public remarks about his death. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for comments that could harm the company's reputation or violate workplace policies, as First Amendment protections are limited in the private sector. The incidents, involving employees from a sports news site, MSNBC, and United Airlines, highlight the professional repercussions of expressing controversial opinions on politically charged events. The actions have sparked a wider debate about free speech and employment law in the U.S.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 14:09:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewables like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before considering government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, which shows fossil fuels and nuclear power are more expensive to generate due to ongoing fuel costs. However, the energy landscape is being shaped by conflicting government policies, with the previous administration's Inflation Reduction Act promoting clean energy and the current Trump administration favoring fossil fuels through new legislation and tariffs. Experts emphasize that while renewables are cost-competitive, a diverse mix of energy sources is crucial for a stable national power grid.</p>

          <p>With annuity sales rising, many retirees are using them for guaranteed income, but may need to access funds unexpectedly. This financial article outlines seven strategic ways to withdraw money from an annuity, a process that can be complex and restrictive. Options range from waiting for scheduled payouts to avoid penalties, making partial withdrawals, or taking a loan against the annuity's value. More drastic measures include surrendering the contract for its cash value or selling future payments to a third party, though these often come with steep fees and tax implications.

          <p>Representative Buddy Carter is introducing a resolution to remove Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar from her House committee assignments. The move comes in response to Omar's comments following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which Republicans have characterized as disparaging his legacy. In an interview, Omar criticized Kirk's past rhetoric while also expressing empathy for his family, later stating her words were taken out of context and that she condemns the violence. Carter argues that language justifying political violence is unacceptable and disqualifies a member from serving on committees.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave increased by up to 8% after the company revealed a major purchase agreement with Nvidia. The deal obligates Nvidia to buy at least $6.3 billion of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, heavily relies on the chipmaker's GPUs to provide AI services to its clients, including major tech companies like Google and Microsoft. This agreement further solidifies the strategic partnership between the two companies as demand for AI computing power continues to grow. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has revived a proposal to change the corporate financial reporting standard from every three months to every six months. He argues that a semiannual system would save companies money and encourage executives to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profit targets. The idea, which would require SEC approval, has been debated for years, with supporters citing reduced regulatory burdens and critics warning it would deprive investors of timely and crucial financial data. The push aligns with the administration's deregulatory goals, and analysts suggest there is a significant probability the SEC could enact the change. (not investment advice)</p>

A borrower recounts their personal experience of being moved from Nelnet to a new servicer, Central Research Inc. (CRI), and finding their loans unexpectedly placed in administrative forbearance. Experts advise that during such transfers, payments can get lost, and recommend borrowers set aside their payment amount until the new account is fully active. The transfers are part of the Department of Education's management of its massive student loan portfolio, but the process is causing significant disruption for individuals.</p>

Miran, currently chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has defended his qualifications and stated he would act independently, but the move is seen as part of a broader effort by the administration to exert influence over the nation's monetary policy.</p>

The piece criticizes the weaponization of Kirk's death to undermine free speech protections, citing instances where individuals have been fired for criticizing Kirk's rhetoric.

The Prime Minister defended the initial due diligence process but admitted the new information revealed a relationship "far different" from what was understood at the time of the appointment.

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is seeking class action status for its lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the Department of Education is unlawfully denying borrowers access to loan forgiveness. The suit claims that over a million borrowers are stuck in a backlog for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and tens of thousands are awaiting decisions on Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has stated that the Eurovision Song Contest "has never been about politics" while acknowledging concerns over Israel's participation in the upcoming competition. Several European broadcasters have threatened to boycott the 2025 event if Israel is included, citing the country's military actions in Gaza. Davie confirmed the BBC is working with the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the contest, as it consults with members to make a final decision.

          <p>Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, has strongly condemned Israel's recent deadly bombing in Doha as a "treacherous and cowardly" act of state terrorism. Speaking at an Arab-Islamic summit, he asserted that the attack, which targeted Hamas leaders, shows Israel is not interested in peace and is attempting to thwart ceasefire negotiations. The Emir accused Israel of waging a war of "extermination" in Gaza and warned against its expansionist ambitions in the region. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has pledged to activate joint defense mechanisms in response to the unprecedented attack on Qatari soil.</p>

Despite facing increased competition from AI startups and aggressive regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have gained more than 30% this year.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion, financial experts are highlighting common mistakes that make carrying a balance more expensive. Paying a bill late can trigger fees and penalty APRs, while allowing a balance to carry over from month to month leads to rapidly compounding interest. The article also points out that many consumers fail to utilize cost-saving strategies like 0% balance transfer offers or debt consolidation loans. Avoiding these missteps is crucial for managing debt effectively, especially as high interest rates and inflation continue to strain household budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

Savers are advised to lock in current high rates with CDs before they fall.

Machar's opposition party accuses Kiir's government of systematically obstructing the peace agreement by dismissing opposition officials without consultation.

However, policy experts in Brussels believe this demand is unlikely to change the EU's current course. While the EU has significantly reduced its reliance on Russian energy, Hungary and Slovakia remain holdouts, and Trump has not applied direct pressure on these friendly governments.
