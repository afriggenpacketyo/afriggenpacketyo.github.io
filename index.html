          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 10:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the third week of the Spring Canton Fair, interest in toys was low due to Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, reflecting the struggles of traditional Chinese manufacturers. Many toy exporters avoided showcasing the latest products developed with US clients, fearing plagiarism and anticipating low US participation. Bob Lu of Natty Boy Toys noted that the suspension of US orders has negatively affected R&D, increasing uncertainty. While Walmart shipments have recovered, other American retailers like Target are holding off on new orders, creating inventory and operational pressures for Chinese toy manufacturers. The article indicates a shift towards emerging markets with products tailored to South American tastes.</p>

          <p>Alex Matisse, the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse, initially avoided his famous last name when founding East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, in 2009. He wanted to make his own way, building a wood kiln with his wife and growing the business organically. Despite initial setbacks when he tried to mechanize and introduce new colors, his pottery gained a dedicated following known as "Potheads."

          <p>The Panama Canal, a vital passage for U.S. East Coast container traffic, faces a potential slump due to Trump's trade war with China and declining manufactured goods orders from U.S. shippers. The uncertainty surrounding the trade war and high tariffs on Chinese goods have led to a significant increase in canceled freight vessels from China to the United States. With a large percentage of the canal's cargo linked to the United States, any economic downturn in the U.S. could impact its revenue, adding to existing challenges from extreme weather conditions.</p>

          <p>Trump's tariffs have caused a slowdown at the bustling Los Angeles ports, impacting longshore workers and the broader Southern California economy. As a result of the Trump administrationâ€™s decision to subject imports to a minimum 10% tariff, roughly a third of the traffic at the port has ground to a halt. With many jobs in Southern California tied to the ports, the slowdown is expected to affect warehouse workers, truck drivers, and logistics teams. Experts warn that the port's struggles, handling a large portion of US imports, could signal broader economic challenges for the entire country.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project (LAIP) has announced new evidence in the Scott Peterson murder case, claiming it "eviscerates" the prosecution's theory and proves Peterson's innocence. The LAIP argues that suppressed and destroyed exculpatory evidence, along with new witness statements and research on fetal growth, support the theory that Laci Peterson was abducted and killed by someone else. Despite skepticism and controversy surrounding the re-examination of the case, the LAIP's investigation has raised questions about the fairness of Peterson's original trial and the thoroughness of the police investigation.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the concept of "soft eugenics" as it relates to policies enacted by Robert F Kennedy Jr. as the US Secretary of Health, and Elon Musk. Kennedy's emphasis on personal responsibility for health, coupled with cuts to social services and public health programs, is seen as a form of soft eugenics that disproportionately affects vulnerable populations. Similarly, Elon Musk's focus on promoting procreation among "smart" people while cutting foreign aid is viewed as another manifestation of this ideology, with devastating consequences for maternal and child health in low-income countries.</p>

These estimates are based on housing costs not exceeding 30% of gross income, assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 15% down payment and a 6.84% interest rate, factoring in insurance and property taxes.</p>

          <p>During the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century, gold seekers discovered rich copper deposits in Alaska's Copper River Valley. The U.S. Army started work on the Valdez Trail, which became the main route between the mining fields and Valdez. In 1902, the Miles Brothers, a team of photographers, documented the town, the growing trail, the landscape, and Alaska Natives. These photographs, recently digitized at the U.S. National Archives, provide a remarkable glimpse into daily life along the Alaskan interior nearly 125 years ago.</p>

          <p>Sarah Snook's one-actor take on "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Broadway explores the parallels between Oscar Wilde's novel and modern society's obsession with image and social media. Snook plays 26 roles, using elaborate camerawork and a smartphone to highlight the dangers of prioritizing aesthetics over substance. The production critiques the performance of identity and the allure of false perfection, drawing parallels to social media culture where individuals curate idealized versions of themselves. The use of technology and the multi-faceted portrayal of characters emphasizes the potential for self-deception and the erosion of genuine connection in a world consumed by appearances.</p>
