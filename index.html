          <p>A public falling-out between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk has raised concerns among Republicans about potential divisions within the party. Musk's criticisms of Trump's policies and his suggestion of a new political party have caused unease, particularly as the GOP aims to pass key legislation before the midterm elections. Some Republicans fear that Musk's influence and financial support, which were significant in the previous election, may now be withdrawn, potentially impacting the party's prospects. While some downplay the feud's impact, others acknowledge that the discord could create uncertainties and undermine party unity.</p>
