          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprise pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, narrowly outperforming Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Russell's final qualifying lap was just 0.007 seconds faster, securing his first pole since the Canadian Grand Prix. The result places him in a strong starting position ahead of championship contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris of McLaren, who qualified third and fifth, respectively. Verstappen expressed frustration after his final lap was impeded by Norris, suggesting the incident may have cost him the top spot.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated strong performance, with the S&P 500 reaching new record highs despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The market's positive reaction suggests investors have largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event for the economy. The healthcare, utilities, and information technology sectors led the week's gains, partly driven by a deal exempting Pfizer from certain tariffs and continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The article also details specific stock movements within the CNBC Investing Club portfolio, including purchases of Nike and Boeing shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa's national rugby team, the Springboks, defeated Argentina 29-27 to win their second consecutive Rugby Championship title. The victory was secured at London's Allianz Stadium after New Zealand's earlier win over Australia set the stage for a title-deciding match. Despite an early lead from Argentina, the Springboks' dominant forward play in the second half, featuring tries from Malcolm Marx and Cobus Reinach, proved decisive. This victory highlights the team's strength and depth as they build towards the 2027 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Olive loaf, a processed deli meat popular from the 1940s to the 1970s, has largely vanished from American delicatessens and lunchboxes. Initially valued for its affordability and visual appeal, its decline began in the 1970s due to growing health concerns about sodium, preservatives, and processed meats. Shifting consumer preferences towards fresher, more natural foods, along with the rise of convenient microwaveable meals, further diminished its popularity. While some retain a nostalgic fondness for the meat, experts believe a significant comeback is unlikely without a modern rebranding focused on health-conscious ingredients.</p>

          <p>The increasing adoption of digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, presents significant regulatory challenges and risks of financial instability. While proponents highlight benefits like lower transaction costs and faster payments, critics warn of potential for financial crashes and increased user surveillance. The article contrasts different regulatory approaches, from the U.S. model that favors private innovation and limits Federal Reserve involvement, to Europe's more state-controlled system. The U.K. is attempting to find a middle ground, but concerns remain about systemic risks posed by a largely privatized digital money ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts argue that American investors are overly concentrated in domestic assets, a phenomenon known as "home bias." They suggest that diversifying into international markets, particularly emerging economies, could offer better long-term value and growth opportunities. China is highlighted as a market with significant long-term potential, while India is noted for its large population, strong demographics, and rapid economic growth, which is driving consumption. This trend mirrors the growth trajectory China experienced over the past two decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump suggests that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair could play a leading role in the governance of Gaza following a potential ceasefire. The plan envisions a technocratic government overseen by a "Board of Peace," chaired by Trump, with Blair in a significant position. This proposal has drawn criticism due to Blair's controversial legacy in the Middle East, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his previous tenure as a Middle East envoy. Critics, including Palestinian leaders, have expressed concerns about potential colonial overtones and questioned his suitability for the role.</p>

Jon Godfread, North Dakota's insurance commissioner, warns that the window is closing to prevent a massive spike in premiums for millions of Americans ahead of the November 1 open enrollment deadline. If the subsidies expire, the average consumer could see their premiums more than double, potentially pricing them out of the market and destabilizing the insurance risk pool.

          <p>Dawon Matthews, who struggled to find employment after a felony conviction, has built a successful business empire, most notably a Houston food truck that generates over $1 million in annual revenue.

His latest venture, Goodies Soul Kitchen, capitalized on Houston's late-night food scene and has been profitable since its launch.

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly fired Navy Chief of Staff Jon Harrison, who was a key figure in the Trump administration's efforts to restructure the Pentagon. Harrison, appointed in January, had been instrumental in policy and budget changes within the Navy. His dismissal follows the recent confirmation of Hung Cao as Navy Under Secretary and reports that Harrison had sought to limit the influence of that office. This firing is the latest in a series of leadership upheavals at the Pentagon under Hegseth, who has overseen the removal of numerous top generals and admirals.</p>

          <p>The FBI is reportedly considering a high-profile arrest and "perp walk" for its former director, James Comey, who was recently indicted for lying to Congress. According to sources, an FBI agent was suspended for insubordination after refusing to participate in the plan, which was described as unusual for a white-collar defendant. The indictment comes after public pressure from President Trump on Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate Comey. The potential for a showy arrest highlights the deep-seated political tensions surrounding Comey, whose lawyers had already agreed to bring him to his scheduled court appearance.</p>

          <p>China has revealed an incident from last year where a domestically produced J-16 fighter jet successfully intercepted and expelled two foreign stealth fighter jets near its coastal waters. According to the pilot, the foreign aircraft were on a provocative course, leading to a tense aerial encounter. The Chinese pilot performed advanced maneuvers, including a barrel roll over one of the jets, before achieving a radar lock on both intruders, which prompted them to leave the area. The report did not specify the nationality of the foreign aircraft but noted that jets of that type have not been seen in the region since.</p>

This legislative maneuver is opposed by Speaker Johnson and former President Trump. A spokesperson for Johnson indicated she will be sworn in when the House returns to session, which is currently delayed by the government funding dispute.</p>

          <p>In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, prosecutors in 16 states have charged 412 people with 'pregnancy-related crimes,' according to research by the advocacy group Pregnancy Justice. Most cases involve allegations of substance use during pregnancy and disproportionately affect low-income women. Critics argue these prosecutions reflect a growing acceptance of 'fetal personhood,' which grants legal rights to fetuses and leads to the increased surveillance and criminalization of pregnant individuals. This trend raises concerns that the U.S. is moving toward a model similar to El Salvador, where pregnancy is aggressively policed.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has emerged as a powerful dissenting voice, using her opinions to warn about what she views as threats to the rule of law in the United States. In a notable dissent for a case limiting judicial power over the executive branch, she cited a book on the legal structure of Nazi Germany, drawing a parallel to the current erosion of checks and balances. As the court's conservative supermajority reshapes long-standing legal precedents, Jackson's writings are seen as a direct address to the American public and lower courts about the dangers of unchecked executive power and a politically polarized judiciary.</p>

The expert suggests writing on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to provide a full picture of family life.

Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early.
