            <p>Actress Aimee Lou Wood, known for her role in 'The White Lotus,' has publicly criticized a recent 'Saturday Night Live' sketch that parodied her character, Chelsea, arguing that it was 'mean and unfunny'. Wood specifically took issue with the sketch's reliance on exaggerated prosthetic teeth and a pronounced accent, which she felt 'punched down' on her and perpetuated misogynistic tropes. She acknowledged that SNL is about caricature but believed the joke was cheap and lacked nuance. Wood also mentioned that she received apologies from SNL and thousands of messages agreeing with her after sharing her criticism online, highlighting the discomfort many felt with the portrayal.</p>

            <p>Following a deadly helicopter crash on the Hudson River that killed a family of five tourists from Spain and the pilot, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced the immediate shutdown of New York Helicopter Tours. The FAA is launching a review of the tour operator's license and safety record while supporting the NTSB's investigation. Senator Chuck Schumer had previously called for the company to suspend flights during the investigation, citing concerns about safety and potential corner-cutting by helicopter tour companies. The crash has renewed safety concerns regarding sightseeing helicopter excursions in New York City, prompting calls for stricter regulations and potential bans on non-essential flights over the city.</p>

            <p>Mario Vargas Llosa, a Nobel Prize-winning Peruvian author and a central figure in the Latin American Boom literary movement, has died at the age of 89. Known for his prolific output of over 50 works, Vargas Llosa's writing often explored themes of authoritarianism, violence, and machismo, reflecting the political and social turmoil of Latin America in the 20th century. Initially aligned with left-wing ideologies, he later became a proponent of center-right politics and even ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990. His literary legacy includes impactful novels such as 'The Time of the Hero' and 'Conversations in the Cathedral,' which critiqued corruption and abuse of power.</p>

            <p>Kyiv's Western allies have strongly condemned a Russian missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Sumy, which resulted in the deaths of 34 people, including two children, and injuries to 117 others.

International leaders, including US President Donald Trump and Germany's chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz, have expressed outrage, with Merz calling the attack a war crime. The incident occurred as the US pursues negotiations to end the war, now in its fourth year, and Ukraine urges Trump to witness the devastation firsthand.</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant jump of 12.4% in March, exceeding expectations, as businesses accelerated shipments to avoid impending US tariffs. However, imports declined by 4.3%, indicating sluggish domestic demand. This trade dynamic occurs amidst escalating trade tensions between the US and China, with both countries imposing tit-for-tat tariffs. Experts anticipate that exports may weaken in the coming months due to the increased US tariffs, potentially leading to supply chain disruptions and inflation in the US. The Chinese government has reiterated its call for negotiations with Washington while vowing to implement countermeasures against the US. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Center-right President Daniel Noboa has secured re-election in Ecuador, winning the run-off round and earning a full four-year term after initially assuming power in a snap election in November 2023. Noboa has defined his presidency through a tough military crackdown on violent criminal gangs, a strategy he is expected to continue. His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, has disputed the results and alleged fraud, though without providing evidence. Noboa's victory grants him a mandate to pursue his 'war' on drug gangs, including militarizing streets and prisons, and he aims to allow foreign military bases in the country to aid in this effort.</p>

The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) will present evidence to the court to potentially overturn the initial findings.

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policies have created further confusion as a cabinet official suggested new levies on semiconductors shortly after the administration exempted computers and smartphones from reciprocal tariffs. Trump himself intervened, stating that any relief would be short-lived and that new tariffs would be announced soon. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio expressed concerns that the US could face 'worse than a recession' due to Trump's trade policies. The situation highlights the ongoing volatility and uncertainty surrounding the US trade strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy expressed relief at overcoming a 'burden' of over a decade after securing a dramatic victory at the Masters, completing the career Grand Slam. McIlroy's win came after defeating Justin Rose in a sudden-death playoff, marking his first major victory since 2014. He described the pressure of trying to complete the Grand Slam and witnessing his peers win Green Jackets as challenging. The victory was secured after an extraordinary day at Augusta, during which McIlroy had to overcome a missed putt on the final regulation hole and a resilient performance from Rose.</p>

            <p>A new CBS News poll reveals that Americans are divided on President Trump's trade and tariff policies, with most believing that tariffs will lead to higher prices. While many are concerned about the short-term financial impact, Republicans are more likely to believe in the long-term benefits, particularly in terms of job creation. The poll indicates that Trump's ratings for handling inflation and the economy have become more negative. The public largely views the current economic situation as Trump's responsibility, with a majority attributing the state of the economy to his policies rather than those of Joe Biden.

            <p>Amid stock market volatility and concerns about Treasury bond yields, investors are seeking strategies to secure income and manage risk. A bond ladder strategy, involving investing in a range of Treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, is gaining attention as a way to provide regular income. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers this approach in an ETF format, investing in Treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, providing a fixed monthly income through 2035. Experts suggest this strategy can offer exposure to Treasury bonds without worrying about short-term price swings. (not investment advice)</p>
