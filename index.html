          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 storm, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts its center to pass east of Bermuda, while dangerous swells are expected to impact the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward to Atlantic Canada, creating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Despite initial predictions from NOAA for an unusually active season, overall hurricane activity has remained quieter than anticipated, with only one of the six preceding named storms making landfall in the U.S. Officials are urging residents in the affected regions, including the Azores, to closely monitor the storm's trajectory and prepare for potential hazards.

          <p>Brazil's chief prosecutor has charged Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of former President Jair Bolsonaro and a sitting congressman, with coercion. The Attorney General's office alleges he repeatedly prioritized personal and family agendas over national interests, including threatening sanctions from foreign governments. Eduardo, who claims to be living in "exile" in the US, dismisses these charges as "bogus" and part of "ongoing political persecution," coming weeks after his father's 27-year conviction for plotting a coup. This article underscores the persistent political and legal challenges facing the Bolsonaro family, while President Lula da Silva pledges to veto any amnesty bill for those involved in the coup attempt.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen Airport has reopened after a four-hour suspension prompted by sightings of two to three large, unidentified drones in its airspace. Danish police confirmed they could not determine the drones' origin or current whereabouts, stating an investigation with unspecified measures is underway. The incident caused substantial disruption, leading to the diversion of at least 35 flights and widespread delays and cancellations. While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky referenced "Russia's violation" of NATO airspace in Copenhagen, EU and NATO leaders have yet to make a public attribution.

          <p>President Donald Trump, flanked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced new recommendations for pregnant women to avoid Tylenol, citing a disputed link between the pain reliever and autism. Trump asserted that acetaminophen "is no good" and should only be used in cases of extreme fever, despite inconsistent and inconclusive scientific findings. Tylenol maker Kenvue strongly disagreed, affirming that sound science shows no causal link to autism and that acetaminophen remains the safest pain relief option for expectant mothers. Leading medical professional groups, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have also pushed back, highlighting the lack of robust evidence and the potential health risks of untreated maternal pain and fever.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk, which critics have characterized as a rallying cry for the Trump administration's "state-sponsored war" against perceived political adversaries. The speech, seen as a concentrated expression of Trumpism, portrayed opponents as embodying "wickedness" destined for destruction, a stark contrast to calls for national unity. The article highlights Miller's perceived hypocrisy in condemning incitement while employing highly inflammatory language, effectively depicting a significant portion of the country as irredeemably evil. This rhetoric is viewed as exacerbating societal divisions, standing in sharp contrast to more unifying responses to tragedy, such as Barack Obama's eulogy for Clementa Pinckney.</p>

The article explains that China views continued reliance on US chips, even in a diluted form, as accepting technological subservience, and would rather prioritize pushing for complete tech independence.

Flanked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz, Trump explicitly stated his remarks were based on his personal "feelings" and "common sense," rather than scientific consensus. This article highlights the profound dismay of autism researchers and advocates, who emphasize the minimal evidence for a causal link between acetaminophen and autism, and warn of the dangers of untreated fevers during pregnancy. The FDA's official communication was notably milder than the president's strong assertions.</p>

          <p>India is investing $18 billion through its "Semiconductor Mission" with the ambitious goal of establishing a full domestic chip supply chain, encompassing design, fabrication, testing, and packaging. This article explains that the initiative aims to reduce import dependence, secure chips for strategic sectors, and capture a larger share of the global electronics market, a move partly driven by US restrictions on advanced AI chip exports to China. While India boasts a significant pool of engineering talent, experts caution that success requires more than just financial incentives. They emphasize the need for a dynamic and long-term ecosystem, including robust tax, trade, and intellectual property policies, to effectively compete with established chip-making nations.

The petition, filed on behalf of US citizens and millions of Latino immigrants, accuses federal agents of "kidnapping arrests, prolonged detentions without due process," and brutal excessive force, citing the case of a pregnant woman who was shackled and detained. This article highlights that petitioners argue domestic efforts to stop these "roundups" have failed due to Supreme Court rulings.

The order directs federal agencies to "investigate, disrupt, and dismantle" Antifa's operations, claiming it uses illegal means and violence to overthrow the government. Critics warn this action, coming after Charlie Kirk's death, risks infringing on constitutional rights to free speech and assembly, especially since Antifa is a decentralized, ideological movement without a formal membership or command structure.

The UK government is committed to driving up standards through a major overhaul and renationalization of rail services, with some positive signs of overall cancellations starting to fall. However, the cancellation rate for the past year remains slightly higher than the previous one, indicating ongoing challenges for service reliability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unproven claims linking Tylenol (acetaminophen) to autism have sparked significant concern among medical experts, who emphasize that such assertions lack scientific support and can endanger women's health. This article connects Trump's stance to a broader administration campaign promoting "natural" pregnancy and motherhood, which has also questioned Covid vaccines and antidepressants, often defying widespread medical consensus. Critics argue this "anti-science agenda" risks corroding women's health and safety by discouraging proven medical interventions, potentially leading to more pain and fewer options for pregnant individuals. This article provides critical context, highlighting how this rhetoric contributes to a shaming culture around maternal health decisions.</p>

This article explains Davey's initiative, framed as a direct response to what he calls the US government's "anti-science agenda," aims to position the UK as a global leader in the fight against cancer. The proposal follows significant cuts to biomedical research grants in the US and a poll indicating that 75% of scientists are considering leaving the country.

This article explores how social media has intensified these tensions, turning ordinary online posts into causes célèbres and highlighting a lack of consensus on how to police online speech. It contrasts the UK's "qualified right" to free speech with the US First Amendment, noting that despite international criticism, some argue there's more leeway in the UK than suggested. The article concludes that this issue is deeply politicized, with public opinion often prioritizing safety over free expression online.</p>
