          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has voiced concern over the latest U.S. jobs report, particularly its significant downward revisions for May and June. She stated that such large revisions are often characteristic of economic "turning points" and could signal a slowdown in economic activity later in the year. Cook also highlighted an "uncertainty tax" on businesses, where executives spend valuable time preparing for macroeconomic instability, such as potential tariffs, which she described as a deadweight loss to the economy.

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing the country's continued importation of oil from Russia. This new levy brings the total tariff rate on Indian products to 50% and is scheduled to take effect in 21 days. The move is part of a broader strategy to pressure countries doing business with Russia to encourage a peace settlement in Ukraine. The U.S. trade deficit with India was $45.8 billion last year, and this action escalates trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>An active-duty sergeant opened fire at Fort Stewart, Georgia, wounding five fellow soldiers before being subdued by his colleagues. The suspect, identified as 28-year-old Quornelius Radford, used a personal weapon in the attack. All five victims are in stable condition and expected to recover, with officials praising the soldiers who tackled the gunman for preventing further casualties. The motive remains under investigation, but authorities have stated there is no indication of a link to terrorism or extremism.</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended his firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner by alleging the agency "rigged" jobs data before the 2024 election to harm him politically. However, this article's analysis of the timeline shows his claims are incorrect. A major downward revision of 818,000 jobs occurred in August 2024, months before the election, not after, as Trump claimed. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used at the time to criticize his opponent.</p>

Prosecutors allege that 31-year-old Elias Rodriguez traveled from Chicago and targeted Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum in May. During his arrest, he reportedly shouted "Free Palestine," and investigators found writings expressing support for violence against Israelis. The Justice Department has filed findings that could allow for the death penalty to be pursued in the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could deliver a significant blow to India's economy, with an estimated $8 billion in exports being most vulnerable. Sectors such as gems and jewelry, apparel, textiles, and chemicals are disproportionately exposed to the new duties. While the overall impact on India's GDP is estimated at 2%, certain industries will feel a more direct effect. However, key sectors like IT services and pharmaceuticals, which are major exports to the U.S., are not targeted by the current goods tariffs and are expected to be shielded.

          <p>New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye praised head coach Mike Vrabel's hands-on approach after Vrabel jumped into a practice pile to break up a scuffle and emerged with a bloodied face.

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose a tariff of approximately 100% on imported computer chips and semiconductors. He stated that companies building manufacturing facilities in the United States would be exempt from this import tax. The move represents a significant shift in strategy to onshore critical technology production, favoring punitive tariffs over the subsidy-based approach of the 2022 CHIPS Act. This policy could dramatically increase the cost of numerous consumer goods, including electronics, cars, and appliances, if enacted.</p>

          <p>This opinion column from the Los Angeles Times posits that President Trump consistently projects his own actions onto his political enemies, particularly regarding the concept of "rigging." The author argues that while Trump claims elections are rigged against him, he is actively trying to rig future elections through mid-decade gerrymandering in states like Texas. The piece further contends that this pattern extends to governance, citing the firing of the BLS commissioner and attempts to impose tariffs as examples of Trump manipulating systems to his benefit.</p>

          <p>This article provides a guide for savers on the potential earnings from a high-yield savings account, using a $20,000 deposit as an example. It explains that while these accounts currently offer high rates, often above 4%, their variable nature makes precise long-term calculation impossible. Assuming a constant rate of 4.35%, a $20,000 deposit could earn approximately $214 in three months and nearly $900 in one year. The article advises that savers who want to capitalize on the current high-rate environment should consider opening an account soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County may be far higher than official figures. Researchers estimate there were 440 more deaths than expected during the period of the fires, likely due to factors like poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services. This number is more than 14 times the official coroner's count of 31 deaths. The study highlights the challenge of quantifying the full public health impact of climate-driven disasters.</p>
