          <p>A judge in Wisconsin, Hannah Dugan, was arrested for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, evade ICE agents after a court hearing. The FBI alleged that Dugan allowed Flores-Ruiz, facing misdemeanor battery counts, to escape from her courtroom. This incident raises questions about the separation of powers and the role of judges in immigration enforcement. Flores-Ruiz was later apprehended by immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>With student loan collections resuming, the U.S. government has the power to garnish wages, tax refunds, and Social Security benefits from borrowers in default. Experts warn that up to 15% of Social Security benefits could be seized, potentially leaving retirees with insufficient funds for basic necessities.
