          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her first major speech since leaving office, addressing Democratic concerns about the current political climate under President Trump. Speaking in San Francisco, Harris warned of a potential constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to check executive power. She praised Democratic leaders who have been vocal in their opposition to Trump's agenda, including Senators Sanders and Booker, and Representative Ocasio-Cortez. Harris emphasized the need for Americans to organize and stand up for their fundamental rights, noting that courage is contagious, and she is expected to decide by the end of the summer whether she will run for California governor in 2026.</p>

While American ideals and images still resonate, the withdrawal of U.S. aid and diplomatic efforts has created a vacuum that China is eager to fill, leading to complex feelings of both hope and concern among Asian nations.</p>

The armed forces, with a smaller naval fleet and aging aircraft, are equipped only for short, high-intensity conflicts. Modern wars, like the conflict in Ukraine, require both advanced systems and a large volume of staple munitions, which the U.S. struggles to produce in sufficient quantities.

          <h2>Bank of Japan Downgrades Economic Outlook Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has reduced its economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year from 1.1% to 0.5%, citing concerns about the impact of U.S. tariffs. The central bank also anticipates a decline in domestic corporate profits due to a slowdown in overseas economies. These revisions complicate the BOJ's efforts to normalize monetary policy, as the tariff disruption exacerbates pressures on an already fragile economy. Despite these challenges, the BOJ has decided to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.5 percent.</p>

          <p>The estranged husband of Erin Patterson, accused of serving a poisonous mushroom lunch to her family, testified that it was "very rare" for her to host social gatherings at home. Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal meal but declined, is the first witness in the trial where Ms. Patterson is charged with murder and attempted murder. The prosecution alleges Ms. Patterson invited the group to lunch under the pretense of having been diagnosed with cancer, but Ms. Patterson has pleaded not guilty, claiming she "panicked" after unintentionally serving poison to family members she loved.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that there is "a very good chance" of reaching a trade deal with China, despite his own trade envoy, Jamieson Greer, acknowledging that no tariff discussions are currently taking place between Washington and Beijing.

          <p>A survey by the Asian American Foundation reveals that one in four non-Asian Americans view Chinese-Americans as a potential threat, particularly concerning national security. Additionally, four in ten fear that Asian-Americans have greater allegiance to their countries of origin than to the United States. These findings highlight growing concerns about the ability of Asian-Americans to assimilate amid rising social tensions and plummeting U.S.-China relations. The survey underscores a troubling disconnect between how Asian-Americans are perceived and how they experience life, impacting their safety and sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>India's improving relations with China may face complications due to a forthcoming trade deal with the United States and escalating tensions with Pakistan, according to analysts. While China views India as an important player in its efforts to engage with Global South economies, these looming issues could hinder the recovery in ties between New Delhi and Beijing. The potential trade deal with the U.S., initiated in response to Trump's tariffs on Indian imports, could create a new layer of complexity in the relationship.</p>

          <p>A California Assembly committee scaled back a controversial provision in a bill aimed at ending solar credits for rooftop solar system owners. The amended bill, AB 942, now applies only to those who sell their homes, removing a provision that would have limited the program's benefits to 10 years. The bill has faced significant opposition from rooftop solar owners, schools, and environmental groups, who argue it undermines investments in green energy. Supporters of the bill, including utilities and electrical worker unions, claim it promotes fairness and equity by addressing the costs shifted to non-solar panel owners.</p>
