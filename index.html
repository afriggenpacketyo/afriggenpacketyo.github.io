          <p>A research team in China has achieved a significant milestone in regenerative medicine by cultivating a human heart structure within a pig embryo. The structure, developed from reprogrammed human stem cells, reportedly beat independently for 21 days. This breakthrough, announced at a stem cell research conference, builds on the team's previous success in growing human kidneys in pigs, advancing the potential for creating human organs for transplantation. The process involved genetically modifying human stem cells to enhance their survival before implanting them into pig embryos.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi has issued a warning from Tehran that the Iranian government is intensifying its repression of citizens, particularly activists. In a video message, she stated that the regime is using the recent conflict with Israel as a pretext to increase executions and arrests, aiming to instill fear and deflect from internal failures. Mohammadi, who is currently defying an order to return to prison, described the dire conditions for political prisoners, especially after an Israeli strike on Evin Prison. She calls for renewed international attention on Iran's human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. Led by prominent figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Jamie Raskin, the lawmakers argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or fundamentally alter the department. The move comes after the administration slashed the agency's staff and paused over $6 billion in education funding. The brief asserts that only Congress can create or dismantle federal agencies through legislation.</p>

          <p>A jury in Clackamas County, Oregon, has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of first-degree sexual assault and other related charges. The conviction stems from an incident in October 2021, when McLemore was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. Prosecutors argued that McLemore sexually assaulted a woman who had passed out after heavy drinking, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The Clackamas County District Attorney stated the verdict shows that celebrity status does not shield individuals from prosecution in the county.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have issued warnings for eight local beaches, advising against swimming, surfing, or any water activities due to high levels of bacteria. The advisory, released just before the Fourth of July weekend, is a result of tests showing that recent street runoff contaminated the ocean water. Officials state that contact with the contaminated water can cause illness or skin infections, with children and the elderly being at higher risk. Affected areas include parts of Santa Monica Beach, Avalon Beach on Catalina Island, and Mothers Beach in Marina Del Rey.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Department of the Interior to develop a strategy for increasing entrance fees for non-U.S. residents at national parks. The order aims to generate additional revenue for park improvements while keeping prices lower for American citizens, aligning with an "America first" approach. The Interior Department estimates this surcharge could raise over $90 million annually. The order also mandates preferential treatment for U.S. residents in park access systems, such as lotteries or permits, and revokes a previous Obama-era memorandum promoting diversity and inclusion in parks.</p>

Recycling and green waste collections have been suspended, and there is currently no resolution in sight.

Critics argue that using the military for domestic law enforcement, which is largely prohibited by the Posse Comitatus Act, is inappropriate and places service members in situations they are not trained for. The deployment, which includes National Guard and Marines protecting federal property amid immigration protests, is seen as a dangerous precedent.

According to the Deportation Data Project, nearly half of the approximately 56,000 people currently in ICE detention have no criminal record. This trend contradicts the administration's stated focus on deporting violent criminals and reflects a broader push to increase arrests of anyone in the country without legal status. The article highlights the case of a Guatemalan pastor with no criminal record who was recently deported after living in the U.S. for 30 years.</p>

          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has found that the Home Office has no effective way of knowing whether foreign workers are leaving the country after their visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee reported that since the skilled worker visa route was introduced in 2020, the department has failed to analyze exit check data. The report criticizes the Home Office for showing "little curiosity" about the system's operation and being "slow and ineffective" in tackling the exploitation of workers. Over 1.18 million people have applied for this visa since its launch.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to be sidelined for approximately six weeks after being placed on the injured list with a bone bruise in his left knee. The injury occurred during Wednesday's game when an opposing player's helmet collided with his knee during a slide into third base. While an MRI revealed no structural damage, which Muncy called the "best-case scenario," his absence creates a significant gap in the Dodgers' lineup. Muncy had been a key offensive player, leading the team in average and RBIs in the month of June.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature tax and spending bill is set to fundamentally alter the U.S. social safety net by cutting funds and adding work requirements to major programs. The legislation makes significant changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Nonpartisan estimates predict these changes could cause millions to lose health and food benefits, with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities forecasting one in five SNAP recipients could be affected. While the bill provides tax cuts, experts warn its largest effects will be felt by low-income Americans and could have ripple effects on local economies and healthcare providers.

          <p>An analysis of the U.S. economy shows the mixed and evolving impact of the tariffs enacted by the Trump administration since January. While the stock market initially dropped, it has since rebounded, though shares of tariff-vulnerable companies remain weak. Trade volumes surged before dropping, but overall imports are still up year-over-year, with future trends depending on whether the administration extends its current tariff pause. Economists widely expect that consumers will eventually bear the cost of the tariffs, and recent data shows signs of slowing consumer spending, though the job market remains a key factor in staving off a potential recession.

          <p>One year after taking power, the Labour government's performance is receiving mixed reviews across key policy areas, according to an assessment by BBC correspondents. While net migration has fallen, this is largely due to policies from the previous government, and small boat crossings have increased. On the economy, growth has been minimal, and some policies may be weighing on businesses. In foreign affairs, the government has managed relationships with the U.S. and EU but faces criticism for being too cautious. Significant challenges remain in health, with long hospital waiting lists, and in education, where teacher recruitment targets have not been met.</p>
