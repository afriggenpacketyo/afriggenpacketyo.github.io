          <p>Following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, India's Prime Minister Modi has engaged with numerous world leaders and briefed diplomats, signaling a potential move towards military action against Pakistan, which India accuses of involvement. Despite denying involvement, Pakistani officials have been described by Indian officials as providing past support for terrorist groups targeting India. While India has not officially identified any group responsible for the attack, technical intelligence, including facial recognition data, is purportedly linking the perpetrators to Pakistan, raising tensions and sparking international concern over regional stability.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights concerns over Turkey's slide towards autocracy under President Erdogan, particularly the recent detention of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a likely presidential opponent, along with numerous associates on questionable charges. The article criticizes the weak international response, including silence from many European leaders and praise from President Trump, urging democracies to support the Turkish people and pressure Erdogan to reverse his actions. The author contends that the situation mirrors Russia's path towards autocracy, and warns of the deliberate dismantling of Turkey's institutional foundations.</p>
