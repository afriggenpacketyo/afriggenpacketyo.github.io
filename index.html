          <h2>Russia Launches Drone Attacks on Ukraine After Announcing Cease-Fire</h2>

          <p>Despite announcing a unilateral three-day cease-fire, Russian forces launched 100 attack drones across Ukraine overnight, resulting in casualties including a child. Ukrainian President Zelensky dismissed the cease-fire announcement as a manipulative tactic amid ongoing negotiations, emphasizing the need for an immediate, full, and unconditional cease-fire lasting at least 30 days. A Kremlin spokesman rejected a longer cease-fire without further details, while Ukraine's Air Force reported shooting down 37 of the drones. The attacks followed President Trump's expression of doubt regarding Putin's sincerity about seeking peace.</p>

          <p>Electricity was restored to almost all of Spain and Portugal nearly 18 hours after a blackout disrupted daily life, leaving tens of millions without power. The cause of the outage is still unknown, though officials have ruled out foul play such as a cyberattack. A high-voltage connection line between France and Spain was interrupted shortly before the outage, but experts suggest that more factors were likely involved, such as a sudden outage at a power plant. While life is returning to normal, concerns remain about the vulnerability of European grids to climate change and other threats.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs and annexation threats have sparked a surge of anti-American nationalism in Canada, leading to an unexpected victory for the Liberal Party in the recent election. Mark Carney, the Liberal leader, campaigned on distancing Canada from the U.S. due to Trump's policies, capitalizing on widespread Canadian frustration. Trump's actions inadvertently undermined Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, who shares similarities with Trump's MAGA approach, as Canadians mobilized against perceived threats to their sovereignty. This shift demonstrates how Trump's policies are damaging America's relationships with key allies and reshaping global political dynamics.</p>

Increased support for the Liberals and Conservatives came at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the New Democratic Party.

The company cited the global trade dispute as a factor preventing it from raising its full-year outlook, despite a significant increase in first-quarter profits. While Adidas has minimized exports of China-made products to the U.S., the general increase in U.S. tariffs on other countries, where its products are manufactured, poses a significant challenge. The company is unable to produce almost any of its products in the U.S. currently.</p>

          <p>European leaders are grappling with increasing geopolitical and trade turmoil following the first 100 days of President Trump's second term. The EU faces uncertainty on trade and Russia's war on Ukraine due to Trump's policies, with the EU preparing countermeasures to tariffs. Despite a temporary reduction in duties, the EU anticipates fallout from ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and other partners, like China. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas described the period as "very intense" and "disruptive," marked by unpredictability.</p>

The Conservatives made gains but fell short due to the progressive vote coalescing around the Liberals, highlighting divisions within Canada. Carney plans to initiate negotiations for a new economic and security relationship with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to circumvent the immigration court system in an effort to expedite deportations, raising concerns about due process rights. Changes include removing deportation protections, canceling legal representation grants, and relocating individuals to remote locations, including prisons outside U.S. jurisdiction. Experts warn these actions weaken due process for immigrants, potentially impacting lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens. The administration's approach is defended as necessary to remove criminals, but critics argue it undermines constitutional protections and could lead to erroneous removals.</p>
