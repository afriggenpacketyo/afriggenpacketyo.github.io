        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPRs) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, defying expectations for a cut despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate reduction. This decision aligns with economists' forecasts, who anticipated a hold on major stimulus measures amidst a recent stock market rally. The article notes that this stability comes even as economic data from August, including slowed retail sales and industrial output growth, indicates signs of fatigue in the Chinese economy. The PBOC's cautious approach aims to balance economic support with market stability.</p>

The preserve confirmed the "accident," emphasizing Easley's deep love and respect for the animals despite the inherent risks. This incident serves as a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of wild animals, even in controlled environments.

          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) is being adapted for crucial roles in intelligent warfare, with a new variant, possibly the naval GJ-21, featuring folding hinges for potential deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This advanced drone, numbered 21 on its fuselage, suggests it could be the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone. Recent images resembling the drone's wing profile appeared on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, informally known as a "drone carrier," equipped with an electromagnetic catapult.

          <p>Australia's Reserve Bank Governor, Michele Bullock, stated that the central bank remains vigilant regarding potential shifts in the economic outlook, though recent data largely aligns with expectations. The article highlights that while recent rate cuts are intended to boost household and business spending, the global economic environment introduces considerable uncertainty. The RBA has pursued a gradual approach to policy easing, having cut rates three times this year, and future adjustments will depend on incoming data. Investors are currently paring back expectations for further immediate rate cuts following stronger-than-expected economic growth and a spike in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On Nantucket, scientists are pioneering a novel approach to reduce Lyme disease transmission by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice to be immune to the bacteria. This article explains that since mice are the primary hosts for Lyme, making them immune would prevent ticks from becoming infected and breaking the disease cycle. Researchers at MIT's Sculpting Evolution lab, led by Kevin Esvelt, are using CRISPR technology to introduce an antibody gene into mouse embryos, which is then passed on to offspring. The project, "Mice Against Ticks," seeks community buy-in before potential field trials, addressing ecological concerns.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has launched with an inaugural class of 92 students, promoting ideological openness, robust debate, and, for now, free tuition. The article highlights UATX's mission to disrupt traditional higher education, which founders like Niall Ferguson argue has become stifled by political imbalance and self-censorship. UATX emphasizes Western civilization, small seminar-style classes, and the Chatham House Rule to encourage candid discussion. While critics label it an "anti-woke" university, UATX asserts its focus is on intellectual diversity and the "fearless pursuit of truth," aiming to revitalize academic discourse in America.</p>

          <p>Former UK Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg has publicly criticized Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, describing the "endless knee-bending" as "slightly cringey." Speaking at a Liberal Democrat conference event, Clegg urged Starmer to uphold British values rather than solely courting the unpredictable U.S. president. The article notes Clegg's argument that the government's pursuit of a trade deal with Trump stems from a "miscalculation" about balancing U.S. and EU relations. Clegg also condemned Elon Musk's recent comments at a UK rally as an "outrageous intrusion into our sovereignty."</p>
