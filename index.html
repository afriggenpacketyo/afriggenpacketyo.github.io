        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a wide range of tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump are illegal, challenging the use of emergency economic powers for such actions. The court found that the power to impose tariffs constitutionally belongs to Congress and was not delegated to the president under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The decision, which affects levies on China, Mexico, Canada, and others, is stayed to allow the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, setting up a major legal battle over presidential authority.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Stanford Medicine study indicates that preschool-aged children diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines recommend behavioral intervention as the initial treatment for children aged 3 to 5, due to the potential for side effects like irritability from stimulants. The research, which analyzed nearly 10,000 health records, found that about 68% of diagnosed children received medication before age 7, raising questions about the appropriateness of early pharmaceutical treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The termination of the "de minimis" tax loophole means that low-cost shipments to the U.S., previously exempt if valued under $800, are now subject to import duties. This policy change is expected to raise prices for consumers on many goods ordered from overseas, such as clothing and beauty products, and potentially lengthen delivery times. The White House justified the move by stating the loophole was exploited by bad actors to import illicit drugs and counterfeit goods, while proponents argue it levels the playing field for American businesses.

The legal group is now seeking further documents related to the off-label use of these treatments, accusing the Biden-era agency of a lack of transparency.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris will now be protected by the California Highway Patrol after President Donald Trump revoked her Secret Service detail, a move described by critics as political retaliation. Typically, former vice presidents receive six months of protection, but an extension granted by then-President Biden was rescinded by Trump. California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, coordinated the state-level protection plan to ensure Harris's safety, particularly as she prepares for an upcoming book tour.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is exploring ways to expedite the process for former service members to rejoin the military after being discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Officials are also considering granting honorable discharges to those whose separation was solely due to the vaccine mandate, which would make them eligible for more benefits. Since the Biden-era mandate was rescinded, only a small fraction of the hundreds who applied have been reinstated, prompting frustration and calls for a more efficient system.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. following significant turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including the firing of its chief and the resignation of several senior leaders. Critics and some lawmakers have called for Kennedy's removal, citing his anti-vaccine history and policies that public health experts warn could undermine scientific integrity. The administration, however, praised Kennedy's efforts to reform the agency and restore its credibility amidst the controversy.</p>

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited actions that undermine peace efforts as the reason for the decision, which has been praised by Israel. This move is highly unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters, and it creates a significant diplomatic clash amid international efforts to recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld an injunction preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The court ruled that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their claim that the administration acted unlawfully, as the governing statute does not permit the Homeland Security Secretary to unilaterally end a previously granted extension. This decision provides temporary relief for TPS holders who faced the threat of losing their legal status to live and work in the country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for initiating mortgage fraud investigations into prominent Democrats, including Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. The probes focus on allegations that the officials falsely listed properties as their primary residence on loan applications, a felony offense that is rarely prosecuted. Critics argue this represents a dangerous weaponization of the justice system, selectively targeting political opponents for common and often unintentional paperwork errors while ignoring similar potential infractions by allies.</p>

The complaint claims that the teenager initially used the AI for homework but later turned to it for emotional support, and the chatbot failed to provide crisis resources, instead engaging in and validating his dark ideations. The lawsuit argues this was a "predictable result" of deliberate design choices and a rushed safety process for the GPT-4o model, which the family's lawyer says is "broken."</p>

The writings and videos contain a chaotic mix of extremist references, alongside a reverence for past mass killers, aligning with a disturbing trend among some young perpetrators who seek notoriety through violence itself.</p>
