          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly negotiating to take equity stakes in several quantum computing firms, such as IonQ and Rigetti, in exchange for federal funding. This strategy mirrors recent government investments in other critical sectors like rare earths and semiconductors, reflecting a policy shift towards securing supply chains and technologies vital to U.S. national security. The move, aimed at countering technological competition from China, underscores the perceived importance of quantum computing for future economic and defense applications. The news has prompted a significant surge in the stock prices of the mentioned quantum companies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to multiple sources, France is backing away from its pledge to more forcefully intercept small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. This apparent reversal, attributed partly to internal political turmoil in France, is a setback for the UK government's strategy to curb the crossings. Despite previous announcements of a new "maritime doctrine," French patrol boats are reportedly not attempting to turn back the inflatable "taxi boats" used by smugglers, citing safety risks and legal obstacles. This inaction has led to frustration among UK officials and French coastal residents as dangerous crossings continue daily.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced new coordinated sanctions targeting Russia's major oil companies, including Rosneft and Lukoil, to curtail Moscow's war funding. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the measures as a crucial step, while former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev labeled them an "act of war." The sanctions were imposed following President Trump's expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to seriously negotiate an end to the conflict. This economic escalation aims to compel Russia to engage in peace talks as the war continues with ongoing strikes from both sides.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from analytics firm Cotality, rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. has slowed to its lowest level in 15 years. Rents increased by only 1.4% year-over-year in August, a significant deceleration from previous months and the 3% average gain seen last year. This cooling trend is observed across all price tiers, though regional variations exist, with Chicago seeing the highest growth and Dallas experiencing a decline. The slowdown is mirrored in the multifamily apartment sector, where a construction boom has increased supply and pushed the national vacancy rate to a record high.</p>

          <p>A majority of prospective homebuyers are waiting on the sidelines because they anticipate that mortgage rates will fall further, according to a new CNBC Housing Market Survey. Despite rates hovering at their lowest level in a year, nearly three-quarters of real estate agents report that their clients believe rates will continue to drop. This expectation, combined with ongoing affordability challenges, has created a market standoff where many sellers are still pricing their homes for a seller's market. Consequently, many buyers are only moving if necessary, often compromising on home features or seeking financial help from family to make a purchase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A university professor and linguist argues that the widespread concern over students using AI for their assignments is largely misplaced. The author contends that lamenting a decline in traditional reading and writing habits ignores the reality that technology has always changed how people learn and work. Instead of banning AI, educators should adapt by creating assignments that AI cannot easily complete, such as those requiring personal reflection or in-class writing. The article suggests that AI can handle tedious tasks like mastering arbitrary grammar rules, freeing up students to focus more on critical thinking and developing their own ideas.</p>

Loomis's extensive experience in China is expected to help stabilize the company's position in the crucial market, where it faces competition from Airbus and uncertainties related to trade disputes and export controls. The move underscores Boeing's efforts to manage its relationship with China, a country that has previously used aircraft orders as a point of leverage.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are recommending that high-net-worth individuals increase their charitable giving before the end of 2025 to maximize tax benefits that are set to diminish in 2026. New provisions in a tax bill signed by President Trump will introduce a floor and a ceiling on deductions for top earners, reducing the overall tax advantage of their donations. For example, a new rule will only allow deductions for contributions exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income. To navigate these changes, advisors suggest "bunching" several years' worth of donations into the current year or utilizing donor-advised funds for immediate deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted two more strikes against alleged drug-trafficking vessels, this time in the Pacific Ocean, killing five people. This expands a controversial strategy that has now resulted in nine known strikes and at least 37 deaths since last month, with the previous seven attacks occurring in the Caribbean. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed the strikes, stating the boats were operated by a designated terrorist organization along a known trafficking route. The administration's legal rationale for these lethal actions has been questioned by some members of Congress, who argue the tactic is being used without sufficient oversight or justification.</p>

          <p>Luke Littler, the 18-year-old darts phenom, is positioned to become the world's number one ranked player if he wins the upcoming European Championship in Germany. Currently ranked second, Littler has had a meteoric rise since joining the professional tour less than two years ago, winning seven major titles. Victory in the tournament would make him the youngest PDC world number one in history, surpassing Michael van Gerwen. Littler has openly stated his ambition to claim the top spot from current number one Luke Humphries before he defends his World Championship title in December.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's nine water companies have received their lowest collective environmental performance rating ever from the Environment Agency (EA), largely due to failures in managing pollution. In the annual report, only one company, Severn Trent, achieved the top four-star rating, while Thames Water was rated as "poor" with just one star. The EA's chair, Alan Lovell, described the results as a clear and urgent signal for change, citing long-term underinvestment in infrastructure as a key factor. Campaign groups have called for a complete overhaul of the privatized water system, arguing it has failed to protect rivers and provide fair service.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops in Washington, D.C., as part of a federal law enforcement intervention, has elicited mixed reactions from residents. While many are unnerved by the military presence and view it as presidential overreach, some have cautiously welcomed the D.C. Guard contingent's community improvement efforts, such as cleaning parks and refurbishing recreation centers. This has created a complex situation for local officials, who oppose the deployment on principle but acknowledge the practical help being provided in underserved areas. The deployment remains a point of tension, embodying the conflict between local autonomy and federal authority.</p>

          <p>Internal records show that an unverified rumor about the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) ordering its members to attack U.S. police spread widely among law enforcement agencies last year. The claim, which originated from a local police bulletin, was amplified by state and federal agencies, conservative media, and Republican politicians as evidence of border-related dangers. However, months later, an internal FBI report acknowledged that the claim of a TdA directive to target law enforcement was inaccurate. This dissemination of misinformation highlights concerns about law enforcement's understanding of the gang and has fueled alarmist narratives with significant political and social consequences.</p>

          <p>Spain's La Liga has once again failed in its attempt to stage a regular season match in Miami, after the game's promoter canceled the event due to a lack of guaranteed approvals. The planned match between Villarreal and Barcelona was plagued by poor communication and a lack of consultation with key stakeholders, including the clubs and players' union. Villarreal's chief executive expressed his fury at being disrespected by the league after the cancellation was made public during his team's match. This marks the fourth failed attempt since 2018 to take a league game to the U.S., highlighting deep divisions and flawed strategy within Spanish football.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is seeking to convert its existing loans from China into yuan, a move that could significantly reduce its debt-servicing costs and advance Beijing's goal of internationalizing its currency. This follows a similar decision by Kenya, which is expected to save over $200 million annually in interest payments. By swapping its dollar-denominated debt, Ethiopia could see its interest rate drop from around 7.25% to 3%. The trend, also seen in countries like Sri Lanka and Hungary, provides a critical financial lifeline for nations restructuring their debt while simultaneously increasing the global use and influence of the yuan.</p>

          <p>This article explores the literary world of Philip Pullman, whose fantasy series "His Dark Materials" and "The Book of Dust" stand apart from contemporaries like Harry Potter with their idiosyncratic and intellectually challenging themes. Pullman's work is characterized by its engagement with real-world issues, its critique of organized religion, and its celebration of experience over innocence. The author argues that Pullman's magic is intentionally unsystematic and that his storytelling is deeply committed to the tangible, material world. The essay concludes that Pullman's ultimate project is not escapism, but rather an imaginative guide to navigating and loving our complex reality.</p>

          <p>Kathryn Bigelow's new film, "A House of Dynamite," depicts the immense pressure on a U.S. president who has less than 20 minutes to decide whether to retaliate against an incoming nuclear missile of unknown origin. The movie presents a best-case scenario with rational actors to emphasize that the system itself, designed for rapid response, is inherently flawed and biased toward catastrophic action. This article discusses the film with its screenwriter and a national-security expert, exploring the chilling accuracy of the timeline and the historical context of presidential authority over nuclear weapons. The film serves as a stark reminder of a threat that has evolved but not diminished since the Cold War.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the concept of "screen time" as a metric to be reduced is fundamentally misguided in the modern era. The term, coined in 1991 to describe children's television habits, now encompasses nearly every aspect of life, from work and communication to entertainment and basic errands. The author contends that simply measuring the duration of screen use says little about the quality or necessity of the activity and that most meaningful activities now require a screen. Instead of an individual problem to be managed, "screen time" is presented as a systemic condition of contemporary life, a frenzy of existence that cannot be escaped through simple self-monitoring.</p>

The EU praised Egypt's "vital stabilizing role" in the Middle East, particularly concerning Gaza and its efforts to curb illegal migration to Europe. However, this embrace of the authoritarian leader has drawn sharp criticism from human rights organizations, who argue the EU is bankrolling repression in exchange for cooperation on migration.
