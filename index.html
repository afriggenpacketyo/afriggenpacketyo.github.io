          <p>Jordan's Interior Ministry has announced a ban on the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group already outlawed in several Arab countries. This decision follows the arrest of 16 individuals accused of plotting threats to national security, involving weapons, explosives, and drone manufacturing. Interior Minister Mazin Al Farrayeh suggested the plot was connected to the Muslim Brotherhood, alleging they undermined stability and national unity and attempted to destroy documents, with explosives manufacturing linked to a leader's son. The Jordanian government aims to prevent further destabilizing actions by the group.</p>

          <p>The European Union has imposed fines totaling 700 million euros on Apple and Meta for violating the bloc's digital competition rules. Apple was fined 500 million euros for preventing app makers from directing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, while Meta received a 200 million euro fine for forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between personalized ads or paying to avoid them. Both companies plan to appeal the decisions, arguing that the EU is unfairly targeting American businesses.

          <p>Jewish high school students across North America have experienced a significant rise in antisemitism since October 7, 2023, marked by fear, hostility, and harassment. Students have reported being isolated, intimidated, and threatened for their Jewish identity or support for Israel. The Anti-Defamation League's 2024 audit highlights a 140% increase in antisemitic incidents, including harassment, vandalism, and assaults, predominantly in schools and colleges. Schools are being urged to update anti-harassment policies, train staff to identify modern forms of antisemitism, and foster an environment where Jewish identity is respected.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has denied any rift with shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick regarding potential alliances with Reform UK. This denial follows a leaked recording where Jenrick expressed a desire for a united front against Labour in the next general election, fueling speculation about a possible pact with Nigel Farage's party. Badenoch's spokesperson clarified that there would be no electoral pact with Reform and that Jenrick's comments were aimed at uniting center-right voters to defeat Reform. The Conservative leader has always ruled out such a deal, arguing that Nigel Farage's party is seeking to destroy the Tories.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to between 50% and 65%, a move that has boosted U.S. equities markets. These cuts would significantly reduce the tariffs previously set at 145% and are part of the White House's efforts to recalibrate trade strategy. Options under review include a tiered system distinguishing between strategic and non-strategic goods, with strategic goods facing tariffs of at least 100%. This potential shift signals a possible easing of trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of lacking "moral courage" on transgender issues during a heated Prime Minister's Questions session. This follows a UK Supreme Court ruling that the legal definition of a woman should be based on biological sex. Badenoch criticized Starmer for not clearly stating his position and likened him to a "weather vane," while Starmer emphasized treating everyone with dignity and respect. The exchange highlights the ongoing political divisions surrounding transgender rights and the challenges of navigating this sensitive issue.</p>
