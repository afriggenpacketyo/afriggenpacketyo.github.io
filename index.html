          <p>Swedish activist Greta Thunberg was deported from Israel after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound aid boat she was on with 11 others in the Mediterranean. The Israeli foreign ministry stated Thunberg agreed to be deported and was flown to France. Other passengers, including French citizens, faced deportation proceedings after refusing to sign deportation orders. The intercepted yacht, the Madleen, aimed to deliver aid to Gaza, defying Israel's maritime blockade and highlighting the humanitarian crisis, but Israel dismissed it as a "selfie yacht" and said the aid would be transferred through proper channels. The situation underscores ongoing tensions surrounding aid efforts and maritime restrictions in the region. Optimism is muted given the underlying conflict and differing perspectives on humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help these tiny birds, can become deadly traps if not regularly cleaned. Sugar water left out too long spoils, attracting harmful microbes that can cause infections in hummingbirds, such as candida, which causes their tongues to swell and makes it difficult to eat. Wildlife rehabbers emphasize the importance of cleaning feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily in the summer. The solution involves mixing one part refined white sugar with four parts water, avoiding other sugars, sweeteners, and red food coloring, and regularly cleaning the feeder with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture to prevent mold growth.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally requested clarity from UEFA regarding Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League. The concern stems from potential breaches of UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, as John Textor, who owns a 43% stake in Palace, also holds a 77% stake in Lyon, another Europa League qualifier. UEFA regulations prohibit an individual or entity from holding a majority of voting rights at two clubs in the same European tournament, and Forest, which could benefit if Palace is disqualified, has voiced its reservations to UEFA. The investigation aims to ensure fair competition and prevent collusion between clubs.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended the government's decision to partially reinstate winter fuel payments for pensioners, reversing an earlier cut. The Chancellor initially withdrew the payment from over 10 million pensioners to stabilize the economy but later expanded eligibility due to public pressure. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government maintains that the change will not lead to additional borrowing due to an improving economy, though the Conservatives have criticized the move, questioning its funding.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned President Trump as "deranged" after thousands more troops were deployed to Los Angeles amid ongoing protests against immigration raids. The Trump administration sent 700 US Marines and doubled the National Guard contingent to 4,000, a move Newsom described as fulfilling "the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president." The state is suing the president for deploying troops without the governor's permission, arguing it violates the US Constitution and California's sovereignty. Protests have also spread to other US cities, with law enforcement using rubber bullets and gas canisters to disperse demonstrators.</p>

          <p>Gen Z has shown a recent trend of returning to religion, reversing previous declines in religious attendance. Experts suggest this may be a form of rebellion against atheist parents or a search for community and answers in a turbulent world. While women have historically been more religious, Catholicism is seeing a rise in young men, potentially due to politics and a desire for a privileged position. This shift marks a significant change in the religious landscape and challenges previous assumptions about the decline of religion among young people.</p>

          <p>President Trump has frequently used Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to block the entry of noncitizens into the United States, citing national security and other concerns. This law allows the president to ban foreigners if their entry is deemed detrimental to U.S. interests. While previous presidents used this authority sparingly, Trump has employed it to implement travel bans, restrict legal immigration, and target foreign students. This has expanded executive power over immigration and created a new legal paradigm, despite court challenges and concerns about anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

While serious economists may not rely on these informal signs, the overall mood and "animal spirits" can influence spending and investment decisions.
