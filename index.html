          <p>President Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top investors of his meme coin, $TRUMP, at his Virginia golf club. Crypto investor Nicholas Pinto described the event as opulent but underwhelming, noting that the food was subpar and Trump only briefly addressed the attendees without taking questions. Security was reportedly lax, and many guests seemed more concerned with the coin's fluctuating price than the event itself. Despite the high price tag of $148 million spent collectively by the attendees, the event left some feeling underwhelmed, especially those who didn't make it into the top 25 wallets for a private reception.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting it will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This follows the Biden administration's previous blocking of Nippon Steel's outright acquisition of U.S. Steel due to national security concerns. U.S. Steel will maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and investors reacted positively, with shares jumping over 20%. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern about the impact on American jobs, while officials from both Pennsylvania and Nippon Steel applauded the news, citing innovation and growth for the American steel industry.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council, according to sources, following the appointment of Marco Rubio as national security adviser. Some NSC staff are being moved to other positions within the administration, while the NSC's communications team is being dissolved. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser Andy Baker is expected to take on a top role in the restructured NSC, and White House aide Robert Gabriel is playing a key part in managing the NSC.

          <p>Yasmina Asrarguis, a French-Moroccan researcher, reflects on the life and tragic death of Sarah Milgrim, who was murdered outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington. Milgrim was known for her interfaith work, particularly her engagement with organizations that brought together Christians, Jews, Muslims, Israelis, and Palestinians. The article emphasizes the importance of not co-opting Milgrim's legacy for political gain, but rather honoring her commitment to coexistence and mutual respect. Milgrim dedicated herself to creating a space for dialogue and seeking solutions, a vision that was tragically cut short by an act of antisemitic violence.</p>

The New Orleans Police Department had paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. until the technology's use is deemed legally compliant. The ACLU and some members of Congress oppose the unchecked use of facial recognition, citing potential for bias and errors, particularly affecting people of color and other marginalized groups.</p>

Gemini also claimed that the holiday is intertwined with national identity and patriotism, which can be controversial for those with differing perspectives on American history and foreign policy.

          <p>A brush fire near Yosemite National Park in California has led to the shutdown of a major highway and the evacuation of Mono City. The Inn fire, which ignited on Thursday, has burned over 700 acres in Inyo National Forest. Firefighting efforts are focused on containing the fire's north end, with helicopters pulling water from nearby lakes. The fire is one of several that have erupted in California due to warmer weather, impacting tourist destinations and raising concerns for Memorial Day weekend.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. This follows the Biden administration's previous blocking of Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel. Trump projected that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% on the news, and the president announced he'll hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on May 30.</p>

The move follows previous actions, including suspending over $400 million in research funding to Columbia.</p>
