          <p>The Israeli military has recovered the body of Natthapong Pinta, a Thai man abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz and killed in Gaza by the Kataeb al-Mujahideen terror group shortly after October 7, 2023. Pinta, who had come to Israel to work in agriculture, was found in the Rafah area. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz expressed condolences to Pinta's family and affirmed the commitment to bring back all hostages, both living and deceased.

          <p>Tesla faces significant challenges, exacerbated by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The dispute, stemming from policy disagreements over Trump's spending bill, led to a sharp decline in Tesla's stock value and a breakdown in their relationship. This fallout could impact Tesla's regulatory environment, government support, and tariff exemptions. The company was already struggling with declining revenue, increased competition, and backlash against Musk's political activities, and investors are concerned about Tesla's ability to innovate and compete with rivals in the electric vehicle market.

          <p>A 9-year-old girl's death following a dental surgery in San Diego County has been attributed to a rare blood disorder called methemoglobinemia. The condition, which disrupts oxygen delivery to cells, could have been triggered by anesthetic medications used during the procedure. While dental procedures are generally safe, methemoglobinemia can be caused by exposure to certain medications or an excess dosage. The San Diego Police Department has closed its investigation, and the dental facility stated the death was due to an undiagnosed medical condition, not dosage errors.</p>

          <p>The UK government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK. New figures show the Home Office plans to spend Â£2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, only marginally less than the Â£2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. This money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of asylum seekers. Critics argue that this diverts funds from humanitarian and development priorities across the world, and that the Home Office has no incentive to reduce ODA spending because the money does not come out of its budgets.</p>

German firms, particularly those in AI, robotics, and mechanical engineering, are heavily invested in the US, but investment has slowed due to Trump's trade policies.

          <p>Japan and the United States are striving for a trade agreement by mid-June, despite failing to find common ground on tariff issues. Japan's negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported "further progress" after talks with U.S. officials, but significant differences persist. Japan is pushing for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, citing their adverse effects on the Japanese economy. The discussions cover trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of national interest over rushing into a deal.</p>
