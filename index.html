          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmakers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix surged significantly following their partnership with OpenAI for its Stargate initiative. This collaboration aims to boost the supply of advanced memory chips crucial for next-generation AI and expand data center capacity in Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean leaders and company executives to finalize these agreements. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, is already mass-producing next-generation high-bandwidth memory chips, while Samsung is working to certify its own HBM4 chips, intensifying their competition in the AI memory market.

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first individual to reach a net worth exceeding $500 billion, driven by the rising valuations of Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX. This milestone solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest person, significantly surpassing rivals like Oracle founder Larry Ellison. His immense wealth is primarily linked to his substantial stake in Tesla, whose shares have seen a sharp increase this year. Investors have reportedly welcomed Musk's increased focus on his companies over political engagements, with the company's board outlining a potential $1 trillion pay package tied to ambitious future targets.</p>

          <p>An Idaho state judge has ruled against the public release of graphic crime scene photos from the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students by Bryan Kohberger. The judge determined that disseminating these "incredibly disturbing" images would cause "extreme emotional distress" for the victims' families, outweighing public interest in the investigation's conduct. While portions showing victims' bodies or blood must be redacted, other investigation records, including videos of distraught friends, can be released. Kohberger pleaded guilty to the murders, receiving life without parole, and the criminal case is now closed.</p>

          <p>French asset manager Amundi has largely divested from China's September equity rally, reallocating investments towards dividend stocks due to persistent concerns about the country's economic outlook. Philippe d’Orgeval, the firm’s deputy group chief investment officer, noted trimming positions in "overvalued" Chinese stocks while selectively increasing exposure to onshore equities. Despite an 18% surge in the CSI 300 Index, skepticism remains that the rally may have outpaced economic fundamentals. Amundi remains open to rebuilding its China exposure if the macro environment becomes more supportive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order promising to use all lawful measures, including military action, to defend Qatar against external attack. The order, dated Monday, views any armed assault on Qatar's territory, sovereignty, or critical infrastructure as a threat to U.S. peace and security. This pledge follows a recent Israeli attack on Doha targeting Hamas leaders, for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed regret during a visit to Washington.

          <p>Brendan Carr, the pro-Trump chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has reportedly agreed to testify before the Senate commerce committee. This development follows Disney's temporary suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, which occurred shortly after Carr publicly pressured network affiliates to stop airing the show. Carr's comments, which included phrases like "we can do this the easy way or the hard way," drew criticism, with Senator Ted Cruz comparing him to a "mafioso." Kimmel's show eventually returned, hitting a 10-year ratings high, and the controversy has sparked questions about FCC influence over broadcasting content.</p>

          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of E.J. Antoni to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), though no specific reason was provided. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, was nominated in August after President Trump fired the previous BLS Commissioner following a weaker-than-expected jobs report. Antoni had previously criticized the BLS, suggesting it suspend its monthly jobs report and referring to its health insurance figures as "phoney baloney." He expressed gratitude to the president but noted a lack of support from other elected officials for his agenda of change in Washington.</p>

          <p>Amid the federal government shutdown, a key point of contention between the White House and Democrats is the claim that Democrats seek to provide free healthcare to immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Republicans point to a Democratic proposal to reverse measures in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' that narrowed Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. Democrats clarify their proposal would only restore Medicaid access to immigrants with legal status or government protection, not those residing illegally. U.S. law generally prohibits federal benefits for undocumented individuals, and Democrats deny any intent to change this.

          <p>New Jersey Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's net worth has substantially increased since her election six years ago, fueled by luxury properties and her banker husband's over $2 million annual income. Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli has criticized her finances, accusing her of "flipping stocks," a claim Sherrill denies, stating she doesn't own individual stocks. Financial disclosures indicate her net worth jumped significantly, partly due to the purchase of a Washington, D.C., townhouse. While she faced a fine for a STOCK Act violation related to her husband's trades, most of her family's wealth growth stems from his compensation and real estate investments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced cuts of nearly $8 billion in funding for green energy projects across 16 Democratic-leaning states, including California and New York. Russell Vought, Director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, stated the funds were for "Green New Scam funding" that did not align with national energy needs or provide a positive return on taxpayer investment. This move, which also includes freezing $18 million for New York City infrastructure projects, has been criticized by Democratic lawmakers as political retaliation and a weaponization of policy. The Department of Energy confirmed terminating over 300 financial awards, with recipients having 30 days to appeal.</p>

This ruling comes as the Trump administration also slashed federal counterterrorism funding for the NYPD.

          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a significant hole in its side. Miraculously, no injuries were reported despite the extensive damage and debris scattered across Alexander Avenue. Mayor Eric Adams praised the fortunate outcome, emphasizing the avoidance of a major disaster. Officials believe the blast originated in the boiler room, sending shockwaves up the chimney and leading to the structural failure. Residents from 38 apartments have been evacuated, and inspections are underway to ensure the building's structural integrity, with gas services temporarily shut off.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique silent protest after fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to starter over him. When questioned by reporters about remaining the team's No. 3 quarterback, Sanders smiled and pantomimed answers without uttering a single word. This inventive response followed critical remarks from former NFL coach Rex Ryan regarding Sanders' previous comments about his NFL backup status. Sanders, a former college star, was drafted by the Browns in the fifth round, behind Gabriel, and now sits third on the depth chart behind Gabriel and veteran Joe Flacco.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has scheduled the execution of Christa Gail Pike for September 30, 2026, marking the first time the state will execute a woman in over two centuries. Pike, 49, was 18 when she was convicted of the brutal 1995 murder of 19-year-old Colleen Slemmer, a crime that involved severe beating, stabbing, and a pentagram carved into the victim's chest. Pike later bragged about the murder and kept a skull fragment. Her attorneys argue that her young age and undiagnosed mental health issues at the time should warrant a life sentence without parole instead of the death penalty, a stance opposed by the victim's mother.</p>

He emphasized that analyzing quarterly winners provides a valuable roadmap for investors, as fund managers often acquire these stocks in the fourth quarter. AppLovin, Western Digital, and Seagate led the charge with substantial gains, driven by AI demand. Cramer also highlighted Warner Bros.

          <p>A Cambridge professor has clarified common misconceptions about cooking oils and fats, offering guidance on healthier choices for home cooking. Professor Nita Forouhi debunks the idea that sunflower and vegetable oils are unhealthy, stating they are beneficial due to their low saturated fat content and high levels of mono- and polyunsaturated fats. She also noted that modern margarines, with minimal trans fats, can be part of a healthy diet, helping to reduce bad cholesterol. The article advises using basic olive oil for shallow frying and vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying due to their higher smoke points, promoting informed decisions for better health outcomes.</p>

An analysis by BBC Verify and BBC Russian shows 21 of 38 large refineries have been hit this year, with strikes soaring in August and September. These attacks, some deep inside Russia, are part of Ukraine's strategy to cripple Russia's oil industry and pressure for negotiations.

The article criticizes these settlements as acts of "corporate cowardice," arguing they implicitly validate Trump's claims and weaken the platforms' stance on content moderation and free speech.

          <p>The White House has warned that mass layoffs of U.S. federal workers are imminent, with no end in sight for the government shutdown that began on Wednesday. Vice President JD Vance and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the impasse, accusing them of playing political games. Democrats, in turn, criticized Republicans for refusing to negotiate on healthcare funding, which they deem essential. With Congress failing to reach a spending agreement, hundreds of thousands of federal employees face unpaid leave, and the threat of permanent job cuts looms, exacerbating the economic and social impact of the funding lapse.</p>
