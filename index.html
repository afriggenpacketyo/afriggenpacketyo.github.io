          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated his willingness to participate in a proposed summit with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, despite recent tense discussions at the White House. Reports indicate the meeting was acrimonious, with the U.S. side allegedly pressuring Ukraine to accept Russian terms, including ceding the Donbas region, to end the war. Zelenskyy publicly described the talks as "frank," emphasizing his goal is a just peace, not a quick one, and expressed skepticism about Hungary as a neutral venue for the talks. This development follows Trump's previous shifts in his stance on how to resolve the ongoing conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with debt, settlement programs offer a structured path to pay less than what is owed, but failing to complete one can lead to severe financial repercussions. Dropping out means any unsettled debts remain fully owed, with interest and fees continuing to accrue, potentially making the balances larger than when the program started. Additionally, funds paid into the settlement account may be reduced by service fees, and any forgiven debt could still have tax implications. The article stresses that while difficult, sticking with a debt relief plan can provide a crucial financial reset in the current high-interest-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys kicker Brandon Aubrey has made NFL history by becoming the first player to successfully convert five field goals from 60 yards or more. He achieved this milestone with a 61-yard kick during the team's victory against the Washington Commanders. Aubrey, who is perfect on his 15 field goal attempts this season, has become one of the league's most reliable kickers. His journey to the NFL is unconventional, as he was a professional soccer player before transitioning to football and finding success in the USFL, which ultimately led to his contract with the Cowboys.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), originating from its US-East-1 region in Virginia, caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites, apps, and services worldwide. The issue was identified as a DNS problem affecting services like DynamoDB, impacting companies such as Disney+, Reddit, Lyft, and even Amazon's own internal warehouse and delivery systems. While AWS reported seeing "significant signs of recovery" after several hours, the event highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers. The incident serves as a reminder of the fragility of global technology infrastructure, where a technical fault at one key provider can have a cascading global effect.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review a case challenging a federal law that prohibits regular users of illegal drugs, specifically marijuana, from owning firearms. The case involves a man charged with felony gun possession after acknowledging his cannabis use, a law also used in Hunter Biden's 2024 conviction. The Trump administration is appealing a lower court ruling that found the ban unconstitutional, citing the Supreme Court's 2022 Bruen decision which expanded Second Amendment rights. The government argues that historical laws restricting gun ownership for habitual alcohol users provide a precedent for the current statute, setting up a significant test of the court's interpretation of gun control.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut is set to close 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations in the UK, resulting in the loss of 1,210 jobs after its franchise operator, DC London Pie Limited, went into administration. However, Pizza Hut's global owner, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to acquire and save 64 other restaurant sites, thereby preserving 1,276 jobs. This marks the second time in less than a year that the UK restaurant business has faced insolvency, reflecting significant challenges from increased competition, rising operational costs, and cautious consumer spending. Experts note the brand has struggled to stay relevant in a more upmarket and social media-driven pizza market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that cannabis is more effective than opioids for treating chronic low back pain, a leading cause of global disability. One study showed a proprietary cannabis oil blend provided better pain relief than a placebo, while the other found it offered superior relief and fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared to opioids over a six-month period. These findings are considered groundbreaking by some U.S. researchers, as large-scale cannabis trials are difficult to conduct in the United States due to its Schedule 1 drug classification. While the specific cannabis tincture is not yet available in the U.S., the research provides strong evidence for patients considering alternatives to opioids.</p>

The incident is the latest in a series of high-profile art thefts, such as the 2019 Green Vault heist in Dresden, which was linked to a Berlin crime syndicate.

          <p>A fragile peace deal between Israel and Hamas, brokered by the Trump administration, was tested over the weekend by renewed clashes that left 45 people dead in Gaza. Senior U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, key negotiators of the agreement, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday to help ensure the ceasefire holds. The violence erupted after Israel launched retaliatory strikes following a deadly attack on its soldiers, though Hamas denied involvement. Both sides have since recommitted to the peace process, with a key focus now on maximizing the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza as stipulated by the U.S.-led plan.</p>

          <p>King Charles visited Manchester to meet with survivors of the deadly car and knife attack at the Heaton Park synagogue that occurred on October 2. The monarch expressed his sadness over the "terrible" incident, which killed two people, and met with three survivors, including the volunteer security guard recently released from the hospital. He also met with synagogue leaders and thanked members of the emergency services for their "fantastic response" to the attack. The visit was seen as a significant gesture of support for the Jewish community, with one survivor noting that it sends a powerful message from the very top of the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett stated that he believes the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. Speaking on CNBC, Hassett suggested that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown persists due to a partisan stalemate over federal funding, with Democrats demanding that any short-term spending bill include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett claimed moderate Democrats might soon break the impasse, allowing the government to reopen and policy negotiations to resume through the regular process. (not investment advice)</p>

Now rebranded as Afghan Women United, the team will participate in the "FIFA Unites: Women's Series" against Chad, Libya, and a fourth unannounced team.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Working with a controlling manager can be exhausting, but an executive coach and author offers several strategies to navigate the situation effectively. Instead of perfecting work, present rough drafts to invite early input, which satisfies the boss's need for involvement while conserving your energy. It is also helpful to reinforce their authority with phrases that acknowledge their final say and to proactively overshare information to preempt their need for oversight. Additionally, getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." technique can help validate their feedback while still asserting your own ideas, making the dynamic more manageable.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, a trend attributed to several key factors. Historically, generous government and manufacturer incentives on new EVs have lowered their resale value, as used car buyers are less willing to pay a premium. Additionally, the rapid advancement of battery technology and increasing range means that older EV models quickly become outdated. As the market matures with more affordable models and a larger volume of used EVs becomes available, experts anticipate that this depreciation gap may begin to narrow, making them more appealing to value-oriented used car shoppers.

          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the U.S. agency responsible for safeguarding the nation's nuclear stockpile, will furlough approximately 1,400 employees due to the ongoing government shutdown. This is the first time the agency has had to lay off workers since its creation in 2000, as officials state they have exhausted all available funding. The furloughs will leave fewer than 400 employees to manage the critical agency. While the Energy Secretary assured that the nuclear stockpile will remain secure, he noted that the staff reduction will impede efforts to modernize older weapons systems, highlighting the shutdown's impact on national security functions.</p>

          <p>Filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can wipe out most unsecured debts, is not automatically available to everyone and requires passing specific eligibility hurdles. The primary obstacle is the "means test," which compares an individual's household income to their state's median income. Those with incomes below the median typically qualify easily, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. Other factors, such as recent bankruptcy filings and the completion of mandatory credit counseling, also affect approval. If an application is denied, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement, or credit counseling remain viable options for managing overwhelming debt.</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou was sacked as Nottingham Forest's manager after just 40 days, following a 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea, in a move that seemed inevitable due to a fundamental clash of styles. Forest achieved success last season with a deep-sitting, counter-attacking strategy, which is the antithesis of Postecoglou's high-pressing, aggressive football philosophy. The article questions the judgment of both the club's owner for making such an unsuitable appointment and Postecoglou for accepting a job with a squad ill-equipped for his system. This brief and unsuccessful tenure has likely damaged Postecoglou's reputation and prospects for future Premier League management roles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's renewed threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S. could severely impact the global film industry, with Britain's sector being particularly vulnerable. The UK's film and TV industry, which contributes significantly to the economy, relies heavily on U.S. partnerships, with American studios accounting for 65% of production spending last year. Industry leaders warn that such a tariff would make it much more difficult to finance and produce British films, potentially forcing the UK to seek more co-production opportunities with European and Asian partners. The proposal adds another layer of uncertainty to an industry already facing challenges from post-pandemic recovery and streaming competition. (not investment advice)</p>
