          <h2>Interest in Learning Mandarin Declines in Western Nations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 18:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from several Western countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and New Zealand, indicates a significant decline in enrollment for Mandarin language courses. Once promoted as the language of the future due to China's economic rise, interest has waned after years of growth. University enrollments in the U.S. for Mandarin have dropped by 25% from their 2013 peak, with similar downward trends seen in other nations. This shift reflects changing geopolitical dynamics and a cooling of enthusiasm for cultural and economic engagement with China in the West.</p>

          <p>Oleksandr Usyk delivered a commanding performance to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion, stopping Daniel Dubois in the fifth round at Wembley Stadium. The Ukrainian boxer reclaimed the IBF title, adding it to his WBA, WBO, and WBC belts in a masterclass display. Usyk, who remains undefeated, knocked Dubois down twice in the final round before the fight was stopped. This victory solidifies his status as one of boxing's elite, while Dubois suffers his third professional defeat.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to a new target to cut the number of sewage discharges by water companies in half by 2030. This marks the first time a clear national target has been set on the issue, following public outrage over waterway pollution. The pledge comes after data revealed a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, reaching a record high. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution, though it coincides with expected rises in consumer water bills to fund infrastructure investments.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has issued multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms across large parts of the UK, indicating a threat of flash flooding and travel disruption. The alerts follow a recent heatwave that has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing flood risk. While a more severe amber warning for London and the South East did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts are still possible. Warnings remain in place for Scotland, Wales, and much of England through the weekend and into Monday.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly cut staff and resources for federal programs aimed at combating human trafficking, a move that has surprised advocates. The State Department’s key anti-trafficking office was recently gutted, losing about half its staff, which could delay a critical annual global report. This follows funding cuts at the Labor Department for programs fighting child labor abroad and record-low issuance of special visas for trafficking victims who cooperate with law enforcement. The pullback is seen as a reversal, as combating trafficking had previously been a high-profile priority for the administration.</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, claims Manhattan prosecutors illegally obtained his confidential medical records. His attorneys allege the DA's office used a fraudulent subpoena to compel Aetna to turn over the information, violating health privacy laws like HIPAA. They are requesting a hearing and sanctions, which could include dismissal of the charges. Sources from the DA's office contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent the additional protected materials in error.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa sanctions on a Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The Trump administration placed restrictions on Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, calling the case a "political witch hunt." President Lula described the U.S. action as unacceptable interference in Brazil's justice system and a violation of national sovereignty. The sanctions were imposed after the judge ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic monitor while awaiting a verdict on charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election.</p>

          <p>More than 100 people have been arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Protesters in several major cities, including London and Bristol, were arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses for displaying placards in support of the group. The UK government banned Palestine Action earlier this month under the Terrorism Act after its members broke into an RAF base. The protests come as the group's co-founder prepares to challenge the ban in the High Court.</p>

          <p>Former major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open championship. Both golfers were warned by officials about their pace during the third round, with Stenson calling the enforcement inconsistent compared to the leniency shown in earlier rounds. DeChambeau, who has been a long-time advocate for a new timing system, argued that the current approach is unfair. Their comments highlight ongoing frustration among professional golfers regarding the inconsistent and often controversial handling of pace of play in major tournaments.</p>
