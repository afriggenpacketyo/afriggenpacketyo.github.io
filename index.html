          <p>Following the death of their 18-year-old daughter Chloe Childress in a devastating flash flood at Camp Mystic, her parents successfully advocated for new safety legislation in Texas. The new laws, passed by the state legislature, will prohibit cabins in flood zones, mandate warning systems, and improve emergency communications for campgrounds. Despite some camps raising concerns about financial burdens, the Childress family believes these changes are essential to prevent future tragedies and honor the memory of the many campers and counselors who lost their lives.</p>

          <p>A spokeswoman for former President Joe Biden has confirmed that he recently underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer. This type of surgery involves removing thin layers of skin until no cancerous tissue remains, aiming to preserve as much healthy tissue as possible. In 2023, Biden had a cancerous basal cell carcinoma lesion removed from his chest, and this recent procedure addresses a wound observed on his head. The surgery is considered highly effective for common types of skin cancer.</p>

          <p>In the contentious New York City mayoral race, independent candidate Andrew Cuomo challenged his opponent, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, to a series of five debates across the city's boroughs. Cuomo criticized Mamdani for being evasive on policy issues. In response, Mamdani's campaign dismissed Cuomo as a "puppet" and instead counter-proposed a debate with former President Donald Trump, alluding to reports that Trump is trying to clear the field for Cuomo by offering jobs to other candidates.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu, and its police commissioner, alleging that the city's sanctuary policies violate federal law. The lawsuit, announced by Attorney General Pam Bondi, targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits municipal cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The DOJ claims these policies endanger public safety by preventing the detention of individuals for immigration removal. Mayor Wu has previously defended the city's stance, stating that immigration enforcement is a federal, not local, responsibility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order directing the Department of Defense to also be known as the Department of War, its historical name until 1947. While a formal renaming requires congressional approval, the order will permit the new title in official correspondence and for the Secretary of Defense to use the title Secretary of War. Trump has previously argued that the name change conveys a stronger message of readiness and better reflects the country's history of military victory under the former title.</p>

          <p>Political scientist Sir John Curtice analyzes the remarkable rise of Reform UK, which has consistently led in UK polls for five months, a feat unprecedented for a party other than Labour or the Conservatives. The party's success is attributed to widespread voter dissatisfaction with the economy, the NHS, and immigration, coupled with the personal appeal of its leader, Nigel Farage. Curtice argues that Reform has effectively captured the pro-Brexit, socially conservative vote, fundamentally realigning the UK's political landscape and posing a significant challenge to the traditional two-party system.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie, an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered among his personal archives donated to the V&A Museum. Notes found in his locked New York study reveal his deep fascination with the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 1700s London, including notorious figures like thief Jack Sheppard. This discovery sheds new light on Bowie's creative ambitions in his final months, showing his long-held desire to write for the theater, an ambition he was exploring until his death in 2016.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock increased in extended trading after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and provided a strong revenue forecast. A key driver of investor optimism was the announcement that Broadcom has secured $10 billion in orders for its custom AI chips from a fourth, unnamed major customer, with shipments expected to begin in 2026. CEO Hock Tan highlighted that strong growth in AI-related revenue, from both custom chips and networking parts, is significantly boosting the company's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a temperature of 82 degrees or below. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address the growing public health risks posed by extreme heat waves. Proponents argue it is a critical health and safety issue, particularly for vulnerable residents, while landlord associations have raised concerns about the high costs of implementation and potential impacts on rent prices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle to the Supreme Court, seeking permission to remove Democratic commissioner Rebecca Slaughter from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Lower courts have blocked President Trump's attempt to fire Slaughter, citing federal laws that provide tenure protections to members of certain independent regulatory agencies to shield them from direct presidential control. The administration argues that the modern FTC wields substantial executive power, and therefore its commissioners should serve at the president's will, challenging a long-standing legal precedent.</p>
