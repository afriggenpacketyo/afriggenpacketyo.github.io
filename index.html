        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is facing a jury trial in Seattle this week against allegations from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it misled consumers into signing up for its Prime membership. The 2023 lawsuit claims the company utilized manipulative user-interface designs, known as "dark patterns," to trick customers into enrolling and made the cancellation process deliberately complicated. Federal regulators argue that the button to complete a purchase often did not clearly state it was also an agreement to join Prime. Amazon denies all allegations of wrongdoing, asserting that it has always prioritized its customers and that its executives acted appropriately throughout.</p>

          <p>The article provides a detailed timeline of the Karen Read case, from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022, to her recent retrial. It chronicles the initial investigation, Read's arrest, and the defense's claim that she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. Key moments are detailed, including a hung jury in the first trial, the subsequent firing of the lead investigator for misconduct, and the eventual acquittal of Read on the most serious charges of murder and manslaughter. She was ultimately convicted only of driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume broadcasting on ABC this Tuesday, following a nearly week-long suspension. The company stated the initial decision to halt production was made to avoid escalating a tense situation after Kimmel's comments linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's MAGA movement. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, Disney CEO Bob Iger and co-chair Dana Walden decided to bring the show back. The suspension had drawn widespread criticism and sparked a national debate about free speech and potential government influence over media content.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether the president has the authority to fire members of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) without cause. The case emerged after President Trump attempted to oust FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, which a lower court blocked, citing a law that limits removal to specific reasons like neglect of duty. While the case is pending, the high court will allow Trump to remove Slaughter from her position. This landmark dispute tests the separation of powers and could significantly weaken the independence of federal agencies designed to be insulated from political pressure.</p>

          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations to address national security concerns, though China has not officially confirmed the agreement. The proposal involves creating a new U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members, where TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, would hold less than 20% equity. Software company Oracle will manage the security of the app's U.S. data and algorithm from top to bottom. A senior official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, which would avert a nationwide ban on the popular social media application.</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. skyrocketed by over 46% on Monday after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson recommended the stock. Jackson, known for his role in the trading surge of Opendoor, called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages" and highlighted its potential for massive growth, suggesting it could be a "350-bagger in 2 years."

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity have more affordable options. The article compares a fixed-rate home equity loan with a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC), noting that HELOCs are currently slightly cheaper on a monthly basis. However, it cautions that the variable nature of HELOC rates could lead to higher costs in the future if market rates rise, unlike the stability of a fixed-rate loan. The analysis suggests borrowers should carefully weigh the immediate savings of a HELOC against the long-term predictability of a home equity loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates on a downward trend, prospective homebuyers anticipating another drop in October can take several strategic steps to prepare. Financial experts recommend getting a mortgage pre-approval now to demonstrate seriousness to sellers, but only after thoroughly checking one's credit report for any inaccuracies that could lower their score. It is also advised to research and select an experienced real estate agent who can navigate what could become a more competitive market. Finally, buyers should begin comparing rates, costs, and terms from various lenders online to be well-informed and ready to act quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a link between the use of acetaminophen (Tylenol) during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism, a claim that is being strongly contested by medical experts and the drug's manufacturer. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, stated that sound science shows no causal link and that acetaminophen remains the safest pain reliever for pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and other major studies also find no clear evidence of a direct relationship. Experts worry the announcement could cause unnecessary fear and lead expectant mothers to use riskier alternatives for treating conditions like high fever.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 studies has found that efforts to reduce partisan animosity, often called the "age of rage," yield only small and temporary results. Researchers discovered that interventions, such as correcting misperceptions about political opponents, produced only a modest increase in warmth towards the other party. Furthermore, these effects largely vanished within two weeks. The study suggests that individual-level approaches are not a magical fix for deep political divides. Lasting change will likely require systemic shifts in the incentives that encourage political and media figures to fuel partisan conflict.</p>

The charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation, deemed it inappropriate for her to continue in her role. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent under duress to counter a defamation lawsuit threat from Epstein and that she deeply regrets any association with him.</p>

His number will hang alongside other Pitt legends like Dan Marino and Tony Dorsett. Donald, a Pittsburgh native, expressed his gratitude to the university for taking a chance on him. In 2019, he made a seven-figure donation to the program, leading to the renaming of its performance center in his honor.</p>

The iconic sportswear brand has struggled since late 2021 due to challenges in China and a loss of innovation edge, which allowed competitors to gain market share. Under new CEO Elliott Hill, Nike is refocusing on core sports, rebuilding retail partnerships, and working to clear excess inventory ahead of the holiday season. Recent positive earnings and upgraded ratings from analysts suggest growing confidence that the company is on the right track to return to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advocacy group Consumer Watchdog has proposed a new ballot initiative in California called the "Insurance Policyholder Bill of Rights." The measure would mandate that insurers offer coverage to homeowners who implement wildfire mitigation measures or face a five-year ban on selling home or auto insurance in the state. It also gives policyholders 180 days to make necessary repairs for renewal if they face unavoidable delays. The proposal comes in response to insurers pulling back from the California market and another proposed initiative that would weaken consumer protections established by the landmark 1988 Proposition 103.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's new appointee to the Federal Reserve board, is advocating for more aggressive interest rate cuts, diverging from the central bank's recent policy. Last week, Miran was the sole dissenting vote, favoring a half-point cut instead of the quarter-point reduction the Fed implemented. He argues that rates should be below 3% by the end of the year and dismisses concerns that tariffs are fueling inflation, a view that contrasts with that of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Miran, who is also serving on Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, has pledged to be a dissenting voice on the board.</p>

Silva stated that it is not fair to play one of the season's most important games with such a significant disadvantage in rest time. His comments echo previous complaints from manager Pep Guardiola, who has argued that English teams are often put at a disadvantage in Europe due to demanding schedules.</p>

However, experts note that predicting foliage is not an exact science, as timing and vibrancy are influenced by local temperature, rainfall, and elevation. Climate change is generally causing peak colors to occur later than in the past, but conditions from the preceding spring and summer also play a significant role each year.</p>

This has led to confusion and concern among pediatricians, who worry that families are making health decisions based on politics.
