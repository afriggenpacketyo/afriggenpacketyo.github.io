          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin laying off approximately 1,800 domestic employees following a Supreme Court decision that permits the Trump administration's plan to downsize the federal workforce. This "reduction in force" is part of a broader reorganization effort initiated by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline operations by merging or eliminating over 300 bureaus and offices. Deputy Secretary Michael Rigas confirmed in an email that affected staff would be notified soon, thanking them for their service. The move aims to create a more results-driven diplomatic corps, with terminations expected to commence imminently.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Malaysia during the ASEAN summit, marking a significant high-level engagement between the two nations. The talks occur amidst heightened tensions over issues including trade tariffs, Taiwan's sovereignty, and China's support for Russia in its war against Ukraine. Wang has called for a "fairer" international order, criticizing U.S. protectionism, while Rubio intends to raise concerns about China's role in the Ukraine conflict.

          <h2>Trump Administration Threatens to Impose 35% Tariffs on Canadian Goods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 22:22:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, set to take effect on August 1st, escalating trade tensions with a major U.S. partner. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's alleged failure to stop drug trafficking and its retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the new duties. This move follows similar threats to over 20 other countries and a previously established 10% baseline tariff on all nations. Economists warn such tariffs could lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth, though the administration maintains they are necessary to correct trade imbalances.

          <p>Analysts are closely watching for the release of China's first-half economic performance data to determine if more fiscal stimulus is required to counter pressures from U.S. trade policies. While second-quarter growth is expected to meet the 5% target, concerns remain about underlying weakness in domestic demand and employment. Economists suggest that significant external challenges, particularly from shifting U.S. tariffs, necessitate stronger government support to ensure the full-year growth target is met. Central bank adviser Huang Yiping has also indicated support for proactive fiscal policy to mitigate any potential downturn caused by external uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

While younger travelers were more affected by news of tariffs and border policies, they still showed more overall interest in visiting. However, sentiment varies by country, with travelers from Vietnam and the Philippines showing increased interest, possibly due to large diaspora populations, while a majority of Singaporeans are less interested in U.S. travel.</p>

While new aluminum sails were installed before the Paris Olympics, delays in acquiring a new electric motor kept them motionless until now, marking the full restoration of a beloved Parisian landmark.</p>

          <p>South Korean singer Taeil, formerly of the K-Pop group NCT, has been sentenced to three and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to the sexual assault of an intoxicated woman. The Seoul Central District Court delivered the sentence to the 31-year-old musician, born Moon Tae-il, and two other men who also participated in the 2024 assault. The victim, a foreign tourist, was reportedly heavily intoxicated when the men took her to a private home and assaulted her. Taeil was removed from his group in August 2024 after the allegations first surfaced.</p>

In his book, he identifies eight key words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—that serve as "emotional shortcuts" resonating with voters across different cultures and political leanings. While not a guarantee of success, these words act as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging. The article also notes the trend towards highly targeted, AI-crafted messages, which may eventually replace traditional, broad-appeal slogans in political campaigning.</p>

          <p>Irvine Welsh, author of the cult novel "Trainspotting," is releasing a new sequel titled "Men in Love," which explores the characters' lives immediately after the first book's conclusion. In an interview, Welsh reflects on the social decay that inspired his original work and expresses concern about the present, stating that the internet and AI are creating a "post-culture society" of "dumbed down machines." He argues that modern society has become a "precariat," where economic insecurity affects all classes. Welsh's new novel aims to focus on love as an antidote to the hate and poison he sees in the world today.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, where over 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed, through the story of a survivor who now lives in Australia. The author, Ed Husic, highlights the painful cycle of witnessing atrocities, followed by international inaction, eventual legal recognition of genocide, and the oft-repeated declaration of "never again." The article draws a direct parallel between the suffering in past genocides in places like Rwanda and Srebrenica and the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It poses the question of how much longer the world will wait before applying the "never again" declaration to the situation facing Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Tesla is seeking to expand its Robotaxi service to Phoenix, Arizona, applying for permits to test and deploy its autonomous vehicles in the area. This move follows competitor Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in Phoenix since 2020. Tesla recently began a pilot program for its Robotaxis in Austin, Texas, using human-supervised vehicles, but has faced some issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on social media. The expansion into a new market represents a key step in Tesla's effort to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, even as it faces regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an extraordinary year for weather, with its warmest spring on record and a third heatwave already underway in July, raising questions about the role of climate change. Scientists confirm that human-influenced global warming of over 1.3°C has dramatically increased the likelihood and intensity of such extreme weather events. While many compare the heat to the summer of 1976, analysis shows that event was an isolated anomaly in a cooler decade, whereas today's heatwaves are more frequent and widespread. Projections indicate that hot spells will become an even more regular feature of UK summers, particularly in the southeast.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a surge in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This boom is attributed to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning, often delaying childbirth due to social and financial pressures. Consequently, many turn to treatments like IVF when they are older and ready to start families. While the government has increased subsidies for these treatments, the high costs and workplace pressures remain significant barriers for many couples, highlighting a persistent desire for children that is difficult to fulfill.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a rate that outpaces the general trend of global warming. The findings indicate that heat waves are not only getting hotter but also lasting longer, with the most extreme and rarest heat events showing the greatest increase in frequency. This acceleration means that even small increments of global warming will have a disproportionately large impact on the risk of prolonged and dangerous heat. The study underscores the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies to protect people, agriculture, and infrastructure from the growing threat of extreme heat.</p>

UNAIDS estimates that without this funding, there could be an additional six million new infections and four million AIDS-related deaths in the next four years.
