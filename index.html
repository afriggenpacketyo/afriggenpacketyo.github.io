        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Brazilian court has imposed new restrictions on former President Jair Bolsonaro, including an ankle monitor and a nighttime curfew, amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup. The judge cited concerns that Bolsonaro might flee the country or obstruct justice, also banning him from social media and communication with his son and foreign diplomats. Bolsonaro's lawyers expressed outrage at the decision, which the former president called a "supreme humiliation," while he maintains his innocence. The case has also drawn international attention, with the U.S. government revoking visas for involved judicial officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is on high alert for dangerous flash floods, with the Met Office issuing an amber weather warning for parts of the country, including London. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, creating a high risk of deep, fast-flowing floodwaters that could disrupt transport and cause power outages. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground parched and less able to absorb the intense rainfall, exacerbating the flood risk. Authorities have warned that homes and businesses are likely to be flooded quickly.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the complete elimination of its Office of Research and Development (ORD), a move expected to impact over 1,500 scientists and researchers. The agency stated the closure would result in nearly $750 million in savings and is part of a broader reorganization to streamline its mission. Critics, including a former EPA official, argue the decision dismantles a world-renowned research organization and leaves the public more vulnerable to pollution. Employees reportedly learned of the mass layoff through a public press release, creating widespread anxiety and uncertainty about their futures.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East L.A. has resulted in the deaths of three deputies. The deputies, identified as members of the elite Arson Explosives Detail, were reportedly working to render safe a grenade that had been recovered from a separate location the previous day. Sheriff Robert Luna described the incident as the department's largest loss of life since 1857, calling the deceased deputies fantastic experts with a combined 74 years of service. Federal agencies, including the ATF and FBI, are assisting in the ongoing investigation into the tragic blast.</p>

          <p>China's disciplinary authorities are highlighting a failed tourism project in Guilin as a prime example of wasteful grass-roots government mismanagement. The "Yaohan Longevity City" was intended to be a major health tourism hub but was left largely abandoned after its capital chain broke due to poor decisions by local officials. The project, which saw only a fraction of its planned 1.65 billion yuan investment utilized, is now being used as a cautionary tale for cadres nationwide. The official primarily responsible for the debacle was expelled from the Communist Party after being found guilty of misappropriating funds.</p>

          <p>Scientists at China's Army Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic weapon design, dubbed a super 'X-railgun,' intended to be significantly more powerful than the navy's existing model. The current naval railgun, a global first when mounted on a ship in 2018, is limited by the immense power required, which restricts projectile weight. The army's proposed solution involves cross-stacking two railguns, a design they claim could nearly double the force. This would allow it to fire heavier projectiles of up to 30kg at speeds of Mach 7, potentially overcoming current limitations and enhancing its military application.</p>

A cross-party committee of MPs described the situation as "woeful" and criticized regulators for being "missing in action" in holding the industry accountable.

Auditors also found that when inspections did occur, documentation was often poor, and fines were sometimes improperly reduced.

          <p>In a recent interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed the agency plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants in the U.S. illegally. He stated this intelligence is used to find individuals with deportation orders or criminal histories, particularly those who disappeared after entering the country. Lyons also addressed the controversial practice of ICE agents wearing masks during arrests, stating that while he is not a proponent, he will continue to allow it. He cited a more than 800% increase in attacks against ICE officials as a primary reason for permitting the practice for agent safety.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement that it will be added to the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace the oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often boosts a company's stock price, as index funds must purchase shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite a 14% decline in its stock value this year amid a challenging macroeconomic outlook, Block's market capitalization of around $45 billion places it well above the median for the index.

          <p>Supporters of President Trump are rallying to his defense following a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter he sent to Jeffrey Epstein, a shift from their recent criticism over the administration's handling of Epstein files. The controversy, combined with Trump's subsequent lawsuit against the paper and his call to release grand jury testimony, appears to have unified his base against a common media target. Influential MAGA voices who had been critical are now praising the president's actions, framing the push for document release as a victory. This has temporarily cooled internal backlash and redirected supporter anger towards the media.</p>

According to the provision, the fee is intended to be reimbursable if visitors comply with the terms of their visa, such as not overstaying.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's diagnosis with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), medical experts have clarified that it is a common and often benign condition, especially in older adults. The White House physician reported the diagnosis after the president noted mild swelling in his lower legs, confirming it with ultrasound tests. CVI occurs when vein valves weaken, causing blood to pool in the legs, leading to swelling and aching. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise. Doctors emphasized that in Trump's case, the condition appears mild and manageable, with no signs of more serious cardiovascular issues.</p>

          <p>A Nashville judge has ordered Tennessee prison officials to deactivate an inmate's implanted heart-regulating device moments before his scheduled execution. The ruling addresses concerns from attorneys for death-row inmate Byron Black, who argued the device could repeatedly shock him as the lethal injection drug stops his heart, causing extreme pain. The order requires a certified medical professional to be on hand to disable the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator just before the execution proceeds. State attorneys had argued this was unlikely and that the inmate would be unconscious, but the judge's decision aims to prevent a potentially torturous outcome.</p>

          <p>At the direction of President Trump, the U.S. Department of Justice has formally requested a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. This move aims to quell a growing political firestorm over the administration's handling of the case, particularly after it previously stated no more files would be released. The request came shortly after a Wall Street Journal report on an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which the president has denied and sued over. A judge must approve the release, which would likely involve a lengthy process of redacting sensitive victim information.</p>

Critics note that topical, nightly shows struggle to find a long-term audience on catch-up services.

While scientific data is pending, anecdotal evidence suggests an increase in callouts for large nests appearing early in the season. Although often disliked, experts emphasize the crucial ecological role of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers. While many insect populations are in decline globally, the common wasp seems to be bucking the trend, remaining stable in the UK over the last century.</p>

President Trump's past promises to release Epstein files have fueled these beliefs, creating a difficult situation where the administration's actions are closely scrutinized by a base eager for revelations that confirm their worldview.</p>

          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, 'The Legend of Rooney's Ring,' reimagines the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy epic inspired by 'The Lord of the Rings.' Written by a co-creator of the sitcom 'Motherland,' the comedy is a tongue-in-cheek homage that avoids targeting the couple, instead using their public story as a basis for a silly, medieval caper. The plot is loosely based on a tabloid myth about Coleen throwing her engagement ring away. The play is characteristic of the local-focused, crowd-pleasing comedies produced by Liverpool's Royal Court theatre.</p>
