          <p>Former KISS lead guitarist Ace Frehley has passed away at 74 after sustaining injuries from a fall last month, his family confirmed in a statement to Variety. They expressed profound devastation, cherishing his memories, laughter, and kindness, noting the epic magnitude of his passing. Frehley had been on life support due to a brain bleed, forcing him to cancel tour dates and postpone work on his next album. As a founding member of KISS from 1973-1982, he later embarked on a successful solo career with Frehley's Comet before rejoining the group in 1996 and departing again in 2002, leaving an indelible mark on rock music.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's suggestion that President Trump deploy federal troops to San Francisco has led to prominent startup investor Ron Conway resigning from the Salesforce Foundation board. Conway, a long-time Democratic donor and supporter of Kamala Harris, cited misaligned values in his departure, as first reported by The New York Times. Benioff later attempted to walk back his comments, stating city and state leaders are primarily responsible for safety, but his initial remarks were amplified by figures like Elon Musk. California Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco leaders have publicly rejected the idea of federal troops in the city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, which the Chamber deems unlawful. The organization argues this fee will inflict "significant harm" on American businesses, particularly startups and small to mid-sized companies, by sharply increasing labor costs and restricting their ability to hire skilled foreign talent. The administration, however, defends the fee as a necessary initial step to reform the H-1B program and prioritize American workers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for protein powders is soaring, driven by influencers and a growing consumer focus on protein intake, yet dietitians advise caution, emphasizing whole foods over supplements. While protein is an essential nutrient for various bodily functions, current wellness culture often overestimates individual needs. Consumer Reports found some protein powders contain unsafe lead levels, raising health concerns. Dietitians recommend limiting powder intake to occasional use, as whole foods offer more comprehensive nutrients and sustained fullness, and most adults can meet their protein needs through diet alone.</p>

          <p>This article critically examines Apple's "Live Translation" feature in AirPods, finding it struggles significantly in real-world, noisy environments. The author experienced issues with ambient sound interference, lagging translations, and inaccuracies, particularly with Mexican Spanish vocabulary like "rajas" and "cempasúchil." Despite Apple's promotional claims of "transformational" communication, the feature's limitations, including its optimization for Spain's Spanish and the cumbersome user interface, fall short of a seamless translation experience. The article argues that language encompasses more than just words, including culture and gestures, which the technology fails to capture effectively.</p>

          <p>A report by former US intelligence and national security officials, "Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics: Assessment of Democratic Decline," warns that the U.S. is on a trajectory toward "competitive authoritarianism." Applying intelligence analysis methods, the assessment concludes with "moderate to high confidence" that democratic backsliding is accelerating under the Trump administration, visible in executive overreach, politicization of civil service, and erosion of judicial independence. The article emphasizes the urgency for organized resistance by institutions, civil society, and the public to prevent further consolidation of executive power and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Henry Dwight Sedgwick's 1904 short story, "The American Coup d’Etat of 1961," which envisioned a future America grappling with unchecked presidential power, economic collapse, and political chaos. Sedgwick's fable, written as a critique of early 20th-century expansionism and materialism, depicts a nation where democratic institutions are undermined, and a new order emerges as corrupt as the old. The article draws parallels to contemporary concerns about democratic fragility and executive overreach, serving as a stark commentary on the potential trajectory of American society and governance.</p>

The proposed arch, inspired by Paris's Arc de Triomphe, is envisioned to welcome people into the nation's capital.
