          <p>Alaska is undertaking a historic airlift to evacuate hundreds from coastal villages severely impacted by flooding and high winds from Typhoon Halong's remnants. The storm caused record water levels, washing away homes and leaving two people missing, with makeshift shelters housing 1,500. The remote location poses significant challenges for resource deployment and damage assessment, with some homes becoming uninhabitable as winter approaches. This disaster highlights past cuts to grants for storm preparedness in Indigenous villages, intensifying the long-term recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Virginia Democratic Attorney General candidate Jay Jones faced intense questioning from his GOP opponent, Jason Miyares, regarding a reckless driving conviction and past violent rhetoric. Miyares accused Jones of driving 116 mph and attempting to skirt community service by performing it for a PAC he controlled. Jones also faced scrutiny for 2022 text messages fantasizing about violence against a Republican rival and his children. Jones maintained he has taken accountability for his mistakes and is focused on holding Donald Trump accountable.</p>

          <p>Sol Bashirian, owner of Sunday Gravy, an Italian restaurant in Inglewood, California, is struggling to stay afloat due to rising tariffs and inflation. Despite a 30% sales increase, the business is "barely breaking even" as imported ingredient costs soar by thousands monthly. Financial analysts note that eateries serving lower- and middle-income consumers are particularly affected by broad cost pressures. The restaurant has added a 5% surcharge to offset tariffs, highlighting the industry's dilemma between maintaining profit margins and risking customer loss from price hikes.

          <p>Venezuelan fishermen, like Wilder Fernández, are living in fear following US military strikes on suspected drug-carrying boats in the Caribbean. These operations, part of a US effort against alleged "narco-terrorists" linked to the Maduro government, have killed at least 27 people, raising concerns about civilian casualties and international law. Fishermen worry about being caught in the crossfire, with some considering illicit activities due to economic downturns and increased risks. Venezuela has denounced the actions at the UN, while the US stresses national security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted its sixth known strike on a suspected drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean Sea, with officials confirming survivors for the first time. This operation is part of the Trump administration's broader military buildup and pressure campaign against Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, whom the U.S. accuses of cartel ties. Previous strikes have resulted in at least 27 deaths, sparking domestic and international pushback regarding congressional authority and evidence for the alleged drug trafficking. The administration justifies the actions as self-defense in a "non-international armed conflict" with cartels.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that recent bank loan worries, including bankruptcies and disclosed losses, will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner. He argues that credit losses are a definitive sign of an economic downturn, motivating the Fed to act swiftly without excessive concern for inflation. While market averages dipped due to regional bank fears, Cramer believes the pain will be contained to banks, not hurting broader market profits. Lower borrowing rates, he notes, would also help prevent defaults. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defense attorney for Jonathan Rinderknecht, charged with igniting the deadly Palisades fire, claims the evidence is thin and accuses authorities of scapegoating his client. Rinderknecht faces up to 45 years for allegedly starting the Lachman fire, which later rekindled into the massive Palisades blaze that killed 12 people and scorched 23,400 acres. His lawyer argues there's no factual link between the initial small fire and the later destructive wildfire, citing a six-day gap and multiple variables. Prosecutors, however, cite witness statements, video, and phone data, and an AI-generated image of a burning city found on Rinderknecht's phone.</p>

          <p>McLaren Formula 1 driver Lando Norris acknowledged he will face "consequences" for his first-lap collision with teammate Oscar Piastri at the Singapore Grand Prix. The incident, where Norris ran into Max Verstappen's car and then Piastri, damaged his front wing, though he still finished third, with Piastri fourth. Norris took responsibility, stating the team's rule is to avoid crashing with each other, even in minor incidents. Red Bull's Max Verstappen jokingly suggested McLaren favors Norris, but later clarified it was a joke. Piastri confirmed no favoritism exists within the team.</p>
