          <p>Amidst President Trump's considerations of potential U.S. strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, law enforcement agencies have heightened surveillance on Iran-backed operatives within the United States. The FBI has intensified efforts to monitor possible domestic sleeper cells linked to Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization supported by Iran, particularly following Israel's Operation Rising Lion. This heightened vigilance stems from long-standing concerns among current and former administration officials regarding Iran's capacity to instigate attacks within the U.S., a concern that has grown since the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani. Trump is expected to make a decision on potential strikes against Iran within the next two weeks, citing the possibility of negotiations. </p>

          <p>European officials and experts are debating solutions to address China's global non-market overcapacity, fearing its impact on European industries. Concerns stem from decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, weak domestic consumption, and trade wars, potentially leading to a flood of discounted Chinese goods into Europe. Governments worry that this could decimate industries, cause job losses, and empower populist parties in manufacturing regions. The EU insists Beijing should address these issues to avoid a similar anti-China backlash as seen in the United States. </p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the Starbase facility in Texas, potentially triggered by a ruptured nitrogen tank, according to Elon Musk. The explosion occurred during the final stages of a countdown for a planned engine test firing, creating a large fireball and scattering debris.

          <p>This article discusses the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal, which restricted Iran’s nuclear enrichment program in exchange for sanctions relief. The agreement was signed in 2015 by Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany, and the EU. In 2018, President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the JCPOA and reimposed economic sanctions on Iran, arguing the deal was defective. Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time for producing a nuclear weapon, and recent conflicts between Israel and Iran have further complicated the situation. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, arguing that the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully coercing them into adhering to Trump's immigration policies. The states contended that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress for transportation projects. This ruling follows several executive orders aimed at cutting off federal funding to sanctuary jurisdictions. </p>

The government defends the reforms as necessary to fix a broken welfare system and ensure support for those with the most severe disabilities. The proposed bill tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, sparking concern among Labour MPs. </p>

          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution. Researchers found that local and state plastic bag policies enacted from 2016 to 2023 reduced plastic bag litter collected during shoreline cleanups by up to 47%. Fee-based policies were found to be more effective than partial bans. California's experience with plastic bag regulations highlights the importance of well-designed policies with fewer loopholes. </p>

The movie has a dull central plot, but it is beefed up by unusual ambition, quirky side characters and maniacal editing. The film shifts alliances without taking sides, and it is a comment on human progress. The reviewer states that it is a given that humans will eventually, stubbornly, relentlessly find a way to tear other humans to pieces, as we do in every movie, and just as we’ve done since the first homo sapien went after his rival with a stick. </p>

The MOP is designed to attack deeply buried facilities, and the B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft in the Air Force equipped to carry it due to its weight.
