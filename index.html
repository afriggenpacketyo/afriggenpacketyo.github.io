          <p>Han Duck-soo, the acting president of South Korea, has resigned, fueling speculation of a presidential bid. Local media reports suggest Han will launch his campaign imminently, positioning himself as a potential conservative leader amidst turmoil within the People Power Party following Yoon Suk Yeol's imposition of martial law. The Supreme Court's decision to overturn Lee Jae-myung's acquittal on election law violation charges further complicates the political landscape, casting doubt on Lee's eligibility to run. Han's tenure as acting president was marked by clashes with the opposition over judicial appointments and bills targeting Yoon and his wife.</p>

          <p>Tesla has refuted a Wall Street Journal report that its board contacted headhunters to find a replacement for CEO Elon Musk. Tesla's chair, Robyn Denholm, stated the report was "absolutely false" and affirmed the board's confidence in Musk's leadership. The denial follows concerns about Tesla's declining profits and criticism of Musk's involvement in President Trump's administration. Musk himself denounced the report as a breach of ethics.

          <p>China has enacted a new private sector law aimed at curbing "profit-driven" enforcement that unfairly targets non-state businesses.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has maintained its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, influenced by concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on Japan's economic outlook. While inflation has remained above the BOJ's 2% target for 36 months, allowing for potential rate increases, the central bank is wary of the trade tensions. The BOJ will continue to raise rates if economic and price forecasts are realized, but cautioned that drastic tariff changes would affect its monetary policy outlook. The bank expects growth to moderate due to a slowdown in other economies and a decline in domestic corporate profits.</p>

India accuses Pakistan of supporting the militants behind the attack, which Islamabad denies.

          <h2>China Lifts Sanctions on MEPs in Apparent EU 'Charm Offensive'</h2>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on several Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is perceived as an effort to improve relations with the EU amid global uncertainties caused by President Trump's tariffs. The sanctions, initially imposed in 2021, had strained EU-China relations and halted a trade and investment deal. The move is expected to facilitate trade discussions between the EU and China, though significant constraints remain due to Beijing's ties to Moscow. Despite this gesture, the EU plans to maintain its sanctions related to human rights concerns in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Mackenzie Eaglen and Brady Africk argue that the U.S. military, despite possessing advanced equipment, lacks sufficient personnel and materiel to fight a major war. They point to conflicts in Ukraine, Israel, and Yemen as examples highlighting the demands of modern warfare. The authors advocate for increased investment in active service members, ammunition, new ships, and aircraft, cautioning against prioritizing small quantities of expensive weapons over adequate firepower for sustained conflict. The U.S. is also short on advanced munitions, such as precision-guided missiles.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal, granting Washington preferential access to Kyiv's natural resources in exchange for the establishment of a reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, pursued by President Trump, aims to facilitate Ukraine's economic recovery and contribute to ending the conflict with Russia. The deal involves joint development and monetization of Ukraine's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas, and other natural resources, effectively acting as compensation for U.S. aid to Ukraine during the war.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing an additional indictment for abuse of authority, adding to his ongoing trial for insurrection. The new charge was announced after investigators raided Yoon's residence as part of a probe into bribery allegations involving his wife. Yoon was previously charged as the "ringleader of an insurrection" related to his declaration of martial law. With Yoon out of office, South Korea is preparing for a snap election on June 3.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has revised down its economic and inflation projections for the current fiscal year, citing concerns over the potential impact of U.S. tariffs. The central bank expects a decline in domestic corporate profits due to trade frictions and a slowdown in overseas economies. While maintaining its benchmark interest rate, the BOJ remains committed to raising rates further if the economy and prices align with its expectations. The bank now anticipates achieving its 2% inflation goal in the latter half of the three years through March 2028.</p>
