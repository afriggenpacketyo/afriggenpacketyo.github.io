          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life in an attack officials called a "violent, despicable act." The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Shane Tamura, reportedly traveled from Las Vegas and used a high-powered rifle. Investigators discovered a note where Tamura seemed to blame the National Football League, which has offices in the building, for a traumatic head injury and the brain disease CTE. The incident has prompted renewed calls from New York officials for stricter national gun control legislation to prevent such tragedies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a widely circulated video of a violent brawl in downtown Cincinnati, Republican congressional members from Ohio are blaming Democratic policies for what they describe as growing "fear and chaos" in major cities. Rep. Michael Rulli and Sen. Bernie Moreno pointed to issues like sanctuary city policies and reduced police funding as contributing factors, with Moreno calling for the Cincinnati mayor's resignation. The incident, which resulted in five arrests, involved a mob attacking a man and a woman. The specific cause of the fight remains unclear, but the event has fueled political debate over urban safety and governance.</p>

          <p>In a rare display of public intraparty conflict, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey sharply criticized his Democratic colleagues on the Senate floor over a bipartisan policing package. Booker accused them of being "complicit" in President Trump's agenda by allowing the administration to politicize federal grants and withhold funds from certain law enforcement agencies. The heated exchange occurred after he objected to passing the legislation without an amendment to ensure fair resource distribution. The confrontation highlights the ongoing struggle within the Democratic party to form a unified strategy against the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Starbucks reported its sixth straight quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2%, which was steeper than analysts had anticipated. Despite the results, CEO Brian Niccol stated that the company's turnaround plan is ahead of schedule, pointing to improvements in the U.S. market and a return to growth in China. The company is focusing on enhancing customer service, renovating cafes, and plans to introduce new products like protein cold foam and a refreshed rewards program. Executives remain conservative about the next quarter's outlook, citing an uncertain consumer environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public health experts are exploring a potential link between extreme heat and a spike in drug overdose deaths, noting that July is historically the deadliest month for overdoses in Los Angeles County. Researchers suggest that substances like opioids can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature, while sedating effects prevent users from seeking shelter from heat. This article highlights a systemic issue where medical examiners may undercount heat-related fatalities, often not listing heat as a contributing factor in deaths also involving drugs. This lack of consistent data hinders the development of effective public health responses to the dual threats of extreme heat and substance use.</p>

The recent China-EU summit yielded minimal gains for Europe, signaling that China no longer sees the bloc as a serious partner requiring significant concessions.

          <p>President Trump has signed a new executive order aimed at changing the nation's approach to homelessness, which has advocates worried about its potential consequences.

The administration argues that previous strategies have failed to address the root causes of homelessness despite significant federal spending.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority has settled a lawsuit that threatened to delay plans for updating its subway car fleet ahead of the 2028 Olympics. Advocacy group Jobs to Move America had sued Metro, alleging its contract with Hyundai Rotem violated laws by not ensuring fair worker pay and hiring from disadvantaged communities. As part of the $250,000 settlement, Metro agreed to modify the $730-million contract to include these requirements. The deal allows the transit agency to move forward with acquiring the new rail cars, with the first batch still expected to arrive before the Games.</p>

          <p>This article profiles 24-year-old singer-songwriter Niko Rubio, whose new EP "Ring Ring" captures her experience growing up as a first-generation Mexican and Salvadoran American in Southern California. After starting her career in alt-rock, Rubio made a conscious decision to create music that blends the English and Spanish sounds of her upbringing, from traditional Mexican boleros to California beach rock. The release of her EP was postponed in response to recent immigration raids, with Rubio donating a portion of her merchandise sales to an immigrant rights group. She emphasizes the importance of proudly expressing her heritage through her art.</p>

          <p>The family of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy from South Carolina who recently died from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, is urging public awareness to prevent similar tragedies. The infection typically occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose during activities like swimming. His parents stated that had they known about the risk of swimming in the lake, they would not have allowed it, and they do not want their son's death to be in vain. This was the first known case in the state since 2016, prompting health officials to reiterate safety precautions for freshwater recreation.</p>

          <p>High-level trade talks between the U.S. and China in Stockholm have ended without an agreement to extend a tariff pause set to expire on August 12. U.S. officials stated that any extension requires final approval from President Trump, who will be briefed on the negotiations. If the deadline passes without a deal, tariffs on Chinese goods could "boomerang" back to higher levels. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the meetings as constructive but also suggested it would not be "the end of the world" if the higher tariffs were reinstated for a short period while negotiations continue.

          <p>The recent deadly shooting at the NFL's Manhattan headquarters has refocused attention on the league's long and controversial history with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The gunman left a note blaming football for giving him the incurable brain disease, asking for his brain to be studied. This article provides context on CTE, a degenerative disease linked to repeated head trauma that can only be diagnosed posthumously. It recounts the stories of former players like Mike Webster and Junior Seau, whose deaths exposed the illness, and the NFL's years of denial before finally acknowledging the link between football and CTE in 2016.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency under the Trump administration is taking steps to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, a cornerstone of climate regulation that classifies greenhouse gases as a threat to public health. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as driving "a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion" and potentially the largest deregulatory action in U.S. history. This finding provides the legal basis for the Clean Air Act to regulate emissions from vehicles and power plants. Repealing it would dismantle the foundation of federal climate policy as part of the administration's broader effort to expand fossil fuel production.</p>

          <p>An analysis by financial experts suggests President Trump's threatened tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have a varied impact across the industry. Companies like Novartis and Roche, with larger manufacturing footprints abroad, appear more at risk, while firms such as AbbVie and Eli Lilly are seen as better positioned due to their significant U.S. operations. The article notes that while drugmakers could raise prices to offset the costs, doing so might be politically untenable given existing concerns about drug affordability. The potential levies are part of a broader push to reshore manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

The cuts will primarily affect U.S.-based research and development teams as Recruit Holdings moves to integrate Glassdoor's operations into Indeed.

          <p>President Trump provided a new explanation for his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein, stating it was because Epstein repeatedly hired young female employees away from the spa at his Mar-a-Lago club. This article covers Trump's comments, made aboard Air Force One, which aimed to distance himself from the convicted sex offender. The report also notes that Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice, has demanded immunity or a presidential pardon in exchange for her testimony before a House committee investigating the case.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has concluded that UCLA violated the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students by showing "deliberate indifference" to harassment they faced during a pro-Palestinian encampment in the spring of 2024. In a letter, the DOJ faulted the university for an inadequate response to complaints and for failing to remove the encampment, which created a hostile environment. The Trump administration has given UCLA until August 5 to enter a voluntary settlement or face a federal lawsuit. This finding is the first major conclusion from a series of federal investigations into alleged antisemitism on UC campuses.</p>
