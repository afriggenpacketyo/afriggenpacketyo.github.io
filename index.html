          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous employees across various industries have been fired or placed on leave for their public remarks regarding his death or political views. Legal experts confirm private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for comments harming reputation or disrupting business, especially on sensitive topics. Cases include a sports reporter, a political pundit, and a Secret Service agent, highlighting the limited First Amendment protections for private sector workers in most states. The incidents underscore the intense debate surrounding political violence and free speech in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a "framework" deal between the U.S. and China concerning TikTok, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize the terms soon. This agreement, primarily between private parties, aims to shift TikTok towards U.S.-controlled ownership. The development comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. business or risk a shutdown, following legislative actions and national security concerns. The deal may require a deadline extension, but ongoing extensions are not anticipated.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated he would not have appointed Peter Mandelson as U.S. ambassador if he had known the full extent of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This admission followed Lord Mandelson's sacking after leaked emails revealed supportive messages to Epstein post-conviction, including advice to "fight for early release." Sir Keir emphasized that these messages contradicted his stance on violence against women and girls. The scandal has raised questions about the Prime Minister's judgment and caused frustration within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his demand that European nations, especially NATO members, cease all energy purchases from Russia before he implements new U.S. sanctions. He criticized Europe for not doing enough to counter Russia, despite recent EU sanctions. Trump indicated he would impose major sanctions only if allies reciprocate by stopping Russian energy imports, including LNG. This stance highlights a divergence in approach between the U.S. and some European nations regarding sanctions against Moscow.</p>

          <p>USA's Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from his semi-final at the world championships for "jostling." Hocker, boxed in on the inside, made contact with Germany's Robert Farken while trying to break through, ultimately finishing second before his disqualification. World Athletics regulations define jostling as physical contact that grants an unfair advantage or causes harm. The U.S. team's appeal was rejected, ending Hocker's championship bid despite his strong performance.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested U.S. companies should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, pending SEC approval. He argued this change would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term company operations, drawing a comparison to China's longer-term view. While some financial figures like Warren Buffett have advocated against quarterly guidance, current regulations mandate quarterly reports. Experts are divided, with supporters emphasizing transparency for investors, while critics believe it fosters short-termism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative MP Danny Kruger has defected to Reform UK, becoming the first sitting Tory MP to do so, and declared the Conservative Party "over."
