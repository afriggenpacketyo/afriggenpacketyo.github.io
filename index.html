          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 00:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for violating a court-ordered social media ban. The warning came after allies circulated a video of a speech he gave, which the judge deemed an intentional breach of the restrictions. These measures, which also include an ankle monitor, were imposed due to allegations that Bolsonaro plotted a coup to overturn the 2022 election results. The incident has ignited a debate in Brazil over whether such bans should extend to media interviews shared by third parties.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Trump's Preference for Tariffs Over Traditional Sanctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 00:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines President Donald Trump's use of tariffs as a primary tool for foreign policy, contrasting them with traditional sanctions. Tariffs, which are taxes on imports, are seen by the administration as more flexible and faster to deploy than sanctions, which often require international cooperation. The policy has created global market uncertainty but has also significantly increased US tariff revenue. Critics worry this approach blurs the lines between economic and punitive measures, potentially destabilizing global trade and peace. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In recent interviews, Hunter Biden has launched sharp criticisms against figures within the Democratic Party, media personalities like CNN's Jake Tapper, and actor George Clooney. He accused Democrats of being disloyal to his father, leading to the 2024 election loss, and dismissed Clooney's political influence. Biden also addressed personal controversies, reaffirming his sobriety and denying involvement in a White House cocaine incident. His confrontational tone marks a departure from typical Democratic discourse, adopting a more aggressive, grievance-focused political style.</p>

          <p>A writer from the Balkans reflects on the expectations of the Western literary market, arguing that publishers often seek stories that conform to stereotypes of the region as a place of historical trauma and conflict. She recounts being advised by a US publisher to write about themes specific to her culture's "problematic" or "traumatic" history. The author contends that this limits Balkan writers, who are expected to self-exoticize rather than explore universal themes without a regional, tragic lens. She calls for a broader appreciation of the diverse narratives emerging from the region.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Gansu province are investigating 10 local officials following a lead poisoning scandal at a kindergarten in Tianshui. The investigation revealed that a local hospital and the provincial disease control center had falsified test results related to the incident. This cover-up has raised serious questions about local governance and the integrity of public information channels in the country. The slow official response and data falsification highlight a systemic issue where officials may prioritize avoiding responsibility over public health and safety.</p>

          <p>North Korea has publicly announced its intention to build a third 5,000-ton naval destroyer, setting a completion deadline of October 2026. This move is part of leader Kim Jong Un's broader plan to significantly develop the country's naval power and defend its maritime sovereignty. The announcement follows the launch of its first destroyer of this class in April and the capsizing and subsequent repair of a second ship in May. This naval expansion occurs as South Korea's new president adopts a more conciliatory stance toward the North.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing major changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected around 30,000 people in the 1970s-90s. The revisions come after a critical report from the public inquiry chair, who called the original payment process "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. The government has allocated an additional £1 billion for these changes, aiming to restore trust with victims who have been repeatedly let down.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysis from property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of renting a home in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. The sharp increase is attributed to high tenant demand coupled with an insufficient supply of available rental properties. This financial pressure has forced some renters to turn down job opportunities or move to more affordable areas, with many young adults relying on parental support. While the rate of increase is now slowing, particularly in major cities, rents in more affordable areas continue to rise sharply. (not investment advice)</p>

This ambiguity has led to widespread media speculation about pilot error or intent, which Indian and US investigators have called "premature" and "irresponsible."

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight approaching Minot, North Dakota, had to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft on a converging course. In a calm announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar, had not warned him about the bomber. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the state fair. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, which highlights a serious breakdown in communication between military and civilian air traffic control, narrowly avoiding a potential disaster.</p>

          <p>Following the death of his "Cosby Show" co-star Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Bill Cosby shared his memories of the actor who played his on-screen son, Theo Huxtable. In an interview, Cosby described Warner as an ultimate professional who was always prepared and a "great studier." He revealed that the two had maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after the show ended, with Warner calling him regularly. The role of Theo was loosely based on Cosby's own son, Ennis, who passed away in 1997, adding another layer to their connection.</p>

          <p>A police standoff in San Diego's Rolando neighborhood concluded with the arrest of a woman who had barricaded herself inside a van. The incident began after reports that the woman had assaulted someone with a glass object. Dozens of San Diego Police officers surrounded the vehicle on El Cajon Boulevard for over an hour, repeatedly calling for her to surrender. Officers eventually used gas before moving in to make the arrest, also taking a dog from the van. The situation caused significant traffic disruptions in the area.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's universal tariffs, while widely criticized, may have a "silver lining" by forcing other countries to address their own protectionist policies. The author suggests that nations like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing internal trade barriers that hinder their own economic growth. The pressure from US tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movement toward removing these domestic barriers in Canada and China. The piece posits that the economic pain of tariffs exposes the hypocrisy and self-defeating nature of these internal restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annie Farmer, a key witness in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial and one of Jeffrey Epstein's earliest accusers, is urging the government to release information related to the case. In an interview, she expressed exhaustion with the politicization of the case and stated that if there is "nothing to hide," the files should be made public. Farmer voiced skepticism about the Trump administration's handling of the files and concern over the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey. She was also motivated to speak out against calls to pardon Maxwell and by the recent death of fellow accuser Virginia Giuffre.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has removed a Wall Street Journal reporter from the press pool for an upcoming presidential trip to Scotland. This action is seen as retaliation for a recent article by the newspaper alleging Trump sent a suggestive birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, a report that prompted Trump to file a $10 billion lawsuit. The White House press secretary cited the Journal's "fake and defamatory conduct" as the reason for the exclusion. The White House Correspondents' Association condemned the move as a troubling attempt to punish a media outlet for its coverage.</p>

          <p>Texas officials have accounted for the vast majority of over 160 people who were reported missing after the devastating July Fourth floods along the Guadalupe River. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, mostly in Kerr County. Officials stated that most of the missing were tourists who had left the area and returned home without checking in, leading to a sharp revision of the numbers after an exhaustive verification effort. Only three individuals from the hardest-hit county remain unaccounted for, a pattern common in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale natural disasters.</p>

In a podcast interview, the 76-year-old musician noted that his condition, which involves a build-up of fluid in the brain, is "still being worked on." The diagnosis forced Joel to cancel numerous concert dates for 2025 and 2026 to undergo specific physical therapy.

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 200,000 pages of previously sealed FBI records related to the surveillance and 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The release, part of an executive order, has been met with caution from King's family, who warned the files must be viewed in the context of the FBI's campaign to discredit the civil rights leader. His children reiterated their belief that he was the victim of a broader conspiracy and objected to any attempts to weaponize the files to attack his legacy. The release has also drawn criticism as a potential distraction from other political controversies.</p>
