          <p>Sir Menzies Campbell, a distinguished Scottish politician and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, has passed away at the age of 84. Known for his principled opposition to the Iraq War and a notable earlier career as an Olympic sprinter who held the UK 100m record, his death has elicited tributes from across the political spectrum. Colleagues and opponents alike remembered him for his wisdom, courtesy, and significant contributions to public life as both a Member of Parliament and later in the House of Lords. His passing marks the loss of a respected figure in British politics, remembered for his integrity and dedication.</p>

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) will hold a vote among its 68 member countries to decide if Israel will be permitted to participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest. The decision comes after Israel's continued involvement became controversial due to the ongoing war in Gaza, prompting several nations like Ireland and the Netherlands to threaten a boycott. A simple majority vote will determine the outcome, with Israel’s public broadcaster arguing for its inclusion as a long-standing and successful participant. The situation highlights the growing intersection of international politics and cultural events, placing the contest's organizers in a difficult position.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has intensified into a hurricane over the Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to become a major hurricane over the weekend. As of early Friday, the storm was located 465 miles northeast of the Leeward Islands with sustained winds of 75 mph, moving slowly northwest. While there are no immediate coastal watches or warnings in effect for the United States, officials at the National Hurricane Center are monitoring its path for potential downstream impacts along the Southeast coast. This development marks the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane season, with another system also being watched in the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>A London court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara, was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was brought unlawfully because it missed the six-month statutory time limit for gaining the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions. Following the ruling, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he fatally stabbed in the neck while she slept in 2021. Elliott, who was 17 at the time, called 911 immediately after, claiming he was sleepwalking and thought he was in a dream. Prosecutors have struggled to find any motive or evidence of conflict between the deeply close siblings, creating a perplexing case for investigators.

          <p>Hashem Abedi, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, has been accused of carrying out a terrorist attack inside a maximum-security prison. Prosecutors allege that Abedi used five makeshift knives and threw boiling liquid at three prison officers at HMP Frankland while shouting "Allahu akbar." The attack, which occurred in April, left the officers with serious injuries, including stab wounds and burns. Abedi now faces charges of attempted murder and assault, with prosecutors asserting the incident had a clear terrorist motivation, adding another grim chapter to his history of violence.</p>

          <p>Moldova is holding a parliamentary election that is being framed as a critical choice between aligning with the European Union or returning to Russia's sphere of influence.

These campaigns, allegedly supported by Russia and involving widespread vote-buying schemes, aim to destabilize the country's path toward EU integration.

          <p>A brutal clash between rival drug gangs at a prison in Esmeraldas, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of at least 17 inmates, with some victims being decapitated. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly riots that have plagued the nation's overcrowded and gang-controlled prison system, where over 500 inmates have been killed since 2021. The violence underscores the deep-rooted power of organized crime groups, which use prisons as operational hubs and are connected to international cartels.

          <p>Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee have launched an investigation into the recent resignation of Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The inquiry follows President Trump's public calls for Siebert's removal and the subsequent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, a case Siebert had reportedly been hesitant to bring. Siebert was replaced by Lindsey Halligan, a former Trump defense lawyer with no prosecutorial experience, who signed Comey's indictment shortly after taking office.

While the government says the tests will help support students, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, teaching unions have criticized the plan.

The author asserts there is no viable "peace partner" and that this diplomatic recognition legitimizes a "sick cult of violence."

          <h2>China Expands Cultural and Linguistic Influence Across Africa Through Confucius Institutes</h2>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power in Africa through a growing network of government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. With institutes now in 49 African countries, Beijing offers scholarships and educational opportunities, attracting many young Africans. However, critics raise concerns that these institutes also serve as tools for political indoctrination, interfering with academic freedom at host universities and promoting authoritarian values. This cultural expansion is seen by some analysts as intertwined with China's economic interests, including securing access to the continent's vast natural resources, such as lithium and cobalt, under the guise of cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition has discovered a remarkable ecosystem thriving on unexploded Nazi-era bombs at the bottom of Germany's Luebeck Bay. An unmanned submersible captured footage of dense populations of marine life, including worms, mussels, and crabs, covering the surface of ten V-1 cruise missiles. In a particularly baffling observation, researchers saw over 40 starfishes piled directly onto an exposed chunk of TNT, a highly toxic explosive. This discovery highlights nature's surprising resilience, as these deadly weapons, once meant to cause destruction, have inadvertently become artificial reefs that support a vibrant underwater community in an area where natural hard surfaces are scarce.</p>

          <p>A major Interpol-coordinated operation across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of running online romance scams and "sextortion" schemes. The crackdown, funded by the UK, targeted criminal networks that use social media to build trust with victims before defrauding or blackmailing them. Authorities identified over 1,400 victims who lost a combined total of nearly $2.8 million. The operation led to the seizure of numerous devices and forged documents, and successfully dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups, highlighting a growing international effort to combat the sharp rise in digital-enabled crimes across the continent.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating global trade tensions, Beijing has developed a diverse set of policy tools to protect its domestic industries and respond to actions from trade partners like the United States. Beyond traditional anti-dumping investigations, China's measures include an "Unreliable Entity List" to target foreign firms deemed harmful to its national interests, which can result in trade and investment bans. Another key tool is the implementation of export controls on "dual-use" items, which are goods with both civilian and potential military applications. These mechanisms provide China with a flexible and powerful arsenal to navigate the complexities of international economic disputes and assert its strategic interests.</p>

          <p>The number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody has risen to at least 16 since January, prompting serious concerns from lawmakers and advocacy groups about detention conditions. This marks a significant increase in the mortality rate compared to the previous administration, even when accounting for the record-high number of people being detained, which surpassed 60,000 in August. Two Democratic senators from Georgia have demanded information from the Department of Homeland Security about the fatalities and the administration's plans to prevent more deaths. Critics argue that the system is inherently inhumane and that conditions are worsening under the current mass detention strategy.</p>

          <p>Robert “Rabbit” Jaramillo, a founding member of the influential 1960s Chicano rock group Cannibal and the Headhunters, has died at the age of 78. His band was at the forefront of the Eastside Sound, scoring a national hit with "Land of 1,000 Dances" in 1965. Their success led them to open for The Beatles on their U.S. tour, including two shows at the Hollywood Bowl, bringing their unique blend of doo-wop, soul, and Mexican-American influences to a massive audience. Though he left the music industry for a career with the railroad, Jaramillo's contributions were later recognized, and he remained a proud figurehead of a pivotal moment in rock history.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's remarks linking Tylenol to rising autism rates, medical experts and researchers are emphasizing a more nuanced view of the science. While some studies suggest an association between frequent acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders, a causal relationship has not been established. Physicians stress that untreated fevers pose significant, proven risks to a fetus, and acetaminophen remains the safest available option for treatment. Experts, including authors of the cited research, recommend judicious use under a doctor's guidance for the shortest necessary duration, cautioning against alarmism and urging a balanced assessment of risks and benefits.</p>

His comments follow a federal demand for a $1.2 billion fine and sweeping policy changes at UCLA, linked to the suspension of research grants over allegations of antisemitism and discrimination. Frenk affirmed that UCLA would remain compliant with the law but will staunchly protect academic freedoms regarding admissions, hiring, and curriculum.

          <p>An analysis of federal data reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is transferring detainees between facilities more frequently and rapidly than in previous years. Advocacy groups argue this is a deliberate and retaliatory tactic used to isolate individuals from their families, legal resources, and community support networks, thereby increasing fear and pressuring them to self-deport. The transfers often move people to remote locations with fewer legal aid services, making it significantly harder to fight their cases. This practice is part of a broader strategy of mass detention that critics say prioritizes removal efficiency over the well-being and legal rights of those in custody.</p>

Other candidates from law enforcement backgrounds are also running, citing issues like poor morale, rising inmate deaths, and a lack of progress on rooting out alleged deputy gangs. Luna is defending his record, arguing for stability and highlighting the controversies of his predecessor's term, setting the stage for a heated political battle.</p>
