        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law prohibiting smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and other public areas. The regulations, which took effect Sunday, are part of a national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to reduce the impact of passive smoking. Violators could face fines up to €700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not extend to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, a point of difference with upcoming rules in neighboring Spain.</p>

          <p>A volunteer at a Leicester church was subjected to a prolonged stalking and harassment campaign by a Church of England lay preacher after he declined her romantic advances. The victim, Jay Hulme, reported the abuse to the church, but the Bishop of Leicester initially dismissed his complaint and accused him of witchcraft. After the police also failed to act initially, Hulme's persistent documentation of the abuse eventually led to the preacher's arrest and conviction for stalking. The case has exposed significant failures in how both the police and the Church of England handled the serious allegations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted late Saturday to advance President Trump's major domestic policy package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a dramatic, hours-long session. Republican leadership secured the necessary votes by negotiating with a group of four conservative holdouts, reportedly promising them a future vote on an amendment to reduce federal funding for certain Medicaid recipients. The procedural vote passed after Sen. Ron Johnson switched his vote to yes, avoiding a tie that would have required Vice President J.D. Vance to intervene. The bill now faces further debate and a final vote in the coming days.</p>

The rap-punk duo Bob Vylan led chants calling for the "death" of the Israeli military, which the UK government condemned and the BBC called "deeply offensive," pulling the set from its on-demand service. The performance by Irish-language rap group Kneecap, one of whose members is facing a terrorism-related charge, also included expletive-laden chants against political figures.

Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak ended with a 9-5 loss. The start was Ohtani's third since returning from elbow surgery, showing he is steadily rebuilding his pitching stamina.</p>

This year's events carry a tone of defiance, with themes like “Rise Up: Pride in Protest,” in response to recent political and legislative challenges to LGBTQ+ rights under the Trump administration. Organizers note a more pronounced protest element compared to recent years, which is further compounded by a noticeable pullback in corporate sponsorships from major companies. The marches blend jubilant street parties with a firm stance on protecting hard-won rights.</p>

One case involves Mandonna Kashanian, a 64-year-old grandmother who has been in the U.S. for 47 years and was arrested at her New Orleans home despite regularly checking in with immigration officials. Advocacy groups are concerned that these arrests are part of a broader, politically motivated roundup following recent military tensions between the U.S. and Iran.

          <p>A jury found Samuel Woodward guilty of first-degree murder and a hate crime for the 2018 stabbing death of his former high school classmate, 19-year-old Blaze Bernstein. Prosecutors successfully argued that Woodward, an active member of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, targeted Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The defense claimed the killing was an impulsive act of rage, but the jury's verdict confirmed it was a premeditated murder motivated by hate. Woodward now faces a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the brutal killing.</p>

While the initiative will require companies to report on healthy food sales for accountability, it does not impose specific targets.

          <p>The popular reality show Love Island USA is facing scrutiny over the intense cyberbullying directed at its contestants, prompting the show to air a plea for viewers to stop the harassment. The issue highlights the dark side of overnight fame and draws parallels to the UK version of the franchise, which faced a government inquiry after two former contestants died by suicide. While producers state they offer comprehensive psychological support, experts argue that the US version may not have evolved its duty of care protocols as much as its UK counterpart. The situation underscores the ongoing challenge of protecting participants' mental health in high-pressure reality TV environments.</p>

          <p>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts issued a stern warning about the dangers of heated political rhetoric aimed at judges, stating that it can incite threats and violence. Speaking at a judicial conference, Roberts emphasized that politicians from both parties need to be mindful that their words can be misinterpreted by individuals, leading to serious consequences. He referenced his own past interventions to condemn threatening statements from both President Donald Trump and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. His remarks come amid heightened political tensions and after an armed man was arrested outside Justice Brett Kavanaugh's home.</p>

This criticism reopens a recent, fiery conflict between Musk and the Trump administration, which he briefly served.

          <p>An estimated 140,000 protesters gathered in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule, leading to clashes with riot police. The student-led demonstrations, the largest in recent months, have intensified pressure on the populist government amid accusations of corruption and ties to organized crime. President Vucic has dismissed the protests as a foreign plot and has so far refused calls for a snap election. The unrest follows months of growing discontent, which was recently fueled by a deadly railway station roof collapse that protesters blame on corruption.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earth materials is accelerating efforts in Western countries to establish independent production capabilities, though the process is expected to be slow and costly. Ohio-based firm REalloys announced plans for a US$50 million facility to produce high-performance magnet materials by 2027, sourcing ore from Brazil and processing it in Canada. Analysts suggest that for these new ventures to be viable, they will likely require government subsidies and tariffs to compete with China's long-standing dominance in the global market. The situation highlights the strategic vulnerabilities in relying on a single source for critical materials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave affects the UK, this article explains the "urban heat island" effect, the reason why cities are often significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Hard, dark surfaces like asphalt and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, slowly releasing it as heat, particularly at night. In contrast, rural landscapes with more vegetation and water stay cooler through natural evaporation. This effect, which can make cities 4-6°C warmer, exacerbates the dangers of heatwaves for urban populations and highlights their increased vulnerability as climate change makes extreme heat more common.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched through Venice to voice their opposition to the lavish wedding celebrations of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez. Activists argue that the extravagant, celebrity-filled event represents the exploitation of their city, which is already struggling with overtourism, a housing crisis, and environmental fragility. Chanting "Kisses Yes, Bezos No," the demonstrators criticized the event as an affront to residents. Despite Bezos making a significant donation to Venetian environmental groups, many protesters dismissed the gesture as an attempt to appease criticism rather than a genuine effort to help the city.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program is being trialed in primary schools across Kent, England, to teach children as young as five about sun safety. The initiative aims to reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, by instilling good habits early in life. Pupils learn how to read UV indexes, apply sunscreen correctly, and understand the risks of sun exposure, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases later risk. Amid projections of rising melanoma diagnoses, the program is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026 as part of the standard health curriculum.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive demonstration of solidarity and defiance against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The huge turnout was largely seen as a direct response to the government's attempts to ban the march using a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the event himself, transforming the annual Pride celebration into a broader protest for human rights and a clear rebuke of Orban's increasingly authoritarian rule.</p>

Many Iranians, still reeling from the violent suppression of the 2022 protests, express terror at the intensified state control.
