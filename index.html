          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 23:37:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 4.2% year-on-year rise in September, halting a four-month period of contraction, primarily fueled by strong growth in shipments to Asian markets. This positive development occurred despite a significant 13.3% decline in exports to the U.S., especially in the automotive sector, even after a trade deal reduced tariffs. The nation's economic trajectory is also influenced by the recent appointment of Sanae Takaichi as Japan's first female prime minister, whose policies are expected to weaken the yen and bolster export competitiveness. Analysts, however, caution that persistent U.S.-China trade tensions cloud the long-term outlook for external demand and recovery.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa has formed in the Caribbean, marking the Atlantic's 13th named storm this year, with its direct impact on the mainland United States currently considered improbable. The storm, featuring maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, is projected to deliver heavy rainfall, potentially up to 10 inches, to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, elevating the risk of significant flash flooding and landslides. Although a gradual turn toward the north and northwest is expected, considerable uncertainty persists regarding its precise path and intensity, with some models indicating a possible westward shift towards the Gulf. Hurricane and tropical storm watches have been issued for Haiti and Jamaica, advising residents to complete preparations.</p>

          <p>Former Rep. George Santos, following his sentence commutation, described his 84 days in prison as "mentally torturous," revealing he wrote three suicide notes during isolation. In a wide-ranging interview, he expressed apologies to constituents and colleagues for betraying their trust, emphasizing a desire for a second chance to "do good." Santos also recounted a conversation with President Trump, where he conveyed his ambition to contribute to prison reform and youth programs, though he denied awareness of potential local legal challenges. He criticized the justice system as "over-politicized" and denied some specific criminal allegations, while stating no plans to seek office "in the near future."</p>

          <h2>UK Bans Gambling Ads Featuring Lewis Hamilton and Chelsea Logo Over Youth Appeal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 23:21:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has prohibited gambling advertisements from Kwiff and Betway that prominently featured Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. This ban stems from investigations into complaints that these promotions would strongly appeal to children under 18, breaching established advertising regulations. Kwiff's post on X highlighted Hamilton at the British Grand Prix, while Betway's YouTube ad displayed football fans wearing Chelsea merchandise. The ASA cited Hamilton's large youth following on Instagram and his presence in age-rated video games as clear indicators of his appeal to minors. Both betting companies received warnings to avoid including any characters with significant allure for viewers under the age of 18 in future campaigns.</p>

          <p>Celebrated author Sir Philip Pullman has called upon the UK government to amend copyright laws regarding "scraping," the practice of using writers' books to train artificial intelligence without providing compensation or recognition. Pullman, creator of the popular "His Dark Materials" series, labels this uncompensated use as "wicked" and a form of "theft," asserting that authors should be remunerated for their creative contributions. While the government has launched consultations and established expert groups on AI and copyright, Pullman advocates for prompt legislative action. He additionally criticizes contemporary education policies for suppressing imagination, a concept deeply explored in his newest novel, "The Rose Field," which delves into the existence of elements perceptible solely through imagination.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly declined on Wednesday as investors analyzed Japan's recent trade data and the implications of its new political leadership. Japanese exports in September increased by 4.2% year-on-year, ending a four-month period of contraction, largely fueled by robust growth in Asian markets, though this still fell short of analysts' expectations. The market also considered the influence of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and her newly appointed cabinet, which includes Japan's first female finance minister, sworn in on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 index experienced losses, leading the regional downturn, while shares of SoftBank notably plunged over 5%, indicating a cautious investor sentiment amidst these economic and political shifts.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, according to Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, to bolster the city's understaffed police department during significant public events. This deployment, initiated by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry's request, is timed for the Bayou Classic football event and will continue through New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras. Kirkpatrick emphasized that the Guard's presence is a collaborative "partnership" to act as a "force multiplier," not an assumption of police duties. Despite welcoming the assistance, she expressed reservations about their deployment beyond major events, distinguishing their combat training from the police's peacekeeping mission. The New Orleans Police Department still requires around 300 additional officers.</p>

Mahmood confirmed the inquiry would explicitly investigate the ethnicity and religion of offenders, while recognizing the frustration caused by delays in selecting a chair.

Local politicians, including City Councilmember Christopher Marte and Mayor Eric Adams, publicly disavowed NYPD involvement and criticized the "aggressive and reckless" nature of the operation.

          <p>Los Angeles is currently grappling with a significant surge in copper wire theft, which is leaving numerous communities in darkness and incurring millions of dollars in repair costs, as tragically illustrated by the unlit Sixth Street Bridge. More than 37,000 streetlight repair requests have been filed in 2025, with nearly half directly linked to wire theft, resulting in extensive delays due to insufficient staffing. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, scheduled for implementation next year, aims to curb this crime by imposing greater responsibility on junk dealers to verify sellers' identities and the legal ownership of materials. This legislation also escalates penalties for recyclers who acquire public property materials without proper authorization, addressing a crime with substantial safety and financial ramifications.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit initiated by the District of Columbia Attorney General claims that the National Guard's deployment in Washington D.C. might extend until the summer of 2026, with federal officials reportedly planning for a "long-term persistent presence." Documents, including emails from National Guard leaders, suggest preparations for America's 250th anniversary in July 2026 as a consideration for the mission's extended duration. The lawsuit argues that the Guard is functioning as a "federal military police force," thereby usurping local authority and potentially violating the U.S. Constitution, as state governors reportedly lack effective command over their deployed service members. Conversely, the Pentagon maintains that the Guard's current orders are only valid until November 30.</p>

While Gross believes gold might "hold up better than stocks" in the immediate future, he anticipates a price pullback, potentially offering a more opportune buying moment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Common Myths About Hair Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker have debunked several prevalent haircare myths, stressing that genuinely healthy hair stems from fundamental care rather than costly products or intricate routines. They clarify that washing hair with cold water does not enhance shine, and no existing product can permanently mend split ends, which invariably necessitate a trim. The experts further dismiss the notion of hair "self-cleaning," emphasizing that consistent washing is essential to prevent the accumulation of oil and debris, which can lead to unpleasant odors and exacerbate scalp conditions like dandruff. They strongly advise against using dry shampoo as a prolonged substitute for washing, recommending it only for single-day touch-ups between washes.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has announced a "successful hit" on the Bryansk Chemical Plant in Russia, utilizing UK-made Storm Shadow missiles that reportedly penetrated Russian air defenses. Kyiv considers this strike vital for targeting facilities integral to Moscow's war efforts, as the plant is said to produce gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components used in enemy ammunition. This attack coincides with a joint declaration from UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders, pledging to "ramp up the pressure on Russia's economy and its defence industry" until Russian leader Vladimir Putin is prepared to make peace. The strike follows recent discussions where U.S. President Trump appeared hesitant to supply long-range missiles to Ukraine.</p>

Trout characterized Skaggs as a "funny, outgoing" friend and admitted observing former communications director Eric Kay acting "wired," suspecting drug use, yet he remained unaware of the specifics or that Kay allegedly supplied opioids to players. The lawsuit, filed by Skaggs's wife and parents, contends the Angels bear responsibility for allowing Kay access to MLB players despite his addiction and alleged dealing. Kay was federally convicted for providing the fentanyl-laced pill that caused Skaggs's death.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes why President Trump achieved a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza but struggles to resolve the war in Ukraine, attributing the difference to varying levels of leverage. In Gaza, Trump's strong pro-Israel stance and influence over Netanyahu, coupled with economic ties to Arab nations, provided significant diplomatic power. Conversely, in Ukraine, Trump's inconsistent approach—swinging between pressuring Putin and Zelensky, and fluctuating on arms shipments—has yielded little progress. The article suggests Putin may exploit Trump's desire for a deal to influence policy, as evidenced by the temporary suspension of a Budapest summit and the U.S. hesitation on long-range missiles for Kyiv.</p>

The research, analyzing 30 common antidepressants across over 58,500 patients, found some medications could cause up to a 2kg weight gain or alter heart rate by 21 beats per minute within eight weeks. Academics emphasize these findings are crucial for personalizing treatment, allowing doctors to match antidepressants to individual patient needs and existing health conditions, rather than relying on a few commonly prescribed, generic options.

          <p>UK supermarket prices, exemplified by a 134% rise in orange juice since 2020, are soaring due to a "perfect storm" of global and local factors.

For orange juice, specific issues include citrus greening disease in Florida and Brazil, reducing supply and sweetness, alongside U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports. The article highlights that these price shocks are transmitted quickly, and while some expect prices to normalize with better harvests, the concentrated market and ongoing climate challenges suggest stubbornly high food bills might persist for consumers.</p>

          <p>A devastating fiery collision involving eight vehicles, including four semitrucks and four passenger cars, on the westbound I-10 in Ontario, California, has tragically claimed three lives and injured four others.

Consequently, all westbound lanes, excluding the two FasTrak lanes, and the transition roads from the I-15 to the I-10 westbound were shut down, causing severe disruptions to rush-hour traffic.
