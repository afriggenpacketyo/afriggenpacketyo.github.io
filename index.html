          <p>House Republicans pushed forward President Trump's budget package after overcoming initial resistance from conservatives who felt the spending cuts were insufficient. The bill, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and increases military and border security spending, faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition in the Senate. Negotiations continued over the weekend, leading to minor modifications to address concerns about Medicaid work requirements and clean energy subsidies. The article details the compromises made and the ongoing challenges to passing the legislation, including pushback from blue-state Republicans over state and local tax deductions.
