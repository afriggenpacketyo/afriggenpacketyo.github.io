          <p>FedEx announced better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, driven by the achievement of its $4 billion cost-cutting goal. CEO Raj Subramaniam expressed confidence in the company's transformation initiatives, which focus on integrating networks and further reducing costs. The company plans to cut an additional $1 billion in the upcoming fiscal year. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped about 5% in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance that fell slightly below Wall Street expectations, while CFO John Dietrich mentioned a $170 million headwind from international exports due to global trade policy impacts.

          <p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices experienced a surge following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republican senators introduced a major bill aimed at establishing clear regulatory guidelines for the crypto industry, defining when crypto is a commodity or a security. The bill would allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulatory oversight of digital assets. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev highlighted the importance of this regulatory development for the U.S. to regain its leading position in the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit arose after OpenAI announced plans to bring on Apple designer Jony Ive by acquiring his AI startup io, leading Iyo to claim unfair competition and trademark infringement. OpenAI removed the blog post about the deal from its website following a court order. Altman shared emails suggesting Iyo's CEO had previously sought investment from OpenAI, indicating that the lawsuit is a surprising turn of events.</p>

          <p>President Trump shared a message from the NATO Secretary General praising his decisive action in Iran, which Trump claims led to a ceasefire and ended the "12 Day War." Despite the administration touting the obliteration of Iran's nuclear facilities, US military intelligence officials report that the program has only been set back by months, and enriched uranium was not eliminated. While a ceasefire is in place, the situation remains tenuous, and the wars in Gaza and Ukraine continue. Vice President JD Vance outlined Trump's foreign policy doctrine as defining American interests, negotiating aggressively, and using overwhelming force if necessary.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that Republicans largely support the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, while the majority of the overall public disapproves. There are bipartisan concerns about the U.S. becoming involved in a wider war with Iran, with Republicans showing less concern. A large majority of Americans believe President Trump needs congressional authorization for military action against Iran. The poll also reveals that most Americans perceive the U.S. economy negatively, with concerns about rising prices and a potential recession.</p>

The decision affects 317 people across several cities and comes after mounting legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased. Gang injunctions, which can restrict suspected gang members' activities, have been challenged as overly broad and racially biased, with civil rights groups arguing they turn everyday activities into crimes.</p>

The F-35 A jets can carry conventional weapons and US-made nuclear bombs, with their use requiring authorization from NATO and both the US and UK leaders.

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran may be a foreign-policy victory, but it also carries the risk of Iran pursuing nuclear weapons. The absence of a diplomatic agreement linked to the ceasefire means that Iran could end cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, allowing it to develop a nuclear weapon covertly. Trump's declaration that the problem is fully solved without extracting commitments from Tehran could lead to a new Iranian nuclear crisis.</p>

The DNGC, which oversees the accounts of French professional football clubs, provisionally demoted Lyon in November and upheld the decision despite the club's efforts to improve its financial situation. Lyon has raised funds through player sales and released high earners, but the DNGC remains unconvinced. The club contends that the decision is incomprehensible given their proven funds and recent sporting success.</p>

However, Anthropic still faces a trial in December over the separate issue of downloading millions of pirated books.
