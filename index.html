          <p>Israel's defense minister announced that an airstrike killed Abu Obeida, a long-time spokesperson for Hamas's armed wing, amidst a new military offensive in Gaza City. This claim follows Prime Minister Netanyahu's earlier statement that Obeida was targeted, though Hamas has not yet commented on the matter. The operation is part of Israel's broader effort to dismantle Hamas's capabilities following the October 7th attack. Meanwhile, humanitarian conditions worsen, with reports of at least 43 Palestinians killed since Saturday and the UN highlighting a devastating famine situation in the region.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The emergency ruling came just as flights were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit by attorneys who argued the plan would violate legal protections for vulnerable minors. The judge cited the government's hurried actions over a holiday weekend as justification for the extraordinary measure. The administration contended it was repatriating children at their families' request, a claim disputed by the children's legal representatives.</p>

President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah expressed deep sorrow over the loss, highlighting the nation's struggle with high road traffic fatality rates.

          <p>A protest against the use of hotels for housing asylum seekers in Canary Wharf, London, led to four arrests after some demonstrators became aggressive towards law enforcement. The Metropolitan Police reported that an officer was punched in the face, though not seriously injured, when masked protesters entered a shopping center. The arrests were made for offenses including assault on police, drug possession, and public order violations. In response to the unrest, police implemented a dispersal order and a measure to prevent protesters from concealing their identities with masks.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has called for resistance against the Trump administration's plans to launch a significant immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, labeling a potential troop deployment an "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been contacted by federal officials and warned that such uncoordinated actions are disruptive and dangerous. His comments follow President Trump's social media posts criticizing the governor and the city. In response, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to limit local police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 loss to Brighton, Manchester City is experiencing its worst start to a Premier League season since 2004-05, raising questions about their title contention. Despite significant spending and the return of key player Rodri, the team has shown inconsistency, repeating patterns of defensive vulnerability seen last season. Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged the team "forgot to play" after conceding, but urged patience, stating the season is long. Historically, no team in a 38-game season has won the title after losing two of their first three matches.</p>

          <p>Representative James Comer, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has formally requested all Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell from the Treasury Department. The request, made in a letter on Sunday, is part of the committee's investigation into potential mismanagement of the federal government's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking network. This action follows the committee's establishment of a task force to declassify federal secrets and its subpoenas to several high-profile former government officials. The Treasury has been given a deadline of September 15 to produce the requested documents.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing its second-worst wildfire season on record, surpassed only by the 2023 season, with scientists attributing the increasing severity to climate change. Researchers from United Nations University highlight that warmer global temperatures are creating ideal fire conditions by drying out forests, extending the fire season, and increasing volatile weather like lightning storms. This year has already seen over 17 million acres burned, exceeding the 10-year average significantly. The persistent and widespread fires and resulting smoke are raising urgent calls for new fire management strategies and climate change solutions.</p>

Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life before they can receive their own jabs.

While the president ordered security forces to take strong action against looting, student groups have indicated that the concessions may not be sufficient to end the demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-long restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived 80 acres of vital kelp forest by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins. Led by The Bay Foundation, an army of divers manually smashed the urchins, which had created barren underwater landscapes by devouring young kelp. The removal of the voracious grazers allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to quickly regrow, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species and bolstering the local ecosystem. The project is now being viewed as a successful model for kelp restoration efforts in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Afghans who were promised entry to Germany after fleeing the Taliban takeover are now living in fear of deportation from Pakistan, where they have been waiting for visas. Germany recently ended a freeze on admissions, but the process has been agonizingly slow, leaving many in legal limbo. A one-month pause on deportations from Pakistan is set to expire, with the government planning to resume them in September, potentially affecting over a million people. For those who worked with international governments, like the family profiled in the article, being sent back to Afghanistan could be a death sentence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to President Donald Trump, condemned a recent appeals court decision that ruled most of the administration's sweeping tariffs illegal, calling it "weaponized partisan injustice." Echoing the president's rhetoric, Navarro warned that if the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, "it will be the end of the United States." The 7-4 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals found that Trump overstepped his authority by using a 1977 law to justify the tariffs. The administration remains optimistic about its chances on appeal to the Supreme Court, which will likely make the final determination. (not investment advice)</p>

The race saw a dramatic turn of events for his teammate, Lando Norris, who was running in a comfortable second place before an oil leak forced him to retire with just seven laps remaining. The retirement dealt a significant blow to Norris's title hopes. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar claimed a remarkable first-ever podium finish for Racing Bulls, capitalizing on a chaotic race that included three safety cars and multiple crashes.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has announced that her party, if elected, would remove all net zero requirements for companies drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea. The plan aims to "maximise extraction" by scrapping the need for producers to reduce emissions or invest in carbon storage technologies. Badenoch argued that current climate measures result in higher energy bills for households. The move represents a significant shift in climate policy and drew immediate criticism from the Labour government and environmental groups, who warned it would accelerate the climate crisis without improving energy security or lowering bills.

The author argues that activists are using the trivial logo change as a pretext to make an example of the company, aiming to instill fear in any corporation that might deviate from conservative-approved policies.</p>

Manning, the highly anticipated nephew of NFL legends Peyton and Eli, completed 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception in a shaky debut. While Manning was self-critical, Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian pushed back against the immense external pressure on his young quarterback. Sarkisian described the expectations as "out of control" and urged patience, stating, "let's finish the book before we judge it."</p>
