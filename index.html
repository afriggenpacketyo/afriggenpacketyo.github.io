          <h2>Poll Suggests Trump's First 100 Days Marked by Tariff Focus and Shifting Approval</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that while President Trump retains strong support from his base, a growing number of Americans believe his administration is overly focused on tariffs, negatively impacting his approval ratings on the economy and inflation. MAGA Republicans maintain a positive outlook on the economy, while other Trump voters, including independents and young people, have become less approving. The poll also reveals that most Americans think Trump is trying to expand presidential powers, with differing views on whether these changes are positive or negative. (not investment advice)</p>
