          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 09:48:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising older homeowners to carefully weigh the risks of reverse mortgages amidst the current economic climate. While these loans offer a way to access home equity without selling, they come with significant responsibilities, including rising costs for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, which could lead to foreclosure if not met. Other factors to consider include the impact of potentially falling home prices on available equity and the reduced inheritance that may be left to heirs. The high upfront fees and variable interest rates also mean the product is best suited for those planning to remain in their homes for many years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a devastating earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, women and girls are facing extreme difficulty in receiving medical aid due to the Taliban's oppressive policies. Rules requiring male guardians and gender segregation are preventing female victims from being seen or treated by male responders, while a severe shortage of female doctors exacerbates the crisis. Activists report that volunteer female medics have been turned away by both the Taliban and local men. This systemic barrier is leading to preventable deaths, including those of injured pregnant women, compounding the tragedy in a nation already facing a catastrophic humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential candidate for the next Fed chair, has publicly called for an interest rate cut at the upcoming September meeting. Citing concerns about a rapidly deteriorating labor market, Waller argued for a proactive approach, suggesting multiple cuts could occur over the next three to six months to bring rates closer to a neutral level. He emphasized that the central bank should not be locked into a rigid sequence of cuts but should remain flexible based on incoming economic data. Waller also stressed the importance of the Fed's independence amid political pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Tlaib, the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress, asserted that Palestinians would not "disappear" despite facing violence and oppression, stating they are now in Congress and across the U.S. She also criticized the United States' political structures as being built on slavery and genocide. The conference itself drew scrutiny for featuring speakers with controversial views, further highlighting the deep divisions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>Amazon is discontinuing its Prime Invitee Program, which permitted Prime members to share their free shipping benefits with one person outside of their household. The company has begun notifying users that the program will officially end on October 1, 2025, after which invited guests will need to purchase their own memberships. This policy change steers users toward the Amazon Family program, which allows benefit sharing but requires all members to share the same primary residential address.

          <p>A former South Carolina correctional officer, a former inmate, and his brother have been charged in a scheme to smuggle drugs into 14 state prisons by hiding them in books. Authorities allege that Shataysha Quneeka Lewis, who left her job in 2019, conspired with the others to mail packages containing hundreds of strips of synthetic cannabinoids and Suboxone. The investigation utilized evidence from inmate statements, contraband cell phones, and surveillance footage from the post office where the packages were sent. The director of the state's Department of Corrections condemned the operation, highlighting the danger such contraband poses to both inmates and staff.</p>

          <p>The yield on the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond briefly surpassed 5% as markets contended with multiple economic and political pressures. Investor sentiment has been affected by a recent court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's tariffs illegal, potentially forcing Washington to issue billions in refunds. Additional anxiety stems from the president's attempts to dismiss a Federal Reserve governor, raising concerns about the central bank's political independence and its long-term credibility in fighting inflation. These factors have contributed to a volatile environment for government bonds ahead of the upcoming monthly jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic instability, with its price influenced by a complex interplay of market forces. Key drivers include fundamental supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates, as investors often use the precious metal to hedge against the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty, central bank policies, and the strength of the U.S. dollar all play significant roles in its valuation. Interest rates are also a critical factor, as lower rates decrease the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset like gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five years after closing its physical stores following the collapse of Sir Philip Green's retail empire, the Topshop brand is set to return to the UK High Street. Starting in February 2026, the iconic fashion label will be available in 32 John Lewis department stores, with its Topman brand appearing in six. The brand was acquired by online retailer Asos, which has since relaunched its website and is now orchestrating a major comeback into physical retail. John Lewis hopes the partnership will attract a new, multi-generational customer base to its stores, capitalizing on the nostalgia and affordability associated with Topshop.</p>

          <p>Families of the 346 people killed in two Boeing 737 Max crashes are making a final plea for a federal judge to reject a non-prosecution agreement between the company and the Department of Justice. They are demanding that Boeing face a criminal trial for allegedly deceiving regulators about a flight-control system implicated in the disasters. The DOJ has moved to dismiss a felony fraud charge in exchange for Boeing paying another $1.1 billion in fines and safety investments. Victims' relatives argue this allows the company to evade meaningful accountability and are urging the judge to deny the government's request and appoint a special prosecutor.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of children in art has evolved significantly throughout history, reflecting societal shifts in the perception of childhood itself. In the Middle Ages, art focused on religious themes, with the Christ child being the most common representation, often appearing glorified and adult-like. As the modern era emerged, the affluent bourgeoisie began commissioning portraits that styled their children after mythological figures to symbolize virtues. It wasn't until the 17th century that peasant children became worthy artistic subjects, initially to evoke charity, before the modern concept of a carefree, playful childhood emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is tapping into the growing consumer demand for protein-fortified products by launching a new line of protein lattes and cold foams. Beginning September 29, customers can add a protein cold foam, providing about 15 grams of protein, to various drinks or order new lattes made with protein-boosted milk. The move is part of the company's broader strategy to modernize its menu and stimulate sales growth following a recent revenue slowdown. The launch aligns with a significant market trend that has seen a surge in protein-enhanced beverages and foods, driven by their perceived health and nutritional benefits.</p>

          <p>Activists gathered near the White House to protest the Trump administration's alleged illegal withholding of congressionally appropriated funds for global HIV programs, including the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar). With the fiscal year ending, protesters warned that the impounded funds would soon disappear, jeopardizing a program credited with saving 26 million lives. Former USAID officials and health workers described how the abrupt funding cuts have already shuttered programs, leading to treatment interruptions and deaths in countries like Kenya and Mozambique. The protesters demanded the Office of Management and Budget release the funds immediately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite mortgage rates falling to their lowest level since April, overall mortgage application volume decreased by 1.2% last week, driven by a drop in purchase applications. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to buy a home fell 3% for the week, ending a four-week streak of gains. This pullback suggests that persistent high home prices and broader affordability challenges continue to be a significant barrier for potential buyers. While applications to refinance a home saw a slight increase, the decline in purchase activity indicates that lower borrowing costs alone are not yet enough to reinvigorate the housing market.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using an aggressive social media campaign with militaristic and nationalistic themes to recruit over 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. The campaign uses imagery reminiscent of wartime recruitment posters and captions like "Hunt cartels. Save America," while targeting audiences from Gen Z to former military personnel. To expand its hiring pool, DHS has lowered the minimum age to 18 and is offering student loan forgiveness. Critics and marketing experts note the campaign's polarizing and dehumanizing messaging, which they fear will attract recruits with xenophobic views and further politicize the agency.</p>
