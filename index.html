          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of "reciprocal tariffs",  Citi and Capital Economics analysts estimate the effective US tariff rate on Chinese goods to be around 65-70%. This significant increase is attributed to new tariffs, previous levies, and the phasing out of duty exemptions for low-value imports.  The impact on China's economy and global trade remains to be seen.</p>
