        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed a massive and controversial spending bill, which President Trump is expected to sign into law. At its core, the legislation makes the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent while increasing funds for border security and defense. The bill is funded in part by significant cuts to social safety net programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, a forecast the White House disputes.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of a major explosion and fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Yolo County, California. Seven individuals, some of whom were identified by family as employees, have been unaccounted for since the incident. The investigation has revealed that the fireworks business was operating without the necessary local permits to store pyrotechnics on the agricultural property. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has been called in to assist with the ongoing investigation into the cause of the blast.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck the Texas Hill Country, resulting in at least 13 confirmed fatalities after torrential rains caused the Guadalupe River to rise dramatically. The situation is particularly dire at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where more than 20 children remain unaccounted for, prompting a large-scale search and rescue operation involving helicopters and emergency crews. Local officials described the flooding as catastrophic, occurring with little warning and overwhelming local communities. The state has mobilized extensive resources to aid in the response as the search for the missing continues.</p>

          <p>President Trump officially signed his administration's major tax and spending legislation into law during the White House's Fourth of July picnic for military families. The president used the event to celebrate the bill, which he touted as the largest tax cut in American history, while dismissing Democratic criticism as a "con job." Democrats have fiercely opposed the legislation due to its deep cuts to social services like Medicaid and food stamps, which they argue will harm the nation's most vulnerable citizens. The signing ceremony took place amidst patriotic displays, including military flyovers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has revealed that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against global warming due to their epic annual migration in the Antarctic. These small animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to hibernate. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, preventing it from entering the atmosphere, with scientists estimating the amount is equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars. The discovery highlights a crucial natural mechanism for carbon sequestration that was previously not fully quantified.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a sophisticated criminal network in the UK that is stealing millions of pounds by exploiting weaknesses in the probate system. The fraudsters target the estates of individuals who have died without leaving a will, using a public government list to identify them. They then produce a forged will naming one of their members as the sole beneficiary, allowing them to claim the entire estate before the rightful heirs are aware. The scheme also involves significant inheritance tax fraud, with the gang undervaluing estates to avoid payment.</p>

The gains are most significant for the wealthy in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, where the top 1% could see their annual tax bills fall by over $100,000. These benefits stem from provisions like permanent income tax cuts and a higher estate tax exemption.

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a victory over Poland, but the win was overshadowed by a significant injury to captain Giulia Gwinn. The Bayern Munich fullback left the pitch in tears during the first half after injuring her knee, sparking fears of another long-term layoff for a player who has already suffered two ACL injuries. While goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller secured the three points for the eight-time champions, the potential loss of their captain has cast a dark shadow over the team's tournament prospects pending medical evaluation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will bring significant changes to U.S. national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international tourists. The order directs that any revenue generated from these increased fees be used for infrastructure improvements across federal recreational sites. Additionally, the order revokes a 2017 Obama-era presidential memorandum that promoted diversity and inclusion efforts in the management of public lands and the protection of cultural sites. This move aligns with the administration's broader policy of ending government diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and China are increasingly visible within Global South-focused organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). A recent SCO defense ministers' meeting highlighted this friction when it concluded without a joint statement. According to India's foreign ministry, a lack of consensus over language regarding terrorism, a key issue for India, prevented an agreement. This incident underscores India's growing assertiveness in challenging China's leadership and agenda within these multilateral forums, where decision-making requires consensus among member states.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has outlined five categories of food he avoids giving his own children due to their long-term health risks. The list includes microwave popcorn, often lined with harmful chemicals; flavored yogurts packed with hidden sugars; and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats, which are high in sodium and preservatives linked to heart disease. The doctor also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can fuel inflammation.

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as arguably the most important event in world history, as it created the novel concept of a "citizen" rather than a "subject." Discussing his upcoming film, Burns emphasized that understanding the nation's founding requires embracing its complexities, including the deep divisions of the era and the founders' personal flaws, such as slave ownership. He argued that a sanitized, simplistic version of history is less powerful and that grappling with these difficult truths makes the story more accessible and meaningful for all Americans today.</p>

The report outlines the different financial challenges and planning strategies relevant to each group. For many, a significant portion of their net worth is tied up in illiquid assets like their home, posing challenges for accessing cash in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

As policy changes are implemented, many beneficiaries may not realize that warnings about "Medicaid" apply to their state-specific plans, which go by names like "MassHealth" or "SoonerCare." This lack of recognition could cause people to miss crucial deadlines for redetermination or fail to respond to important notices.

Meanwhile, Israeli strikes have intensified, killing at least 138 Palestinians over a 24-hour period, according to Gaza health officials.
