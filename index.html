          <p>Starbucks has reported its sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2% that was steeper than anticipated. Despite these figures, CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence, stating the company's turnaround plan is progressing ahead of schedule, drawing on his experience from reviving Chipotle. The article notes that while overall sales fell, North American performance was better than feared, and the company's China market saw its first same-store sales growth in a year and a half. Future plans include a $500 million investment in labor and service improvements, along with new product launches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In recent comments, former President Donald Trump claimed that Jeffrey Epstein had "stole" Virginia Giuffre from her job at the Mar-a-Lago spa in the early 2000s. Trump stated this was one of at least two instances where Epstein recruited workers from his club, which he cited as the reason for ending their friendship. The article provides context on Giuffre's allegations of sexual abuse by Epstein and his associates. It also touches on related developments, including Ghislaine Maxwell's refusal to testify before Congress without immunity and Trump's ongoing lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch over a separate Epstein-related story.</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock experienced its most significant single-day drop in over two years, falling by more than 11% after the company released disappointing financial results and weak guidance for the upcoming quarter. The music streaming service reported a net loss and revenue that both fell short of Wall Street expectations, attributing the results to increased operational costs. The article notes that while monthly active users and premium subscribers grew, the company's forecast for third-quarter revenue was below analyst predictions. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged the execution challenges but expressed confidence in the long-term strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that his government will formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September unless Israel takes significant steps toward peace.

The article details the immediate and strong rejection of this announcement by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who framed it as a reward for terrorism. It also provides context, noting that this follows a similar move by France and comes as sources report Netanyahu is considering annexing territories in Gaza.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration prepares to implement tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, analysts are evaluating which companies may be most affected. The article suggests that drugmakers like Novartis and Roche could face greater risk due to their larger manufacturing operations outside the U.S., while AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly appear better positioned with more domestic facilities. The specific tariff rates remain unclear, but experts warn that levies above 50% could be highly punitive, potentially forcing companies to cut research and development spending.

          <p>A recent trip by U.S. President Donald Trump to Scotland, the birthplace of his mother, was met with a deeply divided response, reflecting a broader political disconnect with many Scots. This article explores the mixed reactions, from protests and critical newspaper headlines to more pragmatic engagement from Scottish political leaders. First Minister John Swinney, despite past criticisms of Trump, met with the president to discuss key issues like U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky. The piece analyzes the complex dynamic, noting that while Trump's politics are unpopular with the majority of Scots, his business interests and political power make him an unavoidable and influential figure in Scottish affairs.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement of a conditional recognition of a Palestinian state marks a significant shift in British foreign policy, driven by both public and political pressure. This article analyzes the context and potential consequences of the move, noting the stringent conditions placed on both Israel and Hamas, such as a ceasefire and disarmament. The author questions the realism of these conditions, given the current political stances of the Israeli government and Hamas. The piece concludes that while the pledge is a major development, its ultimate impact remains uncertain and largely dependent on the actions of key players like Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu and U.S. President Trump.</p>
