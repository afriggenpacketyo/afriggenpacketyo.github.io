          <p>President Trump announced two new tariff types: a universal 10% import duty on all goods and reciprocal tariffs aimed at equalizing trade imbalances.  These tariffs, effective April 5th and 9th respectively, aim to revitalize American industry, but economists predict increased inflation and higher costs for consumers.  The reciprocal tariffs are designed to match tariffs imposed by other countries on US exports, although this is not fully reciprocal.</p>
