          <p>The Conservative Party is pressing the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) regarding the possibility of restarting prosecutions against two men accused of spying for China, following their acquittal after charges were dropped. The CPS cited a lack of evidence classifying China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. Tories are also questioning the role of the government's national security adviser in the case's collapse, while the Labour government defends its officials. Legal principles like double jeopardy make a second prosecution difficult, especially under the Official Secrets Act.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially announced her candidacy for the 2026 U.S. Senate race, aiming to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. Mills, a popular two-term governor, is a key target for national Democrats seeking to narrow the Republican Senate majority. However, her entry sets up a potentially contentious Democratic primary, with progressives already backing a younger candidate. The race is anticipated to be one of the most closely watched contests in the upcoming midterms, highlighting broader party tensions over generational change and strategy.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zhu Lin in the first round of the Ningbo Open, losing in three sets. Raducanu, who retired from the Wuhan Open last week due to illness, visibly struggled physically during the match. She received medical attention for blood pressure, vital signs, and a back injury, which hindered her movement and serve. This loss adds to concerns about the physical demands on the 22-year-old, who has played her most WTA Tour matches this year since her 2021 US Open victory.</p>

Jahn, who killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life, had become a loner obsessed with AI and practiced shooting a month prior. His parents stated he was "completely normal" before moving to Washington state and returning with these beliefs.

          <p>As Disney approaches the 2026 deadline for naming Bob Iger's successor, a co-CEO structure is being considered, with internal candidates Dana Walden and Josh D'Amaro as potential leaders. While other companies like Netflix have successfully implemented this model, Disney's history presents unique challenges. Experts and insiders warn that Iger's past reluctance to fully relinquish control and the company's politically charged culture could undermine a dual leadership arrangement. The article suggests that a single CEO might be a better, albeit riskier, path to stability.</p>

          <p>New U.S. tariffs on imported kitchen cabinets, vanities, lumber, timber, and certain upholstered furniture have taken effect, with President Donald Trump citing the need to protect U.S. manufacturers and national security. A 10% tariff now applies to softwood lumber, rising to over 45% for Canadian imports due to existing duties. A 25% tariff on kitchen cabinets and vanities will increase to 50% in January, impacting housing costs and potentially causing consumers to postpone renovations. Retailers are expected to pass these increased costs onto customers, leading to higher prices for everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>Gen Z-led demonstrations have surged across South and Southeast Asia, fueled by stagnant economic prospects, widening inequality, and perceived elite corruption. A World Bank report highlights high youth unemployment and a shift to lower-paid service jobs, leaving many young people vulnerable to poverty. These protests, seen in Nepal, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, and the Philippines, target issues like government perks and alleged misuse of funds. While some protests have led to concessions, experts note the challenge of translating street power into lasting systemic reform amidst government efforts to delegitimize dissent.</p>

          <p>Court documents reveal that the United States government informed Dutch officials months in advance that Nexperia's founding CEO, Zhang Xuezheng, had to be removed to prevent the company from facing expanded U.S. entity list sanctions. The U.S. warned that the blacklist would soon extend to subsidiaries where a listed entity holds over a 50% stake. Nexperia's parent company, Wingtech, was added to the entity list in December, and it fully acquired Nexperia in 2018. This directive led to Zhang's removal, sparking significant anger in Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, under the Trump administration, is dismantling its approach to climate change, cutting research funding and abandoning adaptation plans, despite severe impacts on U.S. troops and military installations. Extreme weather has caused over 10,000 heat-related illnesses among troops since 2018, flooded bases, and undermined operational readiness. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dismissed climate concerns, redirecting focus solely to "training and warfighting." Critics warn this retreat puts troops at risk and creates strategic vulnerability, as other nations continue to integrate climate impacts into their defense strategies.</p>

While the report will prioritize homeland defense and deterring China in the Indo-Pacific, some interpretations suggest a shift towards a "broader, indirect containment strategy through peripheral regions" rather than direct confrontation. This potential reorientation of U.S. defense priorities, also encompassing Russia, is anticipated to redefine Washington's approach to global security and its engagement with major rivals.</p>
