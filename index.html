          <p>During Bryan Kohberger's sentencing for the University of Idaho murders, family members of the victims delivered powerful and emotional impact statements directly to him. The sister of Kaylee Goncalves called Kohberger a "pathetic loser," while Maddie Mogen's father tearfully read the last Father's Day card he received from his daughter. The statements conveyed immense grief and anger, with family members describing the profound loss and the vibrant lives that were taken. Onlookers in the courtroom applauded after Alivea Goncalves's statement, in which she asserted that her sister would have fiercely fought back if she hadn't been attacked in her sleep.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish during the 17th stage. The 160.4km route concluded in a bunch finish after the peloton caught the last breakaway rider with just 4km remaining. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that involved some of Milan's key rivals. This victory strengthens Milan's hold on the green jersey for the points classification, while Tadej Pogacar safely retains the overall leader's yellow jersey with no changes in the top general classification standings.</p>

          <p>Actor Jerry O’Connell disclosed during a comedy show that his wife, Rebecca Romijn, had visited Jeffrey Epstein's private island years ago. He clarified that the visit was strictly for a professional modeling shoot and occurred when she was a supermodel. O'Connell made the impromptu revelation to emphasize the professional context of the visit, stating there was no illicit activity involved. The article also notes the couple's unconventional approach to their finances, as they maintain separate bank accounts and contribute to a joint pot for family expenses, a system they've used during their 18-year marriage.</p>

          <p>New York Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will run for reelection to his House seat in 2026, ending speculation about a potential run for governor against incumbent Kathy Hochul. Lawler stated that after deliberation, he concluded that focusing on his district and helping maintain the Republican House majority was the right decision for his family and constituents. His Hudson Valley district is considered a key battleground seat, and his decision impacts the field of potential Republican challengers to Governor Hochul. The announcement drew a sharp response from Hochul, who criticized Lawler's political alignment with former President Trump.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old man, Michael Gann, has been federally charged with manufacturing and attempting to detonate homemade bombs in New York City. Prosecutors allege he used chemicals purchased online to create multiple improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Gann is accused of storing the bombs on residential rooftops in SoHo and throwing one onto subway tracks on the Williamsburg Bridge. Although no one was injured, authorities highlighted the significant danger, noting one device contained material far exceeding legal firework limits. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

While the National Association of Realtors argues the tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling, analysts believe the primary problem is a lack of confidence and stability. The current tax exemption is $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples, meaning it primarily affects those in high-cost areas or who have owned their homes for decades.

          <h2>Handwritten Edits on Trump's Briefing Card Raise Questions About Japan Trade Deal</h2>

          <p>Details of the newly announced trade deal with Japan appear to have been altered by hand on President Trump's briefing card just before its announcement. A photo shows that a proposed 10% tariff rate was changed with a marker, and a $400 billion investment figure was crossed out and replaced with "500." However, Trump's official announcement on Truth Social cited a 15% tariff and a $550 billion investment, creating confusion about the final terms. The discrepancies have left Wall Street analysts and Japanese officials with different interpretations of the agreement's specifics, particularly regarding the investment plan.

          <p>Two vessels collided in the German North Sea port of Cuxhaven, resulting in an estimated 6,000 liters of oil spilling into the harbor. The incident involved the 60-meter tanker Capella and the offshore supply ship Coastal Legend. Emergency crews have deployed oil booms to contain the spill and mitigate environmental damage. Officials stated that shipping traffic on the nearby Elbe River was not affected, and no injuries were reported among the crew. An investigation is underway, with initial police reports suggesting the tanker's captain may have misjudged the circumstances leading to the crash.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer (M&S) advertisement after ruling that the model featured in it appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog determined that the model's pose, combined with clothing choices like large, pointed shoes, irresponsibly emphasized her slenderness. The ASA ordered that the ad must not appear again in its current form.

          <p>For homeowners struggling to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), financial experts recommend several strategies to improve their approval odds. Lenders are tightening underwriting standards due to higher interest rates, making it crucial for applicants to have a strong financial profile. Key steps include checking and improving credit scores, reducing overall debt to lower the debt-to-income ratio, and ensuring all financial documents are in order. If denied, borrowers should ask the lender for the specific reasons and consider alternatives like a fixed-rate home equity loan, a cash-out refinance, or a personal loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, two former traders jailed in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal, have had their convictions overturned by the UK Supreme Court. The court ruled that their original trials were unfair due to flawed jury directions, making the convictions unsafe. The two men, who spent years in prison, have long maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for what were normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The ruling is a major vindication for the traders and could lead to other convictions in the scandal being quashed.</p>

          <p>Amazon is closing its artificial intelligence research lab in Shanghai as part of a broader cost-cutting and strategic adjustment effort within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit. The closure is attributed to ongoing U.S.-China geopolitical tensions, which have prompted many American tech firms to reduce their operational footprint in China. The lab, established in 2018, focused on natural language processing and machine learning. This move follows Amazon's previous retreats from the Chinese market, including the discontinuation of its Kindle e-book store and e-commerce marketplace in recent years.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's recent actions and statements regarding his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein are unconvincing and suggest guilt. The author points to Trump's denial of writing a note in Epstein's birthday scrapbook, his attempts to kill the story, and his efforts to deflect by attacking political opponents. The piece highlights the contrast between Trump's professed lack of interest in the Epstein case and his sudden release of documents on Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. The author concludes that Trump's frantic evasions and deflections are more indicative of a person with something to hide.</p>

The demonstrations were sparked by a new law that grants the politically appointed prosecutor general more control over two historically independent anti-corruption agencies, NABU and SAPO. Protesters and critics, including EU officials, fear the move undermines Ukraine's fight against graft and could jeopardize its path to EU membership. Zelenskyy has defended the changes, claiming they are necessary to remove alleged Russian influence from the agencies while acknowledging public concern.</p>
