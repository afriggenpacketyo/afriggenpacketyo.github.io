          <p>A coalition of four European countries—the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark—has collectively pledged over $1 billion to purchase American-made weapons for Ukraine. This initiative follows a new arrangement announced by President Trump, allowing NATO allies to fund and transfer U.S. arms to aid in Ukraine's defense. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude for the support, which includes crucial components for Patriot air defense systems. The cooperation aims to bolster Ukraine's capabilities against intensifying Russian attacks, marking a significant European contribution to the ongoing conflict.</p>

As part of the deal, the 94-year-old media mogul will provide Trump's legal team with regular, sworn updates on his health status. The arrangement addresses concerns raised by Trump's lawyers about Murdoch's ability to testify in the future due to his age and health. This unusual stipulation temporarily pauses the legal proceedings until a judge rules on the motion to dismiss the case.</p>

          <p>Holly Paz, a key IRS official who was a deputy during the Obama-era Tea Party targeting controversy, has been placed on administrative leave. This action follows allegations from Republican lawmakers that a new sub-department she was leading had become politicized and was unfairly targeting conservative-leaning businesses. The unit, created to audit pass-through entities, was criticized for using politically charged language and adopting an aggressive approach. The move to place Paz on leave signals a response from IRS leadership to concerns about ideological bias within the agency's enforcement divisions.</p>

The data highlights Germany's ongoing challenge with an aging population, placing it below the European Union average of 10.7% for this age group. The article also touches on other German news, including a trial for spying for China and a study on Ukrainian refugee preferences.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration's planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could eventually escalate to as high as 250%. The proposed tariffs are part of a strategy to encourage drug companies to relocate their manufacturing operations to the United States. This measure is being pursued under a Section 232 national security investigation into pharmaceutical imports. The pharmaceutical industry has warned that such high tariffs could lead to increased drug costs, disrupt supply chains, and deter investment in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European countries offer widely varying levels of support to Ukrainian refugees, despite operating under a common EU directive for temporary protection. In Germany, refugees receive 'Bürgergeld' payments equivalent to domestic welfare, along with housing and health insurance coverage, making it one of the most generous nations. In contrast, Poland provides access to services but no monthly stipend, while Hungary offers minimal financial aid. This analysis highlights the lack of a standardized financial response across the EU, with each country implementing its own policies on housing, employment, and monetary assistance for those fleeing the war.</p>

However, the review found the actual savings from unspent obligated funds were closer to $165 million.

          <p>A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to convert home equity into cash, but concerns exist about outliving the loan. The loan does not expire or become due as long as the borrower lives in the home and meets obligations like paying taxes and insurance. However, it is possible to outlive the home's equity, as the loan balance grows with interest and can eventually exceed the property's value, leaving little for heirs. As a non-recourse loan, the borrower or their estate will never owe more than the home's sale price, providing a key protection for long-living seniors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has raised its full-year profit guidance for 2025, attributing the optimistic outlook to successful cost-cutting measures and strong business performance. The company also reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by robust sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The updated forecast now projects adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share. This positive revision comes as the company navigates potential impacts from the Trump administration's drug pricing policies and proposed tariffs on pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lindsay and Craig Foreman, a British couple detained in Iran since January on espionage charges, have been permitted to make their first phone calls to family after months without direct contact. The couple, who were on a round-the-world trip, have been held in separate prisons, a situation their family describes as a traumatic ordeal. Their son reported that the brief calls were emotional but confirmed his parents are 'holding strong' despite the circumstances. The family continues to call on the UK government to recognize them as hostages and intensify efforts to secure their release.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers, who left their state to block a Republican-led redistricting bill, held a press conference in Illinois alongside Governor JB Pritzker and DNC Chair Ken Martin. They condemned the plan to create five new GOP-leaning congressional districts as an attempt to disenfranchise minority voters and subvert the Voting Rights Act. The Democrats' departure from Texas denied the state legislature the quorum needed to vote on the bill. In response, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested, escalating the high-stakes political standoff.</p>

          <p>The New York Times has published previously unseen letters and photographs related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, revealing new details about his extensive network of powerful connections. The letters, written by figures such as filmmaker Woody Allen and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, were part of a birthday gift for Epstein. Photos from inside his Manhattan mansion show him with numerous famous individuals and reveal unsettling decor, including prosthetic eyeballs and a sculpture of a woman in a bridal gown.

          <p>A devastating flash flood and landslide have struck a village in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, resulting in at least four confirmed deaths and leaving 50 people missing.

          <p>The House Ethics Committee has issued a reprimand to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for inconsistencies in how she identified her fiancé, Riley Roberts, in official documents. The committee's report noted that she listed Roberts as her 'spouse' on paperwork for privately sponsored travel, such as the 2021 Met Gala, which granted him benefits reserved for spouses. However, he was not listed as a spouse on her financial disclosure filings, which would have required revealing his financial holdings. The committee criticized this discrepancy while closing its investigation into her Met Gala attendance after she repaid outstanding costs.</p>

The healthcare and social assistance sector remains a key driver of employment, accounting for nearly half of all growth over the past year. In contrast, sectors like professional services and manufacturing have been shedding jobs, contributing to what some experts describe as a challenging 'white collar' job market.

          <p>Despite being on the verge of eradication, the global campaign against polio is facing a significant comeback, fueled by deep-rooted mismanagement and strategic failures. An investigation reveals that in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last two countries with uninterrupted transmission, health workers have been pressured to falsify vaccination records. Furthermore, the campaign's reliance on an oral vaccine has inadvertently sparked new outbreaks in areas with low immunization rates. Insiders and internal documents point to a persistent failure by leadership to address these on-the-ground problems, undermining the decades-long, multi-billion-dollar public health effort.</p>

His legacy is complex, as he was lauded by some for steering the country toward a market economy but also faced accusations of crimes against humanity for his role in the violent 1989 revolution and the subsequent brutal crackdown on protesters in 1990. Though he was indicted, he was never convicted.</p>
