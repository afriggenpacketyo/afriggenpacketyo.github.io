          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a massive legislative package championed by President Trump, voting 218-214 to approve trillions in tax cuts and increased spending on defense and immigration enforcement. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, is offset by significant cuts to social programs like Medicaid. The passage followed a contentious overnight session where Republican leadership overcame internal opposition, while Democrats strongly criticized the bill's projected impact on the federal deficit and healthcare coverage for millions of Americans.

          <p>Edward Kelley, a Tennessee man who was pardoned by President Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison for a separate federal conviction. The new sentence is for a conspiracy plot to assassinate FBI agents and incite a "civil war" while he was under investigation for the Capitol attack. Prosecutors argued that Kelley was remorseless and had created a "kill list" of law enforcement personnel, demonstrating that the presidential pardon did not extend to these subsequent crimes.</p>

          <p>Budget airline Ryanair has announced it will increase its free personal cabin bag size allowance by 20 percent, to new dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 20cm. The change aligns with a broader EU initiative to standardize minimum hand luggage sizes across airlines, aiming to reduce passenger confusion and unexpected fees at the gate. While Ryanair's new size is more generous than the new EU minimum, it still differs from the allowances of some of its low-cost competitors.</p>
