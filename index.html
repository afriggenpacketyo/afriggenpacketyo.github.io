        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. automakers are recalibrating their electric vehicle strategies following the Trump administration's moves to eliminate EV subsidies and mandates. Companies like Tesla and Rivian anticipate financial headwinds due to the termination of the $7,500 tax credit and the end of the regulatory credit system that benefited them. In response, Ford is pivoting towards a broader range of hybrid vehicles, viewing them as more aligned with current consumer demand, while General Motors anticipates a short-term rush on EVs before a subsequent slowdown. This policy shift is forcing a significant re-evaluation of production plans and capital allocation across the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

He informed law enforcement that his son, Patrick Joseph White, had become fixated on the COVID-19 vaccine, blaming it for his depression and suicidal thoughts. A neighbor corroborated this, stating White deeply believed the vaccines were harmful, though they never expected him to become violent. The attack resulted in damage to multiple CDC buildings and the death of DeKalb County Officer David Rose, a Marine veteran.</p>

The club plans to buy 50 shares of Palo Alto Networks and 75 shares of Starbucks, increasing its holdings in both companies. The rationale for the Starbucks purchase is the confirmed progress of its turnaround plan, while the Palo-Alto Networks buy is driven by the strategic value of its recent acquisition of CyberArk, despite initial market uncertainty. The article notes that trading was delayed due to rules restricting trades after a stock is mentioned on television. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an unusual arrangement with the Trump administration, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenues from certain chip sales to China. This deal secures export licenses for Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were previously restricted, allowing them to regain access to the lucrative Chinese market. While the deal provides short-term certainty for the companies, it raises long-term questions about potential future government cuts and China's reaction to the policy. Investors have reacted mildly, viewing 85% of revenue as preferable to zero, though the move sets a new precedent for U.S. tech trade. (not investment advice)</p>

The new tariffs may trigger a downturn in labor-intensive sectors like garment manufacturing, which employs millions of lower-skilled workers, while pushing capital toward less labor-reliant technology industries. Furthermore, the U.S. plan to penalize "transshipment" of Chinese goods through these countries could devastate industries that perform final assembly on Chinese materials. These factors, combined with an influx of cheap Chinese goods, risk suppressing wages and slowing wealth accumulation for the poor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall across several Midwest states has caused widespread flooding, leading to road closures, power outages, and vehicle abandonments. The Milwaukee area was particularly hard-hit, receiving up to 14 inches of rain, with one 24-hour period marking the city's second-wettest day on record. The severe weather forced the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair and prompted the Red Cross to open shelters for displaced residents. In Nebraska, strong winds associated with the storms resulted in one fatality after a tree fell on a car.</p>

          <p>A state law in Ohio is forcing public school districts like Dayton's to find transportation for private and charter school students, often at the expense of their own. Due to a shortage of drivers and buses, and facing potential fines for non-compliance, Dayton Public Schools has cut busing for about 2,000 of its high school students. This leaves families to bear the significant cost of private transport or rely on public transit, which has raised safety concerns. The situation stems from a wider conservative push for school choice initiatives, which critics argue unfairly burdens public school systems and their most vulnerable families.</p>

The reviewer finds the book's proposals, such as ending the filibuster and raising taxes on wealth, to be a familiar progressive wish list rather than a novel plan. The critique centers on the book's perceived failure to engage with the reality of right-wing populism and the actual political views of ordinary Americans. The reviewer argues that simply advocating for more democracy is insufficient without understanding and persuading citizens who may not share a progressive worldview.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese aerospace engineers has developed a new stealth launcher designed to capture space debris without creating harmful vibrations or secondary fragments. The device uses a closed-gas mechanism that ignites a small charge to propel a projectile, such as a net, toward a target. Unlike conventional launchers, it produces no smoke or light, and a unique energy-absorbing ring near the muzzle mitigates the recoil, protecting the launch platform.

Murray is reported to be in stable condition, while the community held a vigil for both the injured priest and the deceased man.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed federal agents across Washington, D.C., in a stated effort to remove homeless individuals and crack down on crime. The President announced the move on social media, vowing to jail criminals and hold a press conference on the matter. This action comes despite official statistics showing that violent crime in the city reached a 30-year low last year. Reports from the scene described dozens of agents, some carrying military-style rifles, creating a tense atmosphere and raising concerns among residents, particularly those in homeless encampments who fear their displacement.</p>

          <p>Former government officials are sounding the alarm about the nation's preparedness for biological threats following the dismantling of key White House biosecurity units. The National Security Council’s biosecurity directorate and the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy are now effectively defunct under the Trump administration. Authors of the article, who previously led these efforts, argue that without a dedicated, high-level team to coordinate responses, the U.S. is more vulnerable to outbreaks like Ebola or a future pandemic. They contend that the system that successfully contained a 2021 Ebola outbreak no longer exists, increasing the risk that future diseases could reach American shores.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his country will officially recognize a Palestinian state, a decision to be formalized at the UN General Assembly in September. This move aligns Australia with other Western nations like France, Britain, and Canada that have signaled similar intentions. Albanese described the decision as a practical contribution towards a two-state solution, which he called "humanity's best hope" to end the conflict and the "humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza. The recognition is predicated on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no role for Hamas in government and the demilitarization of Gaza.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed that the term "artificial general intelligence" (AGI) is becoming less useful as AI capabilities advance rapidly. He noted that with multiple, shifting definitions, the concept of an AI that can perform any human intellectual task has become too vague. Instead of a binary "is it AGI or not?" distinction, Altman suggests it is more productive to think about continuous levels of progress in AI capability. Other experts agree, arguing the sci-fi-tinged term can be a distraction from the tangible, specialized progress being made and is often used as hype to drive funding.</p>

Currently, 147 of the 193 UN member states already recognize Palestine, with many of these recognitions dating back to 1988. However, full UN membership remains blocked by the United States' veto power in the Security Council.

Global financial markets reacted positively to the news, with stocks rising and safe-haven assets like gold declining. The talks are expected to provide a boost to the Russian economy and could lead to investment opportunities, even as concerns remain about potential concessions from Ukraine.

          <p>A recent spending bill signed by President Trump has provided a nearly $170 billion boost to the Department of Homeland Security, powering a sweeping expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This funding underpins the administration's agenda for mass deportations, with ICE now working to establish detention sites at military bases. The massive, vaguely detailed allocation of funds is raising alarms among lawmakers from both parties, who are demanding more oversight into how the money is being spent. Critics argue the funding enables a fundamental shift in immigration policy, moving enforcement deep into American communities. (not investment advice)</p>

According to a Reuters report, some villagers are being offered as little as $12 per square meter of land, along with rice provisions, causing fear about their future livelihoods. The project, a joint venture with a Vietnamese real estate company, received unusually fast approval as Vietnam was negotiating to lower U.S. trade tariffs.

The Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 workers, reports that fear surrounding ICE raids and an unwelcoming atmosphere are deterring international and domestic visitors, particularly from Canada and Mexico. This has led to a drop in visitor numbers and subsequent layoffs in the hospitality sector.

The other "reformist" camp, including leaders from Vanderbilt and Washington University, argues that universities must proactively address valid concerns about campus ideology and anti-Semitism to regain public trust. This fundamental disagreement has led to public spats, separate lobbying efforts, and paralysis on unified action, weakening the sector's collective response to political threats.</p>

          <p>The British government is considering a major revision of driving laws that could require motorists over the age of 70 to pass compulsory eye tests to remain on the road. This proposal is part of a new road safety strategy that also includes potentially lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's. The move follows a coroner's report which called the UK's reliance on driver self-reporting for vision problems the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight. The government aims to address the nearly 1,600 annual road deaths with tougher, more proactive safety measures.</p>
