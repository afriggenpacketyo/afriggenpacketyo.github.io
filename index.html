          <p>The Dallas Mavericks' general manager, Nico Harrison, has commented on the team's decision to trade Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers, a move that has drawn criticism from fans. Harrison acknowledged the importance of Doncic to the fan base but admitted he underestimated the level of attachment. He suggested that injuries to key players acquired in the trade, such as Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, exacerbated the negative reaction, as the team failed to achieve its anticipated championship caliber. The Lakers' acquisition of Doncic has significantly bolstered their NBA championship aspirations. </p>

          <p>Norwich City has dismissed head coach Johannes Hoff Thorup following a series of defeats, appointing former Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere as interim manager for the remaining two games of the season. Thorup's tenure lasted less than a year, marked by a poor run of form despite the team's strong goal-scoring record. Sporting director Ben Knapper cited recent results as the reason for the change, while expressing gratitude for Thorup's efforts. Wilshere, previously a first-team coach and manager of Arsenal's under-18 team, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley.</p>

          <p>Florida's public universities are facing scrutiny for their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), with multiple institutions signing agreements that grant campus police immigration enforcement powers. These agreements, described as "force multipliers for ICE," allow campus police to question, arrest, and prepare charges for suspected immigration violations. This collaboration, spearheaded by Governor Ron DeSantis, has led to revoked visas and student protests. The agreements are unprecedented and raise concerns about academic freedom and the targeting of students based on their speech or past actions.</p>

Policing Minister Diana Johnson countered that the plan is unworkable and would hinder monitoring of antisemitism and other racist incidents. NCHIs are defined as alleged acts perceived as motivated by hostility or prejudice but do not constitute a criminal offense. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs are causing economic anxiety and altering consumer behavior, with consumer confidence plummeting and panic-buying of goods expected to face price hikes. Surveys of manufacturers indicate a pessimistic outlook, suggesting the tariffs are hindering rather than reviving American manufacturing. While consumers are currently stocking up on certain items, economists anticipate a pullback in spending due to the economic uncertainty created by the tariffs. These shifts in economic activity raise concerns about a potential recession. </p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Pentagon to re-evaluate missile defense, potentially leading to the development of a complex and costly "Golden Dome" system. A key component would likely be space-based interceptors designed to engage missiles early in flight. While defense companies have expressed interest, experts caution that such a system would be significantly more challenging than existing missile defenses like Israel's Iron Dome. Concerns include the high cost of building and maintaining a vast satellite constellation, as well as the potential for triggering a new nuclear arms race. </p>
