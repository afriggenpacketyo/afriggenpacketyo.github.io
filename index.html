          <p>The US-China Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement (STA), signed in 1979, is a critical indicator of the relationship between the two nations, according to expert Denis Simon. Originally a cornerstone for building trust, the agreement now sits at a tense intersection of national security, economic competition, and techno-nationalism. The very openness that fostered collaboration is now viewed by some as a vulnerability, raising debates about intellectual property and strategic competition. The future of the STA is considered a bellwether for the broader direction of US-China engagement.</p>

          <p>The death toll from severe flooding in Texas has climbed to at least 78, with state and local officials providing updated figures. In hard-hit Kerr County, 68 fatalities have been confirmed, including 28 children, while search efforts persist for those still missing, including campers from Camp Mystic. A major disaster declaration has been signed for the county, enabling federal resources from FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard to assist in the ongoing search, rescue, and recovery operations. The tragedy has prompted a large-scale response from multiple government agencies.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris celebrated an emotional first victory at his home British Grand Prix, in a race marked by changing weather and on-track incidents. The McLaren driver inherited the lead after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, received a controversial 10-second penalty for an alleged safety-car infringement while leading. Norris, who sustained a minor facial injury from his trophy during celebrations, expressed immense pride in winning at Silverstone. The event was challenging for all drivers, with Piastri left stewing over a penalty he felt was unjust.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon organizers have issued an apology after a human error led to the deactivation of the electronic line-calling system during a fourth-round match. The malfunction resulted in three missed calls in a single game, with one particularly crucial point causing Russian player Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova to protest. The chair umpire, unaware of the system failure, ordered a replay of the point, which Pavlyuchenkova argued should have been her game. While she ultimately won the match, the incident has sparked debate about the need for video reviews and the umpire's role in overriding technology.</p>

The early assumption that close proximity and economic integration would naturally foster deeper appreciation between the two has proven false. Instead, misunderstandings and misjudgments from both sides have complicated the dynamic. Fully grasping the intricacies of Chinese politics and appreciating Hong Kong's unique identity are presented as essential for navigating the future of the "one country, two systems" framework.</p>

Pundits point to recurring issues, including inconsistent batting from key players like Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley, and the high cost of runs conceded by spinner Shoaib Bashir.

          <p>A Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, was destroyed by a powerful explosion after an SUV crashed into the building and ruptured a natural gas line. Two occupants of the vehicle were rescued by courageous bystanders just minutes before the building was engulfed in flames and subsequently exploded. The blast also caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, though no one was inside the buildings at the time. No injuries were reported from the explosion itself, and multiple people from the three-vehicle crash were hospitalized.</p>

          <p>A provision within the recently passed "megabill" is being described as a major victory for the anti-abortion movement, as it will bar Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid reimbursements. This defunding applies not only to abortion services but to all healthcare they provide, including prenatal care, vaccinations, and screenings. Reproductive rights advocates warn this will have a devastating impact on healthcare access for vulnerable communities, as Planned Parenthood is often the only provider in many areas. The measure represents a significant new front in restricting reproductive care access post-Roe v. Wade.</p>

          <p>The FBI is alerting homeowners in New Hampshire about a rise in quit claim deed fraud, a scam that has cost residents over $4 million in recent years. So-called 'title pirates' forge documents to illegally transfer property ownership, often targeting vacant lands, vacation homes, or properties owned by the elderly. The scammers then sell the property or take out a mortgage on it without the true owner's knowledge. Authorities are urging property owners to be vigilant, consider title insurance, and utilize county alert services to protect themselves from this devastating form of theft.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," following a public feud with President Trump over a massive tax and spending bill. Musk, a vocal critic of the bill's impact on the national deficit, is positioning his new venture as an alternative to the "one-party system." The move was met with skepticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who suggested Musk should focus on his businesses rather than politics. This development marks a significant break between the tech billionaire and the administration he previously advised.</p>

          <p>A White House economic adviser has indicated that the "rough outlines" of several international trade deals are becoming clear as a key tariff deadline approaches. With a 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs set to expire, the administration is finalizing some agreements while preparing to send letters to other nations where talks are less advanced. The strategy appears to be encouraging foreign countries to open their markets to US products or face tariffs. The administration believes this approach is also driving a record rate of onshoring production back to the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the National Weather Service issuing timely watches and warnings based on record atmospheric moisture, the sheer intensity and specific location of the rainfall were hard to pinpoint precisely.

He stated that criminal gangs are now operating freely, and new armed groups affiliated with powerful local families are emerging as contenders for control.
