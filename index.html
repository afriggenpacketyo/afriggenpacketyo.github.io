          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in Fresno County, California, near Naval Air Station Lemoore. The pilot managed to eject safely from the aircraft before the impact and was not injured, with no other personnel affected by the incident. The jet, attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron, went down around 6:30 p.m., sparking a small grass fire that was subsequently contained. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation by naval authorities.</p>

However, major trading partners like China, India, Canada, and Mexico have not yet reached agreements and face the prospect of higher duties.

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean experienced a significant surge, rising over 16% after the announcement of a new trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. The deal sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a development that investors appear to view favorably for the company. Hanwha Group is expected to increase investment in its U.S. facilities, including the Philly Shipyard, contributing to American shipbuilding efforts. The stock's rise was also supported by strong second-quarter profits and recent new orders. (not investment advice)</p>

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated they fired "warning shots" at a gathering near aid trucks but were not aware of casualties from their gunfire. This incident adds to a rising death toll of people seeking aid, with the UN warning that famine is currently unfolding in Gaza.

          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing a 25% tariff, India has not rushed to secure a trade agreement, holding firm on key national interests. New Delhi has resisted demands for greater market access for American agricultural products to protect its large farming population, a critical voting bloc. Analysts suggest India's strategy is bolstered by its relatively low export dependency on the U.S. and its "multi-alignment" approach of forging trade deals with other partners like the UK and EU. This diversification provides India with leverage in negotiations with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings fell after its first-quarter earnings report, despite meeting overall revenue and earnings estimates. The company's revenue from smartphone royalties, its largest business segment, showed weaker-than-expected growth. The company also confirmed it is exploring designing its own processors or chiplets, a strategic shift that could turn some of its current customers into competitors. While Arm provided a stable forecast for the next quarter, investor concern over slowing royalty growth and future strategy impacted the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law in California that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. This "wobbler" provision targets older predators while avoiding harsher penalties for all younger offenders. The bill was amended after initial controversy, with some lawmakers expressing concern that vague language could lead to profiling of minority and low-income individuals.</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic rift is emerging between the United States and its key allies, including the UK, France, and Canada, over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These nations have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the Trump administration opposes and boycotted a recent UN conference about. This analysis suggests the U.S. currently lacks a clear long-term vision for the governance of Gaza beyond supporting Israel's immediate military objectives. The European and Canadian push for a two-state solution is seen as an attempt to fill a strategic vacuum left by Washington.</p>

          <p>Following an outcry from residents, Los Angeles city leaders have moved to restrict the construction of duplexes in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which was devastated by a wildfire in January. The decision came after Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order allowing areas in high fire hazard zones to be exempt from SB 9, a state law promoting housing density. Residents feared that increased density would worsen evacuation dangers in future fires. While duplexes are being restricted, the building of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) has been streamlined and widely adopted by homeowners rebuilding in the area.</p>

The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which the company claims would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The group estimates its plan would cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035, arguing it presents a lower-risk and more cost-effective solution. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the airport's expansion.</p>
