          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to approve COVID-19 vaccine updates for high-risk groups but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new top vaccines official, Dr. Vinay Prasad, stated that the agency is seeking a balance between providing rapid access for vulnerable people and ensuring evidence for those at average or low risk. Vaccine makers are urged to conduct new randomized studies, with interim results potentially available next year.</p>

          <p>At least two Navy SEALs from Team 4 are facing disciplinary measures after sharing racist memes, including one depicting slavery, in a Signal chat directed at a Black fellow SEAL. The memes, which resurfaced after being reported by the targeted sailor, led to an investigation that also revealed failures in addressing the sailor's concerns about racist behavior. The Navy is dedicated to fostering a climate of dignity and respect, and accountability actions are ongoing, according to a Naval Special Warfare Command spokesperson. The acting Pentagon press secretary emphasized the importance of merit over immutable characteristics and ridding the Department of Defense of divisive DEI agendas.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has strongly condemned Israel's bombing of Gaza, describing the situation as "intolerable" and warning of a "dark new phase in this conflict." In response, the UK has suspended talks over a new trade deal with Israel and is reportedly considering sanctions on top Israeli officials. Lammy's remarks signal a significant shift in UK-Israel relations, with the UK accusing Israel of "cruel and monstrous extremism." The UK is calling for an end to the blockade and the allowance of aid into Gaza, where there are rising concerns about starvation and a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Japan's export growth has slowed for the second consecutive month, according to recent government data, as the country grapples with the impact of U.S. tariffs. Exports grew by only 2%, the slowest pace since October of the previous year, while imports shrank by 2.2%. Japan's economy contracted in the first quarter, partly due to stagnant private consumption and slowing export growth. The United States currently levies a 25% tariff on Japanese auto, steel, and aluminum exports, adding to the economic strain.</p>

          <p>Japan is reportedly considering easing its demand for a full removal of U.S. tariffs, potentially accepting lower duty rates to reach a trade agreement with the United States. This shift comes as President Donald Trump shows reluctance to fully address Japan's initial demands. Top tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa is scheduled to visit the United States for a third round of bilateral talks. This adjustment reflects the challenges Japan faces in navigating trade negotiations amidst ongoing trade tensions and the need to secure favorable economic terms with the U.S.</p>

          <p>NFL owners are considering a proposal to ban the "Tush Push" play, a controversial short-yardage tactic popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Packers' proposal cites "player safety" and "pace of play" as reasons for the ban. While some coaches express safety concerns, NFL executive Jeff Miller argues that data does not support safety being an issue with the push. Jason Kelce, an Eagles player, has described the play as "grueling" but does not consider it particularly dangerous, while others like Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu call it a "cheapo play."</p>

Jurors also saw evidence of weapons with defaced serial numbers recovered from Combs' Miami Beach residence.

          <p>The global economy has responded positively to a US-China tariff truce, signaling a potential step back from a damaging trade decoupling. While the truce is currently a 90-day reprieve, it indicates that neither side is willing to completely sever economic ties. Despite remaining tariffs still casting a shadow over bilateral trade, most business leaders expect tariffs on Chinese goods to either hold steady or decrease further after the 90-day period lapses. The truce also raises hope for resolutions on other contentious issues, such as fentanyl.</p>

The UK is responding to the scale of the humanitarian crisis and growing pressure from MPs and the public. The Israeli government has been warned it must end its "egregious" military expansion and "immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza."</p>
