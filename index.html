          <h2>Shingles Vaccine Linked to Lowered Heart Disease Risk in New Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer protection against cardiovascular events such as stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease for up to eight years. The research, involving over one million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in those who received the vaccine, with the protective effect being more pronounced in men, individuals under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles through vaccination may reduce blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, which can contribute to heart disease, while also noting that further research is needed on recombinant vaccines like Shingrix to confirm similar benefits. The CDC recommends the two-dose shingles vaccine starting at age 50, given the increased risk of shingles with age.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company outperformed Wall Street's expectations in the first quarter but has suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing an anticipated $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs. The company plans to offset $1 billion of these costs through remediation efforts, but the remaining $1.5 billion impact and near-term risks, including potential supply chain disruptions and further tariffs, prompted the decision to withdraw the guidance. The tariff impact on Ford is less than that projected for General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles. The automotive industry faces challenges from tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts not compliant with the USMCA.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough, nearing his 99th birthday, is releasing a new film titled Ocean, which he believes is crucial for saving biodiversity and combating climate change, arguing that the ocean is humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime, showing the damage caused by bottom trawling and its contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the grim reality, Attenborough remains optimistic, highlighting the ocean's remarkable ability to recover, citing the recovery of whale populations after the ban on commercial whaling. He hopes the film will inspire leaders to take action at an upcoming UN conference to protect a third of the world's oceans, emphasizing that a healthier ocean ecosystem can trap more carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA, citing ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have led to numerous delays and cancellations. Schumer attributes the problems to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, outdated technology, and depleted federal funds. He also questioned why Newark was excluded from a bonus offered to air traffic controllers in other locations, calling the situation a "mess" that requires a deep look into the FAA's administrative, operational, and capital functions. United Airlines is cutting flights at Newark due to the disruptions, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to release a plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>China's e-commerce giants, including Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan, are engaged in a new battle centered on "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. This service offers consumers in major cities the convenience of receiving a wide range of products, from fast fashion to everyday items, within an hour, often subsidized to be very affordable. China's advanced transport and warehousing infrastructure, along with powerful algorithms and a large delivery workforce, make this possible, but investors are concerned about the intensified competition and the potential for a zero-sum fight among platforms. The article notes that the working conditions of delivery couriers, who are part of China's gig economy, have raised concerns about insufficient social security and long working hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has urged a federal district court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas challenging the FDA's actions that expanded access to mifepristone, a widely used abortion pill. Justice Department lawyers argue that the states lack legal standing and that the case was filed in an improper venue, echoing arguments made by the Biden administration previously. The lawsuit seeks to roll back changes made by the FDA beginning in 2016, including allowing mifepristone to be taken up to 10 weeks into a pregnancy and dispensing the medication through the mail. The administration contends that the states waited too long to challenge the FDA's actions and that the lawsuit has no connection to the Northern District of Texas.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation into a Washington State law that requires clergy members to report confessions of child abuse or neglect, claiming it violates the First Amendment's religious protections. The law adds clergy to the list of professionals mandated to report such information, without exception for the absolute seal of confidentiality, particularly affecting Catholic Priests. The DOJ argues that the law singles out clergy by not allowing them to rely on religious privileges, as compared to other reporting professionals. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon stated that the law demands that Catholic Priests violate their faith to obey the law, which cannot stand under the Constitution.</p>

While Ford is less affected by tariffs than other automakers because it manufactures most of its vehicles in the United States, it still expects a significant financial impact.

          <p>Alexander Pancoe, an American climber who survived a brain tumor, died while attempting to scale Mount Makalu in the Himalayas. Pancoe, 39, was at Camp 2 of the mountain when he died, and his body is being retrieved. He had previously completed the Explorer's Grand Slam and was climbing Makalu to raise funds for the pediatric blood cancer program of the Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago, where he had already raised $1 million. Pancoe had a history of overcoming challenges, including a near-fatal fall in 2018, and had dedicated his climbs to others who had survived brain tumors.</p>

Ford CEO Jim Farley emphasized the advantage that higher domestic production gives his company.
