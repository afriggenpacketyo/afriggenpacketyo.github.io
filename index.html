          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing President Trump over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling the move unlawful and a violation of state sovereignty. Newsom argues that the deployment, intended to address protests over federal immigration enforcement actions, occurred without his consent and is unnecessary, as local law enforcement is capable of managing the situation. The lawsuit claims that Trump's action infringes on the governor's authority as Commander-in-Chief of the California National Guard and exceeds federal law related to the National Guard. Trump's administration claims the move is necessary to maintain order amid what they characterize as violent protests. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing escalating tensions as protests erupt in response to President Trump's deployment of the National Guard, triggered by recent ICE operations. Demonstrators have taken to the streets, leading to clashes with law enforcement, freeway blockades, and instances of vandalism, including the setting of self-driving cars ablaze. Local officials, including Governor Newsom and Mayor Bass, criticize Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard, viewing it as an inflammatory measure. Law enforcement officials report numerous arrests for offenses ranging from failure to disperse to arson, while authorities strive to maintain order amidst the unrest.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has removed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), asserting the panel had become a "rubber stamp" for vaccines. The move has been met with strong criticism from medical groups, who fear it will undermine public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy's decision follows months of controversy over his handling of public health agencies, including changes to COVID-19 vaccine guidance and spreading misinformation about vaccines. Critics worry that the ACIP will now be filled with individuals who are suspicious of vaccines, potentially endangering public health.</p>

          <p>The National Guard and Marines deployed in Los Angeles will operate under specific rules of engagement, primarily focused on protecting federal buildings and personnel. The troops are instructed to de-escalate situations and will not engage with crowds unless necessary, and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition. These rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. Local law enforcement officials are urging open communication between all agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response.</p>

The governor's response positions him as a leading voice in the Democratic resistance against Trump's policies. The situation presents both risks and opportunities for Newsom, who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028.</p>

Johnson's decision to federalize the Alabama National Guard in 1965 to protect civil rights marchers, drawing parallels to President Trump's recent deployment of the National Guard in California. Johnson's action, taken against the wishes of Governor George Wallace, was prompted by the state's refusal to ensure the safety of activists.
