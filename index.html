          <p>The Marks & Spencer website experienced a complete outage, preventing users from browsing due to ongoing disruptions following a cyberattack the previous month. M&S estimates that the cyberattack will reduce this year's profits by approximately £300 million, with online services expected to be affected until July. The retailer confirmed that some personal customer data, such as telephone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, was stolen during the attack, but payment details and account passwords were not compromised. Police are investigating the incident and focusing on a notorious group of English-speaking hackers known as Scattered Spider.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives has moved forward with a substantial tax and spending bill championed by President Trump, despite significant divisions among Republicans. The bill aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts while introducing new provisions such as breaks for tipped income and auto loans, while also ending green-energy subsidies and increasing military and immigration enforcement spending. Funding for these changes would come from stricter eligibility requirements for food and health programs that assist low-income Americans, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Democrats strongly oppose the legislation, criticizing it for cutting benefits to finance tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed there is an ongoing "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, a claim that has been refuted by Ramaphosa, major political parties in South Africa, and a South African court. Despite these denials, Trump has continued to voice concerns about violence and racist laws allegedly causing white South Africans to flee the country. A South African court ruled in February 2025 that claims of white genocide were unfounded, but acknowledged that murders of farmers are a problem, though there is no indication that these murders are race-driven. The White House released a statement after the meeting doubling down on the administration's unfounded claims of genocide happening in the nation.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong, exceeding 10%, following optimistic earnings reports and a stronger-than-anticipated revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled compared to the previous year, fueled by robust sales, and Xpeng delivered 94,008 vehicles during this period, marking a fourfold increase in sales volume. This improved financial performance has narrowed the company's net loss and boosted its gross margin, with analysts anticipating Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter due to strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The automaker aims to begin mass production of vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving features in China by year-end.</p>

State media reported that parts of the 5,000-ton destroyer's bottom were crushed, causing the vessel to tip off balance. Kim, who was present at the launch, ordered the ship to be restored before a key party meeting in June and demanded that those involved in designing the ship be held responsible for the incident, which he stated "severely damaged the dignity and pride of our nation in an instant." The report did not mention any casualties or injuries resulting from the incident.</p>

The subsidy aims to reduce the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned in subsequent weeks.

During their meeting, Kato expressed concerns about the global economic and financial market impact of uncertainty created by the Trump administration's tariffs, while Bessent did not push Japan for specific exchange rate targets.

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are pressing the EU to take action against seven low-cost airlines for their baggage fee practices, alleging they mislead passengers and cause confusion. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air of unfairly charging additional fees for hand baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines. Passengers can face extra costs of up to €280 to bring on a suitcase. The groups have requested an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, seeking sanctions for these "illegal" practices and demanding a standard luggage allowance be included in ticket purchases.</p>

The accident at the eastern port of Chongjin was caused by a loss of balance while the vessel was being launched. It left “some sections of the warship’s bottom crushed” and the bow was unable to exit the shipway, and Kim said the accident “brought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse” and vowed to hold officials accountable for the “irresponsible errors”.</p>

          <p>Immigration remains a contentious issue in UK politics, with successive governments struggling to assuage public concerns. Figures are expected to show a fall in net migration to the UK, which the Labour government is likely to hail as an early success. The number of Britons naming immigration as one of the most important issues increased from about 2000 onwards. Attitudes to immigration are warming and softening, however concern about migration was at a very high peak in 2016, and it crashed down in 2020, with Brexit having a softening impact.</p>
