        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong debut, reflecting the ongoing electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. The funds will primarily support CATL's new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL has faced challenges, including a revenue drop due to intense competition in China's EV market and scrutiny from the U.S. Pentagon over alleged ties to China's military.</p>

          <p>A report by the Cato Institute reveals that at least 50 Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) had legally entered the US with government permission. This finding contradicts the administration's claim that only undocumented individuals were deported. The report highlights that 21 men were admitted at a port of entry, 24 were granted parole, four were resettled as refugees, and one entered on a tourist visa. The Trump administration controversially invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport over 200 alleged gang members to the Cecot mega-prison in March.</p>

          <p>President Trump awarded the first-ever Medal of Sacrifice to three Florida deputies posthumously honored for their service. The deputies were killed when they were struck by an SUV while working to restore one of their motorcycles on the shoulder of the road. Eric Trump, who was heavily involved in making the medals become a reality, said the idea came to him while at a service for the officers.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, as a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions provide room for monetary easing. The 1-year loan prime rate was trimmed to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move is part of a broader package of stimulus measures aimed at shoring up the economy, including reductions to deposit rates and the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves. Analysts expect further easing policies from the PBOC, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

Her arrest occurs amid a growing crackdown on dissent in El Salvador and increasingly close ties between the Trump administration and the Bukele government, particularly concerning the imprisonment of migrants deported from the U.S. International human rights organizations have condemned Lopez's arrest, expressing deep concern over the increasing environment of fear in the country.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces significant challenges in passing a sprawling tax and budget bill due to deep divisions within the Republican Party. The article describes how conservative fiscal hawks are demanding deeper cuts to Medicaid and the elimination of clean energy tax credits, while moderate Republicans from swing districts oppose Medicaid cuts and support some clean energy incentives. This internal conflict is further complicated by representatives from high-tax states pushing for higher state and local tax (SALT) deductions, creating a precarious situation for Johnson, who can only afford to lose a few Republican votes. The article suggests that these competing priorities make it difficult to reach a consensus and pass the legislation.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched an investigation into the City of Chicago, prompted by remarks made by Mayor Brandon Johnson highlighting the number of Black officials in his administration. The DOJ's Civil Rights Division is examining whether Chicago is engaging in a pattern of discrimination based on race, violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The investigation was triggered by Johnson's emphasis on filling top-level positions with Black individuals, raising concerns about potential discriminatory hiring practices at lower levels. The DOJ stressed that no conclusions have been made and welcomed Johnsonâ€™s assistance with the investigation.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center, while simultaneously dropping a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 when McIver and other lawmakers visited the detention center, leading to a confrontation with ICE agents. McIver maintains that ICE agents instigated the clash and that the charges are politically motivated, while the U.S. Attorney stated that no one is above the law. The decision to drop the charge against Baraka came after extensive consideration, with the U.S. Attorney inviting him to tour the facility.</p>

President Trump sought a quick solution to delays in the existing Air Force One replacement program, leading to secret coordination between Washington and Doha. While Trump characterized the arrangement as a gift, questions linger about the financial sense of refitting the plane and the potential for Qatari influence.

          <p>The Senate has advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, after overcoming initial Democratic opposition related to concerns over ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family. The legislation aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. While some Democrats like Sen. Mark Warner supported the measure as a "meaningful step forward," others, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, raised concerns about consumer risks and potential corruption. The bill moved forward with a 66-32 vote after negotiations addressed some, but not all, of the initial concerns.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs off the coast of Honolulu are experiencing widespread bleaching due to warming ocean temperatures, a phenomenon that marine scientist Greg Asner compares to "pulling the plug on a TV." According to NOAA, 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress that can cause bleaching, where corals lose their vibrant hues and turn white. While the decline is worse in other regions like the Great Barrier Reef and the Caribbean, the rising heat is speeding up coral deaths, threatening marine life and coastal protection. Efforts are underway to educate tourists and implement solutions like underwater nurseries to help corals recover.</p>
