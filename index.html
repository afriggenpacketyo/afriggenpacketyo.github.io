          <p>Getty Images is allocating millions to combat what its CEO, Craig Peters, describes as a "world of rhetoric" surrounding its lawsuit against Stability AI. Peters asserts that Stability AI, along with other AI labs, is unlawfully using copyright-protected material to train their AI models for commercial purposes, which constitutes unfair competition and theft. Getty Images is suing Stability AI in both the U.K. and U.S., alleging the unauthorized copying of 12 million images, and Stability AI contests these claims. The CEO believes that this lawsuit is important to protect content creators and ensure fair practices within the rapidly evolving AI industry.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising alarms about capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields rise to near-record highs, prompting fears of a carry trade unwind. Analysts suggest that increasing Japanese government bond yields could lead Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering global financial market instability. Some strategists warn of a possible "global financial market Armageddon" if yields continue to climb, impacting U.S. tech stocks and increasing global borrowing costs. However, other analysts believe the carry trade impact may be gradual due to a weaker dollar and eroded confidence in U.S. assets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that European businesses' optimism regarding growth and profitability in China has reached a record low, influenced by economic downturns and escalating geopolitical tensions. The survey, conducted before the intensification of the China-US trade war, reveals that only 29% of respondents are optimistic about growth prospects in China, while a record-high 49% express pessimism about future profitability. Market access and regulatory barriers remain significant concerns, with one-third of respondents not anticipating meaningful improvements. Despite China's commitment to maintaining an open market, foreign businesses are increasingly wary amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines, marking a significant advancement in the country's aeronautics industry. The new alloy turbine blades can withstand temperatures 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. Developed by the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), this innovation is expected to benefit both military and civilian aircraft. This patent reinforces China's leadership in high-performance propulsion technologies by improving the thermal tolerance of the blades, which are critical components in modern jet engines.</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are encountering increasing difficulties due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations, signaling challenges for multinational business ties. A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that nearly three-quarters of companies find it harder to operate there, with a record-low proportion planning to expand operations. Despite curbing investments, some European businesses are increasing their reliance on Chinese components, complicating efforts to shield manufacturing from China's exports. Flat or falling wages in China contribute to weak demand, resulting in broadly low prices and deflation, further impacting European companies.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, marking progress towards sending humans to Mars, but an apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control. The spacecraft spun out of control and re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a non-ideal angle, causing it to mostly burn up, with remaining pieces expected to fall into the Indian Ocean. Despite the "rapid unscheduled disassembly," SpaceX said the test provided valuable data to improve Starship's reliability. The company aims for Starship to be fully reusable, launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance, and this launch incorporated modifications based on lessons from previous failed tests.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley warns that government pledges on crime will not be met without substantial additional funding for policing in the upcoming spending review. He highlights a decade of underinvestment and increasing pressures on police forces, emphasizing that without significant investment, there will be no restoration of neighborhood policing or halving of knife crime and violence against women and girls. The Home Office states it is backing the police with up to £17.6 billion this year, but Sir Mark argues that a lack of investment will perpetuate structural inefficiencies and hinder reform efforts. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is due to deliver her spending review on June 11, outlining funding for public services over the next several years.</p>

This suspension, intended to be temporary, does not affect those with already scheduled interviews. Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to issue guidance on expanded social media screening.

This action occurs amidst Trump's dispute with elite colleges, which he accuses of being too left-wing and fostering antisemitism. Foreign students are typically required to attend interviews at an American embassy in their home country prior to visa approval, and many institutions rely on the tuition fees paid by these students.</p>

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) forecasts that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be between 1.2 and 1.9 degrees Celcius above the pre-industrial average.

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan suggests decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The London Drugs Commission's report, chaired by Lord Falconer, recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) and maintaining it as a controlled substance under the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA). Sir Sadiq Khan supports the report, stating current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalization. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education, while opponents argue that decriminalization would wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful.</p>

The company's fortunes mirror those of corporate Britain, marked by expansion followed by retrenchment and write-downs in asset valuations. While Vodafone has expanded in Germany and the U.K., investors remain cautious due to past false dawns and ongoing concerns about metrics such as free cash flow and EBITDAal (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known as NB.1.8.1, is proliferating in the U.S. following a surge in China, though it's not yet included in federal variant-tracking dashboards. While LP.8.1 remains the dominant strain in the U.S., NB.1.8.1 has led to increased hospitalizations and emergency room visits in Asia. The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring, noting its spread throughout 22 countries, including the U.S. The WHO evaluates the public health risk posed by this variant as low at the global level, current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is visiting Berlin to meet with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, marking their third meeting in as many weeks, highlighting Merz's focus on the war in Ukraine. Merz aims to reestablish German leadership among European allies, especially as U.S. support for Ukraine weakens. Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly the long-range Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden. Merz has reiterated his support for Ukraine and the use of sanctions to pressure Russia to agree to a cease-fire, contrasting with the cooler initial relationship between Zelensky and former Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</p>

United, who are expected to allow Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho to depart this summer, require additional options to support manager Ruben Amorim after a season of low goal output.</p>

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators and human impact. Skomer is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills. Conservationists believe the abundance of food in the area and the absence of predators have contributed to the puffins' thriving population, making it a conservation success story.</p>
