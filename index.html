          <p>This guide provides a comprehensive, hole-by-hole breakdown of the Bethpage Black golf course, the host of the 2025 Ryder Cup. It details the yardage, par, and strategic challenges of each of the 18 holes, from the nerve-wracking first tee to the deceptively sloping final green. The analysis highlights key features such as elevated greens, deep bunkers, and long, arduous par-fours that define the course's notorious difficulty. The article offers insights into how professional players might approach each hole, noting where birdies are possible and where pars represent a significant achievement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic party is missing a political opportunity by promoting far-left figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. The author suggests their socialist-leaning politics and focus on divisive cultural issues are out of step with mainstream American voters. The piece critiques their rhetoric and policy positions, such as Mamdani's stance on Israel and policing, positing that Republicans would welcome them as the face of a hyper-liberal party. It also touches upon Kamala Harris's perceived political weaknesses, framing her as another part of the Democrats' leadership problem.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are projected to have a mixed opening as global investors anticipate the release of new U.S. jobs data. This data is significant as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that a cooling labor market could justify an interest rate cut. In Europe, market watchers are also monitoring consumer confidence reports from France and Germany, with German data suggesting a halt in declining consumer sentiment but remaining at a low level due to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The Swiss National Bank's latest monetary policy update is also in focus following the recent imposition of high U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Co-op has quantified the initial financial damage from a cyber-attack earlier this year, reporting at least £206 million in lost revenue. The security breach, which occurred in April, caused significant disruption, including payment system failures, product shortages, and the theft of data from all 6.5 million members. This incident contributed to the retailer posting a £75 million underlying pre-tax loss for the first half of 2025, a sharp reversal from a profit in the previous year. The company warns that the full financial impact is not yet known and expects further consequences in the latter half of the year.</p>

          <p>Yu Kongjian, the celebrated Chinese landscape architect known for pioneering the "sponge city" concept, has died at age 62 in a plane crash in Brazil. The single-engine Cessna aircraft also claimed the lives of two Brazilian filmmakers and the pilot. Yu was globally recognized for his innovative, nature-based approach to urban design that helps cities manage rainwater and mitigate extreme weather, a concept adopted as national policy in China. Tributes have poured in from world leaders and professional organizations, including Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who praised Yu as a global reference for combining quality of life with environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, has revealed that some Labour MPs have privately encouraged him to launch a leadership challenge against Prime Minister Keir Starmer. In an interview, Burnham did not rule out another run for the party leadership, stating he is ready to play any role to address what he calls an "existential" threat to the Labour party. His comments, made ahead of the party's autumn conference, are seen by many as a potential leadership pitch, coming at a time of internal pressure on Starmer. However, Burnham, who is not currently an MP, would face significant hurdles to initiate such a challenge.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) following a major cyber-attack that has halted the carmaker's production. With JLR's factories shut until at least October, there are growing concerns that smaller firms in the supply chain could face bankruptcy. Ministers are considering several measures, including the government purchasing component parts to maintain cash flow for suppliers or offering government-backed loans. The move comes as the Business and Trade Select Committee prepares to hear evidence on the viability of these businesses, which employ tens of thousands of workers.</p>

The film's global distributor, Neon, condemned the unauthorized edit and demanded that the Chinese distributor, Hishow, cease its distribution. This incident has sparked a debate about censorship and misrepresentation in China, where LGBT content is frequently censored, but the use of AI for such alterations has struck a particular nerve.</p>

Thousands of children are now facing long waits, with many living in pain or discomfort and losing critical days of their childhood and independence.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated that he senses Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is now "much more willing to talk" about a potential peace settlement with Russia. Following a meeting, Lula is reviving a Brazil-China peace plan and reiterated his call for the United Nations to form a contact group to lead negotiations. He noted that while neither side is ready to state its concessions, he believes both leaders understand the limits of the conflict. This diplomatic push follows a rare alignment in March when Brazil and China supported a U.S.-led ceasefire initiative at the UN Security Council.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his visit to the United Nations, demanding an investigation into three separate technical failures. In a social media post, Trump described an escalator coming to a "screeching halt," a teleprompter failing during his speech to the General Assembly, and the auditorium's sound system being off. He asserted these events were not a coincidence and called for security tapes to be reviewed. A UN official suggested the escalator's safety lever was hit accidentally by a member of Trump's entourage, while another noted the sound system was designed for use with translation earpieces.</p>

A memo from the Office of Management and Budget instructed agency heads to identify programs "not consistent with the president's priorities" for potential "reduction in force" (RIF) notices. This aggressive tactic is seen as a way to cut programs opposed by the administration and puts additional pressure on Democrats in the ongoing budget negotiations.

The judge found the policy to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," noting the irreparable harm states would suffer from the loss of disaster funds.

The farm's owners had launched a legal battle to stop the cull, a case that has drawn international attention and led to their brief arrest for obstructing officials. The court's decision halts the execution of the birds while it decides whether to hear the owners' full appeal.

While Nvidia provides an equity investment to start, the majority of the funds will flow back to Nvidia as lease payments for the hardware used in new AI data centers.

The program pays farmers to undertake the restoration, which helps filter water, store carbon, and provide storm resilience, while allowing the farmers to retain ownership of the land. Over the last 15 years, the state has restored more than 500 acres, providing an alternative for aging farmers and preserving land that was originally wetlands before being converted for agriculture.</p>
