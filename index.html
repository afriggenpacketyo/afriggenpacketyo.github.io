        <h2>Proposed California Legislation to Increase Pay for Inmate Firefighters</h2>

        <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill (AB 247) to significantly raise the hourly wages of inmate firefighters, currently earning $5.80 to $10.24 per day.  The bill aims to address concerns about fair compensation for inmates who risk their lives battling wildfires, with supporters including celebrities. While the bill passed a committee, the California State Sheriffsâ€™ Assn. opposes it due to potential financial strain on counties. Former inmate firefighters testified about the dangerous conditions and low pay they endured.</p>

        <h2>Trump's Public Display of Tesla Ownership</h2>

        <p>Former President Trump publicly posed with a Tesla, seemingly endorsing the electric vehicle company despite his past criticisms.  This action is viewed as a move to benefit Elon Musk, a significant donor to Trump's political operations.  The event is notable given Trump's history of opposing electric vehicles and the ethical implications of a former president using his position to promote a private company.</p>

        <h2>Senate Democrats Face Difficult Decision on Government Funding Bill</h2>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The House passed a spending bill to avert a government shutdown, but its future in the Senate is uncertain.  Senate Democrats are divided on whether to support the bill, which includes military spending increases but cuts to non-defense spending.  Some Democrats favor opposing the bill and risking a shutdown, while others worry about the potential consequences of a shutdown under the Trump administration. The bill's passage in the House saw only one Republican defection and one Democrat voting with the Republicans.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The Department of Education under President Trump has laid off over 1,300 workers, significantly reducing its workforce.  This action follows earlier employee departures and is seen as a potential step toward dismantling the department, although this would require Congressional approval.  The Secretary of Education claims the layoffs will not affect core services like student loans or grants.</p>

        <h2>Court Blocks Trump Administration Cuts to Teacher Training Funding</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-11 20:22:35 EDT</div>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for teacher training programs.  The judge sided with eight states that argued the cuts violated administrative law and would harm teacher training programs, exacerbating a teacher shortage.  The administration argued the cuts were justified due to concerns about compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws and has appealed the ruling.</p>
