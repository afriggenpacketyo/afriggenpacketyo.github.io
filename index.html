          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps is deploying approximately 200 service members to Florida to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with non-law enforcement duties. This move is part of a broader Trump administration strategy to use the military for immigration operations, with up to 700 personnel approved for support roles in several states. The Marines will handle administrative and logistical tasks within ICE facilities and are explicitly prohibited from direct contact with detainees. This deployment follows similar actions, including sending troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and Los Angeles, which have sparked controversy over the use of military personnel in domestic immigration matters.</p>

          <p>A targeted drive-by shooting outside the Artis Restaurant and Lounge in Chicago's River North neighborhood resulted in four deaths and fourteen injuries. The incident occurred as patrons were leaving an album release party for a local rapper. Police report that assailants in a dark vehicle fired into the crowd with multiple firearms, possibly including a rifle. Authorities have described the attack as targeted, with some victims being part of the rapper's inner circle. The venue has been temporarily shut down as the investigation continues and the city mobilizes to prevent potential retaliatory violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly utilized emergency applications to the Supreme Court to advance its policy agenda, filing 20 such requests in a 23-week period. This strategy has proven effective, with the court's conservative majority frequently ruling in the administration's favor on its so-called "shadow docket." These rulings have allowed the immediate implementation of contentious policies, such as the ban on transgender service members, bypassing lower court injunctions. This frequent use of emergency requests marks a significant increase compared to previous administrations and has enabled the president to enact major priorities without congressional action.</p>

          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying approximately 20,000 military personnel for a major security operation during the Brics summit, which hosts leaders from 28 countries. The measures include a strict no-fly zone over the summit venue, enforced by armed fighter jets with authorization to shoot down unauthorized aircraft posing a threat. The city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial traffic, with flights rerouted to the international terminal. This level of security, comparable to the 2016 Olympics, highlights the significance of the gathering of major emerging economies from the Global South.</p>

          <p>Central Valley Congressman David Valadao, a Republican, voted in favor of a major legislative package that includes significant cuts to Medicaid, a program that covers roughly two-thirds of his constituents. Despite his previous pledges to protect healthcare, Valadao supported the bill, citing negotiated concessions for his district, including funds for rural hospitals and agriculture. Democrats have vowed to use the vote against him in the highly competitive district, highlighting the bill's estimated $1.04 trillion reduction in federal Medicaid spending. The vote has put Valadao in a precarious political position ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

New work requirements for some Medicaid recipients and major funding cuts to the program are scheduled to start in 2026, potentially leaving millions uninsured. Changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), including stricter work rules and shifting costs to states, will begin this year. The bill also enacts temporary tax changes, such as deductions for tips and an increased SALT deduction cap, while eliminating tax credits for electric vehicles and green home upgrades.

          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations approaching, experts from Canine Companions offer advice on how to manage pets' fear of fireworks. Because dogs have highly sensitive hearing, it is recommended not to bring them to fireworks displays. Instead, owners should exercise their dogs earlier in the day to tire them out and provide mental stimulation like puzzle toys. For dogs sensitive to noise, creating a safe, comfortable space at home, playing white noise, and using calming products like thunder shirts can help mitigate anxiety. The goal is to create a positive association and ensure the pet's safety during the loud festivities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that GLP-1 anti-obesity medications could become more affordable in the U.S. through a simplified payment system for employer-sponsored health plans. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, which inflates list prices. Instead, manufacturers could charge health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month, with employers then contributing a portion of the cost. This would lower out-of-pocket expenses for employees, increase access to these transformative drugs, and reduce the administrative burden of prior authorizations, ultimately improving public health by addressing cardiometabolic disease.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper, the fourth seed at Wimbledon, suffered a surprising second-round loss to 36-year-old veteran Marin Cilic. Draper, who was the highest-seeded British male player since Andy Murray in 2017, stated that his performance was simply not good enough and was not due to pressure. He expressed disappointment with his game on grass this season, noting that his forehand struggled to handle the pace of Cilic's shots. The loss highlighted the challenge of meeting high expectations at his home Grand Slam, with Draper acknowledging he still has many areas to improve.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the American founding, particularly the Declaration of Independence, is often misinterpreted as a celebration of pure individualism. The author contends that the revolution was primarily an effort to restore the colonists' inherited political traditions as Englishmen, which they believed King George III had violated. Furthermore, the declaration's famous assertion that all men are created equal is not a universally self-evident truth but one derived specifically from the West's biblical inheritance, particularly the concept that man is created in God's image. The piece concludes that political and biblical heritage were more influential than revolutionary individualism.</p>

Merit Street, which features right-of-center commentary on "Dr. Phil Primetime," has laid off employees and lists liabilities between $100 million and $500 million.

          <p>A sweeping domestic policy bill passed by the House includes a new temporary tax break for senior citizens, providing an additional standard deduction of $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for couples. The deduction, available for tax filers aged 65 and older from 2025 through 2028, begins to phase out for those with incomes over $75,000. This provision is an income tax deduction and does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits as previously discussed during political campaigns. Analysts note that the benefit is primarily aimed at upper-middle-class seniors, as most lower-income seniors do not have a high enough tax liability to claim it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A High Court in London has sharply criticized Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, for repeatedly misleading courts about an informant who was accused of severe domestic abuse. The case involves a woman, identified as "Beth," whose former partner allegedly used his status as an MI5 informant to intimidate her, claiming he had immunity from prosecution. Despite the agency's head apologizing for providing false evidence, the court slammed MI5's internal investigations as inadequate and called for an independent inquiry. The ruling raises serious questions about the agency's accountability and its long-standing policy of secrecy, known as "Neither Confirm Nor Deny."</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued strength in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' predictions. The unemployment rate fell to a low of 4.1%, according to the Labor Department. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink due to significant cuts. Despite economic uncertainty surrounding trade and fiscal policy, the resilient job numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting interest rates at its upcoming meeting.

          <p>A major tax and spending bill passed by Congress eliminates federal tax incentives for the purchase of electric vehicles (EVs), effective after September 30. The bill terminates the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and the $4,000 credit for used ones, which were designed to make the vehicles more affordable. Advocacy groups express disappointment, stating the change will make EVs inaccessible for many lower- and middle-income buyers. However, experts note that even without the credits, EVs can still be a good long-term financial and environmental choice due to significant savings on fuel and maintenance costs over the vehicle's lifetime.

The man, Andrew Biscay, was confronted by deputies after a woman reported he was near her home and had a history of violence. Officials state that Biscay exited his vehicle and aimed what appeared to be a handgun at the deputies, who opened fire when he refused to drop the weapon. The weapon was later identified as a realistic pellet gun. Biscay's recent prior arrest revealed he possessed a fake marshal jacket, a self-made firearm, and zip ties.</p>
