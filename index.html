            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele stated he would not comply with a U.S. Supreme Court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Trump administration claims Abrego Garcia is a gang member, but admits his deportation was due to an administrative error. Bukele questioned how he could be expected to smuggle a terrorist into the United States and defended his country's progress in reducing crime. Top Trump administration officials also suggested they would not comply with the court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. Optimism score is 75 as it involves a single individual who was deported.</p>

            <p>Apple's stock experienced a boost, pushing its market capitalization back above $3 trillion, following the Trump administration's decision to exempt phones, computers, and chips from new tariffs. Analysts suggest this move could save Apple billions in costs, as the majority of its products are manufactured in China and other Asian countries. Despite the positive news, administration officials cautioned that the exemptions were temporary and subject to change. The stock had previously fallen below the $3 trillion mark after Trump announced "reciprocal tariffs."(not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Four Republican members of the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an order attempting to disenfranchise over 5,000 voters in an effort to overturn a recent state supreme court election. This action is part of an ongoing effort by Judge Jefferson Griffin, the losing Republican candidate, to unseat Democratic Justice Allison Riggs. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the state from certifying the election results, pending further litigation. The situation has been compared to Bush v. Gore, as the court is accused of selectively tossing out ballots in Democratic counties.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering a temporary pause on auto tariffs to allow carmakers more time to relocate production to the U.S. He acknowledged that automakers "need a little bit of time" to shift production from Canada, Mexico, and other countries. Car manufacturers' supply chains are deeply integrated with other nations, making it difficult to produce vehicles entirely in the United States. The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars are expected to increase car prices significantly.</p>
