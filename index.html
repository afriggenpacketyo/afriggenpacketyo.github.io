          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as health secretary, has drawn criticism for suggesting parents are to blame for their children's autism, urging them to conduct extensive research into potential developmental factors, including vaccines. Critics argue that these statements perpetuate harmful misinformation, especially the debunked theory linking vaccines to autism, and place undue burden on parents. The article emphasizes that extensive research has disproven any association between vaccines and autism, and that such narratives distract from essential support and research into improving the quality of life for individuals with autism. It highlights the importance of affirming and neutral information about autism, advocating for better support systems for individuals with disabilities.</p>

          <p>A contested North Carolina Supreme Court race, resolved after six months, has exposed a strategy for candidates to challenge election results retroactively. Despite Democrat Allison Riggs' victory, Republican Jefferson Griffin's legal battle to invalidate 65,000 votes raised concerns about future election integrity. Although a federal judge ultimately halted Griffin's efforts, the state court's initial willingness to entertain such challenges could encourage similar attempts. Election law experts offer conflicting views, with some suggesting federal court pushback will deter future challenges, while others worry about potential exploitation in states with partisan-leaning courts.</p>

          <p>An interview with cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod discusses her book, "The Ideological Brain," which explores how political beliefs are not just beliefs but also neurological signatures. Zmigrod defines ideology as a fixed doctrine resistant to evidence, coupled with a rigid identity influencing judgment. She differentiates ideology from culture and religion by its intolerance of deviation and emphasizes the importance of cognitive flexibility, tested through unconscious assessments like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The article delves into the psychological underpinnings of rigid thinking, linking it to a fear of uncertainty and the brain's attempt to resolve ambiguity, while also cautioning against pathologizing conviction and highlighting the fine line between principles and dogmas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have announced a temporary agreement to cut reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, aiming to de-escalate trade tensions and establish a basis for broader negotiations. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that both sides will reduce tariffs by 115%, resulting in a reciprocal tariff rate of 10%. The agreement, reached after talks in Geneva, seeks to alleviate market volatility and recession fears triggered by previous tariff measures. Both countries will continue discussions on economic and trade policy during this period, potentially alternating venues between China, the United States, or a mutually agreed third country.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) faces significant budget and staff cuts, potentially degrading the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasts. These forecasts are critical for various sectors, including air travel, agriculture, and emergency management, saving lives by providing timely warnings for extreme weather events. The article highlights the importance of NOAA's comprehensive weather monitoring system and the expertise of its scientists, warning that understaffing and reduced data collection will compromise the ability to predict and respond to increasingly frequent and severe weather.

The refugees will have a pathway to U.S. citizenship and access to government benefits, with assistance from refugee services and local organizations.

The plans also propose abolishing the dedicated visa for social care providers, reducing the post-study stay for overseas graduates, and increasing English language requirements for work visas. While aiming to reduce net migration, the party avoids setting an overall cap, favoring a more selective and controlled system.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. rule mandates that hotels and short-term lodging companies must disclose all mandatory fees upfront, including "resort fees," which often cover services travelers may not want or need. The rule aims to provide transparency and prevent businesses from charging more without explicitly raising prices. However, concerns exist about the Trump administration's efforts to cut enforcement staff at the FTC and CFPB, potentially limiting the rule's effectiveness. While the rule does not eliminate these fees, it ensures that consumers are aware of them before booking, allowing them to make more informed decisions.</p>

          <p>A convicted murderer, identified as Emanuele De Maria, died by suicide after falling from Milan's famed Duomo cathedral, following reports that he had stabbed a work colleague. De Maria, who was serving a 14-year sentence for a 2016 murder, had been permitted to work outside prison. The incident occurred after police had been searching for him since Friday, when he allegedly stabbed a 50-year-old colleague, who is now recovering after emergency surgery. The area surrounding the Duomo was cordoned off, and witnesses reported the man landed near a child who was in shock.</p>

          <p>Despite benefiting from President Trump's rise to power, the Federalist Society displayed surprising ambivalence towards his policies at a recent gathering. While few criticized Trump's policies directly (except for tariffs), many expressed concern over the "chaos" within his administration. Speakers warned that this chaos could hinder the administration's deregulatory efforts, and some advocated for stripping power from the executive branch and reallocating it to the judiciary. The article suggests a potential divergence between Trump's vision for the executive branch and that of the conservative legal movement.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the shared interest in avoiding a decoupling of the two economies.

          <p>Two new studies on wild chimpanzees reveal important building blocks of human speech in their communication, specifically rhythmic structures and call combinations. The research analyzed drumming patterns and vocalizations of chimps, finding that different populations use different rhythmic structures, similar to regional accents. Additionally, the studies found that chimps combine calls to create new meanings, suggesting that these abilities were already present when the first humans appeared. The findings contribute to an emerging understanding of how human language may have evolved.</p>
