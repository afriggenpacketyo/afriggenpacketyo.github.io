          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling an easing of inflation pressures. The decision comes after President Vladimir Putin described inflation pressures as "alarming" not long ago. The inflation rate in April was reported at 6.2%, down from an average of 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. While domestic demand growth still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the central bank noted that the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path. The central bank plans to maintain a tight monetary policy for an extended period to bring inflation back to its 4% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK has changed its position on the Western Sahara conflict, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy stating that the Moroccan autonomy plan is the "most credible" position. This marks a shift from London's previous support for a UN-led referendum to determine the region's future. The new position aligns with that of other Western countries, and Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita has welcomed the change. Experts note that while the UK is showing flexibility, it still emphasizes the relevance of the UN-led political process. The Western Sahara region is coveted for its mineral resources, and Morocco has been investing in tourism infrastructure there.</p>

          <p>Once a key adviser and major campaign donor, Elon Musk's relationship with President Donald Trump has soured into a public feud following Musk's departure from the White House. Musk left his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency after reaching his term limit as a special government employee. The conflict began when Musk voiced opposition to Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The timeline highlights key moments, including Musk's endorsement of Trump after an assassination attempt, his role in the 2024 election, and his subsequent advisory position in the administration. The feud culminated in social media attacks and threats to government contracts, marking a significant shift in their relationship.</p>

          <p>Hiring in the U.S. slowed in May due to businesses expressing concerns over President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariff policies, though the job market remained resilient. The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the 177,000 jobs added in April, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%. Federal government employment saw a decline of 22,000 jobs in May, totaling 59,000 losses since January. The economic data comes as Trump rolled back some "Liberation Day" tariffs following a trade agreement with China, though tariffs still apply to many imports. The labor market's performance has largely defied fears of a downturn, maintaining low unemployment and cooling inflation.</p>

The meeting occurred a month before the Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday, during which the Tibetan spiritual leader may reveal his preferred method for choosing a successor. Xi expressed hopes that the Panchen Lama would become a Tibetan living Buddha with profound knowledge of Buddhism, beloved by monks and lay followers, and take the lead in obeying the law and adhering to the precepts. The Panchen Lama is the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism, after the Dalai Lama.</p>

The movie follows Zsa-zsa Korda, a merciless man, as he travels the globe, with his cruelty being moderated by his daughter and his unspoken fear of death. The director's inspiration came from his father-in-law, a Lebanese engineer, and the film explores the sins of fatherhood.</p>

          <p>The Glazer family's takeover of Manchester United in June 2005 has cost the club an estimated £1.2 billion due to debt interest repayments, dividends to shareholders, management fees, and debt repayments. The takeover, primarily funded by borrowed money, loaded £604 million in debts onto the club. Since 2005, £815 million has been paid in debt interest repayments, £166 million in dividends, £10 million in fees to Glazer family companies, and £197 million in external net debt repayments. Since 2012, £125 million has been paid out in compensation to the club's directors, with half likely going to Glazer family members.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a ruling that had ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc.

          <p>Proposed funding cuts to public radio and television could disproportionately harm rural areas and smaller communities that rely on these services for news and information. The loss of funding would threaten access to 24/7 news, music, cultural and educational programming, and emergency alerting services. The decline of local newspapers has created "news deserts" in many parts of America, making public media a vital source of credible local reporting. Republican lawmakers, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, claim that public radio and TV are biased, but others like Senator Lisa Murkowski argue that these services are invaluable resources that save lives in states like Alaska.</p>
