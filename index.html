The ruling mandates that individuals without legal status, aged 14 and older, must provide their fingerprints and address, with parents or guardians registering those under 14. The administration argues they are simply enforcing an existing law, while opponents fear it's a means to facilitate mass deportations, forcing individuals to choose between self-reporting or risking criminal charges.</p>

            <p>President Trump acknowledged that there will "always be transition problems" and "difficulty" as markets fell again amid continued uncertainty over his global tariff war. Despite this, Trump said he was still hoping to secure a deal with China. Beijing has shown no sign of backing down, this week increasing its retaliatory tariffs to 84% on American products. The three major US stock markets managed to regain some initial ground early on Thursday, however by closing, the S&P 500 lost 3.6%, the Dow Jones 2.5% and the Nasdaq 4.31%.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks surrendered a chunk of their historic gains from the day before as President Donald Trump's trade war continues to threaten the economy. The S&P 500 fell 189 points, or 3.5%, Thursday to close at 5,268. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,015 points, or 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4.3%. China this week announced more countermeasures against the U.S., and market losses accelerated after the White House clarified that it will tax Chinese imports at 145%, not 125% as initially announced by Mr. Trump on social media.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering placing Columbia University under a consent decree, a dramatic escalation in the federal government’s crackdown on the Ivy League institution. The university has already accepted a series of changes demanded by the administration as a precondition for restoring $400m in federal grants and contracts. The proposal comes from the administration’s antisemitism taskforce, composed in part of justice department lawyers, who have reportedly expressed skepticism that Columbia was acting in “good faith”.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday, wiping away some of the previous day's rally as investors digested President Donald Trump's decision to suspend some tariffs while escalating a trade war with China. Hours after markets opened, the White House said U.S. tariffs on China stand at 145%, more than the 125% levy that had been widely reported a day earlier. The news sent shares falling further than they had earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1,014 points, or 2.5%, at the market close.</p>

            <p>China is prepared to withstand the economic pain from President Donald Trump's tariffs and stand up to what Beijing is calling America's "bullying," according to experts. Trump's trade war also feeds into the strategy that Xi has been working on for years: become less reliant on the United States. Xi's view is that countries will want to do business less with the U.S. because of the uncertainty created by tariffs, which will drive them toward China, said Thomas, who added that China has been preparing for this possibility for years by growing trade relations with the rest of the world.</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Boston said elements of the Trump administration's policy of deporting migrants to countries other than their own without them being able to raise concerns about their safety was "very troublesome" during a court hearing on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy said his recently issued temporary order blocking such removals would remain in effect for another week while he considers issuing a longer-lasting preliminary injunction. The judge signaled misgivings about elements of the policy, suggesting the noncitizens lack a meaningful way to raise concerns about their safety when they are rushed onto deportation flights.</p>
