          <p>The New York Times reviewed a guest list and social media posts to reveal the attendees of President Trump's private dinner for cryptocurrency business customers and a subsequent White House tour. Invitees included a Chinese billionaire previously sued by the SEC, an attorney for Justice Clarence Thomas, and crypto executives. The event, held at Trump's Virginia golf club, raised concerns about the president leveraging his position for financial gain, as guests were identified by their crypto wallet pseudonyms and had to be top holders of the $TRUMP memecoin to gain access. The event was considered an extraordinary moment in which the president leveraged his position to make money â€” for his crypto business and for his Virginia golf club, which hosted the event.</p>

          <p>The Trump Department of Justice filed a motion to dissolve the Flores Consent Decree, which has governed the detention and release of migrant children since 1997. Attorney General Pam Bondi argues the decree incentivizes illegal immigration at the southern border and restricts the administration's immigration agenda. DOJ officials state the aim is to return power to elected officials rather than a single federal judge. The motion argues that significant changes since 1997, including surges of migrants and a global pandemic, necessitate ending the decree to allow the Executive branch to react fully to these changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his support for a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a deal previously blocked by the Biden administration on national security grounds. Trump claimed the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with most investment occurring within 14 months. While the specifics of the deal remain unclear, it appears to involve investment by Nippon rather than a complete acquisition. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern that the arrangement could jeopardize American jobs and erode domestic steel-making capacity, while U.S. Steel stated they would remain American and grow bigger and stronger through a partnership with Nippon Steel.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's upcoming gubernatorial elections are drawing national attention as a potential bellwether for the 2026 midterm elections and a gauge of President Trump's influence. The Democratic primary features a crowded field, including Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, each vying to succeed the term-limited Governor Phil Murphy. Republicans hope to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli, who has shifted his stance on the former president over the years. Experts say the race will also test how partisan allegiances are shifting in New Jersey and the strength of Trump's endorsement of Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to strip Harvard University of its ability to enroll foreign students, following a lawsuit filed by the university. Harvard argued the administration's decision was a blatant violation of law and free speech rights, retaliating against the university for refusing to surrender academic independence. The Trump administration claimed Harvard had not done enough to combat antisemitism and change its hiring practices, allegations the university strongly denied. The order pauses the Department of Homeland Security's move to revoke Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), with a hearing scheduled for May 29.</p>

U.S. Steel praised Trump, stating the partnership would bring massive investment, new technologies, and thousands of jobs, while Nippon Steel called the agreement a "game changer" committed to protecting American workers and national security.

          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students, escalating its campaign against colleges accused of antisemitism. This action follows the administration's suspension of over $400 million in research funding to Columbia. The administration alleges Columbia breached Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funds. This move formalizes previous accusations against Columbia, rather than signaling a new, heightened stage of the campaign against the university. Columbia has already announced changes to campus protest and security policies and new oversight of its Middle Eastern studies department.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a budget package that includes historic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), totaling roughly $700 billion and $300 billion, respectively. These cuts are intended to help pay for tax perks primarily benefiting the wealthy, included in the same bill. President Trump stated that waste, fraud, and abuse should be eliminated from Medicaid, but that the program would otherwise be left intact. One way House Republicans are seeking to curb the programs' spending is through new work requirements. The reconciliation bill would add roughly $3 trillion to the nation's debt including interest over the next decade.</p>

This restructuring is expected to grant more authority to the State Department, the Defense Department, and other agencies.

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders to accelerate nuclear power plant construction, including advanced small reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its rules and approve new reactor applications within 18 months, potentially lowering radiation exposure safety limits. Another order encourages siting reactors on federal lands and military bases, potentially bypassing the NRC. The administration set a goal of quadrupling the nation's nuclear power capacity by 2050. Skeptics fear the White House pressure could compromise safety, while proponents say the NRC's regulations are outdated and hinder advanced reactor deployment.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn and Jeannie Rhee, announced their departure from the firm following its decision to make a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business. The partners are forming their own law firm, citing disappointment with Paul Weiss's capitulation to the president. The move has been criticized by associates, lawyers at other firms, and Democrats, who view it as a compromise of the firm's values.

          <p>Seventeen people were injured in a knife attack at the main railway station in Hamburg, Germany, and several suffered life-threatening injuries. Police arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene, and officers are carrying out a major operation. Police believe the suspect acted alone and did not have a "political motive", but that she may have been "in a state of mental distress". German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the attack was "shocking" and thanked the emergency services on the ground for "their rapid assistance".</p>
