          <p>Experts analyzing President Trump's tariff policies find a mixed economic impact. The levies have generated significant tax revenue, projected to potentially exceed $300 billion by 2025, and have prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, analysts express skepticism about the long-term reliability of this revenue and the fulfillment of corporate promises amid policy fluctuations. The tariffs have also contributed to modest price increases for imported goods like toys and furniture, raising concerns about inflation and its potential to disrupt the economy.

          <p>Congo and the M23 rebel group, which is backed by Rwanda, have signed a declaration of principles in Qatar, committing to a permanent ceasefire. This agreement aims to end the prolonged conflict in mineral-rich eastern Congo, which has displaced seven million people. The deal, which follows a U.S.-facilitated peace agreement between Congo and Rwanda, stipulates that a final comprehensive peace accord will be signed by August 18. Key unresolved issues include the withdrawal of rebels from seized cities and whether Rwanda will cease its support for the M23 group.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Threat from Thunderstorms Following Heatwave</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:11:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms and heavy rain across most of England and parts of Scotland, indicating a risk of flash flooding. The severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground dry and less able to absorb water, increasing the likelihood of surface runoff and potential disruption. Forecasters warn of possible travel delays, power cuts, and flooding of homes and businesses. This weather pattern highlights the challenges of extreme weather swings, as the heavy rainfall is unlikely to alleviate underlying drought conditions.</p>

          <p>An immediate ceasefire has been declared in the southern Syrian city of Suweida following a week of intense sectarian violence between local Bedouin tribesmen and the Druze community. The clashes have resulted in over 700 deaths, prompting the deployment of Syrian internal security forces to the area, a move approved by Israel. The UN has reported widespread human rights abuses, including summary executions by various armed groups. Syria's interim president has called for unity and vowed to hold all perpetrators accountable for the bloodshed and violence.</p>

          <p>Leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for a nationwide council tax exemption for people diagnosed with less than 12 months to live. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a significant income shock and increased costs, making financial relief from large bills like council tax crucial for providing peace of mind. The Local Government Association stated that some support is already available, but advocates are pushing for a more compassionate and standardized approach.</p>

          <p>An opinion column discusses the idea of eliminating national holidays for economic reasons, a concept recently proposed in France. The author contrasts this with President Trump's suggestion of cutting holidays, which was made on Juneteenth, implying a different motivation. The article argues that Juneteenth, celebrating the end of slavery, has immense historical and economic significance, as studies show emancipation yielded greater economic gains than the institution of slavery itself. If a holiday must be cut, the author proposes Thanksgiving, citing its problematic historical origins and its modern role as a prelude to Christmas shopping.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have successfully confirmed the breeding of the California red-legged frog in Southern California for the first time in 25 years, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence. After a multi-year effort to reintroduce frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula, scientists were struggling to confirm if the amphibians were reproducing. A custom AI model was deployed to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings, successfully identifying the mating calls of mature male frogs. This technological breakthrough marks a significant milestone in the fight to save the threatened species, famous from Mark Twain's writing.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Tariffs Coincide with Rising Inflation, Fueling Conflict with Federal Reserve</h2>

          <p>Despite the White House declaring inflation is "right on track," official data shows a recent rise in consumer prices for various goods, coinciding with the chaotic rollout of new tariffs. This has intensified a public conflict between President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has attacked for not cutting interest rates. Economists note that while the full impact of the tariffs is still emerging, they are expected to modestly increase inflation and slightly dent economic growth, putting the Fed in a difficult position as it waits for more data.

          <p>Texas has passed the "Life of the Mother Act," a new law intended to clarify when doctors can legally perform abortions in medical emergencies under the state's strict ban. The law specifies that a patient's death does not need to be "imminent" to qualify for an exception and confirms the state has the burden of proof in any prosecution. While supported by some medical groups as a step in the right direction, reproductive rights advocates and legal experts are uncertain if it will be effective. Critics argue it does not go far enough and may not provide sufficient protection for doctors facing severe penalties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is facing a federal lawsuit over its unprecedented demand for states to hand over the personal information of millions of SNAP recipients by July 30. The data request includes names, addresses, and Social Security numbers, which critics argue turns a vital food assistance program into a tool for mass surveillance. The lawsuit, filed by recipients and advocacy groups, argues the plan violates federal privacy laws and could be used for purposes beyond program integrity, such as immigration enforcement.

          <p>Financial therapists and consumer experts are advising people to be more intentional with their spending to avoid financial strain, especially when money is tight. They suggest asking a series of questions before making a purchase, such as whether it will impact essential funds, if it's filling an emotional need, or if you're trying to impress someone. The article also recommends doing research before buying, not assuming price equals quality, and walking away if the item isn't exactly what you want. The key is to avoid impulsive or emotional buying by being more mindful of your motivations and budget.</p>

The leak exposed the information of over 19,000 people who had applied for relocation, many of whom now fear retribution from the Taliban. The MoD stated it would "robustly defend" against legal claims, citing an independent review that concluded it was "highly unlikely" individuals would be targeted solely for being on the list. Affected Afghans and their advocates argue for swift action to ensure the safety of their families still in Afghanistan.</p>

While facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's popularity has grown nationwide among Muslims who align with his progressive platform and advocacy for Palestinian rights.

The meeting aimed to enforce laws related to fair competition and encourage a healthier market ecosystem that benefits consumers, merchants, and delivery riders. The regulator emphasized that the companies must adhere to existing laws and take on their platform responsibilities. This move signals Beijing's continued effort to rein in the aggressive and sometimes anti-competitive practices of its major technology firms.</p>
