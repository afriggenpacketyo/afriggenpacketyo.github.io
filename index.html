          <p>To investigate the effects of space on the human mind, China has sent a sophisticated 'mini-brain' to its Tiangong space station. This three-dimensional model, grown from living human tissue including nerve and immune cells, is designed to provide more accurate data than previous experiments. Researchers hope this will offer real-time insights into how brain tissues behave in orbit, advancing space medicine, neuroscience, and drug development to study conditions like Alzheimer's and aging.</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a dominant voice in pre-Beatles pop music with hits like "Who's Sorry Now?" and "Where the Boys Are," has passed away at the age of 87. While celebrated for her chart-topping success and global appeal, her personal life was marked by significant hardship, including a violent sexual assault in 1974 that she said derailed her career. Despite these challenges, her music saw a recent resurgence on social media, and she remained a beloved figure from a classic era of American music.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party is reviewing remarks made by MP Diane Abbott in which she appeared to stand by comments about racism that previously led to her suspension. In a BBC interview, Abbott reiterated her view that there is a difference between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice experienced by groups like Jewish and Traveller people. The original comments, made in a 2023 letter, were widely condemned as antisemitic, and the party has stated it is taking her latest interview "incredibly seriously."</p>

          <p>The British government has announced that it will lower the national voting age from 18 to 16, a change planned to take effect before the next general election. The reform, a key pledge of the ruling Labour Party, will also include measures for automatic voter registration and an expansion of acceptable forms of voter ID to include bank cards. The move will enfranchise approximately 1.5 million teenagers and represents the most significant change to the UK electorate since the voting age was last lowered in 1969.</p>

The drills are a response to escalating military and political pressure from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the self-governing island.

          <p>An article from The Economist explores the declining cultural relevance of Superman in the 21st century. The piece argues that while the character was a defining hero of the 20th century, his unwavering moral certainty and god-like powers make him less relatable to contemporary audiences who favor more complex, flawed superheroes. Unlike characters such as Batman or Iron Man, Superman's classic simplicity struggles to find a place in a modern cinematic and cultural landscape that has evolved beyond his original framework.</p>

The court expressed regret that it could not undo the decades of suffering caused by the miscarriage of justice, which was described by a lawyer as a form of "state crime."</p>

The policy is designed to prevent Chinese products from being rerouted through these countries to evade U.S. tariffs. However, economies in the region are worried that a broad definition of transshipment could punish any product containing Chinese components, potentially devastating their manufacturing sectors, which are deeply integrated with China's supply chain.</p>

Simultaneously, Volvo is pulling some sedan and station wagon models from the U.S. market due to waning interest and the challenging tariff environment, reflecting a broader trend of automakers localizing production to navigate trade policies.</p>
