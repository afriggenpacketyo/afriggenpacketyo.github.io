          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK in a new role leading the "Doge team," modeled after President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf had cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time" when he initially quit. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will now take on a more public-facing role, making more frequent media appearances for the party. This move suggests a strategic shift in Reform UK's approach to public engagement and policy implementation.</p>

          <p>Red Sox pitcher Walker Buehler expressed disappointment in his performance after a loss to the Yankees, admitting he felt he has been "embarrassing" to the team after giving up five earned runs in two innings. Buehler, who signed a one-year contract with the Red Sox, underwent Tommy John surgery in 2022 and missed the 2023 season. Yankees infielder Jazz Chisholm hit a three-run homer off Buehler in the first inning and an RBI single in the second, contributing to Buehler's ERA jumping to 5.18, and dropping Boston's record to 30-35.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been returned to the U.S. to face federal criminal charges related to human smuggling. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport migrants from Latin American countries to the U.S. between 2016 and 2025, and the Justice Department said he should be held in pretrial custody because "he poses a danger to the community and a serious risk of flight." His attorney maintains his innocence and criticizes the government's handling of the case.</p>
