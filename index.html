          <p>Brooke Hogan has publicly addressed her exclusion from her late father Hulk Hogan's $5 million will, clarifying that it was her explicit request and she stands by it without regret. She emphasized her long-standing financial independence, stating she has been self-sufficient for a considerable period. Brooke also provided insight into the strained relationship with her father before his passing, describing it as a series of private, difficult conversations and "respectful disagreements" that took an emotional toll. Despite her efforts to be present, especially after his numerous surgeries, a "thick veil" formed around him. Hulk Hogan passed away at 71 from a heart attack in Florida.</p>

Drivers from 25 global teams, including representatives from Hong Kong, Rio de Janeiro, and San Diego, showcased their operating skills in front of thousands of spectators. The competition featured a series of unique tram-based challenges, such as "tram bowling" using a giant ball and "tram curling" to halt a bicycle trolley at a specific spot, alongside tests of smooth braking and acceleration. Austria secured first place, celebrating precision and public transport expertise.</p>

          <p>Twenty-six police officers sustained injuries, four seriously, during a "Unite the Kingdom rally" in central London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, which attracted up to 150,000 participants. Tensions escalated as some groups threw bottles and other projectiles at officers attempting to separate them from a nearby counter-protest. The Metropolitan Police reported 25 arrests for various offenses, vowing to identify others involved in the "wholly unacceptable" violence.

          <p>Congressional Democrats are making health care a central sticking point in negotiations to avert a government shutdown, demanding the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits and a reversal of Medicaid cuts. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated they would not support a GOP-backed spending bill without these provisions. If the tax credits expire, average premiums could soar by approximately 75%, impacting millions. Republicans, including President Trump, have dismissed these demands, accusing Democrats of seeking a shutdown, setting up a contentious policy fight ahead of the September 30 funding deadline and making a temporary solution an uphill battle.</p>

          <p>West Ham manager Graham Potter faces escalating pressure and fan discontent after a 3-0 home defeat to Tottenham, which extended the team's dismal start to the season with two losses, eight goals conceded, and only one goal scored at home. Despite five new summer signings, defensive vulnerabilities persist, particularly concerning headed goals and set pieces. Former players and a significant portion of the fanbase are openly questioning Potter's future, though the club's ownership typically avoids hasty managerial changes. With crucial upcoming matches against Crystal Palace, Everton, and Arsenal, the next few weeks are critical for Potter to demonstrate a turnaround.</p>

The plan outlines a mobilization potentially lasting until September 2026, with troops supplementing local law enforcement, assisting with drug interdiction, and providing logistical support in predominantly Black cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge.</p>

          <p>Glenn County, California, is on the verge of losing its sole hospital, Glenn Medical Center, in October after the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) revoked its "critical access" designation. This crucial status provided increased reimbursement, and its loss will cut the hospital's $28 million annual revenue by 40%, making continued operation financially unsustainable. The federal agency's decision hinges on a newly reinterpreted rule requiring critical access hospitals to be at least 35 miles from the next closest hospital, with CMS asserting Glenn Medical is three miles short, despite local arguments for an alternative qualifying route. The closure will leave 28,000 residents without a local emergency room and 150 health workers jobless.</p>

          <p>A Mexican congressional staffer has resigned after facing intense online backlash and diplomatic pressure for controversial comments made on a major Mexican television news program about the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Salvador Ramírez facetiously remarked that Kirk "was given a spoonful of his own chocolate" due to his promotion of gun rights and ties to the National Rifle Association. The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State warned that "foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome," leading to the Milenio news network issuing a public apology and Ramírez releasing his own apology before officially announcing his resignation.

Investigators tracked Robinson's movements on campus, found the high-powered rifle used in a wooded area, and noted unusual, politically charged inscriptions on bullet casings. While a definitive motive remains unclear, officials believe it was a "targeted attack," and the FBI had offered a $100,000 reward, receiving over 11,000 leads in the high-profile case.</p>

Utah Governor Spencer Cox stated Robinson was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," though specific evidence was not detailed. Reports also surfaced about Robinson living with a transgender partner, a community Kirk frequently criticized, adding a complex layer to the narrative. While some conservatives initially called for the death penalty, others, like Congresswoman Nancy Mace, later urged prayer for Robinson's soul. The article highlights the contrasting reactions, from calls for unity by Governor Cox to President Trump's blaming of "radical left political violence," underscoring deep ideological rifts.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has swiftly prompted widespread discussion on social media and among commentators regarding the nature of modern American political violence. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" observed a familiar, yet concerning, pattern of regret and calls to "pull it back" after such acts, emanating from both Democratic and Republican messaging. However, the panelists expressed skepticism about whether these responses would lead to genuine, lasting change in the deeply polarized political landscape. The article highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the online reactions to Kirk's death and what they reveal about the entrenched divisions in contemporary political discourse.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, reportedly questioned Lord Mandelson about his links to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US. These questions, sent via email, addressed Mandelson's continued contact with Epstein post-conviction, his alleged stay in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison, and his association with an Epstein-backed charity. Although Mandelson's answers were initially deemed sufficient for his appointment, new information, including supportive emails sent to Epstein after his conviction, ultimately led to Mandelson's sacking. The revelation has intensified scrutiny on Sir Keir's judgment and the adequacy of Whitehall's vetting processes.</p>

Sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, the declaration also condemns attacks by Hamas and Israel on civilians, and Israel's "siege and starvation" in Gaza, which has created a devastating humanitarian crisis.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing a $3.1 million fine against Boeing for a series of safety violations identified between September 2023 and February 2024, including issues directly related to the January 2024 Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 door plug blowout. The National Transportation Safety Board's investigation cited significant lapses in Boeing's manufacturing and safety oversight, coupled with ineffective FAA inspections. The FAA specifically identified hundreds of quality system violations at Boeing's 737 factory in Renton, Washington, and a subcontractor's plant, and also found that a Boeing employee pressured an inspector to approve an aircraft that did not comply with applicable standards. Boeing is currently reviewing the proposed penalty and has stated its commitment to strengthening its safety culture and improving quality.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed several controversial bills poised to significantly alter children's school experiences, targeting reading skills, cafeteria meals, and anti-discrimination measures. Assembly Bill 1454 mandates phonics-based "science of reading" instruction, aiming to boost persistently disappointing literacy scores, though some teachers and advocates for English language learners oppose this state-mandated approach. AB 1264 targets ultra-processed foods in school meals, promoting healthier options despite opposition from manufacturers. AB 715, establishing a state Office for Civil Rights, expands efforts against discrimination, including antisemitism, but critics fear it could inadvertently stifle discussions on controversial topics like the Israel-Palestinian conflict. These measures now await Governor Newsom's approval.</p>
