          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is projected to continue on a north-northeasterly path over the central Atlantic Ocean. The National Hurricane Center confirms Fernand poses no immediate threat to land, with its maximum sustained winds currently at 50 mph. While some strengthening is possible today, the storm is expected to weaken tonight and become post-tropical by Wednesday, remaining well east of Bermuda. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar area, and aligns with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season, which predicted 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has increased minimum e-commerce delivery rates in several major centers, including Guangdong province, to counteract "disorderly low-price competition" and prevent harmful price spirals. This adjustment, primarily affecting e-commerce clients, aims to guide companies toward improving product quality and promoting the exit of outdated capacity. The move follows a directive from President Xi Jinping's Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission, emphasizing the need to lawfully regulate market behavior. This initiative is part of a broader "anti-involution drive" expected to expand across more regions, reflecting Beijing's focus on market stability and quality over aggressive price wars.

          <p>Shares of wind farm developer Orsted plummeted 17% to a record low after the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order for its nearly completed Revolution Wind Project off Rhode Island. The project, already 80% finished with 45 out of 65 turbines installed, now faces significant uncertainty regarding its future. This halt is particularly critical as Orsted is seeking to raise 60 billion Danish kroner in capital, a plan now under pressure. Analysts warn of potential double-digit billion write-downs and increased capital raising needs if the project does not supply electricity, despite Orsted's commitment to resolve the issue and proceed.

          <p>The US Open witnessed chaotic scenes during Daniil Medvedev's first-round match against Benjamin Bonzi when a photographer disrupted play at match point, triggering a spectacular meltdown from the Russian. Medvedev, the 2021 champion, was eventually defeated 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4 after a six-minute halt and a frenzied crowd response. His anger was directed at the umpire's decision to re-award Bonzi a first serve following the interference, which Medvedev deemed unjust. The incident, resulting in the photographer's credentials being revoked, created a memorable and dramatic exit for Medvedev, who has had a challenging year in major tournaments.</p>

Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence stated that a second strike occurred as rescuers attended the scene of the initial attack, exacerbating the casualties and highlighting the extreme dangers faced by civilians and media in conflict zones. The Israeli military and prime minister's office have not yet provided immediate comment on the incident, which adds to the tragic toll of the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel reflected on her controversial 2015 decision to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees, reaffirming that her policy was guided by humanitarian principles and human dignity. In an interview for an upcoming documentary, Merkel acknowledged the immense scale of the challenge and the criticism her "Wir schaffen das" (We can do this) statement garnered. She emphasized that using force to prevent refugees from entering Germany was never an option she would consider. Merkel also conceded that her decision likely contributed to the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, yet she continues to stand by her choice as morally necessary.</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned the American ambassador to Paris, Charles Kushner, after he sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging France's efforts against antisemitism are insufficient. The French foreign ministry strongly rejected these "unacceptable" allegations, viewing them as a breach of international law and an interference in internal affairs. Kushner's letter suggested that France's public statements regarding Israel and the recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists and endanger Jewish communities. This diplomatic dispute underscores existing tensions between the allies, which have also seen divisions over trade and support for Ukraine, though some of these issues have recently eased.</p>

The article highlights three red flags: a decrease in overall hiring, a substantial 64% increase in long-term job seekers over three years, and growing difficulties for young workers entering the job market.

          <p>A KFF Health News investigation alleges that actions by the Trump administration severely hampered the CDC's response to a measles surge in Texas, contributing to the worst U.S. outbreak in over three decades. Interference with communications, stalled reports, data censorship, and abrupt staff layoffs created an environment of fear and confusion among CDC scientists, preventing them from providing timely assistance to local health departments. This delay, exacerbated by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s promotion of vaccine doubt and inaccurate claims about vitamin A, led to the outbreak spreading across multiple states and Mexico, causing thousands of infections and at least 16 deaths. Local health officials in West Texas were left overwhelmed and struggled with understaffing and a lack of federal funds for months.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre's memoir, "Nobody's Girl," detailing her allegations of sexual assault against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Prince Andrew, is set for posthumous publication in October. Giuffre had completed the book before her death by suicide in April at age 41, having explicitly expressed a "heartfelt wish" for its release. The memoir is anticipated to share "intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking new details" about her experiences with Epstein, Maxwell, and their associates. This publication will mark the first time Giuffre's comprehensive account regarding Prince Andrew becomes public since their 2022 out-of-court settlement, where he expressed regret for his association with Epstein but maintained no admission of liability.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of Chinese electric carmaker Nio surged over 14% on Monday, extending a remarkable seven-session rally, following the unveiling of its latest ES8 SUV. This new model, priced at 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan, positions itself as one of Nio's most affordable offerings, aiming to capture a broader customer base amidst intense competition in China's electric vehicle sector. This strategic move is designed to counteract pressure from rivals who are increasingly offering similar features at lower price points. Nio has also launched two cheaper brands, Onvo and Firefly, to further diversify its traditionally high-end focus and attract mass market and young urban buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest level since January 2021 and falling below economists' forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributed this moderation primarily to falling retail and other goods prices, in addition to lower electricity and gas costs. With global crude oil prices easing and domestic nominal wage growth moderating, the central bank projects core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025. This latest economic data strengthens the argument for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its October meeting, providing a buffer against anticipated weaker economic growth and significant external uncertainties.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper has announced its intent to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion deal, a strategic move aimed at revitalizing the U.S. giant's struggling coffee business. The acquisition, valued at 15.7 billion euros ($18.4 billion) in total equity, represents a 33% premium on JDE Peet's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price and is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the completion of the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper intends to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies. This significant strategic maneuver seeks to enhance its appeal to thrifty at-home coffee drinkers and expand its offerings into the competitive cold coffee market. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasizes the long-term process of building a new life and highlights the importance of workshops and community support.

While the Guard's role has primarily involved protecting landmarks and crowd control, this new directive allows for the use of force as a last resort in response to imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm.

          <p>Global labor markets are experiencing significant shifts, transitioning from the "Great Resignation" of the pandemic era to a new phase dubbed the "Great Stay" and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze. Economists observe fewer employees voluntarily leaving their jobs and a notable reluctance among employers to either hire new workers or initiate widespread firings, largely driven by prevailing economic insecurity and uncertainty. This trend, evident in both the U.S. and the U.K., indicates a clear slowdown in overall hiring momentum, though initial jobless claims remain historically low as firms are hesitant to release staff after previous difficulties in recruitment. Businesses are essentially holding off on hiring decisions, awaiting greater economic confidence and clearer trajectories for the future. (not investment advice)</p>
