        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a midnight deadline approaches, congressional leaders are engaged in a blame game over a potential government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader John Thune attributes the stalemate to Democrats' opposition to President Trump, claiming their current stance on funding is purely political. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, criticizes Republicans for refusing to negotiate on crucial healthcare priorities, including restoring Medicaid cuts and extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. Democrats argue these are essential demands, while Republicans insist on a "clean" continuing resolution. The impasse highlights deep political divisions and a lack of communication, making a federal funding lapse increasingly likely without a bipartisan resolution.</p>

          <p>Firefly Aerospace's stock plummeted nearly 21% following the explosion of its Alpha Flight 7 rocket during a first-stage test flight in Briggs, Texas. The company confirmed that proper safety protocols were followed, ensuring no personnel were harmed, and only the test stand was impacted. This incident marks another setback for Firefly, which also experienced a rocket failure in April, despite recently securing a $177 million NASA contract and a $50 million investment from Northrop Grumman. The company, which debuted with a $6.3 billion valuation last month, emphasizes learning from each test to enhance system reliability and execution in the increasingly crowded space technology sector (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.S. government faces a looming shutdown, with the Congressional Budget Office estimating approximately 750,000 federal employees would be furloughed daily at a cost of roughly $400 million in compensation. House Speaker Mike Johnson blames Democrats for making policy demands, specifically regarding Affordable Care Act tax credits, arguing these are irrelevant to the immediate need for a clean funding bill. Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, insist on including healthcare protections, accusing Republicans of trying to gut the ACA and highlighting impending premium hikes. This political impasse threatens significant disruption to federal operations and employee livelihoods, with both sides refusing to budge from their positions.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill is accusing her Republican rival, Jack Ciattarelli, of a "witch hunt" over the improper release of her military records. The records, mistakenly disclosed by the National Archives, raised questions about her absence from her 1994 Naval Academy graduation amid a cheating scandal, though she was never accused of cheating. Ciattarelli's campaign demands she release her full disciplinary records, while Sherrill asserts her records show commendations and accuses her opponent of illegally obtaining and misrepresenting them. This controversy intensifies the closely watched gubernatorial race in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace proposal, while generally sensible on paper, faces significant challenges in implementation despite initial support from various international and regional actors. The plan aims to end the war, return hostages, surge aid, disarm Hamas, and pave a path for Palestinian self-government, also reversing Trump's previous controversial stance on Gaza's future. However, the article highlights the difficulty in securing Hamas's agreement to concessions like demilitarization and ensuring Prime Minister Netanyahu's sustained commitment, given his political pressures. The success hinges on Trump's ability to maintain sustained attention and leverage over key parties, which remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Gaza peace plan, touted as a path to "eternal peace," is met with skepticism due to its vague details and lack of concrete implementation mechanisms. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed support, his right-wing allies reject terms like non-annexation, and Hamas is still studying the proposal. Critics, including Palestinian lawyers, argue the plan lacks guarantees for Palestinians and removes their agency, imposing a transitional authority without clear standards or timelines for Israeli withdrawal. Despite its potential to end the immediate conflict, many observers anticipate the plan will flounder like previous Middle East peace efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown due to an impasse between Republicans and Democrats over funding. Democrats insist on including an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits in any temporary funding measure, which Republicans reject as irrelevant to the budget process. This disagreement, rooted in the constitutional requirement for Congress to approve spending annually, highlights a recurring pattern of last-minute funding fights. A shutdown would furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers and halt non-essential services, with significant economic and political costs, as seen in past funding lapses.</p>

          <p>Federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations discovered an additional 200,000 SIM cards in New Jersey, following last week's disruption of a sprawling telecommunications network. This network, previously found to contain over 100,000 SIM cards across multiple sites, was deemed capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and could have disabled cell phone towers, threatening emergency communications and the U.N. General Assembly meetings. Investigators believe the sophisticated operation, which has foreign links including to Chinese actors, was used for communication among foreign governments, organized crime, drug cartels, and human trafficking rings. No arrests have been made yet as forensic analysis of the SIM cards continues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has filed a civil rights lawsuit against pro-Palestinian groups and activists, alleging violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act. This marks an unprecedented application of the law, which has historically protected reproductive health clinics, to safeguard a place of religious worship. The lawsuit stems from a November 2024 protest at a New Jersey synagogue promoting Israeli settlement property sales, which escalated into violence. Critics argue this move is politically motivated, especially given the administration's recent curtailment of FACE Act enforcement for abortion clinics, and aims to suppress pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

Approximately 2,100 of the Education Department's 2,400 employees, including most of the Federal Student Aid office, are expected to be furloughed.

The VICP, established in 1986 to protect vaccine supply and compensate for injuries, has long rejected a vaccine-autism link, which science overwhelmingly debunks. Critics argue such an expansion would be purely political, exploited by vaccine opponents, and could exhaust the $4 billion trust fund with estimated costs reaching $100 billion.

This critical issue is at the heart of the current government shutdown stalemate, with Democrats pushing for a permanent extension of these subsidies and Republicans insisting on separate negotiations.

          <p>California startup Aetherflux is developing innovative space-based solar farms that use infrared lasers to wirelessly transmit collected solar power from low-orbit satellites to small ground stations on Earth. Robinhood co-founder Baiju Bhatt, the company's CEO, explains that this constellation approach allows for distributed power generation and smaller ground collection spots, enhancing efficiency. Aetherflux is initially partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense to address the critical need for battlefield power, a strategy backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures to scale the technology. The challenge now lies in making this advanced technology cost-competitive with existing energy sources.</p>

Petro claimed these diplomats altered his schedule and canceled meetings without authorization during his spring visit to China, impeding his diplomatic efforts. This purge follows Colombia's formal accession to China’s Belt and Road Initiative in May, marking a significant pivot away from decades of deference to Washington and towards deeper engagement with Beijing. The decision, described by Colombia's foreign ministry as a "historic step," is expected to unlock substantial investment, technology transfers, and major construction projects.</p>
