          <p>The United States is undertaking a partial evacuation of its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to increasing security risks attributed to heightened tensions with Iran. Non-essential embassy personnel and their families are being removed as a precautionary measure. This decision follows reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, raising concerns about potential retaliatory actions by Iran targeting US sites in Iraq. The US State Department has stated it is continuously assessing personnel posture at embassies and decided to reduce the mission's footprint in Iraq. The article also references Trump's comments regarding Iran's nuclear program and a tense phone call with Israel's prime minister.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced increased funding for the National Health Service (NHS) in England and housing, while some other departments face budget cuts. The Spending Review includes an extra Â£29 billion per year for the NHS and significant investment in social and affordable housing, as well as funding for artificial intelligence and transport projects. Some departments, such as the Foreign Office and the environment department, will see reduced day-to-day spending. The government hopes that increased spending in health and investment in long-term projects will reassure voters, but many departments will still have to grapple with frugal spending allocations. The opposition criticizes the plan as a "spend now, tax later review".</p>

          <p>David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and activist, is stepping down as Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair after facing criticism for his plan to support primary challenges against incumbent Democrats. Hogg's decision follows a vote to redo the DNC vice chair elections, although the revote was not directly related to his primary challenge plan. He stated that there was a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair and that he needed to focus on his organization, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to elect young leaders. DNC Chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision, while other party figures expressed relief at the resolution of the intraparty conflict.</p>

          <p>All twelve members of the board overseeing the Fulbright scholarships have resigned, protesting the Trump administration's alleged interference in the selection process. The board members claim the administration denied awards to individuals already selected and subjected approved foreign award recipients to unauthorized reviews. They believe these actions undermine the program's merit-based selection process and its independence from political influence. The State Department responded that the board members were partisan political appointees and that the administration was ensuring alignment with President Trump's executive orders. The resignations highlight concerns about the politicization of international exchange programs.</p>

          <p>During a House Ways and Means Committee hearing, Representative Linda Sanchez (D-CA) accused Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent of interrupting her due to her gender, which prompted audible groans from the room. The exchange occurred during a tense questioning session about the impact of tariffs enacted under President Trump's administration. Sanchez repeatedly claimed that American consumers are paying more due to tariffs and described recent negotiations with China as rushed and lacking transparency. Bessent defended the administration's trade policies, stating that China met its agreements under President Trump in 2020, and President Biden did not enforce them.</p>

          <p>An immigration raid at a Los Angeles car wash, where agents arrested six men, illustrates the Trump administration's intensified efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants. The raids are no longer solely focused on individuals accused of violent crimes but have expanded to include workplaces employing undocumented workers. This shift has sparked fear and anxiety within the Hispanic community in Los Angeles, where a significant portion of the population lacks legal status. Protests have erupted in response to the raids, with confrontations between demonstrators and federal agents, highlighting the growing tension surrounding immigration enforcement policies.</p>

The Aukus pact, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and enhance security cooperation in response to China's growing power. The review may lead to a shift in focus away from submarines, and China would likely celebrate if the US were to withdraw from the deal.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans has decreased by 16 points since March, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. While a majority of Republicans still view Musk favorably, the number has fallen from 78% to 62%. This decline follows a public falling out between Musk and President Donald Trump, stemming from Musk's disapproval of Trump's spending bill. Despite the drop in favorability, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with 80% rating his work as excellent or good.</p>

          <p>The UK's recent Spending Review, led by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, is characterized as a gamble on long-term investments in an era of impatience. The government is prioritizing capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential, but this approach may take time to yield results. Day-to-day spending is limited or even cut in some areas, which could create challenges given the current volatile political climate and public restlessness. The government hopes that these long-term investments will ultimately lead to national renewal, but faces the risk of public dissatisfaction in the short term.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say "rewrites" the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The 86 million-year-old skeletons studied belonged to a species that is now the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the iconic T.rex. This discovery sheds light on how tyrannosaurs evolved from small hunters to formidable giants, with features like skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw. The new species represents a transitional fossil between earlier ancestors and the mighty tyrannosaurs.</p>
