He urged Newsom to focus on governing and upholding the rule of law instead of rebranding efforts. Johnson applauded Trump's actions, emphasizing the administration's commitment to enforcing federal law amidst ongoing immigration protests in Los Angeles.

          <p>A recent survey of 277 CEOs indicates a more optimistic outlook for the U.S. economy, with only 28% expecting a recession in the near term, a significant drop from 62% in April.

Despite a recent contraction in the gross domestic product, CEOs are hopeful that business conditions will improve as trade tensions ease and interest rates decrease. The survey reveals that 36% of CEOs expect mild economic growth this year, while 6% anticipate strong growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has dismissed all 17 members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), citing a need to restore public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy stated that a "clean sweep" is necessary, alleging that the panel has become a "rubber stamp" for vaccines and plagued by conflicts of interest. This action follows previous moves by Kennedy to alter vaccine policies, including COVID-19 recommendations and pandemic prevention programs. The ACIP advises the CDC on vaccine data and recommendations, influencing eligibility and insurance coverage. The overhaul has been met with criticism from medical groups who fear it will undermine public trust in vaccines.</p>

          <p>The concentration of wealth in the United States is reaching unprecedented levels, distorting democracy and exacerbating societal tensions. Just 800 families possess nearly $7 trillion, exceeding the wealth of the bottom half of the U.S. combined. The current tax code allows the ultra-wealthy to avoid taxes on a significant portion of their income, while many Americans struggle financially. To address this issue, a wealth tax on billionaires is proposed, such as the Five & Dime tax, which could generate substantial revenue for public investments. This revenue could support programs for working families, boost the economy, and promote fair competition.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account," where they make "deposits" through actions that prioritize their partner's happiness. The account balance reflects the security and safety within the relationship, with a positive balance indicating the ability to handle conflicts effectively. The goal is to make more deposits than withdrawals, leading to less intense and frequent arguments. Common ways to bolster the account include expressing appreciation, spending quality time, offering support, and showing affection. This approach aims to foster a stronger and more resilient partnership.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids are ongoing, with active-duty Marines joining National Guard troops in response to the demonstrations. Tensions escalated as protesters blocked a freeway and set self-driving cars on fire, leading to law enforcement using tear gas and rubber bullets. California has sued the Trump administration for deploying the Guard without consulting Governor Newsom, who deemed the move illegal. As of Monday, 53 people have been arrested on charges including failure to disperse, arson, and looting. The LAPD is complying with the California Values Act, which limits local law enforcement's involvement in federal immigration enforcement.</p>

Audits have shown CoreCivic facilities in Tennessee to have higher turnover rates and unfilled positions compared to state-run prisons.

The estimated number of available jobs fell by 63,000 over the three months to May, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. Companies may be holding back on hiring due to increased employment costs, such as higher National Insurance contributions and a rise in the minimum wage. While average wages have slowed to 5.2%, they remain above the rate of inflation.

          <p>A provision in the House-approved "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could make it harder for low-income filers to claim the earned income tax credit (EITC). The measure would require precertification of each qualifying child for filers claiming the EITC, starting in 2028. Policy experts warn that the new rules could burden eligible filers and delay tax refunds, particularly amid IRS cutbacks. While the provision aims to avoid erroneous claims, critics argue that it will create additional administrative challenges for both taxpayers and the IRS.
