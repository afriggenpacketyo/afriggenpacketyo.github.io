          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration in response to the freezing of $2.2 million in funding, escalating a conflict over campus activism related to the war in Gaza. Harvard's president, Alan M Garber, asserts that the administration is attempting to control academic decision-making, infringing upon the university's autonomy. The lawsuit alleges violations of Harvard's constitutional rights and argues that the funding freeze impedes critical research. The administration's actions are portrayed as part of a broader effort to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights, with potential consequences for various research initiatives.</p>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region thought to be involved in consciousness. The map shows connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain areas, potentially revealing the region's role in cognitive functions like memory and abstract thought. The research also highlighted structural differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, which may offer insights into the evolution of consciousness. This study contributes to the ongoing scientific quest to understand how consciousness is generated and why human awareness differs from that of other animals.</p>

          <p>A European Space Agency (ESA) project has launched an experiment to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts. The project involves growing ingredients like protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats for processing into food. A smaller version of a bioreactor has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to orbit the Earth and then return for examination. If successful, this could lead to the development of small pilot food production plants on the International Space Station, potentially revolutionizing long-term space missions.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn as President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser." The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell sharply, fueled by investor concerns over tariff uncertainty and upcoming tech company earnings. The dollar index also slid to its lowest level since 2022, while gold reached a record high, signaling investor apprehension about the safety of U.S. assets. Trump's pressure on Powell to lower interest rates and potential challenges to the Fed's independence are contributing to market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A minke whale found in Long Beach Harbor died from domoic acid poisoning, linked to a toxic algal bloom affecting marine life in Southern California. Test results showed high levels of domoic acid in the whale's urine, consistent with other marine mammals affected by the bloom. This is the fourth consecutive year of domoic acid events, but this year's bloom started earlier and has affected hundreds of sea lions and dolphins. Experts attribute the bloom to an upwelling of nutrients, as well as climate change and runoff from recent fires, but say it's unlikely to significantly affect the overall marine mammal population.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell has assumed the role of "camerlengo," overseeing the Vatican during the "Apostolica Sedes Vacans" period until a new pope is elected. Nominated by Pope Francis in 2019, Cardinal Farrell announced the Pope's death and will play a key role in the mourning ceremonies. Born in Dublin and having spent over 30 years working in the US, Cardinal Farrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 before leading the Vatican's department for the pastoral care of families in 2016.</p>

          <p>U.S. trade officials have finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels from Southeast Asia, concluding a trade case brought by American manufacturers. The Commerce Department imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on solar equipment from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee argued that Chinese solar panel makers with factories in Southeast Asia were shipping panels priced below production cost and receiving unfair subsidies. Dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while anti-subsidy duties range from 14.64% to 3,403.96%.</p>

          <p>A legal showdown in Denver federal court is challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations.

The case involves Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas and questions the legal rights of migrants to challenge government allegations before deportation. The administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, last used during World War II, is being compared to the internment of Japanese Americans, raising concerns about civil liberties.</p>
