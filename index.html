          <p>The Philippines' ambitious National Greening Program (NGP), aimed at reforestation, is facing scrutiny due to satellite data and field reports indicating potential "greenwashing." Analysis suggests deforestation events occur on NGP land, with native trees cleared for cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods. Communities often lack long-term land access and are pushed to grow single, risky export crops. The program's monitoring is limited, and independent audits reveal issues like poor site selection and weak sustainability planning, raising questions about the program's true environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the FIA's new rule regarding front wing flexibility in Formula 1, calling it a "waste of money." The rule, intended to limit aerodynamic exploitation, has reportedly changed little in practice, with wings still bending, just less so. Hamilton stated that teams have had to spend more money to create new wings that meet the updated regulations. He suggested the money could have been better used for charitable causes, as the change has not significantly impacted performance.</p>

Kennedy's emphasis on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has facilitated the development of promising new therapies. Scientists caution against seeking a single "cause" of autism, as it is likely a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors.</p>
