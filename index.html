          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Hegseth characterized China as seeking hegemonic power and preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia, referencing a 2027 deadline for military readiness to invade Taiwan. The US, according to Hegseth, does not seek conflict but aims to ensure China cannot dominate its allies, while China responded by accusing the US of being the biggest troublemaker for regional peace and stability. Hegseth also promoted US military hardware and warned against economic ties with China, saying Beijing would use it as leverage. </p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest ceasefire proposal submitted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff to mediators, reiterating its demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip, and the continuous flow of humanitarian aid. The group's hostage exchange proposal involves the release of 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The White House has confirmed that Israel approved the ceasefire proposal before it was sent to Hamas, while Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction. Fighting continues in Gaza, with Israeli forces reportedly killing dozens of Palestinians in the past 24 hours.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court decisions have made legal immigrants more vulnerable to deportation, marking a significant shift for a population that entered the country legally and shared detailed information with the government. These decisions represent an abrupt turnaround, potentially impacting many immigrants who believed their legal status provided a secure foundation. The implications of these rulings are being closely examined by immigration advocates and legal experts, as they could lead to increased uncertainty and fear within immigrant communities. The court's interpretation of immigration law is now under scrutiny, raising concerns about due process and the rights of long-term legal residents.</p>

Trump has repeatedly expressed his ire at CBSâ€™ 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, suing the network for $20 million over alleged "deceitful editing."

          <p>Obese patients in England and Wales are being denied hip and knee replacements based on their body mass index (BMI) to reduce NHS costs, despite NICE guidelines advising against BMI as a sole restriction. Patients must lose weight before eligibility, but NHS weight loss programs have long waiting lists or have been shut down due to demand. The Royal College of Surgeons criticized the policy, citing potential mobility loss, while a Tory peer called for government action to address the obesity crisis. Research indicates financial pressures drive BMI threshold policies, with inadequate weight management support services available.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched a federal effort to find the environmental causes of autism, declaring it an "epidemic" and suggesting a focus on toxins, chemicals, and vaccines. However, many autism scientists argue that Kennedy is looking in the wrong place, as research has identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, making genetics the most important driver. Experts fear Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of new therapies. Scientists say that the increase in autism rates is mostly explained by expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is facing a lead poisoning crisis, with several schools temporarily closed due to lead detection.

Milwaukee is now conducting its own inspections and free blood testing clinics, but lacks federal expertise to guide epidemiological investigations. The city's experience highlights a broader issue where cities may be left to fend for themselves amid public health emergencies due to federal government cutbacks.</p>

Thousands have already evacuated western Canada, particularly Saskatchewan and Manitoba, due to growing flames and hot, dry weather. Dense smoke from the fires has spread across Canada and into parts of the US, with both Saskatchewan and Manitoba declaring states of emergency and requesting international assistance. The evacuation of the northern First Nations community of Pukatawagan is a rapidly evolving situation, with over 2,000 people still needing to be transported out.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, stating it will release 10 living and 18 deceased hostages. However, the militant group is seeking additional demands, including a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war. The U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff proposed the deal, which includes a 60-day ceasefire, and Israel has accepted the proposal. More than 54,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the war began nearly 20 months ago.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major review of the military, amid concerns about a "new, dangerous era" with a malevolent Russia and uncertainty over US commitment to European defense. The review is expected to underline the importance of nuclear weapons, modernize the forces, and emphasize a greater need for public involvement in protecting the country. However, some suggest the review may be overhyped, with a rhetorical change towards Nato and Europe but no major change in terms of capability. The PM faces political choices about defence, and critics may warn the review falls short of addressing urgent threats.</p>

          <p>An undocumented man accused of threatening to assassinate Donald Trump may have been framed by someone accused of previously attacking him. Investigators are looking into whether the letter was an attempt to get the man deported, preventing him from testifying against his alleged attacker. Local investigators compared the manâ€™s handwriting with the letter and found they did not match. Activists and attorneys stated the man had little formal education and could not read or write in English.</p>
