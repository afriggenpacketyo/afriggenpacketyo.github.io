          <p>The UK has been temporarily exempted from President Trump's executive order which would have doubled steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. This carve-out follows discussions between UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The exemption is contingent upon the UK's compliance with the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed in May 2025, with potential tariff increases possible after July 9, 2025, if compliance is not met. The UK government is working with the US to fully implement the agreement and remove tariffs, but uncertainty remains for UK steel exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that President Trump's policies, particularly tariffs, are distorting market valuations and prompting investors to engage in short selling. He notes that the market often opens lower due to anticipation of Trump's announcements on trade and specific companies, leading to misguided investment decisions. Cramer points to Nvidia's stock fluctuations as an example, highlighting how trade regulations and market skepticism around AI infrastructure impact its performance. He suggests Trump has inadvertently boosted short selling, but that these strategies can backfire when businesses perform well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A storm is brewing in the Atlantic and could potentially impact the U.S. as the hurricane season begins. A non-tropical area of low pressure is expected to form near the southeastern U.S. coast, with a chance of developing subtropical or tropical characteristics. Forecasters are monitoring the storm, with Hurricane Hunters scheduling a reconnaissance flight to investigate the system, and coastal cities may experience poor beach conditions and flash flooding due to heavy downpours.</p>
