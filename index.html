          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at an ICE detention center while protesting its opening. Baraka, who is also running for governor, had previously filed a lawsuit against the facility, arguing it lacked proper permits. Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated Baraka ignored warnings from Homeland Security officials, while Representative LaMonica McIver defended Baraka, stating he did nothing wrong. Baraka was released without bond and charged with a misdemeanor, claiming he was targeted during the protest.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan escalated their military conflict, with Pakistan accusing India of attacking air bases and retaliating with missile strikes. The conflict began after a militant attack in Kashmir, leading to airstrikes and exchanges of fire.

The escalating tensions have caused fear and exhaustion among residents, with some expressing concerns about food shortages and the potential for further escalation.

          <p>China's consumer prices fell in April, raising concerns about deflation amidst ongoing trade tensions. The national consumer price index edged down by 0.1 percent year on year, mirroring the decline seen in the first three months of the year. High tariffs continue to stifle bilateral trade, leaving Chinese manufacturers with unsold goods. Food prices also declined, while service prices saw a slight increase, contributing to the overall deflationary trend.</p>

          <p>Rich Trumka Jr., a fired commissioner of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), claims his dismissal by President Trump is illegal and plans to challenge it in court. Trumka stated he was fired after opposing the inclusion of DOGE members at the agency. He argues that DOGE would undermine the CPSC's lifesaving work. Consumer Reports and Democratic senators have condemned the firing, calling it an attack on product safety.</p>
