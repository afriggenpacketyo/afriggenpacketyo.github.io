          <p>According to a recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey, President Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain in negative territory despite a slight improvement. The survey indicates public disapproval of his handling of most key issues, including inflation and federal spending, with only border security measures receiving a positive rating. Interestingly, while the Democratic party's favorability has sunk to a historic low, they have slightly increased their lead in preference for congressional control. The results highlight conflicting public sentiments on the economy, which has improved in perception but not in future outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the American Association of Individual Investors reveals a significant spike in bearish sentiment, with 43.2% of investors now negative on the stock market's six-month outlook. This 10.2 percentage point increase is the largest since the market top in February, a development some strategists view as a bullish contrarian indicator. The theory suggests that when retail investors are overwhelmingly bearish, they hold more cash, creating potential buying power to fuel a future rally. This pessimism contrasts with the market's continued upward trend, driven by strong earnings and AI enthusiasm. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal aims to resolve decades of tension that most recently flared into conflict in 2023 over a disputed region. As part of the pact, Armenia will grant the U.S. development rights to a new transit corridor, enhancing access to the West without crossing through Russia or Iran. U.S. officials have been working for months to broker this agreement, seeing it as a crucial step for regional stability and energy transit.</p>

Brazil and India have been hit with 50% tariffs due to policies deemed threatening to the U.S. and purchases of Russian oil, respectively. Meanwhile, Mexico and Canada face existing high tariffs, and a temporary tariff truce with China is set to expire soon, adding to global trade uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

This article from The Atlantic details how Nixon, angered by jobs numbers, pressured the agency and sought to remove Jewish employees he baselessly deemed disloyal. However, Nixon ultimately acted more indirectly and with more constraint than Trump, fearing public disapproval and being checked by his staff. The author argues that Trump's direct firing of the commissioner for producing politically inconvenient data demonstrates a more dangerous and unconstrained abuse of presidential authority than even Nixon dared to attempt.</p>

          <p>Amid rising credit card debt totaling $1.21 trillion, many Americans are exploring debt forgiveness as a relief strategy. These programs typically involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing balances by 30% to 50% before fees. However, this approach can negatively impact credit scores as it requires halting payments, and any forgiven debt may be considered taxable income.

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a new $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, a move seen as strengthening the company's position with the Trump administration and mitigating tariff risks. This commitment, which includes a $2.5 billion expansion for glass supplier Corning, helped shift focus from Apple's perceived lag in artificial intelligence strategy, boosting its stock price. The investment could also create a competitive advantage over rivals like Samsung, which may now face higher tariff rates if they don't increase their own U.S. investments. Despite the positive news, challenges regarding AI and legal battles remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he has ordered the Commerce Department to conduct a new U.S. census that will exclude undocumented immigrants from the count. In a social media post, he stated the "new and highly accurate CENSUS" would be based on information from the 2024 presidential election. This move represents his latest attempt to alter the decennial survey, which is constitutionally mandated to count all persons and is used to determine congressional representation and federal funding. The announcement comes as Texas Republicans, backed by Trump, seek to redraw their state's congressional map.</p>

          <p>With the Trump administration's implementation of widespread tariffs creating market volatility, financial advisors are offering strategies for investors. While many suggest staying the course with a long-term view, others point to tactical opportunities in sectors less exposed to trade disputes, such as financials and utilities. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly those focused on non-physical assets like cryptocurrencies or domestically-focused sectors like nuclear energy, are highlighted as tools to manage risk. The article emphasizes that while tariffs make investing tricky, they also create openings for strategic allocation for those willing to look. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers is asking the Trump administration to provide information on employees from the now-decentralized Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) being converted into permanent federal government positions. In a letter, they express alarm that individuals from Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative are embedding themselves in agencies, potentially violating civil service laws and sabotaging key government functions from within. The Office of Personnel Management refuted the claims, stating all hires comply with merit system principles. The move highlights ongoing scrutiny of the controversial DOGE initiative's lasting influence.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by anonymous online interactions and AI communication, is detrimental to personal happiness. Citing research, the author explains that being polite, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can increase one's own happiness and reduce anger. Conversely, witnessing or engaging in rudeness and sarcasm can lower well-being. The author suggests making courtesy a conscious habit, renouncing snark, and responding to rudeness with dignity as practical steps to improve one's own mood and counteract a broader cultural trend of incivility.</p>

The lawmakers fled to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan that could significantly shift congressional power. This development escalates the political standoff, with President Trump also suggesting federal involvement may be necessary. The Democrats' absence breaks the required quorum for legislative business, effectively halting the process, while they maintain they are protesting an undemocratic gerrymandering attempt.</p>

          <p>Startup Neurable is integrating brain-computer interface (BCI) technology into everyday devices like headphones to monitor and improve cognitive functions. Using non-invasive EEG sensors, their technology can track brainwave data to measure focus, and the company is now exploring applications for tracking brain health, potentially detecting early signs of conditions like Alzheimer's or depression. Unlike most health trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, Neurable's approach taps directly into brain activity. The company has already partnered with Master & Dynamic to release a pair of BCI-equipped headphones to the consumer market.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth cut since last August and bringing borrowing costs to their lowest level in more than two years. The decision was narrowly passed, signaling that future cuts may be finely balanced amid concerns over rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. The rate reduction will provide relief for some mortgage holders but could mean lower returns for savers. The move comes as the UK economy shows signs of slowing growth and a softening jobs market.
