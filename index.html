          <p>Rapper Fat Joe, whose real name is Joseph Cartagena, is facing a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Terrance Dixon, alleging sex trafficking, fraud, and more. Dixon claims that Cartagena and his associates engaged in coercive labor exploitation, financial fraud, sexual manipulation, violent intimidation, and psychological coercion during his 15 years of employment. Dixon alleges he contributed lyrics and creative direction to Cartagena's songs without proper compensation and was forced into humiliating situations, including sex acts performed under duress.

Khalil's arrest was widely condemned as an attack on free speech, as he was detained without criminal charges.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly contradicted his Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's proximity to developing a nuclear weapon. Gabbard had stated that Iran is not close to building a nuclear weapon, but Trump asserted that she is "wrong" and that his intelligence community also holds an incorrect assessment. Trump believes Iran was close to having a nuclear weapon and that it is crucial to prevent them from acquiring one. These remarks follow Gabbard's recent warnings about the risks of nuclear war and criticisms of "warmongers."</p>

The attack, which included approximately 20 missiles fired by Iran, coincided with diplomatic efforts in Geneva involving European foreign ministers and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Despite the ongoing conflict, Araghchi expressed openness to dialogue with parties other than the U.S. and emphasized Iran's readiness to consider diplomacy again, while President Trump stated the U.S. is ready and willing to engage with Iran to see what happens.</p>

          <p>A grand jury in Colorado has indicted Barry Morphew for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were discovered more than three years after she went missing. Morphew was previously charged with her murder in 2021, but the charges were dropped shortly before trial; now he has been taken into custody in Arizona and will be extradited to face the new charges. The indictment states that Suzanne Morphew's body was found in September 2023 and that her death was ruled a homicide caused by undetermined means in the setting of intoxication by drugs used to sedate animals. Barry Morphew denies any involvement in his wife's death, with his attorney stating that the case has not changed and the outcome will not either.</p>

A Tesla Safety Monitor will be present in the front passenger seat during the trips, which are confined to a geofenced area of the city and monitored remotely.

          <p>President Trump has a history of setting two-week deadlines for major decisions, a pattern dating back to his first term. From tax plans to geopolitical conflicts, Trump has repeatedly promised action or updates within a fortnight, often with little or no follow-through. Recent examples include decisions on military action in the Israel-Iran conflict and tariffs on U.S. trading partners. Critics note that these deadlines often pass without resolution, suggesting they are a tactic to delay or avoid making difficult decisions.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged with attempting to kidnap Memphis Mayor Paul Young after appearing at the mayor's home with a Taser, rope, and duct tape. Trenton Abston, 25, is facing charges of attempted kidnapping, stalking, and aggravated criminal trespass. Abston admitted to researching Young's address and stated he went to the mayor's house to confront him about crime in Memphis, according to a police affidavit. The incident occurred shortly after a similar event in Minnesota, prompting Young to comment on the link between angry online rhetoric and real-life violence.</p>

          <p>Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that Iran is open to further diplomacy with the US only if Israel's aggression against his country ceases and the aggressor is held accountable.

Araghchi emphasized that Iran's capabilities, including its missile capabilities, are non-negotiable. With military commanders warning of a prolonged war, the path to direct talks between the US and Iran remains blocked, leaving European countries as intermediaries.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been re-arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, whose remains were found over three years after she was reported missing. Morphew was initially arrested in 2021 but charges were dropped before trial; he has maintained his innocence throughout the investigation. Suzanne Morphew's skeletal remains were discovered in September 2023, and an autopsy report ruled her death a homicide by undetermined means, with a cocktail of drugs used to tranquilize wildlife found in her bones. The case continues to draw significant attention and scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated 639 employees at Voice of America (VOA) and its parent organization, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), significantly reducing the international broadcasting service. These cuts represent the near-complete dismantling of VOA, an organization founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, leaving only 250 employees across the USAGM. Critics argue that the move undermines America's strategy of using broadcasting to promote democratic values globally, while Trump's senior advisor Kari Lake has called it an effort to dismantle a bloated, unaccountable bureaucracy.</p>

He is accused of potentially influencing voters through the post, which may constitute offences of foreign election interference and campaigning during restricted periods.
