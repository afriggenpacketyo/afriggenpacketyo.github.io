          <p>A tragic shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis during a school year-opening Mass resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, with 17 others, mostly children, injured. The 23-year-old shooter, Robin Westman, died by suicide at the scene, having legally purchased the three firearms used. Investigators are examining a scheduled YouTube video described as a manifesto with "disturbing writings." The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and an anti-Catholic hate crime, prompting widespread condemnation and calls for action from local and federal officials. While all injured children are expected to survive, the community grapples with the profound impact of this horrific event, highlighting ongoing concerns about violence in public spaces.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is replacing his principal private secretary, Nin Pandit, after just ten months in the role, making her the third top aide to leave or be moved within a year. Concerns about Ms. Pandit's effectiveness in the demanding position, which acts as the prime minister's gatekeeper, have been cited, although Downing Street disputes this. She will transition to a new policy delivery role within No 10, while critics, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, accuse Starmer of a lack of plan and direction amidst these staff changes. The moves occur as a broader reshuffle of junior ministers is also anticipated.</p>

          <p>A B-52 bomber nearly collided with a Delta airliner and, seconds later, a small private plane over North Dakota last month, according to a preliminary NTSB report. The incidents, which occurred after a state fair flyover, involved confusing commands from air traffic control, leading to an abrupt maneuver by the Delta pilot carrying 80 people. These close calls, the latest in a series of aviation safety concerns, highlight potential coordination issues at smaller airports lacking radar systems. The NTSB's final report, due next year, will further investigate the cause, emphasizing the need for improved air traffic management.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend reported that her opponent, Jelena Ostapenko, told her she had "no class" and "no education" after Townsend's second-round victory at the U.S. Open. Townsend, who is Black, addressed whether the comments had racial undertones, stating she didn't interpret them that way but acknowledged the historical stigma. Ostapenko later posted on Instagram denying accusations of racism, attributing her frustration to Townsend's perceived disrespect regarding a net cord point and warm-up routine. The incident highlights tensions in competitive sports, with Townsend dismissing any "beef" on her part.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing "small changes" to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodations, which currently require properties to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates. The new proposals include allowing an average of 182 days let over several years and counting up to 14 days of charity donations towards the target. However, industry groups like PASC and the Wales Tourism Alliance criticize these adjustments as insufficient, arguing the 182-day threshold continues to harm the tourism industry and that more significant reductions are needed.</p>

          <p>A Vox investigation highlights repeated allegations of horrific animal abuse at dairy farms supplying Fairlife, the Coca-Cola-owned milk brand, despite the company's claims of humane treatment. Undercover footage from Animal Recovery Mission documented workers kicking cows, hitting them with metal pipes, and dragging calves with tractors. This follows previous scandals and lawsuits against Fairlife, revealing systemic welfare issues in the dairy industry where animals lack legal protection. Critics argue that the company's continued success despite these findings underscores consumers' willingness to overlook ethical concerns in pursuit of protein.</p>

          <p>The value of small packages from China, exempt from UK import taxes, more than doubled to £3 billion last year, constituting 51% of all such imports. This surge is attributed to Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, leading British businesses to complain of unfair competition due to being undercut on prices. Industry groups also warn of potential consumer exposure to unsafe products. The UK government is reviewing these "low-value import" rules, while some suggest the removal of the tax exemption could disproportionately affect lower-income consumers and small firms.

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's focus on aesthetics, from redesigning federal buildings to taking over the Kennedy Center, is a deliberate effort to rebrand America in his own image.

This project aims to establish new American norms and redefine what it means to be American, emphasizing a "survival of the fittest" mentality.

          <p>New data from Insurify indicates that electric vehicle (EV) insurance premiums are significantly higher, averaging 49% more than gas-powered cars, at $4,058 annually. This hidden cost stems from EVs' higher sticker prices, increased repair expenses for specialized parts, and higher claims frequency. The findings add to the financial challenges for prospective EV owners, alongside tariffs and expiring government incentives. While California's widespread EV adoption helps lower state-specific premiums, the national trend suggests that ongoing insurance fees could offset maintenance and fuel savings, impacting the broader transition to electric vehicles.

          <p>Nvidia reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for Q2 2026, projecting over 50% sales growth for the next quarter, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure. Despite this, the stock declined in extended trading as its data center revenue fell slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The company expects significant AI infrastructure spending by 2030, and while H20 chip shipments to China remain uncertain, Nvidia benefited from inventory release outside China. This quarter marked Nvidia's slowest growth since the generative AI boom began in mid-2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's contentious relationship with the National Football League spans over 40 years, marked by failed team ownership bids, a lawsuit against the league, and vocal criticism of player anthem protests. The article details how Trump's efforts to acquire an NFL franchise, including buying the USFL's New Jersey Generals and leading an anti-trust lawsuit, ultimately failed. His public disputes with the NFL, including urging boycotts and calling for player firings, have been a recurring theme, even influencing his presidential run. Despite a recent White House meeting with the NFL commissioner, tensions could reignite over stadium plans or a new media deal.</p>

The U.S. State Department confirmed the meeting, reiterating respect for Greenland's self-determination but declining to comment on private citizens' actions.
