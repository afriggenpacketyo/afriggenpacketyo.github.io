          <p>A Russian drone strike killed at least nine civilians on a shuttle bus in the Sumy region of northeastern Ukraine, following the first face-to-face talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in over three years. The strike, which President Zelensky called a deliberate attack on civilians, occurred shortly after both sides agreed to a prisoner exchange of 1,000 individuals each. Despite diplomatic efforts, the conflict continues with daily casualties and rising civilian deaths, prompting Zelensky to call for stronger sanctions against Russia and express skepticism about achieving peace without external pressure.

          <p>Four lawsuits have been filed in Kansas against pornographic websites for allegedly violating state law by failing to implement adequate age-verification systems. These suits, filed by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation on behalf of a minor, mark the first time a minor has sought legal remedy through state age-verification laws. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach believes these actions, combined with his office's lawsuit against a porn site, indicate the law is functioning as intended, holding companies accountable for marketing material accessible to minors.

          <p>The US is finally seeing a decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional figures showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. This progress is attributed to the increased availability of naloxone, which is highly effective in preventing overdose deaths when administered promptly. Policies such as over-the-counter naloxone access and telehealth for addiction treatment have also contributed to the decline. The article highlights the positive impact of these interventions while noting ongoing challenges with stimulant-related deaths and potential funding cuts for naloxone distribution.</p>
