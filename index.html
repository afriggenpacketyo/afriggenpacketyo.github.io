          <p>Over 30 years after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved. The 1991 crime, which involved the victims being tied up, shot, and the shop set on fire, has left a lasting scar on the community. Despite initial arrests and convictions that were later overturned due to new DNA evidence, investigators are still searching for answers. The focus has returned to a small sample of unidentified male DNA and two mysterious customers seen in the shop that night, representing the last hope for solving the case.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a new electronic warfare capability using a swarm of drones. The technology can reportedly create an "electromagnetic storm eye," a protected zone for friendly forces where enemy jamming signals are nullified. By precisely adjusting their signals, the drones can simultaneously jam adversary communications while ensuring allied communications remain clear. This targeted approach marks a potential evolution from traditional, indiscriminate jamming methods that affect both friend and foe.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the enduring power of the Nanking massacre as a cultural and national symbol for the Chinese people. The author notes that recent films depicting the wartime event have prompted a wave of reflection, particularly among younger generations learning about this traumatic history for the first time. The piece argues that the massacre is more than a historical chapter; it is a deep moral wound on the national identity. This sentiment is compounded by the perception that the Japanese government has never properly acknowledged or atoned for the atrocity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million. This news comes despite Hojlund's recent statements expressing his desire to remain with the club. The potential sale is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While the club insists it can make a new signing without first selling players, an exit would be necessary to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules, and Hojlund would likely be marginalized if a new striker arrives.

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it may become more "careful" with its open-source approach. This shift in strategy contrasts with China's current embrace of open-source AI, where companies are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development. This comes as Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently launched powerful new open-source models.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved by researchers. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 but died during the final leg of its sea voyage. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, newly analyzed records, including the attendant's logbook, reveal the platypus likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, with water temperatures far exceeding a safe threshold.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly relying on the development of large-scale theme parks to help drive domestic consumer spending and boost local economies. The recent opening of the world's largest Legoland resort is the latest example of this trend, adding to the more than 4,400 amusement facilities already in the country. According to a global industry association, the number of attractions is forecast to grow significantly in the coming years. Experts note that for every yuan of revenue a theme park generates, it creates a much larger economic impact in the surrounding area.</p>

          <p>Lebanon is mourning the death of Ziad Rahbani, a uniquely influential musician, composer, and playwright who passed away at age 69. Born into a famous artistic family, Rahbani carved his own path with work that was deeply political and often critical of the sectarian divisions that fueled Lebanon's civil war. His music, which blended jazz and other global styles with Arab traditions, gave voice to the common person. He was also known for his transformative collaborations with his mother, the legendary singer Fairuz, bringing a more raw and human element to her iconic status.</p>

          <p>Kori Schake, a foreign policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, argues that President Trump's approach to foreign policy is dangerously weakening the United States. In a recent article, she contends that Trump's belief that allies are a burden ignores how U.S. power relies on international cooperation. Schake warns that by treating allies poorly and imposing arbitrary tariffs, the administration is pushing countries like Japan and South Korea to hedge against American power. This, she fears, could lead to a world where the U.S. has less influence and must face global threats without the help of its friends.</p>

He explained that NPR has a formal protocol to ensure his independence, allowing him to cover the network as he would any other major media outlet, without interference from executives. Folkenflik noted the current climate of intense pressure on the press, from political attacks and lawsuits to the recent defunding of public broadcasting.

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with far-right and white nationalist extremism. Mason traces the evolution of the movement's rhetoric from a legal focus on overturning Roe v. Wade to an insurrectionary one of ignoring the rule of law. She contends that shared conspiracy theories and a narrative of protecting "Western Christian civilization" have created a bridge between anti-abortion activists and other extremist groups, culminating in shared participation in events like the January 6 Capitol riot.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense targeting those who use the internet to advertise or promote illegal small boat crossings over the English Channel. The proposed law, part of a broader immigration bill, could lead to prison sentences of up to five years for offenders. This move aims to give law enforcement more power to disrupt the business model of people-smuggling gangs, who frequently use social media to sell fake documents or promise safe passage and employment. The Home Office notes that a high percentage of migrants report using social media to facilitate their journeys.</p>
