          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump Employs 'Madman Theory' in Foreign Policy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Examines President Trump's foreign policy approach, arguing it aligns with the "Madman Theory," where a leader cultivates an image of unpredictability to gain strategic advantages. The article cites his actions toward NATO allies, his rhetoric on international commitments, and his sudden strike on Iran as examples of this doctrine in practice. Experts quoted suggest this strategy has successfully pressured allies to increase defense spending but may be less effective against adversaries like Russia.</p>

          <p>Details how the UK's Charity Commission issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point and disqualified one of its trustees. The action followed a sermon delivered days after the October 7 Hamas attacks that the regulator deemed "inflammatory and divisive," noting it was not in the charity's best interests. The trustee, who accepted the sermon lacked sufficient context, is barred from senior charity management roles for three years.</p>
