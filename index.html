          <p>The qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marked by chaos, running twice its normal length due to a record six red flags caused by numerous driver crashes. Difficult weather conditions, including strong winds and light rain, contributed to the incidents on the notoriously challenging Baku street circuit. Title contenders Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both made errors, failing to capitalize on opportunities and securing disappointing starting positions of seventh and ninth, respectively. The unpredictable session has set the stage for what is expected to be an eventful race with a mixed-up grid.</p>

          <p>Top Democratic leaders in Congress have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a solution and prevent an impending government shutdown. The request comes as the September 30 deadline to fund the government approaches, with both parties currently at a stalemate. A short-term Republican spending bill passed the House but failed in the Senate, as did a competing Democratic bill. Both sides are publicly blaming the other for the potential shutdown, with Democrats accusing GOP leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks to keep the government open.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with so-called sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois of potential lawsuits and funding cuts for refusing to honor immigration detainers. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding compliance, stating that the states' policies result in the release of criminals into communities. The states argue that ICE detainers are requests, not mandates, and that compliance could lead to liability for unlawful detention. This move signals a deepening clash between federal immigration enforcement and state laws designed to protect undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "Lush!", actress Joanna Page, known for her role in "Gavin and Stacey," recounts being groped by a television host during filming. She reveals that a female producer had warned her beforehand that the host could be "very handsy" and would likely touch her. Page states that she confronted the host directly when the incident occurred, telling him to stop, after which he desisted. She describes the situation as bizarre but notes that such behavior was something one became accustomed to in the industry at the time, choosing not to name the individual for legal reasons.</p>

          <p>An armed man was taken into custody at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the site of an upcoming memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individual, who was carrying a gun and a knife, allegedly exhibited suspicious behavior and presented inactive law enforcement credentials to Secret Service agents. He is not an authorized law enforcement officer for the event, which has been designated a Level 1 security event, requiring extensive federal support. The service is expected to draw up to 100,000 attendees, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to stop U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, saving the jobs of nearly 800 workers. The government exercised its "golden share" rights, a new power acquired as a condition of the recent takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon. This national-security agreement grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. The move marks the first use of this authority and highlights the administration's increasing willingness to directly influence private sector operations to protect American jobs and industry.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what his Boston venue described as a "credible threat" on his life. The threat was reportedly made online by a 26-year-old man in Ottawa, Canada, who has since been charged by police. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, performances at Boston's MGM Music Hall and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were called off. All tickets for the canceled shows will be refunded, and Morrissey's tour is currently scheduled to resume in Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>A recent study from China details a new artificial intelligence system capable of detecting even the most advanced stealth submarines with approximately 95% accuracy. The system reportedly processes vast amounts of data from various sensors in real-time to identify underwater targets, potentially undermining a key pillar of Western nuclear deterrence. While the technology represents a significant advancement in anti-submarine warfare, some Western military experts express skepticism, viewing the announcement partly as psychological warfare and noting the extreme complexity of implementing such a system in the real world.

This shift towards a "less is more" philosophy is presented not as a sign of progress but as a reflection of a world that feels increasingly controlled and hollow.

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to address the UK's asylum application backlog. The party's plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued that this emergency measure is necessary to quickly secure funds and resources. The goal is to reduce the costly and prolonged use of hotels to house asylum seekers while creating a more efficient and humane system.</p>

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of firing multiple shots into the lobby of the ABC10 news station. The incident occurred on Friday afternoon while the building was occupied, though no injuries were reported. The shooting followed a protest held at the station the previous day against ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. While the timing has raised questions, police have stated that the motive for the shooting remains under investigation and it is not yet clear if the attack was targeted or random.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his killing, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being portrayed as a martyr by figures within the Christian nationalist movement. His widow, Erika Kirk, described her weeping as a "battle cry," and prominent pastors have stated that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." The article traces Kirk's own political evolution from a secular young Republican to an advocate for Christian culture war issues. Experts note this framing of his death could serve to energize and mainstream the Christian nationalist ideology that he increasingly embraced during the Trump era.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes achieved multiple record closing highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point. This was the first rate reduction since last December, and central bankers have signaled that two more cuts could occur in 2025. The move boosted investor confidence, leading to weekly gains of approximately 1.2% for the S&P 500 and 2.2% for the Nasdaq.

The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never publicly disclosed the reason for their detention.

          <p>In a recent interview at The Atlantic Festival, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the subject of a global scandal in 1998 to becoming an anti-bullying activist. She discussed how the cultural landscape has changed, particularly for young women in the public eye, and the importance of younger generations re-examining her story with a new perspective. Lewinsky emphasized that a key part of her healing was realizing she could not run from her past but had to find a way to reclaim her own story. She now works to help others, like Amanda Knox, do the same.</p>

          <p>The United States has become less public about its naval warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait under the current Trump administration. While such operations were regularly announced during the previous administration as a show of support for freedom of navigation, there have only been three known transits since January, none of which were proactively publicized by the U.S. military. Beijing has long criticized the "public hype" around these maneuvers, and some Chinese observers see the new, lower-profile approach as a tactical shift rather than a substantive change in U.S. policy.</p>

Data shows a significant increase in students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants noting a particular spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the lower cost of education overseas is a primary motivator, as median tuition in Europe can be significantly cheaper than at U.S. public universities. This trend reflects a shifting perspective on higher education among some American families.</p>

The crossings occurred on the same day the UK government confirmed it had deported two men to France under a new "one-in-one-out" return agreement.
