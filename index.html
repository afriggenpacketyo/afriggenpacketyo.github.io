          <p>Lyle Menendez was denied parole, a day after his brother Erik faced a similar rejection, keeping both imprisoned over three decades after their parents' 1989 murders in Beverly Hills. Lyle's hearing focused on his illicit cell phone use in prison, despite his claims of remorse and efforts to help other inmates. This decision marks a setback for the brothers, who still have potential avenues for freedom through clemency from Governor Newsom or a new trial based on newly alleged childhood sexual abuse. The parole board cited a 'moderate risk' of violence if Lyle were released, noting anti-social traits and issues with accepting consequences. His next parole hearing is scheduled for three years from now.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has expanded an order blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to dozens of 'sanctuary' cities and counties, including Los Angeles and Chicago. The judge ruled the administration's policy, which aimed to punish local governments limiting cooperation with immigration enforcement, was unconstitutional. Cities argue these policies are an abuse of power, violate the Tenth Amendment, and help build trust between police and immigrant communities. This legal challenge underscores the ongoing conflict between federal immigration enforcement priorities and local governance. The ruling prevents the administration from using funding as leverage against these jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>The US Justice Department released over 300 pages of interview transcripts with Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted sexual trafficker and associate of Jeffrey Epstein. In the interviews, Maxwell denied that former President Trump was a close friend of Epstein or acted inappropriately, and also refuted claims of introducing Prince Andrew to Epstein. She expressed disbelief in Epstein's suicide but found theories of his murder by external parties 'ludicrous.' Maxwell detailed her financial relationship with Epstein and dismissed the existence of a 'client list.' These transcripts aim to provide more transparency on the Epstein case. The release followed political pressure on the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Virginia leaders from both Republican and Democratic parties have condemned a racist sign displayed at a protest targeting Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. The sign, raised during a rally against a transgender bathroom policy, linked Earle-Sears' stance to historical racial segregation. Governor Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares denounced the 'idiocy' and 'horrific display of racism.' Democratic state Senator Ghazala Hashmi also criticized the sign for evoking the 'pain of racism.'

          <p>Malaysia has banned the export of unprocessed rare earth metals, aiming to retain these critical raw materials onshore for investment in downstream industries. This strategic move is intended to attract foreign investors who commit to local processing, job creation, and technology transfers. Analysts suggest this positions Malaysia as a significant alternative supplier to China for the mineral-hungry United States, amidst strained US-China trade relations. The policy signals Malaysia's intent to leverage its geoeconomic agency to prioritize its own development needs. This could lead to substantial foreign investment in the country's rare earth sector.

          <p>Hong Kong has surpassed the United States as the leading initial public offering (IPO) venue for mainland Chinese companies this year, marking a significant milestone for the city's capital market. Forty-six Chinese firms raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong, compared to sixteen listings totaling $740.9 million in the US. New shares in Hong Kong have seen an average debut jump of 19.4%, significantly outperforming US listings. This shift is attributed to Hong Kong's more active market, the ongoing rivalry between China and the US, and lingering delisting risks for Chinese stocks in American markets.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances reveals that air pollution from oil and gas activities disproportionately harms Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian American communities across the US. The research, which quantifies health effects from every stage of oil and gas, links this pollution to an estimated 91,000 premature deaths, 10,350 preterm births, and 216,000 new cases of childhood asthma annually. California, particularly Los Angeles County, ranks among the most affected states. The disparities are attributed to historical zoning practices like 'redlining' and the permitting of large factories near these communities.

Surveys show more young women identify as left-wing and favor parties like Labour or the Greens, while young men are more likely to support Reform UK or the Conservatives. Researchers suggest factors such as higher education rates among women and differing responses to societal changes, including traditional masculinity, contribute to this gap. This trend highlights the volatility in British politics and a growing sense among young people that the traditional two-party system is failing them. Social media is also suspected to play a significant role.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel deployed in Washington D.C. to be armed, intensifying the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses a previous stance where troops were unarmed. President Trump lauded the mission as bringing 'total safety' to D.C. and suggested expanding it to Chicago, despite strong opposition from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser and Mayor Brandon Johnson, who cite deep unpopularity among residents and concerns about escalating tensions. The administration is considering declaring a national emergency to extend the deployment beyond its initial 30-day deadline, with Attorney General Pam Bondi reporting hundreds of arrests and firearm seizures.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration touts over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as a success in its crime crackdown, criminal justice experts caution that these numbers are not reliable indicators of public safety. They highlight a lack of transparency regarding who was arrested and why, and that strategies like 'flooding the zone' often lead to more arrests without necessarily reducing crime or leading to convictions. White House officials indicated that a significant portion of arrests were immigration-related. Experts warn that increased police presence can lead to more uses of force and create a 'pressure cooker environment,' raising concerns about civil liberties and the true impact on crime rates.</p>

Evacuation orders and warnings have been issued for hundreds of residents around Calistoga, a renowned wine region, as firefighters battle challenging conditions. The fire is only 5% contained, and fire risks remain exceptionally high across the American West due to high temperatures, low humidity, and the potential for dry thunderstorms. This year has already seen over 44,800 ignitions nationwide, the highest in a decade. The prolonged heatwave also poses significant threats to public health.

          <p>The FBI's search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home is being widely interpreted as a warning shot in the Trump administration's campaign against the 'deep state.' This action, alongside recent security clearance revocations and military officer firings, suggests a politicization of the legal and intelligence systems. Experts express alarm at the 'chilling effect' on intelligence professionals, who fear retribution for speaking out. President Trump's public denigration of Bolton further fuels concerns about political motivations behind such investigations.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, now faces potential deportation to Uganda, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official. His attorneys received notice of this possibility shortly after his release from pre-trial detention in Tennessee on federal human smuggling charges. Uganda recently became the latest 'third country' to agree to accept deportees from the US who are not its citizens, a practice increasingly utilized by the Trump administration. An immigration judge previously ruled Abrego Garcia could not be deported to El Salvador due to fears of gang persecution. He plans to return to his family in Maryland.</p>

Victims described the profound pain and shame of discovering their loved ones' bodies had been left to rot. The judge cited an 'overwhelming perception' that the proposed justice did not reflect the truth of the victims' experiences.

          <p>President Trump's federal intervention to clear homeless encampments in Washington D.C. is drawing parallels to San Francisco's aggressive policies, which followed a landmark Supreme Court ruling allowing penalties for sleeping rough. While San Francisco's crackdown led to a visible reduction in tents and increased arrests, overall homelessness numbers continued to rise, raising questions about the policy's effectiveness in solving the root issue. Advocates for people experiencing homelessness view such criminalization as punitive and ineffective, arguing it merely cycles individuals through the system. San Francisco has allocated significant funds to address the crisis, aiming to combine deterrence with shelter and supportive housing initiatives. This strategy is now being observed as a potential blueprint for D.C.</p>

This growing trend targets established but not superstar artists, leading to confusion among fans and potential royalty theft. The AI-generated tracks often mimic the artists' styles but lack human creative input, resulting in 'vacuous' sound. Artists face challenges in getting these fake releases removed, with some platforms being slower than others. This issue highlights a lack of legal safeguards for artists and the increasing ease with which fraudsters can exploit online music distribution, prompting calls for platforms to be more proactive.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) has achieved a new record high, its first since 2021, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish comments at Jackson Hole, hinting at potential interest rate cuts in September. This speech triggered a 'panicked repositioning' in the crypto market, with significant short liquidations pushing Ether's price even higher. Shares of Ether-focused companies also saw substantial gains. This surge is attributed to regulatory tailwinds and a boom in institutional interest around stablecoins, many of which are powered by the Ethereum blockchain.
