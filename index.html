          <p>Charles Rangel, the longtime U.S. congressman from New York City, Korean War veteran, and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served New York's 13th Congressional District for 23 terms and became the first Black chair of the House's Ways and Means Committee. Despite facing ethics violations later in his career, he remained a respected figure in Harlem, known for his dedication to affordable housing, urban revitalization, and equal opportunities. Leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Kathy Hochul have honored Rangel's legacy of public service and his impact on American politics, remembering him as a champion for justice and a fierce advocate for his constituents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the ACS’ Environmental Science & Technology found that some beers brewed in the US contain elevated levels of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," exceeding EPA limits. The research team modified an EPA testing tool to analyze 23 beers, discovering that beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had the highest concentrations. There was a strong correlation between PFAS levels in municipal drinking water and the beer brewed locally, with 95% of beers tested containing perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid. International beers from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor to Germany for the first time in 34 years, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets rising to a record high, partly due to a weaker yen, Germany's gross external assets reached 569.65 trillion yen, surpassing Japan's 533.05 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets when converted, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. The United States, in contrast, had a net external liability, with foreign debts exceeding overseas assets.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD experienced a significant drop following the company's announcement of price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models. The price reductions, aimed at boosting sales, sparked investor concerns about increased competition and a potential price war in the EV sector. Analysts at Citi, however, remain optimistic, expecting robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan due to relatively mild competition. Shares of other Chinese automakers, including Geely Automobile and Great Wall Motor Co, also declined amidst investor caution.</p>

While state-owned firms saw a profit decline, private enterprises and those with foreign investments showed improvements.

          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, a move that could affect the current frenzy of wealthy individuals buying teams. The legislation would limit the deduction of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, to half their value over 15 years, potentially raising nearly $1 billion over a decade. While this change would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and impact the value of current investments. The White House claims the measure aims to ensure fairness for fans and prevent overcharging, while team owners view it as punitive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is pardoning Scott Jenkins, a former Virginia sheriff convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for making businessmen sworn law enforcement officers. Jenkins was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Trump claimed Jenkins was a victim of a "Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ" and said he does not deserve to spend any time in jail. Federal prosecutors say Jenkins took $75,000 in bribes, giving badges to individuals without proper training or vetting.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging retailers like Walmart to absorb the costs of tariffs on goods from China, a move that contradicts basic business principles. Trump's demand ignores the reality that increased expenses must eventually be passed on to consumers. While some companies may attempt to mitigate the impact, tariffs are essentially a tax on imported goods, paid by the importer, which will inevitably lead to price increases. Some companies are hesitant to acknowledge this, fearing backlash, while smaller businesses are more openly communicating the surcharges to their customers.</p>

          <p>The government is implementing changes to apprenticeships in England, shifting the focus to providing more training opportunities for individuals under 21. The reforms will scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships, making employers fully responsible for the costs of level 7 apprenticeships. These level 7 apprenticeships are used by people training in a wide variety of roles, including accountants, tax advisors and solicitors, most of whom are already in work. Only students under the age of 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships.</p>

          <p>Severe thunderstorms across the Southeast and central United States caused significant flight delays during the Memorial Day weekend, a peak time for travel. Over 5,000 flights were delayed, primarily affecting airports in Texas and Colorado, with Dallas Fort Worth and Denver International experiencing the most disruptions. The storms brought damaging winds, heavy rains, and the potential for tornadoes, leading to power outages in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Despite the weather, AAA had projected a record 45.1 million people would travel at least 50 miles from home during the holiday weekend.</p>
