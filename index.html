          <p>Analysts suggest that China's recent anti-corruption crackdown within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) does not indicate a weakening of President Xi Jinping's control over the military. The article states that the campaign's effect on the military's war readiness and modernization remains limited. The investigation has targeted members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), including Miao Hua, and former defense ministers Li Shangfu and Wei Fenghe, all suspected of corruption. This sweeping campaign signals an effort to maintain discipline and loyalty within the ranks. </p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated the call-up of tens of thousands of reservists in preparation for an expanded offensive in Gaza, with the stated goals of securing the release of hostages and defeating Hamas militants. Critics are questioning the effectiveness of the military's actions in securing the release of captives. The renewed military expansion involves operating in new areas and destroying infrastructure above and below ground. This decision raises concerns about the strain on reservists and the humanitarian impact on Gazans, as well as the true intentions of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Gaza. </p>

The announcement follows pressure from figures like Elon Musk and praise from groups like PETA. The closure reflects a broader trend of phasing out animal testing, with the FDA and EPA also announcing reductions in animal testing requirements. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump has called for the reopening of Alcatraz prison to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders, stating that the U.S. was once a more serious nation that did not hesitate to lock up dangerous criminals. He said the reopening of the San Francisco prison would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice. The prison's closure in 1963 was attributed to crumbling infrastructure and high repair costs. A spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said it would "comply with all presidential orders". </p>

The exhibit featured portraits of 120 people killed by gun violence. The DOJ suggested it will still honor victims in other ways, but not only of gun violence. The removal was first reported by The Washington Post, and the Biden administration had planned to honor a new group of 200 victims each year. </p>

          <p>Former President Trump criticized Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for rejecting his offer to send U.S. troops into Mexico to combat drug cartels, attributing her reluctance to fear of the cartels.

Sheinbaum reiterated that sovereignty is not for sale and that cooperation should occur within each country's territory.
