          <p>Syria is scheduled to hold its first parliamentary elections since the fall of the Assad regime, a move seen as a historic step towards a new political future. The new 210-member parliament will serve a three-year transitional term, with 70 members appointed by interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa and 140 chosen by regional committees. While the new electoral system offers hope, significant challenges remain, including a lack of trust among minority groups and concerns over al-Sharaa's influence. Experts are cautiously optimistic, noting the elections are proceeding despite recent unrest, but the true inclusivity and legitimacy of the new government remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several German states are increasingly using "Gotham," a controversial surveillance software from US tech company Palantir, to analyze vast amounts of data for police investigations. Civil rights groups, like the Society for Civil Rights (GFF), have filed constitutional complaints, arguing the technology violates privacy rights by potentially ensnaring innocent individuals without their knowledge. Critics, including the Chaos Computer Club, also raise concerns about the software's lack of transparency and Germany's growing dependence on a foreign tech firm with ties to US intelligence. The German government remains divided on its federal use, despite public backlash and a petition with over 264,000 signatures.</p>

          <p>After a decade with Tottenham Hotspur, star forward Son Heung-min is departing the club, leaving behind a significant legacy. The South Korean international, who joined in 2015, made 454 appearances, scored 173 goals, and recently captained the team to a Europa League victory, ending a 17-year trophy drought. This article reflects on his journey, from his initial struggles and near-exit to becoming a Premier League Golden Boot winner and a global icon, beloved by fans and teammates for his on-pitch brilliance and off-pitch generosity. His departure marks the end of an era for Spurs, who now face a future without one of their most celebrated players.</p>

          <p>While in England for The Hundred cricket tournament, retired Australian cricketer David Warner has offered some pointed analysis of England's team ahead of the winter Ashes series. Warner highlighted that England's star batter, Joe Root, has yet to score a century in Australia and suggested he needs to adjust his technique to counter bowlers like Josh Hazlewood. Warner also commented on the challenge English bowlers will face and made a lighthearted remark about facing his old rival James Anderson with a white ball instead of a red one. The comments add a layer of friendly rivalry as both teams prepare for the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data presents a mixed and chaotic picture of the U.S. economy during President Trump's second term, challenging the administration's claims of a consistent boom. While second-quarter GDP showed robust growth, it followed an unexpected contraction and was accompanied by a significant drop in private investment. Wild swings in import and export figures reflect the market's reaction to the administration's unpredictable tariff strategy. Furthermore, despite Trump's public pressure, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates on hold due to stubborn inflation, and a recent report showed a surprising slowdown in job creation, complicating the overall economic narrative.

          <p>A new comic from NPR's Life Kit delves into the common yet often uncomfortable experience of receiving a compliment. The piece features insights from social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao, who explain the science behind why praise can make people feel awkward. They discuss how one's reaction to a compliment can reveal self-perception and also impact the person giving the praise. Ultimately, the comic makes a case for learning to graciously accept kind remarks, highlighting the psychological benefits for both the giver and the receiver. The article aims to help readers navigate these small but significant social interactions more smoothly.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Flattery Has Become a Key Diplomatic Strategy for World Leaders Engaging with Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of interactions between world leaders and President Trump suggests a strategic shift towards using praise and flattery as a primary diplomatic tool during his second term. Leaders from the UK, Israel, and the EU have been observed offering effusive compliments and symbolic honors, a contrast to the more skeptical approach seen during his first term. Experts suggest this change reflects a recognition of Trump's personal and decisive leadership style, where appealing to his desire to be seen as a winner can yield tangible results, such as increased NATO defense spending. This strategy highlights a pragmatic adaptation by foreign governments to navigate his transactional and personality-driven approach to international relations.</p>

The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the Swedish forward, whom they value at around £150 million. Isak has been absent from the team's pre-season tour, officially due to a minor injury, and has been training alone at his former club, a development Howe learned about through the media.

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of weaker-than-expected jobs data. The July employment report showed only 73,000 jobs were added, far below forecasts, and included significant downward revisions for previous months, fueling alarm over the economic impact of his tariff policies. Trump claimed without evidence that the figures were "RIGGED," a move that drew sharp criticism for politicizing vital economic data and undermining public trust. The dismissal, which former officials likened to actions in authoritarian countries, coincided with a sharp drop in U.S. stock markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing an ancient link to a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists discovered that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event around nine million years ago between a tomato ancestor and a non-tuberous, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-breeding was a key driver in the development of the potato's tuber, the edible part that has made it a global staple food. The findings, published in the journal Cell, provide a new understanding of how this crucial agricultural crop evolved.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC secured a 4-2 penalty shootout victory against Pachuca after a 1-1 draw in their Leagues Cup match, but the result leaves them nearly eliminated from the tournament. LAFC needed an outright win to have a realistic chance of advancing, and earning only two points from the match was not enough. The game saw Dennis Bouanga score for LAFC and Elías Montiel equalize for Pachuca, with both teams receiving a red card. Despite the shootout win, LAFC's coach Steve Cherundolo praised his team's performance, especially after playing with ten men for a significant portion of the match.</p>

          <p>A roundup of UK newspaper headlines highlights two major stories: President Trump's decision to deploy two nuclear submarines in response to Russian social media posts and a crisis in England's NHS. The Times and The Telegraph report on the unprecedented nature of the submarine deployment, a move that breaks with decades of protocol. Meanwhile, The Guardian focuses on a domestic issue, revealing that half of the six million people on NHS waiting lists have not yet had their first specialist contact. Other headlines include an interview with a Reform UK figure and the release of the man who attempted to kidnap Princess Anne in 1974.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a temporary restraining order that blocks federal immigration agents from conducting "roving patrols" and indiscriminate stops in Southern California. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision, which found that agents cannot use factors like race, language, or location alone as a basis for reasonable suspicion. The lawsuit was filed by civil rights groups on behalf of immigrants and U.S. citizens who were subjected to these stops. The court's opinion stated that the government failed to show it would be harmed by an injunction preventing unconstitutional actions, dealing a blow to the administration's aggressive deportation strategy.</p>

          <p>Amidst a scorching summer and widespread wildfires across Greece, Turkey, and the Balkans, travel experts are offering advice to concerned holidaymakers. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems it safe to travel to these destinations, the article outlines what tourists can do if their plans are disrupted. Standard travel insurance should cover cancellations or curtailments if official advice changes to "do not travel." However, if travelers choose not to go despite it being deemed safe, they are unlikely to be covered unless they purchased specific catastrophe coverage. The article advises communicating directly with airlines and hotels for potential solutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend on TikTok, known as "morning shed," features users removing elaborate nighttime skincare products like silicone masks and mouth tape. Capitalizing on this, Kim Kardashian's brand Skims has launched a "face shapewear" mask, which sold out rapidly but has also sparked controversy. Critics and medical professionals argue that such products fuel harmful beauty ideals and offer no lasting scientific benefits, potentially causing skin irritation. While some influencers praise the temporary "sculpted" look, others condemn the trend as dystopian, saying it preys on insecurities and reinforces the idea that even sleep must be optimized for aesthetic gain.</p>

          <p>In response to growing user fatigue with traditional online dating, various apps are introducing new features to reignite the search for love. Companies are experimenting with formats like group dates, invite-only platforms, and apps that minimize pre-date messaging to encourage in-person meetings more quickly. This shift comes as data shows a decline in usage for major apps like Tinder and Hinge, and as users express frustration with repetitive profiles and unhealthy behaviors like ghosting. This article explores a broader industry trend towards creating lower-pressure and more human-centric ways for people to connect with one another.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import rules for durians from Vietnam after detecting contaminants that pose a serious health risk to consumers. The new regulations require enhanced pre-export safety checks and "batch by batch" testing for the chemical alkaline yellow and the heavy metal cadmium. Any shipments that fail testing will be returned or destroyed, and the corresponding exporters will be suspended from the Chinese market. This move has already had a significant impact, with the value of fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China falling by approximately 45% year-on-year in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the recent trade deal negotiated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with the Trump administration is a "humiliation" for Europe. The authors contend that the agreement is economically damaging, one-sided, and undermines the EU's credibility by condoning U.S. coercion rather than resisting it. They criticize the deal for giving up too much, including a pledge of $600 billion in EU investment in the US, without securing key European interests. The authors call on EU governments and the European Parliament to reject the "unstable interim accord" and course-correct to salvage Europe's position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Miami jury has ordered Tesla to pay $243 million in damages after finding the company partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and severely injured her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' attorneys successfully argued that Tesla's Autopilot technology failed and that the company was negligent for not restricting its use to controlled-access highways. The court determined the system should have disengaged when the driver became distracted, which led to him running a stop sign and hitting the victims. Tesla plans to appeal the verdict, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible for the crash.</p>
