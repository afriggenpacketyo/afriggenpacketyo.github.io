          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the ARM Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The incident occurred as the ship was departing New York City as part of a good-will tour, commemorating the 200th anniversary of a key moment in Mexican history. The ship, carrying 277 people including 175 naval cadets, reportedly veered off course and struck the bridge, causing significant damage to its masts and rigging. Investigations are underway by the Mexican Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Transportation Safety Board to determine the cause, considering mechanical failure, tugboat involvement, or human error.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 17% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025, with funds allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply European automotive clients. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition in China, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year, driven by growing demand for electric vehicles in China. The company faces challenges including U.S.-China trade tensions and punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p>

          <p>Coral reefs in Hawaii are experiencing widespread bleaching due to rising ocean temperatures, threatening marine life and coastal protection. According to NOAA, 84% of coral reefs are under heat stress, causing algae to leave the corals, turning them white and skeletal. Marine scientist Greg Asner notes that the decline is rapid, with coral deaths occurring in weeks instead of years, with the situation being even worse in the Great Barrier Reef and the Galapagos Islands, and most severe in the Caribbean and Florida. Efforts are underway to educate tourists about reef-safe sunscreens and implement underwater nurseries, but controlling fossil fuels is crucial for long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. This occurred during an oversight visit by McIver and other Democratic lawmakers to inspect the facility, with the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, also present. At the same time, the DOJ dropped a misdemeanor trespass charge against Mayor Baraka, who was arrested during the same incident. McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and misrepresent her actions, while Republicans have seized on the episode to criticize Democrats' stance on immigration enforcement.

          <p>A bill advancing in the Texas Legislature seeks to ban minors from accessing popular social media platforms, aiming to combat the addictive nature and harmful effects of these sites. House Bill 186 would require parental consent for application downloads, place warning labels on social media, and restrict access for those under 18. While other states have age restriction laws, Texas's proposed limit would be the strictest in the nation. The bill has bipartisan support in the House, though the Senate may adjust the age restriction.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move is part of a broader stimulus package to bolster the economy amid ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. The rate cuts follow reductions in deposit rates by state-backed commercial lenders and come as trade-war fears have eased after negotiations with the U.S., leading some investment banks to raise their forecasts for China's economic growth this year. However, concerns remain about the housing slump and potential for renewed U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Latino Legislative Caucus in California has criticized Governor Gavin Newsom's proposed budget cuts to Medi-Cal, calling them a betrayal of the state's commitment to protecting vulnerable populations. The caucus opposes the plan to freeze enrollment and charge premiums for undocumented adult immigrants already enrolled in Medi-Cal. State Senator María Elena Durazo characterized the proposed $100 monthly premium as a form of redlining. The objections come as California faces a $12-billion budget shortfall, exacerbated by President Trump’s tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can end the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, allowing for potential deportations. This decision lifts a lower court's injunction that had blocked the administration's move. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The TPS program provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries facing wars or natural disasters. The Biden administration had previously extended the TPS designation for Venezuela, but the Trump administration vacated that extension, citing it as "contrary to the national interest."</p>

Trump appeared to conflate the Gleason score with the stage of Biden's cancer, also questioning why Biden's physical last year didn't include cognitive tests. He also insinuated that Biden officials had been effectively running the office by using the autopen to sign documents. Disclosures of medical information are up to the White House, and there is a long history of presidents concealing their medical issues.</p>

          <p>Federal transportation officials are investigating a crash involving a Mexican naval ship, the Cuauhtémoc, which struck the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. The ship reportedly accelerated suddenly in the wrong direction shortly after leaving a Manhattan pier, reaching a speed of six knots before colliding with the bridge. The National Transportation Safety Board is working with Mexican counterparts to access the ship, inspect the engine, and interview crew members. The investigation aims to determine the cause of the sudden acceleration, considering factors such as mechanical issues or human error. This article is from The New York Times.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, a measure designed to combat online sexual exploitation, including the creation and distribution of AI-generated fake images. The bill, supported by First Lady Melania Trump, makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent, requiring websites and social media companies to remove such material within 48 hours of a request. The act has received bipartisan support but also faces criticism from free speech advocates who argue it is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate content.</p>

          <p>A Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating has amplified concerns among fiscal conservatives regarding President Trump’s tax and spending cut package. The downgrade, attributed to congressional gridlock and the potential for increased federal deficits, has provided ammunition to Republicans demanding deeper cuts to federal programs. The Republican plan, as written, is projected to add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. However, the debt downgrade may not significantly alter the progress of the bill, as anti-deficit conservatives were already pushing for more substantial cuts.

          <p>James Comey has stated that an Instagram post of seashells arranged to read '8647' was innocent and unintentional, despite accusations from Trump allies that it was a call for violence against the president. Comey said he and his wife found the message on a beach walk and he was unaware of its potential interpretation until he heard of the accusations. The Secret Service investigated the post, which led Comey to voluntarily appear for an interview. He warned that the episode pointed to a worrying trend of power being used to target individuals.</p>

          <p>Thousands of chicks that were abandoned in a United States Postal Service truck in early May have overwhelmed a Delaware animal shelter. About 4,000 birds were found dead in the truck, and 10,000 others were stranded there for three days, according to state officials. The Freedom Ranger Hatchery, which raised and shipped the chicks, said it did not know why the shipment had never made it to its destinations. This article is from The New York Times.</p>
