          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass implemented a curfew for downtown Los Angeles due to ongoing anti-ICE protests, effective from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, covering a one-square-mile area. The curfew aims to prevent vandalism and looting, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and the homeless, according to police chief Jim McDonnell. Protests began after immigration raids in the Westlake District, downtown, and South LA, leading to nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses on Monday night. President Trump deployed National Guard troops and Marines to protect federal buildings, sparking a dispute with Governor Newsom, who deemed the action illegal and immoral.</p>

          <p>Following two days of talks in London, the U.S. and China reached an agreement on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus, according to representatives from both sides. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement aims to stabilize the relationship between the two countries after accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. The framework includes resolving Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports to the U.S. and a rollback of U.S. restrictions on advanced tech sales to China as Beijing approves rare earths exports. Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will seek President Trump's approval, while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao also participated in the discussions.

The ruling upholds a prior sentence that Kirchner was appealing, effectively blocking her planned return to politics. This decision marks a significant development in Argentina's political landscape, impacting Kirchner's future and the broader political dynamics of the country.

          <p>A UN panel has called on the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, asserting that the agreement fails to adequately guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius but allowed the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel argues that preventing the Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return to their ancestral lands. The panel suggests suspending the current deal and negotiating a new agreement that addresses the Chagossians' rights, as the current arrangement hinders their cultural rights.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that the tariffs imposed by President Trump can remain in effect until at least the end of July, granting the administration's request to pause a lower court ruling that blocked them. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled oral arguments for July 31, meaning the tariffs will stay in place unless further court action occurs. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously ruled that many of Trump's tariffs, including those on U.S. trading partners and tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China, are illegal.

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly frustrated with Meta's position in artificial intelligence and is investing $14 billion into Scale AI to recruit CEO Alexandr Wang to Meta. Wang will help lead a new AI research lab at Meta, joined by some of his colleagues, while Meta will take a 49% stake in Scale AI. Zuckerberg admires Wang's leadership and technical expertise, believing he can improve Meta's AI efforts following the lukewarm reception of its Llama AI models. This move reflects Meta's strategy to bring in prominent AI leaders from startups by taking large stakes rather than outright acquisitions.</p>

The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies, protecting play in schools, and opening school playgrounds to the community.
