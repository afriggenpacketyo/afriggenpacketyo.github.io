          <p>The NHS is launching a national investigation into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. Health Secretary Wes Streeting apologized to families who suffered avoidable harm, emphasizing the need to ensure no parent or baby is ever let down again. The inquiry will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. The investigation will consist of two parts: an urgent review of concerning units and a system-wide look at maternity and neonatal care to improve services across the NHS.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a significant increase in antiziganism cases in Germany, with 1,678 incidents recorded in 2024, up from 621 in 2022.

The report also criticizes the media for perpetuating clichés and false portrayals of these groups.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran is seeking support from Russia, but Moscow's response has been muted. While Iran has aided Russia in the Ukraine war with military drones, Russia may be limited in its ability to reciprocate due to its own needs and the desire to maintain ties with the U.S. Russia must balance its alliance with Iran against the risk of incurring sanctions from the U.S., especially with Donald Trump's administration potentially being more amenable to Russia. So far, Moscow has only called for peaceful negotiations between Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that could significantly impact global energy markets. Experts suggest that closing the strait, through which about 20% of the world's oil transits, would alienate Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. While the decision now rests with Iran's national security council, the potential closure has raised concerns about higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions, with the U.S. urging China to intervene. There are currently no indications of threats to commercial shipping passing the waterway, according to the Joint Maritime Information Center.</p>

The burial and associated objects are characteristic of the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which inhabited the Lima area between the 11th and 15th centuries.

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of students using AI to complete assignments in humanities courses, questioning the enforcement of institutional rules that students don't take seriously. The real value of a humanities education lies in the formation of human persons, cultivating virtues like honesty and practical wisdom, rather than merely producing literary interpretations or cultural criticisms. Generative AI threatens to short-circuit this process by removing cognitive friction, which is essential for developing reasoning skills and making wise choices. Instead of strictly banning AI, the author suggests allowing students to use it but requiring them to reflect on how it changes their thinking and learning process.</p>

While Iran has threatened to close the strait in the past, it has never followed through, but the current situation is seen as different.

Critics argue that this legislation undermines the right to seek asylum, as guaranteed by international and U.S. law, and prioritizes wealth over humanitarian concerns. The bill directs that a $20-million appropriation for U.S. Customs and Border Protection “shall only be used to conduct an examination of such unaccompanied alien child for gang-related tattoos and other gang-related markings.”</p>

          <p>DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng questioned entrepreneur Luo Yonghao about why someone known for eloquence would start a technology company. This exchange occurred just before DeepSeek's large language models gained global recognition for their high performance at a low cost. Luo Yonghao, formerly a charismatic English teacher, had launched ventures like Smartisan Technology, a smartphone brand that went bankrupt. Luo's story highlights the importance of leveraging one's strengths and adapting to challenges in the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Emerson Colindres, an Ohio high school graduate and soccer standout, has described his deportation experience to Honduras as "traumatizing," noting that he was handcuffed throughout the flight. Colindres, who had no criminal record, was detained during a routine appointment with ICE shortly after his graduation. He spent most of his time in detention confined to a cell for 22 hours a day, and observed that many others on his deportation flight also lacked criminal records. The deportation contradicts claims that the Trump administration's immigration crackdown primarily targets dangerous criminals.</p>

          <p>Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, overestimated his capabilities and underestimated Israel's resolve, leading to the October 7 massacre that has resulted in the dismantling of Hamas. Sinwar's miscalculation, fueled by conspiracism and supremacist Muslim Brotherhood theology, has also weakened Hezbollah and led to the neutralization of Iran's nuclear program. The author argues that Sinwar, like Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1967, fundamentally misunderstood his enemy, leading to disastrous consequences. The long-term outcome of the latest Middle East war remains uncertain, but the existential threat posed to Israel by the Iranian regime has been significantly reduced.</p>

          <p>A 2004 law has inadvertently led to a massive increase in the number of pancreases collected for research, due to a loophole in regulations for organ procurement organizations (OPOs). The law, intended to encourage islet cell transplantation research, allowed OPOs to count research pancreata toward their certification metrics. This has incentivized OPOs to collect thousands of pancreases for research, even if they are not ultimately used for islet cell transplants, in order to improve their grades. The Senate Finance Committee has investigated the issue, finding that many OPOs do not know where the pancreases ultimately end up, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the regulation.</p>

          <p>Okinawa pledged to preserve and pass on the lessons of history at a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki attended the ceremony, which comes amid rising global tensions and controversy over portrayals of civilian deaths at a local museum. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the reality of the battle and its lessons, while Ishiba pledged to reduce the burden of U.S. bases in Okinawa. The Battle of Okinawa claimed more than 200,000 military and civilian lives.</p>
