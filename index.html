        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has denied pressuring ABC to suspend "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," attributing the decision to network executives. The suspension followed Kimmel's comments linking the killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, which prompted FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to threaten ABC's broadcast license. The situation has sparked a widespread debate on free speech and cancel culture, with figures from across the political spectrum, including former President Obama and Senator Ted Cruz, criticizing the administration's actions as an overreach of governmental power.</p>

          <p>Singer and actress Selena Gomez has shared that she is now dealing with arthritis as a complication of her long-term battle with lupus, an autoimmune disease she was diagnosed with in 2015. Medical experts explain that arthritis is a common symptom for lupus patients, with up to 90% experiencing joint pain, which can be disabling if not properly treated. While lupus arthritis typically doesn't cause the permanent joint damage seen in rheumatoid arthritis, it significantly impacts quality of life, particularly for young women who are disproportionately affected by the disease.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a new $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications, a program heavily utilized by the technology and finance sectors to employ skilled foreign workers. The sudden move has caused significant disruption, prompting major companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and JPMorgan Chase to advise their visa-holding employees to remain in the U.S. and avoid international travel. This policy represents one of the administration's most significant actions to restrict legal immigration, aiming to discourage what it calls systemic abuses that undercut American wages.

          <p>A man suspected of fatally shooting a woman in Carlsbad and stealing her vehicle was killed in a gunfight with police outside an In-N-Out Burger in Laguna Hills. The confrontation occurred after a multi-agency police pursuit that ended when the suspect stopped the stolen SUV and began firing at officers. The incident began late Friday when police found a woman shot to death in an apartment complex parking lot. The ensuing chase and shootout caused panic among restaurant patrons, and the suspect was later pronounced dead at a hospital.</p>

          <p>At their party conference in Bournemouth, the UK's Liberal Democrats made a pronounced effort to reclaim patriotism, a theme often associated with right-wing nationalism. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a theatrical speech, draping himself in an England flag and urging members to wave the nation's flags with pride, arguing they belong to everyone, not just nationalists. This strategic shift aims to counter the influence of parties like Reform UK by positioning the Lib Dems as the true patriots who represent British values of tolerance and unity, in a departure from their traditionally more reserved stance on national symbols.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that public statements from officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for his execution, have prejudiced the case and violated his constitutional rights. The defense also criticized the highly publicized nature of his arrest, describing it as a spectacle that has tainted the legal proceedings. This motion follows a recent victory in state court where terrorism charges against Mangione were dismissed.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what was described as a "credible threat" on his life. The threat was reportedly made online before a performance in Ottawa, Canada, leading to the arrest of a 26-year-old man. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, shows scheduled for Boston, Massachusetts, and Mashantucket, Connecticut, were called off. Morrissey, the former frontman of The Smiths, is scheduled to continue his tour later in the week, with all tickets for the canceled shows being refunded.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Claim New AI System Can Detect Stealth Submarines with High Accuracy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from China claims the development of an advanced artificial intelligence system capable of detecting even the stealthiest submarines with 95% accuracy in simulations. The system reportedly integrates data from various sources like sonar and water temperature to create a real-time underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While the technology could potentially undermine existing naval strategies and the concept of nuclear deterrence, Western military experts remain cautious, noting the extreme complexity of the underwater environment and the ongoing arms race between detection and stealth technologies.</p>

          <p>West Ham head coach Graham Potter is facing significant pressure as the club considers potential replacements following a poor start to the Premier League season. A recent home defeat to Crystal Palace has intensified scrutiny on Potter's position, with sources indicating the club had already begun identifying alternatives. Among the names reportedly being considered are Nuno Espirito Santo, Gary O'Neil, and former manager Slaven Bilic for a potential short-term role. Potter has won only six of his 25 matches in charge, and the team has lost all three of its home league games this season.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., North Carolina resident John Saunby is constructing a new home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. Rather than letting the debris go to a landfill, Saunby found treasure in the rubble, using reclaimed porch posts, floorboards, and tree trunks to build his dream house in the Appalachian Mountains. The project represents a creative and resilient response to the destruction caused by the hurricane, which was the deadliest to hit the mainland U.S. since 2005. His partner, an Appalachian musician, provides inspiration as he works.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses have advanced to their seventh consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France.

The English team improved significantly in the second half, utilizing their powerful maul and strong bench to pull away and secure the win.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article critiques the new, thinner iPhone Air as a symbol of a broader, undesirable trend toward minimalism in technology, design, and art. The author argues that while technology once embraced bold, colorful aesthetics, it now favors a spartan and unobtrusive style that feels sterile and controlling. This "miserable minimalist era" is seen in everything from interior design to theater productions, creating a sense of emptiness. The sleek design of modern devices like the iPhone is presented as a deceptive facade of order, masking the chaotic information and reality they deliver.</p>

          <p>Critics are warning that the Trump administration is using the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a pretext to crack down on political dissent. Following the shooting, President Trump and his allies have escalated rhetoric against the "radical left," considering measures like designating some groups as domestic terrorists and revoking non-profits' tax-exempt status. Observers, including political scientists and Democratic lawmakers, argue this is a classic authoritarian tactic of exploiting a tragedy to justify suppressing opposition and eroding free speech. The actions are seen as part of a broader campaign of retribution.</p>
