          <p>NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Connor Zilisch sustained a broken collarbone after an unfortunate fall during his victory celebration at Watkins Glen. After winning the race, the 19-year-old was climbing onto his car's roof when he slipped and fell headfirst onto the ground. He was transported to a hospital but later confirmed he was recovering, with CT scans of his head coming back clear. The incident has forced him to withdraw from the subsequent Cup race, adding to a season already marked by a previous injury.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has overturned a Trump administration directive, effectively reinstating a ban on commercial fishing within the Pacific Remote Islands Heritage marine national monument. The ruling blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had permitted fishing in areas previously protected by the Obama administration. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups, represented by Earthjustice, successfully argued that the administration violated federal law by not allowing for public comment. This decision is celebrated as a major victory for protecting the monument's vulnerable ecosystems and rich cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A significant wildfire has broken out on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy, prompting the closure of all hiking trails in the popular national park. Firefighters, aided by Canadair planes and the army, are battling the blaze which has consumed over 1,200 acres of vegetation. While the smoke is visible from the historic Pompeii archaeological site, the ruins remain open to tourists. Authorities have launched an investigation into the fire's origin, which poses a threat to local agriculture and highlights Europe's increasing vulnerability to wildfires amid rising global temperatures.</p>

          <p>Talk show host Piers Morgan has clarified his previous comments calling Jake Paul's boxing career "staged bulls---t" after facing threats of legal action from Paul's team. Morgan stated on social media that he meant Paul's opponents were often past their prime, not that the fights were illegally predetermined. He deleted his original post and invited Paul onto his show for a discussion. Paul responded mockingly on social media, while his business partner emphasized that they will sue for defamation over any claims that the officially sanctioned fights are rigged.</p>

          <p>In a series of social media posts, President Trump has demanded the immediate removal of homeless individuals from Washington, D.C., stating they will be given places to stay "FAR from the Capital." Citing roadside encampments, he also reiterated threats to use federal power to address crime and potentially put the city under federal control. This follows a recent surge of federal law enforcement presence in the city, which Trump initiated after an alleged assault on a former government employee. The president's comments come despite local police data showing a significant drop in violent crime in the capital.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's revamped team, under new manager Arne Slot, displayed a mix of brilliance and defensive fragility in their 2-2 Community Shield draw against Crystal Palace, which they ultimately lost on penalties. Four new signings, including record acquisition Florian Wirtz, made their competitive debuts, contributing to both goals but also revealing defensive vulnerabilities. The team twice surrendered a lead, highlighting issues that were also present in pre-season friendlies. While Wirtz was a standout performer, the match underscored the need for defensive reinforcements and more time for the new squad to adapt.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte described the upcoming meeting between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a crucial test to determine if the Russian leader is serious about ending the war in Ukraine. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rutte stated that only Trump can make that assessment, while lauding the US president's strategy of applying pressure on Russia through sanctions and military support for Ukraine. Rutte assured that while the initial meeting is bilateral, Ukraine and European allies will need to be involved in any subsequent, substantive negotiations about territory or a final peace deal.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old tourist from New York, identified as Kevin Mares, was fatally shot in the La Perla neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares, who was visiting the island to attend a Bad Bunny concert, was an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire of an argument between several other people. The shooting took place at a local nightspot, and two other individuals were also injured. This incident marks another case of violence against tourists in the historically troubled but increasingly popular shantytown, which gained fame after being featured in the "Despacito" music video.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's remarkable 13% stock advance last week, its best in over five years, is being analyzed as a massive short squeeze that defied market trends. Many short-sellers had targeted Apple, betting on its decline due to a perceived lack of an AI strategy and potential negative impacts from antitrust rulings and tariffs. However, positive developments, including an endorsement from President Trump regarding its U.S. investment plans, caused the stock to rally sharply. This forced short-sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, further fueling the surge and masking negative performance in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Jerome Adams, who served as Surgeon General in the first Trump administration, sharply criticized HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for what he called a "failed" response to the deadly CDC shooting. Adams argued Kennedy's past anti-vaccine rhetoric fanned the flames of violence and his official response was tepid and late. He also condemned the administration's decision to halt $500 million in mRNA vaccine research, stating the technology was President Trump's greatest achievement and that cutting its funding will cost lives by stalling progress on treatments for cancer, HIV, and future pandemics.</p>

          <p>Heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding forced the cancellation of the final day of the Wisconsin State Fair and created hazardous conditions across the Milwaukee area. As much as 10 inches of rain fell in some parts, leading to widespread power outages, road closures, and numerous water rescues by the fire department. The severe weather, part of a larger system affecting several Midwest states, also prompted the cancellation of a major triathlon event. Authorities have urged residents to avoid driving or walking through dangerous standing water as more rain is forecasted.</p>

          <p>Conservative pundit Charlie Kirk has publicly voiced his opposition to reports that the Trump administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug. On social media, Kirk complained that "everything already smells like weed" and argued for making it harder, not easier, to use in public spaces to protect children. The potential policy shift would move marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug, easing some restrictions and opening doors for medical research. Social media users quickly pointed out Kirk's own 2018 post where he had stated people should not be imprisoned for marijuana-related offenses.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London supporting the recently banned group Palestine Action resulted in over 500 arrests, one of the largest single-day totals for the Metropolitan Police in a decade. The majority of arrests were for displaying placards in support of the group, which the UK government proscribed as a terrorist organization in July. Protesters gathered in Parliament Square and, at a coordinated time, revealed signs reading "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." The mass arrests highlight the tension surrounding the new law, which critics argue is overly broad and a threat to free expression.</p>
