          <p>BP shares saw a significant increase following reports indicating early-stage acquisition talks with Shell, according to sources familiar with the situation. While discussions are ongoing, the possibility of a definitive agreement remains uncertain. It is unlikely Shell would acquire the entirety of BP, with sources suggesting that various entities might purchase different segments of the British oil giant should a deal materialize. The current valuation of BP is approximately $85 billion. The potential acquisition reflects the ever-changing landscape of the energy sector.</p>

          <p>Amidst President Trump's unpredictable trade policies, global investors are exhibiting increasing apprehension towards the U.S. economy, leading them to explore opportunities in Europe, particularly in Germany. While the S&P 500 has fluctuated since Trump's inauguration, Germany's DAX index has steadily risen, appreciating over 15%. The IMF has cautioned about potential strains in the U.S. economy due to Trump's policies, citing concerns about escalating debt. As investors reassess Europe, even U.S. firms like Blackstone are planning substantial investments on the continent, spurred by infrastructure and defense investment packages in countries like Germany.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing internal dissent as he defends the government's welfare reform proposals, which have drawn opposition from over 120 Labour MPs. Despite the pushback, the government plans to proceed with a vote on the reforms, which aim to modify Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment eligibility. The Prime Minister insists that the Labour party remains united on the need to reform the welfare system, dismissing criticism as minor distractions. The Conservative leader has indicated potential support for the bill if it guarantees welfare budget reduction and increased employment without raising taxes.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary has sparked debate about the future direction of the Democratic Party. Mamdani, running on a socialist platform, secured a victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, highlighting a shift in voter preferences. This outcome mirrors national trends where Democrats are losing ground with their traditional working-class base while gaining support from college-educated voters. The rise of progressive figures like Mamdani signals a potential takeover of the Democratic Party by far-left ideologies, potentially alienating moderate voters.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, President Trump's nominee for CDC Director, faced scrutiny during her confirmation hearing regarding her views on vaccines, especially in light of HHS Secretary Robert F.

She distanced herself from Kennedy's views on autism, stating she has seen no causal link between vaccines and the disorder. Monarez also outlined her goals as CDC director, focusing on restoring public trust, modernizing public health infrastructure, and employing evidence-based decision-making.</p>

          <p>Shares of Flagstar bank experienced a decline following Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary due to his pro-rent freeze stance. Mamdani's campaign promise to freeze rent increases in stabilized units has raised concerns about the profitability of multi-family rental properties. Analysts estimate that a significant portion of Flagstar's multi-family loan portfolio is exposed to New York rent regulations, which could impact the bank's financial performance. While some analysts believe a short-term rent freeze would be manageable, a longer-term pause could lead to increased loan loss reserves for Flagstar (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt reaching alarming levels and interest rates hovering around 22%, it's crucial to explore strategies to eliminate interest charges. Options include transferring balances to 0% APR credit cards, which offer promotional periods of up to 21 months, or diligently paying the balance in full each month to avoid interest altogether. Enrolling in a credit card hardship program or requesting a temporary rate reduction may also provide relief for those struggling to make payments. By implementing these tactics and creating a realistic repayment plan, cardholders can regain control of their finances (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump is disputing a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment that suggests the recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites did not completely destroy those facilities. While Trump claims the Iranian nuclear program has been "obliterated," the intelligence report indicates the bombings may have only set it back by a few months. Trump acknowledged the report's existence but suggested its data was insufficient, claiming the damage was "very severe". The reporting casts doubt on claims from Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that the strikes had totally eliminated Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>President Trump is intensifying his pushback against a Pentagon intelligence report indicating limited damage to Iran's nuclear program following U.S. strikes. Trump asserted "total obliteration" of the program, contradicting the analysis suggesting the strikes only set it back by months. He also claimed that American pilots who carried out the strikes were being demeaned by news reports about the Pentagon's preliminary assessment. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed Trump's position, attributing the leak of the report to political motives.</p>
