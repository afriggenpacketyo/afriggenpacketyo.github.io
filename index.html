          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has raised its 2025 financial outlook after its second-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, driven by soaring sales of its popular diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. The company now projects annual sales between $60 billion and $62 billion, reflecting strong underlying business performance. However, the announcement was accompanied by disappointing trial results for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which caused the company's stock to fall in premarket trading. Despite this setback, CEO David Ricks expressed confidence in the company's future growth and robust product pipeline.</p>

          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, signaling progress in its turnaround efforts under new CEO Peter Stern. The connected fitness company's positive earnings were attributed to better-than-expected sales and significant cost-cutting measures. Despite this success, Peloton announced plans to lay off an additional 6% of its staff as part of a new restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses by another $100 million. The company is also shifting its retail strategy towards smaller "micro-stores" and expanding its presence in the secondary market for pre-owned equipment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee narrowly voted 5-4 to reduce its key interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4.25% to 4%. This decision reflects the central bank's ongoing challenge of balancing persistent inflation with a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The vote was highly divided, with some members initially favoring a hold or a larger cut before a majority consensus was reached. Governor Andrew Bailey emphasized a "gradual and careful" approach to further monetary easing, stressing that future decisions will depend on the continued easing of underlying inflationary pressures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fifteen years after its launch by Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett, the Giving Pledge has experienced a slowdown in new signatories. Initially, the initiative successfully enlisted 40 of America's wealthiest families to pledge at least half of their fortunes to charity. However, a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies notes that the percentage of U.S. billionaires who have signed on has declined from 14% in 2010 to 12% today. Experts suggest the rapid growth of wealth has made it difficult for billionaires to give away money fast enough, while others point to a generational shift toward different philanthropic models like impact investing.</p>

The order directs the Department of Labor to review guidance under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to facilitate this change. This move is considered a significant victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for greater access to the trillions of dollars held in American retirement accounts. The development has already prompted a rise in Bitcoin's value and private equity stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wide-ranging set of new U.S. tariffs has taken effect, impacting imports from more than 90 countries as part of President Donald Trump's strategy to reshape global trade and boost domestic manufacturing. The tariffs feature a patchwork of rates, with some of the highest levies targeting nations like Laos and Myanmar. Major economies such as the UK, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union have negotiated lower rates, while countries like Switzerland face steep duties after failing to secure a deal. The administration is also using tariffs for political goals, threatening India over its purchases of Russian oil and targeting foreign-made computer chips to encourage U.S. investment.

          <p>The Bank of England's recent decision to lower its interest rate to 4% will have varied effects on personal finances across the United Kingdom. Homeowners with variable-rate mortgages are expected to see an immediate reduction in their monthly payments, providing some financial relief. Conversely, savers will likely face lower returns, as average savings rates are projected to continue their downward trend. The central bank's primary goal with this rate cut is to stimulate spending and manage inflation, which currently stands at 3.6%, well above the 2% target, while also considering the performance of the UK jobs market.

          <p>A sweeping new domestic bill passed by Congress, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is raising alarms over its potential impact on children's health care. While the legislation is framed as a measure to reduce waste in Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office projects it will cut nearly $1 trillion in funding over the next decade, causing 11 million Americans to lose insurance. Experts warn this will disproportionately harm children, as nearly half of them are enrolled in Medicaid or the related CHIP program. The law's nationwide work requirement for adults and other financing changes are expected to destabilize pediatric care systems and expand care deserts.</p>

          <p>An analytical article argues that the famine in Gaza is a direct result of Israel's deliberate and sustained policy of blocking humanitarian aid, constituting the use of starvation as a weapon of war. Unlike famines caused by climate or market failures, the situation in Gaza is entirely human-made, as Israel has the capacity to allow sufficient aid at any time. The article highlights that this tactic is a form of collective punishment, which is illegal under international law, and has been documented since the war's outset. It contrasts the current situation with historical examples, noting the unique rigor and defiance of international humanitarian capacity in Israel's blockade.</p>

Economists estimate the tariffs' impact on India's GDP will be significant but not debilitating, especially as over 60% of its economy is driven by domestic consumption.

          <p>A long-form essay explores the cultural and political history of survivalism, a movement experiencing a modern boom among diverse groups from Silicon Valley billionaires to online doomers. The article traces the concept from its fictional origins to its embrace by far-right figures in the 1970s, who romanticized societal collapse. It contrasts the fictional trope of the resourceful hero, like Robinson Crusoe, with the political survivalist who actively desires the end of civilization. The piece examines how novels and films have both glorified and critiqued this mindset, from "Lord of the Flies" to "The Road," ultimately questioning the Hobbesian worldview that underpins most survivalist narratives.</p>

Recent actions, including scouting potential settlement locations and ministers calling for annexation, suggest the movement's blueprint is effectively becoming government policy, removing previous obstacles to its implementation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to fire Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, after the agency released a surprisingly weak jobs report, has sparked outrage and concern among economists. The July report not only showed modest job growth but also included major downward revisions for previous months, altering the narrative of a resilient economy. Trump called the data "a scam" and a politically motivated manipulation. Experts vehemently defend the BLS's integrity, warning that the move undermines the credibility of vital U.S. economic data, which businesses, the Federal Reserve, and global markets rely on for critical decision-making.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors and computer chips, a key component in nearly every modern industry. However, he stated that companies that are "building in the United States" or have made firm commitments to do so will be exempt from the levy. The move is a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure businesses to onshore their manufacturing operations. The announcement came as Trump praised Apple for committing an additional $100 billion in U.S. investment, and follows major investment pledges from top chipmakers like TSMC, Nvidia, and GlobalFoundries.

          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing calls to resign after a report alleged she increased the rent on a property she owns by £700 a month shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended. The tenants were reportedly given four months' notice that their lease would not be renewed, and the property was re-listed at the higher rate after it failed to sell. A spokesperson for Ali stated she complied with all legal requirements. However, critics, including the Conservative Party chairman and campaign group Generation Rent, have accused the minister of "staggering hypocrisy" for engaging in behavior she has publicly spoken out against.</p>

          <p>A new Taiwanese television series, "Zero Day Attack," which depicts a fictional Chinese invasion, has topped ratings and sparked intense debate on the self-governing island. The show reflects a growing trend in Taiwanese media to address the long-taboo subject of a potential conflict with Beijing, a shift inspired in part by the war in Ukraine. This cultural trend extends to board games and mobile games that simulate Chinese infiltration and military attacks, aiming to raise public awareness. While some praise these works for preparing the public, critics worry they promote anxiety and a "sense of national doom," highlighting the deep political divisions over cross-strait relations.</p>

          <p>A viral story claiming that Russian special forces captured three senior British military officers in a raid on a Ukrainian naval base has been thoroughly debunked as false. The narrative, which spread across Russian media and was amplified by former British politicians, used demonstrably AI-generated images and featured names of officers who do not exist in UK military records. Digital forensics experts identify the story as a typical Russian disinformation campaign, designed to create an echo chamber and project an image of military might to a domestic audience. The campaign targets disgruntled Western audiences while reinforcing the Kremlin's trope of "Anglo-Saxon puppeteers" directing the war.</p>

          <p>The prospective meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the first in over four years, is being analyzed as a high-stakes diplomatic event with uncertain outcomes. While it could signal a breakthrough in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine, it might also be a strategic move by the Kremlin to diffuse pressure and avert a sanctions deadline without offering substantive concessions. Russian state media has portrayed the development as a victory for Putin, suggesting he has successfully "bought time." The possibility of the summit itself remains conditional, with reports suggesting it hinges on Putin first meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a step he has long refused to take.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 years after D.C. police officer Denna Fredericka Campbell was killed, her then-live-in boyfriend has been arrested and charged with her murder. Amir Jalil Ali, 62, was charged this week in the 1995 fatal shooting, which he had originally blamed on a burglary. Charges were initially filed against him at the time but were mysteriously dropped. Investigators reopened the cold case, noting that Campbell had told colleagues she feared her boyfriend and planned to leave him, ominously stating, "If I don't show up for work Saturday, you'll know he killed me." DNA evidence from the scene also implicated Ali in an altercation with Campbell before her death.</p>

The mission was carried out in complete winter darkness and sub-zero temperatures, requiring the crew to use night vision goggles to land a C-130J Hercules aircraft on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials, who requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources at the base, praised the mission as "nothing short of heroic."

The move has generated alarm, with hostage families urging the government to prioritize a deal to end the war and free the remaining captives.

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new domestic legislation that caps federal student loans is being criticized by medical professionals as a significant barrier for aspiring doctors. The law limits lifetime borrowing for professional programs like medical school to $200,000, while the average cost of a medical degree already exceeds that amount. The American Medical Association warns this will disproportionately affect students from underserved communities and could worsen a projected shortage of up to 86,000 physicians by 2036. Experts predict the new limits will force more students to seek out private loans, which often have stricter eligibility requirements and fewer protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that a deficiency of the metal lithium in the brain could be a key contributing factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The research found that lithium occurs naturally in the brain and is essential for maintaining nerve function, with its loss being one of the earliest changes leading to the disease. Scientists also showed that a new compound, lithium orotate, could restore memory in mice by avoiding capture by the amyloid plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's. The findings could offer new strategies for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the condition.</p>
