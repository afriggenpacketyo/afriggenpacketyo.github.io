          <p>A gunman killed at least one person and injured nine others after driving his vehicle into a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan. The 40-year-old suspect used an assault rifle on the congregation before deliberately setting a fire that caused significant damage to the building. Responding officers engaged the suspect in a gunfight, resulting in his death. The FBI is leading the investigation into the attack, which President Trump described as a potential targeted attack on Christians.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has suspended his campaign for re-election, citing fundraising difficulties and persistent media speculation about his political future. His decision alters the dynamics of the mayoral race, potentially strengthening former Governor Andrew Cuomo's independent bid against Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani. Adams' withdrawal follows a period of low polling numbers and a federal corruption indictment that was later dropped, marking him as the city's first one-term mayor since David Dinkins.</p>

Vice President JD Vance confirmed that President Trump will make the final decision after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made the appeal during the UN General Assembly.

          <p>At the Labour party conference, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has publicly criticized Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, urging for an open debate on how to effectively challenge the rising Reform UK party. Burnham warned against underestimating the "peril" Labour faces, pointing to the party's trailing position in opinion polls and a perceived "climate of fear" stifling internal dissent. His comments highlight growing tensions within the party as it struggles to define its strategy against its populist rival ahead of upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker manage the fallout from a major cyberattack. The attack has forced a production shutdown for nearly a month, severely impacting the company and its extensive supply chain. The financial support is intended to protect thousands of jobs, though a local MP warned that further government intervention might be necessary to stabilize the automotive sector.

          <p>In a public referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland, voted decisively to impose significant restrictions on the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. The new measure, supported by over 61% of voters, will completely ban gas-powered devices. The use of electric models will be limited to a three-month period from October to December, with exceptions requiring special permission, reflecting a growing public desire for improved urban environmental quality.</p>

This potential ad hoc expansion of tariffs threatens to escalate trade tensions and harm a sector already struggling with existing duties and global overcapacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A political rally in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu turned tragic after a crowd crush killed at least 40 people, including nine children and 17 women. The event, held for actor-turned-politician Vijay, drew a crowd more than double the size for which permission was granted. The sudden surge forced Vijay to halt his speech and led to the deadly stampede. Authorities have filed a case against senior members of Vijay's TVK party and have launched an inquiry into the incident.</p>
