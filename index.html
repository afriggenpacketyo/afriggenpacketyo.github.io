          <p>Japan and Vietnam have agreed to establish a vice-ministerial-level foreign affairs and defense dialogue, aiming to bolster defense equipment and technology collaboration in response to China's growing military presence. The two nations will hold their first "two-plus-two" security dialogue in Japan this year, strengthening their strategic communication. Japan is also considering adding Vietnam to its Official Security Assistance program, which supports developing countries in enhancing their defense capabilities. This move underscores Japan's increasing security cooperation with ASEAN states amid China's intensified activities in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested three men on suspicion of murder following a home-invasion robbery in Woodland Hills that resulted in the death of 47-year-old Aleksandre Modebadze. Officers responded to an emergency call and found Modebadze with a head injury; he was later pronounced dead at the scene. Homicide detectives determined that the suspects entered Modebadze's home, assaulted him, held him captive, and stole his property. The suspects, Paata Kochyashvili, Zaza Otarashvili, and Besiki Khutsishvili, are being held on $2 million bail each.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tariffs, intended to protect the U.S. auto industry, risk isolating it from global innovation and competition. The tariffs, coupled with domestic policies, could hinder the industry's ability to compete in the rapidly evolving landscape of electrification, digitization, and automation. China's significant advancements in next-generation vehicle production, supported by state subsidies, pose a threat to the U.S. auto industry's supply chains and industrial capabilities. The piece draws a parallel to the 1980s when temporary import limits on Japanese vehicles allowed American automakers to catch up and innovate.</p>

          <p>The Philippines has refuted claims by Chinese state media that Beijing has taken control of a disputed reef, Sandy Cay, in the South China Sea, calling the report "irresponsible." The National Security Council spokesman Jonathan Malaya stated that there is no truth to the claim by the China Coast Guard. The Philippines and China have been engaged in ongoing confrontations over the South China Sea, with Beijing claiming nearly all of it despite an international ruling against its claim.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pakistan's closure of its airspace to Indian airlines has forced carriers to reroute flights, particularly those connecting India to Europe, North America, and the Middle East. This detour results in longer and more costly flights, potentially requiring refueling stops or leading to route cancellations. While some airlines have temporarily suspended certain routes, experts suggest that passengers may not see significant fare increases due to the closure. The airspace closure follows heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after a deadly attack in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>

          <p>Populist politics often promise voters a simpler life, but in practice, they tend to create more hassle and chaos.

The Trump administration's attempts to micromanage institutions and impose ideological conformity could lead to an increasingly bureaucratic and interventionist state.

Savory pouches contain less than 5% of the daily iron requirement for infants, while some fruit pouches have lost virtually all vitamin C during manufacturing.

Trump's influence dominated the campaign, with the election viewed as a referendum on how Canada should approach the US president.
