        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while major technology stocks, including the Magnificent 7, saw a decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September, which would lower borrowing costs and potentially boost companies that are more sensitive to economic cycles. Despite the recent gains, small-cap stocks have underperformed larger tech companies significantly since late 2022, but the prospect of monetary easing is now shifting investor focus.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of containers in July, a surge directly attributed to shippers front-loading cargo to get ahead of tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. The port handled over one million twenty-foot equivalent units, the highest in its 117-year history, reflecting a rush to import Chinese goods before increased tariffs took effect. However, industry experts note that this has created an unusual, front-loaded peak season, and they anticipate a subsequent slowdown in shipping volumes, which could negatively impact trucking and rail companies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article supports President Trump's decision to use federal resources to address the high crime rate in Washington, D.C., framing it as a common-sense move to restore public safety. The author criticizes Democrats for allegedly downplaying the severity of the crime problem and argues that ensuring safety is a fundamental government responsibility, drawing parallels to Rudy Giuliani's successful efforts in New York City. The piece suggests that by tackling issues like juvenile crime and cashless bail, the initiative could set a positive national trend for urban safety.</p>

Leaders like Germany's Friedrich Merz and Poland's Donald Tusk emphasized that Ukraine must be at the table for any follow-up meetings and that pressure on Russia must increase if no concessions are made.</p>

          <p>A recently passed federal budget bill has significantly increased the flexibility of 529 college savings plans, making them more powerful tools for funding education and career development. Originally designed for higher education, these tax-advantaged accounts can now be used for a broader range of expenses, including vocational programs, required continuing education courses, and costs related to professional licensing exams. This expansion, along with a provision allowing unused funds to be rolled into an IRA, aims to alleviate parents' concerns that the saved money might go unused. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California officials are warning that a Trump administration proposal to bar undocumented immigrants from federally funded programs would have devastating consequences for vulnerable populations. In court filings opposing the new rules, they argue the ban would harm not only immigrants but also U.S. citizens, including the children of immigrants and homeless individuals lacking documentation, by cutting off access to essential services. Officials fear a "chilling effect" where families would avoid seeking necessary support, placing severe strain on the state's public health and social safety nets.</p>

This discovery challenges the historical understanding of literacy and record-keeping within the vast Inca Empire, which relied entirely on this system instead of a written script.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the Zelle payment network, alleging it enabled widespread fraud. The lawsuit claims that EWS designed Zelle without critical safety features, leading to scammers stealing over $1 billion from users between 2017 and 2023. James' office is seeking restitution for victims and a court order to compel Zelle to implement stronger anti-fraud measures, arguing the company knew for years that its platform was a hub for fraudulent activity but failed to act.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast appearance, NBA Hall of Famer Shaquille O’Neal spoke candidly about his past use of painkillers during his 19-year career and his ongoing health concerns. O'Neal admitted to taking more than the prescribed dose of opioids to manage injuries and consistently using anti-inflammatory drugs, which he believes has led to "limited kidney stuff." He recounted being told by a doctor that he was addicted and expressed regret, noting that while the pills masked the pain, they created long-term health issues that he must now carefully manage.</p>

While the terms were not disclosed, the team was recently valued at $3.65 billion. Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman and chairman of Dundon Capital Partners, is also the majority owner of major pickleball associations. The sale, which is subject to NBA approval, would transfer ownership from Jody Allen, who has managed the team since her brother's death in 2018.</p>

The Premier League had previously considered a "39th game" concept over a decade ago but shelved it after backlash from fans.

The BBC stated that while the segment's theme was appropriate, some of the language used went too far, and it temporarily removed the episode to edit the remarks.

This rate has nearly doubled since 2019 and comes as the Trump administration resumes collection activities after a nearly five-year pause. Experts suggest the debt often comes from borrowing for their children's education. While the government has currently paused garnishing Social Security benefits for defaulted loans, it can still garnish wages, creating significant financial risk for older borrowers.</p>

          <p>A new federal policy, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is set to provide significant tax relief to retirees in Ohio by exempting Social Security income from federal taxes for most seniors. The law introduces a new deduction that is expected to benefit approximately 2.1 million of the state's 2.2 million seniors. The policy primarily helps middle-income retirees, as it phases out for high-earners and offers no additional savings for those who already owe no federal income tax. This senior deduction is temporary and set to expire after the 2028 tax year.</p>
