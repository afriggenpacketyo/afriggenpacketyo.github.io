            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that he believes the House has the necessary votes to pass the Trump-backed budget resolution, enabling progress on President Trump's agenda. This announcement follows earlier setbacks in securing support for the budget blueprint. The House is expected to vote on the budget resolution, which is a critical step for advancing the President's legislative priorities, during the morning session. Securing the budget is essential for Trump to enact his planned economic reforms and initiatives.</p>

            <p>The consumer price inflation rate eased to 2.4% in March, which is lower than anticipated, while core inflation reached a four-year low. This development occurred as President Trump prepared to implement tariffs against U.S. trading partners. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% in March, resulting in a 12-month inflation rate of 2.4%, down from 2.8% in February. The drop in energy prices contributed to the tame inflation, but food prices increased, with egg prices showing a significant rise.</p>

            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that the company's third-party sellers will likely pass on the increased costs resulting from President Trump's tariffs to consumers. In response to the tariffs, Amazon has made strategic forward inventory buys and is renegotiating purchase order terms to mitigate price increases on its platform. Some vendors have experienced order cancellations for products sourced from China following the tariff announcement. While there is some evidence of consumers stocking up in anticipation of price hikes, the extent of this behavior is still uncertain.</p>

            <p>Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national, was released by Russia in a prisoner swap facilitated by the intelligence agencies of both countries, as confirmed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The swap took place in Abu Dhabi, with CIA Director John Ratcliffe playing a key role in the negotiations. In exchange, the U.S. freed Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national who was arrested in Cyprus on allegations of exporting sensitive microelectronics. Karelina had been sentenced to 12 years for treason after donating to a Ukrainian humanitarian group; her release signals ongoing, albeit complex, diplomatic channels between the U.S. and Russia.</p>

            <p>Several Chinese semiconductor companies have stated that they anticipate minimal impact from increased import tariffs, largely due to existing U.S. sanctions. Cambricon Technologies, an AI processor developer, reported that overseas revenue constitutes less than 1% of its total revenue, and it already faces restrictions from being on the U.S. Entity List. Similarly, chip designer Loongson Technology emphasized its commitment to independent research and development and noted zero revenue from the U.S. These companies suggest that previous sanctions have already mitigated potential effects from the new tariffs.</p>

            <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.4% in March, indicating progress in the Federal Reserve's effort to lower inflation to 2%. Lower fuel prices partially contributed to the easing of inflation, but experts note that recent tariffs orchestrated by President Trump could potentially increase inflation later in the year. While the data is backward-looking, it does not yet reflect the full impact of these trade policy changes. Experts anticipate the Federal Reserve will likely remain cautious at its next meeting due to ongoing inflationary risks and potential economic slowdowns.</p>

            <p>China has raised tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 84% in response to President Trump's 104% tariff on Chinese goods, escalating the trade war between the two nations. The increased tariffs will significantly raise the cost for Chinese companies to import U.S.-made products, potentially cutting off U.S. producers from a key trade market. President Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs for most countries but increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. China's top imports from the U.S. include oilseeds, grains, and oil and gas.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's tariffs have caused confusion among consumers, businesses, and investors. While President Trump paused tariffs for most nations, he increased import duties on Chinese goods to 125%, escalating the trade conflict. Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, typically passed on to consumers through higher prices, impacting everyday items like groceries and housewares. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and even a recession, as they raise prices and reduce consumer spending. The long-term goal of the tariffs is to encourage domestic manufacturing and negotiate more favorable trade deals.</p>

His advice comes as markets experience volatility due to President Trump's tariff policies, with the S&P 500 briefly flirting with bear territory. Munger emphasized that large swings in stock prices are a normal part of investing and encouraged investors to follow Warren Buffett's maxim of being fearful when others are greedy and vice versa.

Population shifts and the potential for further gerrymandering further complicate the path to victory.
