          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures predicted to reach 34Â°C (93Â°F) in central and eastern England, potentially marking one of the hottest June days on record. An amber heat-health alert is active in five regions, signaling likely impacts on health services and travel, with a "severe" risk of wildfires reported in London. The UK Health Security Agency has warned of an expected increase in deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations, and advises the public to stay out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun debating a major legislative package backed by President Trump, facing significant internal Republican opposition. Senator Thom Tillis vocally condemned the bill, arguing it breaks promises regarding Medicaid funding, a sentiment that led him to announce his retirement. Meanwhile, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the national debt and potentially cause nearly 12 million people to lose health insurance. Despite the controversy and a tight timeline, the procedural vote to begin debate narrowly passed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes caused "severe damage" to Iran's nuclear facilities but did not completely destroy them. He cautioned that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to restart its program if it chooses. Grossi's assessment contrasts with more forceful claims from the Trump administration that the program was "obliterated." He emphasized the critical need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites to verify the status of nuclear materials and centrifuges.</p>

          <p>The UK's official Covid-19 inquiry is now examining the pandemic's devastating impact on the social care sector, a phase long-awaited by bereaved families. The inquiry will investigate key decisions, such as the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus and contributing to nearly 46,000 resident deaths. It will also scrutinize the use of "do not resuscitate" orders and restrictive visiting policies. Care home managers and families are seeking accountability, particularly regarding the government's claim of having thrown a "protective ring" around care homes.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has voiced concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to the demanding schedule. He stated he is trying not to think about the potential for player exhaustion to avoid anxiety. Guardiola acknowledged similar past arguments made by former Liverpool manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp about player welfare but noted that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by governing bodies like FIFA. City is set to play Al-Hilal in the tournament, which adds to an already congested fixture list for top clubs.</p>

The crackdown occurs amid increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, which human rights groups warn is fostering a hostile environment and leading to increased discrimination and violence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is pledging increased action to combat a significant rise in attacks on religious facilities, which have surged nearly 100% between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon described the attacks as a form of terrorism intended to make people feel unsafe. The department highlighted recent convictions, including a 25-year prison sentence for a man who targeted a Virginia church, as evidence of its commitment to prosecuting these hate crimes. The trend is partly attributed to rising white nationalism and the targeting of minority or LGBTQ-welcoming congregations.</p>

          <p>A four-alarm vegetation fire, named the Mandalay fire, has burned more than 80 acres in Riverside, California, leading to mandatory evacuation orders for residents in the affected area. The fire produced heavy smoke, prompting numerous 911 calls, and multiple fire agencies, including Cal Fire, have joined the effort to contain it. While officials reported that the fire's forward progress had slowed by Sunday evening, the situation remained active. An evacuation center has been established at a local senior center to assist displaced residents as firefighting operations continue.</p>

The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center cared for the cub for nearly five months, focusing on medical treatment while carefully preserving its wild instincts. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released in a remote part of the Santa Ana Mountains. The center is currently caring for two other orphaned cubs with the same goal of returning them to their natural habitat.</p>

Enthusiasts use trail cameras and forensic-style methods to search for evidence of the creature's survival in the wild. Simultaneously, a high-profile de-extinction project, backed by $15 million in funding, is underway at the University of Melbourne. Scientists there aim to edit the DNA of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, to effectively bring the predator back into existence, though some experts remain skeptical about the project's feasibility.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) needs reform, as its current structure can cause savers to lose money.

Multiple whistleblowers have claimed that pressure to speed up production led to compromised safety standards, including the use of substandard parts, allegations Boeing has denied.

          <p>BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff is reportedly entering the transfer portal in anticipation of a seven-game suspension for an honor code violation. The suspension stems from a sexual assault allegation made against him in a lawsuit, which he denies. However, in his legal response, Retzlaff acknowledged having consensual sex with his accuser, an act that violates the strict honor code of the university, which is run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Retzlaff, who has one year of eligibility remaining, does not face criminal charges related to the allegation.</p>

          <p>UK punk duo Bob Vylan has drawn widespread condemnation after leading chants of "death, death to the IDF" during their Glastonbury Festival performance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled the comments "appalling hate speech," and festival organizers said they were "appalled" and that the statements "very much crossed a line." The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and will not make the performance available on its iPlayer service. The incident has sparked criticism from government ministers and antisemitism campaign groups, with police set to review the footage.</p>
