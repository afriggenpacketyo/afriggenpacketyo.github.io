          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to over seven years in federal prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, marking the maximum sentence he faced. Santos expressed remorse for betraying his supporters and undermining faith in institutions, but prosecutors argued he showed a lack of contrition and blamed the Justice Department. The judge acknowledged Santos's talent but emphasized the consequences of his lies, ordering him to pay nearly $600,000 in restitution and forfeiture. His former campaign treasurer is also awaiting sentencing. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty in federal court to charges related to the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was fatally shot in Manhattan.
