          <p>Two Delta Connection planes operated by Endeavor Air were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred when one plane, taxiing to its gate, struck another that was holding its position as instructed. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury, but there was no significant impact on airport operations, and all passengers were safely deplaned. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the circumstances surrounding the collision.</p>

          <p>President Trump has framed the current government shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to reduce the size and scope of federal agencies he considers political liabilities. He plans to meet with OMB Director Russell Vought, a key figure in Project 2025, to identify agencies for potential cuts, which could be either temporary or permanent. This approach signals an intent to use the funding impasse to enact long-term policy changes and reduce Democratic priorities, a departure from typical shutdown dynamics.</p>

          <p>Justin Halstenberg, a 35-year-old man from Norco, has been sentenced to 16 years to life in prison for starting the Line and Bacon fires in San Bernardino County. The Line Fire ultimately burned 44,000 acres, injured six firefighters, and destroyed or damaged seven structures. Investigators successfully identified Halstenberg's vehicle near the fire's origin point using an automatic license-plate reader, leading to his arrest. The district attorney praised the conviction, stating it ensures a serial arsonist will no longer threaten the community.</p>

          <p>Todd Arrington, the director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, has resigned from his position following a disagreement with the Trump administration. The dispute reportedly arose from Arrington's resistance to a request to remove an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to be presented as a gift to King Charles III. Arrington argued that the artifact was the property of the American people and should not be given away. Ultimately, a replica was sourced from West Point, but the conflict appears to have led to his departure.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester, England, has left two people dead and four others seriously injured. The incident occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, when a suspect drove a car into a group of worshippers and then began a stabbing attack. Police responded quickly, shooting and killing the suspect, who was wearing what appeared to be an explosive vest. Two other individuals have since been arrested in connection with the attack, which has been widely condemned by UK leaders.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is projected to cost the economy approximately $7 billion for each week it continues, potentially reducing GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points. According to an analysis by EY-Parthenon, this cost stems from reduced federal employee pay, delayed government procurement, and a subsequent decline in overall economic demand. While some of this economic activity may be recovered once the government reopens, past shutdowns have resulted in permanent losses. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the 34-day shutdown in 2018-2019 cost the economy about $11 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

The author asserts that the most credible explanation is that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan simply ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. The piece details how Earhart's public image was carefully crafted and how, after her death, her story was exploited for profit and propaganda, leading to persistent but unfounded theories of espionage and capture.

          <p>The failure of Congress to pass a funding deal has resulted in a government shutdown, forcing active-duty military service members to continue performing their duties without pay until a resolution is reached. While a 2019 law guarantees back pay for all government employees after a shutdown ends, military pay is not guaranteed to be on time unless specific legislation is passed. A bill to ensure timely military pay did not pass before the shutdown began. The Defense Department has outlined its priority missions and estimates about 406,000 of its civilian employees will also be required to work without pay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar gained ground against major currencies like the euro and yen, rebounding after several days of losses. The market remains uncertain due to the U.S. government shutdown, which has created a data vacuum by delaying the release of key economic reports, including the monthly jobs figures. While weak private payroll data initially pushed the dollar down on expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the currency recovered as traders grapple with the lack of reliable government data and focus on political headline risk from Washington.

          <p>Israeli forces have intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying humanitarian aid and activists, including Greta Thunberg, in international waters off the coast of Gaza. Israel stated the vessels were approaching a "lawful naval blockade" in an active combat zone, while the flotilla organizers called the interception illegal. The detained individuals are being transferred to an Israeli port for deportation. The incident has drawn international criticism, with several countries and human rights organizations condemning Israel's actions and calling for an end to the blockade on Gaza.</p>

          <p>German Unity Day, celebrated annually on October 3, commemorates the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9, the day the Berlin Wall fell, to avoid coinciding with the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms known as "Reichspogromnacht." The article explains that following World War II, Germany was divided for over four decades, with the peaceful revolution of 1989 paving the way for reunification. While a national holiday, celebrations are typically subdued, and polls suggest many Germans feel the country has not yet fully overcome its historical division.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump Jr. has rejected criticism that his crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, presents a conflict of interest with his father's administration. Speaking at a conference in Singapore, he called the concerns "complete nonsense," stating that his father would not be monitoring blockchain ledgers to grant political favors to investors. The company, which launched a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, has drawn scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers due to its public connections to the Trump family. Trump Jr. emphasized that the firm is a business venture and "100% not a political organization."</p>

He cited stablecoins as an early example of this trend and believes that crypto technology and traditional finance will fully merge.

          <p>Following her death at age 91, this article reflects on primatologist Jane Goodall's legacy, focusing not just on her groundbreaking chimpanzee research but also on her profound commitment to animal rights. Goodall used her scientific stature to advocate for veganism and vocally oppose the practices of factory farming and invasive animal experimentation, which she called a "living hell." This stance often placed her at odds with the scientific mainstream, yet she remained a powerful voice for treating animals as beings with interiority and moral worth. Her work challenged conventional boundaries.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year, though production saw a slight decline. The delivery numbers narrowly beat analyst expectations. The quarter was marked by a sales slowdown in Europe, which was partially offset by a rush of U.S. buyers seeking to take advantage of a federal EV tax credit before it expired. The majority of vehicles produced and delivered were the popular Model 3 and Model Y. Tesla will provide a more detailed financial update to investors later in the month.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has furloughed approximately 750,000 federal employees, while hundreds of thousands more in essential roles are required to continue working without receiving their paychecks. Employees deemed "excepted," such as air traffic controllers and border patrol agents, must report for duty, while "non-excepted" staff are placed on unpaid leave. Although federal law guarantees back pay once funding is restored, the immediate financial strain on workers is significant.

          <p>This article suggests that the immediate scrutiny of a mass shooter's political beliefs, whether Democrat or Republican, often misses the more complex drivers of their violence. Research indicates that many recent attackers are more influenced by a nihilistic online culture and the actions of previous shooters than by traditional partisan politics. This digital radicalization creates a "compilation of ideological influences" that doesn't fit a simple left-right binary. Experts argue that focusing on these online spaces and the fixation on violence itself is more crucial to understanding and preventing future tragedies.</p>

Instead of conceding production capacity, Taiwan is seeking cooperation on supply chains and preferential tariff treatment.
