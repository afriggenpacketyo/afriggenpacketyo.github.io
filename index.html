          <p>An outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease Chikungunya in a southern Chinese city has prompted local authorities to initiate widespread sanitation and clean-up efforts. The outbreak, which originated from an imported case, has resulted in over 1,100 confirmed cases in one district, though most patients are reported to have only mild symptoms. The response involves community-wide measures aimed at controlling the mosquito population to prevent further spread of the virus across multiple city districts.</p>

Organizers have planned a four-day festival with live music and family activities, aiming to create a vibrant atmosphere in what they call a "party city." However, the major tourist event faces a potential challenge from a Met Office weather warning for heavy rain, which could impact the planned festivities and public attendance over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Texas has enacted a new law, the Life of the Mother Act, to provide clarity for doctors regarding the state's emergency medical exception for its abortion ban. The legislation specifies that a patient's death does not need to be imminent to qualify and confirms that the burden of proof rests on the state in cases of alleged violations. While supporters see it as a positive step, some reproductive rights advocates and medical groups argue it doesn't go far enough, as it fails to add exceptions for sexual assault, incest, or fatal fetal anomalies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is requiring states to submit personal data, including Social Security numbers, for millions of SNAP recipients by July 30, citing executive orders aimed at combating fraud and verifying immigration status. This unprecedented data collection has triggered a federal lawsuit from recipients and privacy advocates, who argue the plan violates federal privacy laws and could be used for purposes beyond its stated intent, such as immigration enforcement. Several Democratic senators have also condemned the policy, warning it turns a food assistance program into a mass surveillance tool.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest a series of self-reflection questions to help individuals make more intentional and mindful purchasing decisions, especially when finances are tight. Rather than simply avoiding all non-essential buys, consumers are encouraged to consider their emotional state, budget limitations, and underlying motivations before spending. By assessing whether a purchase is driven by emotional needs, a desire to impress others, or a lack of research, people can curb impulsive habits and develop healthier financial discipline.</p>

          <p>China's top market regulator, the SAMR, has summoned major e-commerce companies including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com to address an intense price war in the delivery sector. The meeting was aimed at regulating promotional behaviors and fostering a healthier, more sustainable market ecosystem for all stakeholders, from consumers to delivery riders. The regulator emphasized that these platforms must adhere to competition and e-commerce laws and take on their corporate responsibilities to ensure fair market practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe demographic decline, as its birth rate has fallen for 16 consecutive years to a record low of 1.18 babies per woman. This crisis is acutely felt in small towns like Fregona, which has lost a fifth of its population in a decade and now risks its primary school closing due to a lack of children. Despite government incentives, many Italians cite the high cost of living and lack of affordable childcare as major barriers to starting families, forcing some companies to create their own solutions.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers Pitcher Tyler Glasnow Shows Promising Signs in Return from Injury</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers being shut out by the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his return from the injured list. The right-hander pitched six innings, allowing only one run and demonstrating increased fastball velocity, a positive sign for the team's long-term pitching stability. Glasnow attributed his success to a simplified, more athletic mindset on the mound, focusing on competing rather than overthinking his mechanics, which the team hopes will lead to more dependable starts.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House select committee on China, focusing on countering Beijing's economic coercion. Morrison's testimony is significant given that during his term, Australia faced Chinese tariffs on key commodities after calling for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. The hearing, which will also feature former U.S. ambassador Rahm Emanuel, comes as Morrison's successor, Anthony Albanese, concludes a visit to China aimed at warming diplomatic and trade relations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the US dollar. The legislation, which passed with bipartisan support, requires stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets and is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, potentially paving the way for wider adoption. Proponents believe this will reinforce the dollar's global status, while critics raise concerns about insufficient anti-money laundering protections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy, while effective against primary tumors, can inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. This research helps explain why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis despite successful initial treatment. The team also identified drugs that could inhibit this process in mice, and a clinical trial based on these findings is now underway for breast cancer patients, offering a potential strategy to improve treatment outcomes.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, its owner Rupert Murdoch, and its parent companies over a report about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The lawsuit centers on an article detailing a sexually suggestive letter Trump allegedly sent to Epstein for his 50th birthday, which Trump vehemently denies writing. The legal action comes as the Department of Justice moves to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Epstein case, following an order from the president.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the elimination of its primary scientific research division, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a broader agency reorganization. The move is expected to impact hundreds of scientists and researchers and is projected to save nearly $750 million. This decision follows a significant reduction in the EPA's overall workforce and has drawn criticism from former officials who warn that dismantling the respected research body could endanger public health and weaken environmental oversight.</p>
