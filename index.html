          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the hit TV series M*A*S*H, has passed away at the age of 87 in her New York home, with her representative stating that she likely died of natural causes. Swit's portrayal of the tough yet vulnerable Army nurse earned her two Emmy Awards and four Golden Globe nominations during the show's 11-season run. She also worked to develop the character beyond the "Hot Lips" stereotype, aiming for a more realistic and intelligent depiction, according to an interview with Suzy Kalter. Beyond M*A*S*H, Swit had a prolific career in theater, film, and television, while also being an artist and animal rights activist.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he is doubling tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, celebrating an agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. Trump claimed China violated its trade agreement with the U.S., while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said talks between the world's two largest economies stalled. This announcement follows a recent ruling where two federal courts challenged Trump's power to unilaterally impose levies, though the tariffs remain in place pending appeal. Meanwhile, Elon Musk is stepping down from his role as a "special government employee" but will continue as an unofficial adviser to Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities are expressing their disappointment over the sport's lack of knighthood or damehood recognition in its 130-year history, contrasting it with rugby union and other sports. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, supports this sentiment, highlighting the numerous rugby league players who have excelled and inspired future generations. David Baines, chair of the all-party Parliamentary rugby league group, suggests that the lack of recognition may stem from class prejudice, given the working-class backgrounds of many rugby league stars. This push for recognition coincides with Kevin Sinfield's charitable fundraising efforts for the sport.</p>

He emphasized France's role as a friend and ally to both the U.S. and China, promoting cooperation while protecting French interests.

Trump framed the administration’s drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security and promised every US steel worker would soon receive a $5,000 bonus.

          <p>Norway is taking action to address concerns about the increasingly intense partying culture surrounding school-leavers, known as russe, and their use of "russebuss" party buses. The parties, which start weeks before exams, involve heavy drinking, drug use, and sleep deprivation, with students often going into debt to afford the experience. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store has acknowledged the issue, and the government plans to move the celebrations to the post-exam period starting next year. The aim is to reduce social exclusion, peer pressure, and high costs associated with the russe celebrations.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores a possible link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that redefined notions of harm, abuse, neglect, and trauma have led to impossibly high standards for parenting. This has resulted in adult children cutting off contact with parents and a fear of not meeting these standards. The author posits that this fear contributes to the decision to forgo parenthood.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer a set of historic photos of enslaved people to the International African American Museum in South Carolina, ending a long legal battle with Tamara Lanier. Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of two people in the photos, had been fighting for the images' return. The daguerreotypes, taken in 1850, are among the earliest depicting enslaved people in the United States and were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz for discredited research. The case has sparked debate on how universities should address their historical ties to slavery.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of over 130 retired judges has filed a brief urging a federal court to drop charges against Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan, arguing her arrest undermines judicial immunity. Dugan was arrested by FBI agents for allegedly preventing the arrest of a man by immigration authorities at her courthouse. The judges assert that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts and that the prosecution is an "egregious overreach" that threatens public trust in the judicial system. Dugan has pleaded not guilty, and her trial is set to begin in July.</p>

The drug, administered before and after surgery, doubled the length of time patients were cancer-free, from 2.5 years to five years on average. The treatment primes the body's defenses to attack the cancer if it returns, offering a potential breakthrough for a difficult-to-treat cancer. The trial involved over 350 patients and showed a 10% lower risk of cancer recurrence after three years.</p>
