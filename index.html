          <p>The 27th season of Comedy Central's "South Park" is experiencing a significant ratings surge, largely attributed to its satirical portrayals of political figures like Donald Trump and Kristi Noem. The season's second episode attracted 6.2 million viewers in its first three days, a 49% increase from the premiere, making it the most-watched episode since 2018. This success comes after the show's creators secured a $1.5 billion deal with Paramount and amid political tensions involving the network's parent company. The episode featured sharp comedic takes on current events, including Trump's legal settlements and Noem's controversial actions.</p>

          <p>Two suspects who led police on a dangerous, multi-vehicle car chase through Los Angeles remain at large after a sophisticated escape. The pursuit began with a carjacking and shooting in Lancaster, involved the theft of two more vehicles including a semi-truck, and ended when the suspects abandoned their final vehicle under a freeway overpass in Boyle Heights. Law enforcement sources believe the pair had accomplices who helped them flee from the final location, a tactic that experts note is becoming more common. Authorities are now processing forensic evidence, including a loaded gun, from the stolen vehicles in an effort to identify and apprehend the fugitives.</p>

The ground, saturated by over six inches of rain, caused the tree to collapse in the early morning. The widespread flooding prompted dozens of water rescues and over 100 evacuations as people became trapped in their homes and vehicles. A local state of emergency has been declared in Hamilton County, with schools closed and residents urged to use extreme caution as more rain is expected.</p>

In response, the airline issued a lockout notice and plans a complete cessation of flights by the weekend, impacting both Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge services. The main points of contention in the stalled contract negotiations are wages and compensation for unpaid work, with the union rejecting the airline's proposal for binding arbitration.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has named the first group of Kennedy Center honorees under his new leadership of the institution, a list that includes George Strait, Sylvester Stallone, Gloria Gaynor, and the band Kiss. Trump, who has installed himself as the center's chairman and replaced its board with loyalists, also announced he will host the awards gala, a departure from his first term when he avoided the event. He has pledged a complete renovation of the Kennedy Center, vowing to restore it to a "higher level" of glamour. The move has drawn criticism, particularly after the producers of "Hamilton" canceled a planned run in protest of his takeover.</p>

The FBI linked Daley to the profanity-laced messages using his cellphone number and noted that he initially denied making the calls before admitting it was possible.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study predicts a substantial decline in global reindeer populations over the next several decades, with North American caribou facing the most significant risk. Researchers from the University of Adelaide and the University of Copenhagen used ancient DNA and computer models to determine that caribou populations could plummet by as much as 80% by 2100 without major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. The study notes that climate change has already contributed to a nearly two-thirds loss in global reindeer populations in the last 30 years. This decline could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and the release of carbon stored in Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected jobs report and a cool inflation reading, economists increasingly predict the Federal Reserve will implement a quarter-point interest rate cut at its September meeting. Despite months of pressure from President Trump, the Fed has held rates steady, but a slowdown in the labor market may now prompt action to prevent an economic downturn. Futures markets reflect this sentiment, with investors pricing in a nearly 96% chance of a rate cut. The central bank faces a difficult balance, weighing concerns of potential tariff-induced inflation against the need to support employment and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Economists at firms like JPMorgan and UBS expect a gradual upward trend in prices as businesses pass on costs to consumers.

          <p>A European Commission proposal to impose penalties on Israel for its actions in Gaza remains stalled due to a lack of consensus among EU member states, with Germany among the holdouts. The plan, proposed in late July, would bar Israeli startups from accessing a portion of the "Horizon Europe" research fund, marking the first punitive action after months of criticism. The EU's executive arm cited the "unimaginable" humanitarian suffering and unfolding famine in Gaza as a violation of human rights and the principles of EU-Israel cooperation. However, deep divisions within the bloc on how to respond to the conflict have so far prevented the measures from being adopted.</p>

          <p>In a satirical piece from The Atlantic, the author ironically agrees with White House advisor Stephen Miller's assertions about rampant crime in Washington D.C., pointing to the criminals within his own administration. The article sarcastically notes that one can't walk near the White House without encountering lawlessness, citing examples like individuals who defied court orders, dismantled government departments, or were convicted felons. It humorously suggests the National Guard should focus on this "terror," alluding to controversial administration policies and the actions of its associates. The piece uses sharp irony to critique the administration's "law and order" rhetoric by highlighting its own alleged and proven transgressions.</p>

This effort follows a recent Department of Energy report that downplayed the risks of fossil fuels, which scientists decried as misinformation intended to support the rollback of key climate regulations. In a related move, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has launched a self-funded, fast-track review of evidence on the threats of greenhouse gases. These actions come as experts work to safeguard scientific data that has been removed from government websites, fighting what they call dangerous attacks on science itself.</p>

He told the Dallas Morning News that he underwent multiple surgeries on his lungs and lymph nodes over the following decade but now has no tumors.

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to include nearly all grocery items, such as milk, meat, and frozen foods, effective immediately. Previously, the discount applied mainly to fresh produce and general merchandise, with broader food discounts limited to the holiday season. The move, which the company said was one of its most requested benefits, comes as concerns about rising prices due to tariffs grow. The expanded discount could help the retail giant retain its 1.6 million U.S. employees and encourage them to do more of their own shopping at Walmart, boosting the company's own sales.</p>

After an initial trial ended in a hung jury, Read was retried on charges of second-degree murder, with prosecutors alleging she struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The defense countered that she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The case was marked by intense legal battles over evidence, witness intimidation charges against a blogger, and an internal investigation into the lead state trooper, culminating in Read's acquittal on the most serious charges.</p>

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration is permitted to suspend or terminate billions of dollars in foreign aid that had been appropriated by Congress. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturns a lower court's injunction that had forced the administration to release the funds. The money at issue includes nearly $4 billion for global health programs and over $6 billion for HIV/AIDS initiatives, which President Trump had frozen via executive order, calling it wasteful spending. The dissenting judge argued the ruling enables the executive branch to disobey the law and evade judicial review for unconstitutional actions.</p>

The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's expansion to Tennessee and its CEO's departure from California, with Habit's CMO stating, "We remain proudly Californian and we’re not going anywhere."

The average homeowner now holds around $213,000 in accessible value, contributing to a total of $11.6 trillion in usable equity nationwide. The article explains how homeowners can calculate their available equity by subtracting their mortgage balance from their home's current market value. It also cautions that while borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs are available, they are not risk-free, as the home serves as collateral and failure to repay could lead to foreclosure.</p>

The Mendenhall River reached an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record and threatening homes and infrastructure along the river. The flooding is an annual event caused when the Suicide Basin, filled with meltwater, creates enough pressure to escape under the glacier. This year's event prompted evacuations and the closure of the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area. While temporary barriers were installed to protect hundreds of homes, the recurring and worsening floods highlight the ongoing impacts of a warming climate on the region.</p>
