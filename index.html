          <h2>Conflicting Economic Views on Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-30 20:06:53 EDT</div>

          <p>ABC News reports on differing expert opinions regarding the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs. While Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro claims tariffs will stimulate the economy and create jobs, economist Diane Swonk counters that they will likely increase car prices and lead to layoffs.  A Republican senator expresses cautious optimism, viewing the tariffs as a necessary step in a long-term negotiation. The article leans slightly towards a more critical perspective on the tariffs, potentially influenced by the inclusion of dissenting economic viewpoints, which is itself a subtle bias.</p>

          <p>Fox News reports on a Dominican Republic judge's decision to close the case against Joshua Ribe, a key witness in the disappearance of University of Pittsburgh student Sudikasha Konanki.  Ribe, believed to be one of the last to see Konanki, was released from police custody after his lawyers argued that his prolonged detention violated Dominican law. The article, written by a Fox News journalist, might present a subtly pro-law enforcement perspective by highlighting Ribe's cooperation with investigators and the judge's decision as a victory for due process, potentially downplaying any lingering questions about Konanki's disappearance.</p>
