          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, warning that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and is actively preparing for military action by 2027. He urged Asian nations to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war, emphasizing that the US does not seek conflict but will defend its allies. China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" in the region, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, stating Beijing would use them for leverage, and promoted a new Indo-Pacific partnership for defense industrial resilience, noting that deterrence comes at a price. The US hopes for a strong shield of deterrence forged with allies to prevent war with China.</p>

In Seoul, a man started a fire on a subway train, leading to the evacuation of 400 passengers, and a new museum featuring Asian art has opened on Naoshima Island.

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment, part of the government's strategic defense review, aims to support the production of 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. Ministers emphasize that the increased defense spending, reaching 3% of GDP by 2034, will strengthen the armed forces and boost economic growth. The move comes in response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons and munitions production. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard University, including threats to redirect research funding and review federal contracts, have sparked concerns about the future of American higher education. Accusations of antisemitism and bias, coupled with demands for changes in diversity programs and admissions, have led to a palpable concern on campus. Some view Trump's measures as an attempt to reshape universities in a more conservative-friendly image, while others argue that universities have become too closely tied to a left-wing worldview. Harvard is resisting these pressures through legal challenges, raising questions about the long-term impact on academic independence and the role of universities in shaping American culture.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in the upcoming Spending Review, as it finalizes budget plans for various sectors including healthcare, defense, education, and criminal justice. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact potential cuts to other "unprotected" areas. The government's decision to "front-load" spending earlier in the parliament term means that future spending increases will slow down. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's commitment to avoiding further borrowing or tax increases has fueled speculation about potential spending cuts in the review.</p>

          <p>Following a 5-0 defeat to PSG in the Champions League final, Inter Milan may need to rebuild with younger players, as suggested by club president Giuseppe Marotta. Coach Simone Inzaghi acknowledged the team's fatigue and PSG's superior energy, hinting at potential changes to the squad. The team's average age was significantly higher than PSG's, indicating a need for fresh talent. Inzaghi's future with the club is also uncertain, with links to Saudi club Al-Hilal, raising questions about who will lead the rebuild.

          <p>Patti LuPone issued an apology after facing criticism from the Broadway community for her remarks about Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald. An open letter signed by over 500 Broadway performers criticized LuPone's comments as disrespectful and racially insensitive. The controversy stemmed from an interview where LuPone disparaged Lewis's claim of being a veteran and dismissed McDonald as "not a friend." LuPone expressed regret for her words and committed to making amends, acknowledging the importance of lifting each other up in the theater community. McDonald responded by saying she was unaware of any rift between them.</p>

          <p>The US has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House, following a UN nuclear watchdog report indicating Iran has increased its enriched uranium production. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged receiving "elements of a US deal" from Oman's Foreign Minister. The proposal comes as the IAEA reports Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, nearing weapons-grade levels, a matter of "serious concern." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated it's in Tehran's best interest to accept the deal, emphasizing that President Trump is committed to preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "Toxic Nation," produced by MAHA Films, targets ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, herbicides, pesticides, and fluoride as key contributors to chronic diseases. The film aligns with the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, spearheaded by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The documentary features various voices in the health and wellness space and coincides with the release of the first MAHA Commission report, advocating for federal policy changes to reduce chronic disease among American children. The film's release and Kennedy's agenda face potential challenges due to budget and staffing cuts at HHS and the EPA, despite ongoing debates and research on the potential harms and benefits of these targeted substances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientist based in Singapore has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be susceptible to hacking due to slight time delays between its onboard lasers. These delays, according to quantum researcher Alexander Miller, could provide eavesdroppers with ample opportunities to exploit the system. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, but flaws in experimental implementation can create vulnerabilities. Miller's analysis suggests that the distribution of quantum keys from Micius may not be secure.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-proposed Gaza ceasefire plan, seeking amendments while pledging to release hostages. The group reiterated demands for a permanent truce, complete Israeli withdrawal, and continuous aid, which are not part of the current deal. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff deemed the response "totally unacceptable," urging Hamas to accept the framework for proximity talks. Hamas insists on a "permanent ceasefire" and "complete withdrawal" of Israeli forces, while also demanding sustained aid for Palestinians and offering to release hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. This situation places Hamas in a complex position, caught between internal pressure and the threat of an escalated Israeli offensive.</p>

This decision, reflecting skepticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials, marks a departure from previous broad vaccine recommendations. Moderna's existing vaccine remains available for anyone aged 6 months and older. The approval was based on a study comparing mNexspike to Moderna's original vaccine, which showed it to be safe and at least as effective.
