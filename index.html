          <p>The United States is currently spending over $1 trillion annually to service its national debt, a figure that has nearly doubled in the past five years, raising concerns about long-term fiscal stability. This expense now exceeds the nation's defense spending, and projections indicate it could reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. Experts warn that increasing interest costs may crowd out funding for vital programs like Social Security, while some Republicans argue that proposed tax cuts will stimulate economic growth.

          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has implemented a new rule allowing players to protect their rankings while undergoing fertility treatments. This policy enables players to take time off for procedures like egg or embryo freezing and return to the tour with a "Special Entry Ranking" based on their recent performance. The special ranking can be used for up to three tournaments after their return, providing a safety net as they resume their careers. This initiative expands the WTA's existing support programs, which include maternity leave, postpartum support, and fertility grants, as female athletes increasingly advocate for addressing fertility challenges.</p>

This hierarchy can create feelings of jealousy and loss among friends, especially when a friend's attention is divided or when single friends feel alienated by coupledom.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal for "Trump Accounts," offering a $1,000 savings account for children, has garnered support from some CEOs but faces scrutiny from policy experts. While the seed money is seen as a benefit, concerns are raised about the program's cost and complexity. Some experts suggest universal savings accounts or 529 college savings plans as more flexible and efficient alternatives. Critics argue that Trump Accounts could add to the national deficit and that universal savings accounts would offer more flexibility for individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

Critics argue that marriage equality is settled law and that the proposal reflects newly emboldened attacks from the Christian right.

          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' growing appetite for the precious metal, according to a European Central Bank report. Central banks' gold stockpiles are close to levels last seen in the 1960s, making it second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. However, analysts suggest that some institutions may be nearing their fill, potentially leading to a cooling in central bank purchases. The precious metal's rally came around the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
