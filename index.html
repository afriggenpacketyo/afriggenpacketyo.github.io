          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 600 employees, mostly journalists and contractors, at Voice of America, a federally funded news network providing independent reporting to countries with limited press freedoms. These layoffs represent over a third of the network's staff and come despite a previous court ruling ordering the government to maintain robust news programming. The administration also put the building housing Voice of America up for sale, further signaling its intent to dismantle the broadcaster, which President Trump has criticized as "the voice of radical America." Some terminated journalists are from countries with repressive governments, and their immigration status is tied to their employment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered significant deals to sell advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, leading to internal debate over potential risks. The agreements involve delivering hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips annually to the UAE for a major data center hub and multibillion-dollar sales to Saudi Arabia. While proponents argue these deals will boost American AI companies and expand U.S. influence, critics worry about inadequate protections against the technology benefiting China and the potential for outsourcing vital infrastructure. The deals also raise questions about conflicting with the administration's "America First" agenda, given the push to bring industries back onshore.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a megabill to enact President Trump’s agenda, featuring a large tax cut primarily benefiting the wealthy, increased funding for defense and immigration enforcement, and reduced spending on health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. The bill includes extending many of the 2017 tax cuts, new temporary tax cuts campaigned on by Trump, and tax hikes on universities and noncitizens. Major changes are proposed for Medicaid, including work requirements and reduced funding to states covering undocumented immigrants. The legislation would also curtail clean energy tax credits, boost military spending, and scale back the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p>

          <p>A recent study has revealed that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene era. This migration was made possible by a land bridge that connected the two continents when sea levels were lower. The study examined fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses found in northeastern China, which showed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These migrations and genetic exchanges occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, highlighting the interconnectedness of these horse populations.</p>

Comey removed the post, stating he was unaware of the potential meaning and opposes violence. The post ignited controversy, with Trump loyalists accusing Comey of calling for the president's assassination, further highlighting the antagonistic relationship between Comey and Trump.</p>

The court is also considering whether federal judges' "nationwide injunctions" unfairly restrict the president's authority.

This could impact both COVID and flu vaccines, with the FDA already requesting more clinical data from Novavax.

          <p>Top US diplomat Marco Rubio stated that he does not have high expectations for Ukraine-Russia peace talks due to be held in Turkey and that Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin need to meet for progress to be made. Trump also suggested that significant progress in peace talks was unlikely until he and Putin met in person. Zelensky confirmed Ukraine would send a delegation for the talks in Istanbul, but criticised the "low-level" delegation being sent by Moscow.</p>

          <p>More than 60,000 disabled households in England faced homelessness last year, marking a nearly 75% increase since 2019. Analysis of government data by the homelessness charity Crisis also reveals that the amount of social housing allocated to disabled people has decreased. Labour MPs have voiced concerns about cuts to welfare payments for pensioners and people with disabilities, fearing a detrimental impact. A government spokesperson said £1bn was being given to councils this year to "support families faster and stop people becoming homeless in the first place".</p>

          <p>Australia's most-decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, has lost an appeal against a landmark defamation judgment which found he committed war crimes.

The civil trial was the first time in history any court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces. A panel of three Federal Court judges on Friday upheld the original verdict.</p>

The bill passed the first stage of the Commons last November, but since then, the details have been scrutinized and dozens of amendments added by both sides. A vote to pass or reject the bill is not likely to take place on Friday, but rather in June. Friday's debate comes as the government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>
