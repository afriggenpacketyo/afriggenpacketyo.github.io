        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to common belief, high-income individuals often struggle with credit card debt, primarily due to lifestyle inflation where expenses rise with income. A recent study shows that 62% of those earning $300,000 or more find it difficult to manage their balances. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for high earners, including using debt consolidation loans to secure lower interest rates and leveraging balance transfer cards with 0% APR offers. It also suggests negotiating directly with creditors for better rates and working with financial advisors to create sustainable payoff plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," with the host's contract ending in May 2026. While the network cited purely financial reasons amid a challenging late-night television landscape, the decision has sparked widespread speculation about political motivations. The move comes as parent company Paramount Global attempts a merger, and follows Colbert's on-air criticism of a recent CBS legal settlement with Donald Trump. The cancellation is being viewed by many as symbolic of both corporate capitulation and the decline of late-night political comedy as a dominant genre.</p>

          <p>Senator Richard Durbin has formally questioned the Justice Department and the FBI about instructions reportedly given to agents reviewing Jeffrey Epstein's case files. In letters to agency heads, Durbin claimed that personnel were told to specifically "flag" any records that mentioned former President Donald Trump. This review, which involved approximately 1,000 personnel, took place in March and was described as haphazard. Durbin is demanding to know who issued this directive and why, adding to the political pressure regarding the handling and release of the Epstein investigation materials.</p>

          <p>The price of the cryptocurrency Ether has surged, outperforming Bitcoin, as the U.S. Congress passed a significant stablecoin bill known as the GENIUS Act. This legislation is now headed to the President's desk and is poised to become the first major crypto-focused law in the United States, a move seen as a symbolic victory for the industry. Ether-tracking ETFs have also seen record inflows, surpassing those for Bitcoin for the first time. Analysts suggest this could signal a shift in crypto market leadership from Bitcoin to Ethereum.

While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher rates, their variable nature means returns can change over time. In contrast, long-term CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed interest rate, which can be more advantageous in a fluctuating rate environment. The analysis suggests that savers must weigh the potential for higher but uncertain returns from a money market account against the security and predictable earnings of a CD.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for south-east England, including London, due to the threat of dangerous flash flooding from imminent thunderstorms. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday morning. The risk is heightened because the ground is parched from a recent heatwave, which will cause the torrential rain to run off rapidly. This is likely to cause significant disruption to transport, power cuts, and the potential for fast-flowing, deep floodwaters that could endanger life.</p>

          <p>The European Union has adopted a new, aggressive package of sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The measures, described as "unprecedented," target Russia's energy, banking, and military sectors. Key provisions include lowering the price cap on Russian oil, banning all future transactions via the Nord Stream pipelines, and sanctioning non-EU shipping vessels in Russia's "shadow fleet." The sanctions also target entities in China and Turkey for supplying Russia with dual-use technologies, though experts note that enforcement will remain a significant challenge for the bloc.</p>

The measures are reportedly aimed at preventing Bolsonaro from fleeing the country, especially as U.S. President Trump has threatened tariffs on Brazil to pressure authorities to drop the case.

The five-day count found 115 young swans, a significant increase from the 86 counted last year. This suggests a reversal of a worrying trend that saw numbers plummet by 45% over the past two years, largely due to avian flu and human-related harm.
