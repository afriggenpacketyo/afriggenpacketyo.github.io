            <h2>Potential Fallout if Trump Scraps AGOA Trade Pact</h2>

            <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides duty-free access to the US market for sub-Saharan African countries, is set to expire in September, raising concerns about the economic impact if Trump doesn't renew it. Experts warn of potential job losses, higher commodity prices, and increased business costs for African economies. Some suggest Africa should focus on luxury products and leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to mitigate the fallout, pushing for collective negotiation rather than individual countries. The article also touches on the criteria for joining AGOA, which include establishing a market-based economy and upholding the rule of law. Optimism is muted given the uncertainty surrounding trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared sensitive information about US air strikes on Yemen in a second private group on the Signal app, which included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The messages, sent on March 15, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. This revelation comes a month after the existence of a separate Signal group discussing sensitive information about US military operations was revealed, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. Critics argue that discussing such information in Signal groups could jeopardize US personnel carrying out military operations.</p>

            <p>China announced sanctions on members of the United States Congress, officials, and heads of non-governmental organizations who have "behaved badly" on Hong Kong-related issues, amidst ongoing trade tensions between China and the US.

The ministry spokesman said that any wrongful actions taken by the United States side on Hong Kong-related issues will be met with China’s resolute retaliation and reciprocal countermeasures.</p>

            <p>Prison officers in the UK are demanding electric stun guns to protect themselves while guarding the most dangerous jails, following an incident where Hashem Abedi, one of the Manchester Arena bombers, attacked officers. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) is calling for the tactical use of tasers and stab vests for all staff. The meeting with the justice secretary comes after Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing, threw hot oil at officers and stabbed them with makeshift weapons at HMP Frankland in County Durham. Former prison governor Ian Acheson said the current protective equipment issued to prison officers, particularly those that deal with the most dangerous prisoners, is inadequate compared to the "level of threat" they face.</p>

            <p>The article argues that the UK, emboldened by Trump's policies, is exhibiting colonial impulses through tightened visa restrictions on African and Caribbean nations, while being more welcoming to Ukrainians. It criticizes the UK's treatment of Trinidad and Tobago, citing exorbitant visa fees as punishment for a spike in asylum claims. The author questions the relevance of the Commonwealth and suggests that Caribbean nations should withdraw their labor and brilliance to build something better. The article also touches on the US's approach to Cuba's medical diplomacy and concludes that the West cannot function without the resources and intellect of the global south.</p>

            <p>An inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) found that "professional failures" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF said its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, and that six of the casualties were Hamas members. The report blamed "poor night visibility" and an "operational misunderstanding" for the incident, leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander and a reprimand for another commanding officer. A UN official in Gaza suggested the IDF investigation did not go far enough and that a lack of real accountability undermines international law.</p>

In line with many other countries, the tariff has been lowered to 10% for a 90-day period.

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for a Chinese airline landed back at Boeing’s US production hub due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Trump raised baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, leading China to retaliate with a 125% tariff on US goods. The high tariffs make it economically unviable for Chinese airlines to take delivery of Boeing jets. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen in a second group chat using the messaging app Signal that included his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer. Those details shared in the second chat included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets involved in the pending attack on Houthi positions. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures to conduct official business. Its use to divulge sensitive military operations may complicate ongoing investigations into potential leaks involving the first known group chat, which included top aides and other members of Pete Hegseth's team -- at least three of whom have been since fired in relation to the inquiry.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), kept its loan prime rates unchanged as strong macro data allows it room to focus on stabilizing the yuan amid trade tensions with the U.S. The decision comes as China reported better-than-expected economic data this month. The 1-year LPR influences corporate and most household loans in China, while the 5-year LPR serves as a benchmark for mortgage rates. The PBOC has kept the LPRs steady since October last year. Following the announcement, the Chinese onshore yuan appreciated against the dollar.</p>

            <p>A survey indicates that postdoctoral positions in Chinese universities significantly outnumber young researchers seeking jobs, contrasting with the US, where research funding cuts are impacting opportunities. The study, published by Lipin, found a large gap between vacancies and demand among postdocs. This comes as high-profile Chinese scientists, including those who worked at MIT, are returning home due to reduced research funding in the US. The statistics show that for every five postdoctoral early career research vacancies, there was on average just one jobseeker.</p>

Texas prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty, driven by a majority of victims' relatives who want the case to be over. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level after pleading guilty to hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

This could lead to a significant loss of rental assistance and subsequent evictions for those fleeing homelessness or domestic violence. The program's future depends on Congress allocating additional funding, which is uncertain given current budget constraints.
