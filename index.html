          <h2>Boeing Could Avoid Guilty Plea in 737 Max Case with DOJ Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 14:03:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department and Boeing are reportedly nearing a deal that would allow the aerospace company to avoid a guilty plea or trial in the criminal case related to the two deadly 737 Max crashes. This development marks a potential reversal from a previous agreement where Boeing was set to plead guilty after the Biden administration determined the company violated a 2021 agreement tied to the crashes. The judge rejected the original plea deal due to concerns about diversity, equity, and inclusion, opening the door for a possible trial. The fraud charge against Boeing stems from allegations that the company misled regulators about the flight-control system implicated in the crashes.</p>

Hartung, known for his disciplined approach to Chipotle's finances during the Covid-19 pandemic, will also join Tesla's audit committee. This addition expands Tesla's board to nine members as the company faces challenges including declining EV sales and concerns about CEO Elon Musk's focus on his role leading the Department of Government Efficiency.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced in a memo that the central bank plans to reduce its staff by 10% over the next few years. This reduction will involve offering voluntary deferred resignation programs to employees eligible for retirement by the end of 2027. Powell stated that the move aims to consolidate functions, modernize practices, and ensure the Fed is appropriately sized to meet its statutory mission. The Fed's 2023 annual report indicated a staff of just under 24,000, so a 10% reduction would bring the total below 22,000 employees.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation for posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged as "8647," which some interpret as a threat to President Trump. "Eighty-six" is slang for "get rid of," and Trump is the 47th president. The post sparked outrage among Republicans, with some accusing Comey of calling for Trump's assassination. Comey deleted the photo and said he didn't realize the numbers could be associated with violence.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill hit a snag when conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. Republicans have yet to resolve disputes, with conservative members seeking deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans demanding a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Conservatives argue the bill does not sufficiently slash federal spending, particularly regarding Medicaid work requirements. Trump urged Republicans to unite behind the bill, which extends tax cuts from his first term and enacts new ones, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are considering abandoning a deal in which Boeing would plead guilty to a felony charge related to the 737 Max crashes, opting instead for a non-prosecution agreement. This potential reversal has sparked outrage from families of the victims, who feel it represents a failure of justice. Under the proposed non-prosecution agreement, Boeing would pay approximately $445 million to a victims' fund, invest in compliance and safety measures, and be subject to oversight by an independent compliance consultant. The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, which claimed 346 lives, were attributed to changes in flight control software on the 737 Max.</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills are projected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high and a more than 6% increase from 2024, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. This increase is attributed to rising electricity prices outpacing inflation, combined with higher temperatures necessitating more cooling. Low-income households, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy costs, may struggle to afford keeping their homes cool, potentially leading to health risks. Experts recommend modernizing homes with better insulation to help control energy bills.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the growing entitlement of elite golfers, particularly in their interactions with the media, and the risk of alienating the golfing public. Instances such as Collin Morikawa's refusal to speak to the media after a loss and Scottie Scheffler's dictating of questions highlight this trend. The article argues that while golfers enjoy a privileged lifestyle, they should remember that their success is partly due to public interest in the sport. The schism in elite golf has already turned the public away from the elite game, and these behaviors could further exacerbate the issue.</p>

The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans making less than $51,000 a year would see their after-tax income fall as a result of the Republican proposal beginning in 2026. This is due to the plan's combination of tax cuts and federal spending cuts, which disproportionately affect the poorest.
