          <p>Wall Street experienced a mixed close to the week, with the S&P 500's attempt at a record finish remaining uncertain as major tech stocks like Nvidia and Tesla lost momentum. Amid ongoing government shutdown concerns, Goldman Sachs analysts expressed confidence in Amazon, raising its price target and highlighting the potential of its advertising business as a key profit driver alongside its AWS cloud services. They project that Amazon Web Services can return to topline growth exceeding 20%, citing its strong backlog and partnerships in the AI sector as key catalysts for future performance.

          <p>More than a dozen individuals were arrested during a protest outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Broadview, Illinois. The demonstration, involving approximately 250 protesters, saw escalating tensions as law enforcement deployed pepper balls and tear gas to manage crowds blocking federal operations. This facility has become a focal point for unrest amid the Trump administration's immigration policies, with recent weeks seeing multiple investigations into alleged hit-and-runs and property damage. The Department of Justice has also filed federal charges against five individuals for assaulting federal agents during previous demonstrations at the location.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has caused the postponement of the highly anticipated monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, leaving economists and financial markets without a critical indicator of the nation's economic health. Federal agencies, including the number-crunchers who compile the data, have furloughed staff, halting the report's production until the shutdown is resolved. Economists had expected the report to show modest job growth, and its delay creates uncertainty at a time of economic transition. The shutdown also threatens to hold up other vital data releases, including the upcoming inflation report.</p>

          <p>Storm Amy, the first named storm of the season, is causing significant disruption across the United Kingdom, with forecasts of wind gusts reaching up to 100mph in exposed areas. Amber weather warnings have been issued for parts of Northern Ireland and Scotland, where tens of thousands have already lost power and hundreds of schools closed early. The storm has led to widespread travel cancellations, including all train services in Northern Ireland and numerous flights, ferries, and rail lines in Scotland. Authorities are urging the public to avoid travel as the high winds pose a potential risk to life from flying debris.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding designated for major transit projects in Chicago, including a significant extension of the Red Line subway system. The White House's budget director cited a need to review the city's race-based contracting and diversity initiatives as the reason for the hold, a justification also used to freeze $18 billion for New York transit projects. This move is viewed as part of a broader strategy to exert pressure on Democratic-led cities and lawmakers during the ongoing partial government shutdown.

          <p>Following a request from the Department of Justice, Apple has removed the ICEBlock app, which allowed users to crowdsource and report the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The developer claims the removal was due to pressure from the Trump administration, while Apple stated the decision was based on safety risks identified by law enforcement. Attorney General Pamela Bondi and the Department of Homeland Security argued that such apps endanger officers and impede efforts against criminal organizations. The move comes after officials noted that a gunman who attacked an ICE facility had searched for similar tracking applications.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has terminated Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) who succeeded Dr. Anthony Fauci. Dr. Marrazzo recently filed a whistleblower complaint alleging she was silenced and faced retaliation for challenging Trump-appointed officials who questioned the importance of childhood flu vaccines. In her complaint, she claimed a top NIH official echoed Kennedy's vaccine skepticism, creating an alarming environment that prioritized political interests over scientific integrity. Marrazzo's attorney stated the firing is further retaliation for her protected whistleblower activities, raising concerns about the politicization of public health.</p>

          <p>Two men are facing felony charges for allegedly rigging poker games at two Southern California casinos, cheating them out of more than $30,000. Prosecutors claim Vaagn Galustyan and Armin Martirosyan marked high-value cards by bending their corners to gain an unfair advantage in subsequent hands. The alleged scheme was uncovered through security footage at the Pala Casino and Harrah's Casino. The district attorney noted that while card marking is an old cheating method, modern technology allows for its detection and prosecution, protecting local casinos from such scams.</p>

The rule benefits the booming vinyl market, which has seen a major resurgence driven by younger buyers and artists like Taylor Swift.

          <p>President Donald Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a U.S.-brokered peace plan for Gaza, warning that failure to agree will result in "all hell" breaking loose. The proposal includes an immediate ceasefire and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. However, a senior Hamas figure has indicated the group is likely to reject the plan, partly because it requires them to surrender their primary bargaining chip—the hostages—at the outset. The White House has emphasized that the consequences for Hamas turning down the deal would be "very grave."</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners considering a $15,000 home equity loan can expect slightly lower monthly payments compared to earlier in the year. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.36% would cost approximately $185 per month, while a 15-year term at 8.24% would be around $145 per month. While the reduction in cost is marginal, it reflects a more favorable borrowing environment for homeowners looking to tap into their equity. The article suggests comparing these fixed-rate loans with variable-rate HELOCs, which may offer even lower initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For many retirees, Original Medicare (Parts A and B) is insufficient, as it covers only about 80% of medical costs and lacks an out-of-pocket maximum, potentially leading to substantial bills.

While not every retiree needs a Medigap plan, it is often a critical tool for managing healthcare expenses, especially as medical needs typically increase with age. Unlike Medicare Advantage plans, Medigap policies offer the flexibility to see any provider nationwide who accepts Medicare, without network restrictions.</p>

          <p>The practice of banning books in American schools and libraries continues to be a contentious issue, evolving from challenges against novels like Judy Blume’s "Forever" fifty years ago to modern campaigns targeting books like Maia Kobabe's "Gender Queer." While portrayals of sex have historically been a primary justification for censorship, the list of forbidden topics has expanded to include LGBTQ themes and challenging aspects of American history. Activists and politicians often use social media to amplify objections, leading to rapid and widespread challenges against certain works. This trend reflects a deliberate effort to remove books with specific viewpoints from public access.</p>

          <p>Southern California is set to experience cooler-than-normal temperatures accompanied by gusty winds and potential light rain through Saturday. The National Weather Service has issued wind advisories for parts of Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Los Angeles counties, with gusts potentially reaching up to 50 mph in some areas. Light showers have already been reported in Los Angeles, with most of the region expecting maximum temperatures in the 70s. The shift in weather provides a brief respite from warmer conditions but brings strong winds to coastal and inland areas, including the Mojave Desert.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: GOP Claims Linking Government Shutdown to Undocumented Immigrant Healthcare are False</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican leaders have falsely claimed that the government shutdown was caused by Democrats demanding healthcare benefits for undocumented immigrants. According to policy experts, this assertion is a distortion, as federal law already bars undocumented individuals from enrolling in major programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The budget dispute actually centers on Democratic efforts to reverse Medicaid cuts and extend ACA subsidies that benefit low-income Americans, which were affected by a recent Republican-backed tax law. Experts suggest the claim is a misleading political tactic that plays into anti-immigrant sentiment.</p>

Fact-checkers point to several signs of AI manipulation, including mismatched mouth movements and distorted images, confirming the video is not authentic. The MedBed myth originates from far-right online communities and preys on the desperation of people with chronic and incurable illnesses.</p>

          <p>A Texas man, Raunaq Alam, was sentenced to six months in jail for spray-painting “Fuck Israel” on a church wall, after a judge overruled a jury's recommendation for community supervision. The jury had found Alam guilty of criminal mischief but rejected a hate-crime enhancement, which argued the graffiti targeted a group based on national origin or religion. Alam's defense contended his actions were protected free speech, similar to protesting against a country like America. The judge, however, called the graffiti “disgusting” and imposed the jail sentence, a move that highlights ongoing tensions around political protest and hate speech.</p>

At a summit in Copenhagen, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that Europe is facing a "hybrid war" and must strengthen its production of both drones and counter-drone capabilities by 2030. While some leaders have referred to this as a "drone wall," others like French President Emmanuel Macron caution that the reality of defense is more complex.

Some members of the crowd accused him and the Labour government of allowing antisemitism to rise and criticized the recent decision to recognize a Palestinian state. As Lammy attempted to express solidarity with the Jewish community, he was met with shouts of "shame on you" and "empty words." The hostile reception highlights the deep anger and fear within the community following the attack, with some attendees linking the violence to what they perceive as a permissive environment for anti-Jewish hatred.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has entered its third day of a partial shutdown after lawmakers failed to agree on a funding bill. The impasse stems from a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare provisions, specifically the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of Medicaid cuts. As a result, non-essential government services are suspended, and about 750,000 federal employees are on unpaid leave. While essential services like border protection and air traffic control continue, the shutdown could delay travel, affect research, and reduce economic output by an estimated 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points for each week it continues.</p>
