          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal transportation funds from states that do not fully cooperate with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit, brought by twenty Democratic-led states, challenged the Department of Transportation's policy, arguing it was unconstitutional and violated the Administrative Procedure Act. Judge McConnell stated that the administration's action exceeded Congress's powers under the Spending Clause. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had warned non-cooperative states that they would be responsible for their own infrastructure needs, but the court's ruling prohibits adverse actions against states lacking specific statutory authorization.</p>

          <p>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, was a 2015 agreement between Iran and several world powers, imposing restrictions on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time for accumulating enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon.

          <p>Law enforcement officials have increased surveillance of Iran-backed operatives in the United States as President Trump considers potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. FBI Director Kash Patel has intensified efforts to monitor possible domestic sleeper cells linked to Hezbollah. This heightened monitoring follows concerns about potential attacks within the U.S. since the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020. Trump is contemplating whether to strike Iran's uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, joining Israel's campaign against Iranian nuclear and military targets.</p>

          <p>The European Union is increasingly concerned about China's economic overcapacity and its potential impact on European industries. Decades of overinvestment, state subsidies, weak domestic consumption, and trade wars have created a situation where China's industrial output may flood global markets, particularly Europe. Governments fear this could decimate industries, lead to job losses, and fuel populist movements. The EU is urging Beijing to address the issue or face a backlash similar to the anti-China sentiment in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering a strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear site, viewing it as necessary to prevent the country from developing nuclear weapons. He has approved attack plans but is awaiting potential negotiations with Iran before making a final decision. The U.K. is actively engaged in diplomacy to find a resolution. Trump has been briefed on the risks and benefits of bombing Fordo, with some sources suggesting that disabling the site is essential due to the speed at which Iran could produce bombs.</p>
