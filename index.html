          <p>A tragic incident occurred in India's western state of Rajasthan when the roof of a school building collapsed, resulting in the deaths of at least four children. Dozens of other students and staff members are feared to be trapped under the debris. The collapse happened at the Piplodi Government School on a Friday morning while classes were in session. Rescue operations are currently underway as authorities work to save those who remain trapped in the one-story building.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize a Palestinian state in September, making it the first G7 nation to take this step. The decision was met with praise from Palestinian officials but drew strong condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who stated the move "rewards terror." The United States also expressed its rejection of the announcement, which comes amid increasing international pressure for a two-state solution and an end to the conflict in Gaza. Macron emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire and a path toward lasting peace.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels "refreshed and recharged" as he enters his fourth year, despite mounting pressure following a 7-6 season. Riley attributes his renewed calm to a more stable program structure and a strong front office, allowing him to focus on refining the team rather than making major fixes. While acknowledging last season's shortcomings, particularly in close games, he expressed confidence in the team's progress, especially on defense and with new quarterback Jayden Maiava. The program's recent success in recruiting signals strong internal momentum.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is set to convene an emergency meeting following intense border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia. The fighting, which erupted over a long-disputed border area, has involved rockets, artillery, and F-16 jets, with both nations blaming each other for initiating the violence. The conflict has resulted in casualties, with Thailand reporting 14 deaths and the evacuation of over 100,000 people from border provinces. International powers, including the US, China, and the EU, have called for an immediate de-escalation and a return to dialogue.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating college sports, particularly regarding athlete compensation and scholarship distribution. The order directs federal agencies to enforce new rules on "pay-for-play" name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and requires top athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels for non-revenue sports. This move comes after a legal settlement allowed for direct payments to athletes, raising concerns about the future of less profitable sports. The order seeks to establish "guardrails" to preserve the educational aspects of intercollegiate athletics, though its legal viability is being questioned. (not investment advice)</p>

While an Israeli official indicated there was "no collapse" in the negotiations, the withdrawal signals a significant setback in efforts to end the conflict.

          <p>A research team in China has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces, using folded layers of graphene. In a surprising discovery, the scientists found that friction did not always increase with thickness; some thicker folds actually slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how the material's bending altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The findings could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear.</p>

In her ruling, Justice Maria Carroccia stated she did not find the complainant's evidence to be "credible or reliable," and therefore the prosecution could not prove its case. The central issue was whether the woman, who had consensual sex with one player before others entered the room, had consented to subsequent acts. The high-profile case has been closely followed in Canada, and the players remain ineligible for the NHL pending the league's own review.</p>

          <p>Terry Bollea, the iconic professional wrestler known worldwide as Hulk Hogan, has died at the age of 71. Police in Clearwater, Florida, confirmed he was transported to a hospital after a cardiac arrest call and was pronounced dead, with no signs of foul play. Hogan was a transformative figure in entertainment, catapulting the WWE to global fame in the 1980s with his "Hulkamania" persona and later reinventing himself in WCW.

          <p>The suicide prevention charity Samaritans is planning a major restructuring that will involve closing at least half of its more than 200 branches across the UK and Ireland. The charity's leadership stated that maintaining so many physical locations is not sustainable and hinders the delivery of the best possible service. The proposal has sparked significant concern among volunteers, who fear the move to fewer, larger regional centers and "virtual volunteering" will dismantle the local support networks that have been effective for 70 years. They worry it could lead to an exodus of volunteers and a more impersonal service.</p>

Unrwa's Commissioner-General described people in Gaza as "walking corpses" and reported that over 100 people, mostly children, have died of hunger. This comes as over 100 international aid organizations warn of mass starvation, pressing for unrestricted humanitarian access. Israel maintains there is no siege and blames Hamas for malnutrition, but the UN insists the level of aid entering the territory is a "trickle" amid an unprecedented hunger crisis.</p>

The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases in Boston and Chicago, said they were given no reason for their termination. They also alleged they had been pressured on how to rule in certain cases to facilitate arrests by ICE agents outside the courtroom. Their firings come amid a growing backlog of nearly four million immigration cases and reports that over 100 judges have left since the Trump administration took office.</p>
