        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels high and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon, this article outlines crucial questions for homeowners considering a home equity loan. Homeowners are advised to assess how much they truly need to borrow, whether their financial needs are urgent enough to justify current interest rates, and if they should wait for potential future rate cuts. The guidance also suggests comparing the stability of a fixed-rate loan against the potential volatility of a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC) to make an informed financial decision.

          <p>The global rise of stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to traditional fiat money, presents a significant challenge for China's economic strategy. The vast majority, over 99 percent, of these digital assets are backed by the U.S. dollar, reinforcing its dominance in the emerging digital finance landscape. This trend complicates Beijing's efforts to promote its own digital yuan and reduce reliance on the dollar. The article explores this dilemma, examining how China might respond to the widespread adoption of dollar-based tokens that could undermine its financial ambitions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice, representing the Trump administration, has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the temporary removal of Democratic Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter. This legal move follows lower court rulings that blocked her dismissal, upholding tenure protections designed to ensure the independence of regulatory agencies. The administration is challenging a 1935 precedent, arguing that the modern FTC wields powers significant enough that its commissioners should be removable at the will of the president, escalating a conflict over executive authority.</p>

          <p>In a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. voiced support for unsubstantiated claims about vaccine risks and clashed with senators over COVID-19 shot accessibility. He publicly agreed with a new appointee's controversial statement linking mRNA vaccines to "serious harm," and aggressively denied that administration policy changes were limiting vaccine access. Kennedy's testimony marks a significant departure from the more moderate assurances he provided during his confirmation hearings, alarming lawmakers from both parties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to sign an executive order that will change the name of the Department of Defense back to its original title, the Department of War. This action, supported by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, is a key part of the administration's broader campaign to promote a "warrior ethos" within the Pentagon. According to the White House, the order will initially use the historic name as a secondary title while directing the secretary to propose legislative and executive actions to make the change permanent.</p>

          <p>England's struggles in one-day international cricket persisted as they were defeated by South Africa by five runs at Lord's, a result that sealed a series loss with one match remaining. Tasked with chasing a target of 331, England's effort fell just short, ending at 325-9 despite strong contributions from Joe Root and Jos Buttler. This marks the team's fifth series defeat in its last six ODI contests, continuing a period of poor form since the 2023 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Michael Schill has announced he is stepping down as president of Northwestern University after a turbulent three-year period. His tenure was marked by intense criticism from Republican lawmakers regarding the university's response to pro-Palestinian campus protests, which they claimed fostered antisemitism. This political pressure was followed by the Trump administration freezing nearly $800 million in federal research funds, a severe financial blow that led the university to eliminate over 400 staff positions and implement a hiring freeze.</p>

He is credited with transforming the club's infrastructure, most notably by building a world-class stadium and making the club highly profitable. However, this business success is contrasted with a lack of major trophies and a high turnover of managers, leading many fans to feel that financial stability was prioritized over the pursuit of silverware.</p>
