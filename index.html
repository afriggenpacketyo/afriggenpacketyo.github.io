          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves on Tuesday, nearly a week after being suspended. The company stated the initial decision was made to avoid escalating a tense national situation following Kimmel's remarks about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Disney explained that after several days of thoughtful conversations with the host, they mutually agreed to resume the show. The suspension had sparked a significant debate across the nation regarding free speech, corporate responsibility, and political pressure on media outlets.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to address the looming government shutdown. The meeting comes after competing funding proposals failed in the Senate, with the September 30 deadline fast approaching. Democratic leaders had requested the meeting, stating they would not support a spending bill that fails to address their healthcare priorities and blaming Republican leadership for the impasse. President Trump has publicly acknowledged the possibility of a shutdown if an agreement cannot be reached between the parties.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 19:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments concerning the president's power to dismiss officials from independent federal agencies, a case with significant implications for the separation of powers. The decision stems from President Trump's firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, which a lower court had deemed unlawful based on a 1935 precedent. This earlier ruling, known as Humphrey's Executor, established that presidents could only remove such officials for misconduct or neglect. The court's willingness to revisit this long-standing precedent could reshape the independence of agencies designed by Congress to be insulated from political interference.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially labeling the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as antifa a "domestic terrorist organization." The order directs federal agencies to investigate and counter any illegal activities conducted by its members and to pursue those who provide funding or material support. This action follows the president's promise to take a hardline stance against the movement, although its legal and practical impact remains uncertain. Legal experts note that the U.S. lacks a specific domestic terrorism statute that would grant the president authority to formally designate domestic groups in this manner.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has made a bold prediction that his son, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, will get an opportunity to start for the Cleveland Browns at some point during the current NFL season. Speaking on a podcast, Sanders advised his son, who is currently third on the depth chart behind veterans Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, to remain patient and prepared for his chance. He also confirmed that other teams, including the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles, had shown interest in Shedeur during the draft. The comments add a layer of intrigue to the Browns' quarterback situation as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>In a series of recent actions, the Trump administration has escalated its campaign against perceived political opponents and institutions, raising concerns about the use of executive power. These moves include pressuring the Department of Justice to investigate political rivals, the FCC chairman hinting at punitive measures against critical media, and labeling 'antifa' as a domestic terrorist group. Additionally, new restrictions have been placed on Pentagon reporters, and a bribery investigation into a White House advisor was reportedly shut down. Critics and constitutional scholars argue these actions represent a significant challenge to democratic norms and First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for employers applying for H-1B visas on behalf of foreign workers, a dramatic increase from the previous cost structure. The White House clarified that this is a one-time fee applicable only to new applicants and will not affect current visa holders or those seeking renewals. The H-1B program allows U.S. companies, particularly in the tech and finance sectors, to hire highly skilled foreign professionals for specialized roles. The administration's stated goal for the steep fee increase is to encourage companies to prioritize hiring American workers for these positions.</p>

The initiative seeks to establish a full supply chain, from design to fabrication and packaging, capitalizing on global efforts to diversify electronics production away from China. So far, ten projects have been approved, including fabrication plants by Tata Electronics and partnerships with Taiwanese firms. However, experts caution that success depends on overcoming significant challenges, including developing a robust local ecosystem, improving infrastructure, and creating sustainable policies beyond initial financial incentives.

          <p>President Trump's recent unproven claim linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism is part of a larger pattern within his administration that promotes a 'natural' approach to motherhood, often at odds with established medical consensus. This article suggests that this ideology also underlies recent efforts to question the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and antidepressants for pregnant women. Critics argue this narrative could undermine women's health by discouraging the use of proven medical interventions for serious conditions like fever or depression during pregnancy. The movement appears to valorize motherhood without medical support, which could have dangerous consequences for maternal and infant well-being.</p>

The proposal is a direct response to the Trump administration's decision to cut billions of dollars from biomedical research grants in the U.S. Davey argues that the UK should seize the opportunity to become a world leader in cancer research by providing a new home for scientists affected by what he terms the U.S. government's "anti-science agenda."

          <p>This article examines the scientific basis for the Trump administration's recent announcement linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism, concluding that the evidence is weak and highly contested. While some small observational studies have suggested a possible association, larger and more robust research, including a study of 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no such link. Experts argue that the rise in autism diagnoses is largely due to increased awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria, not a single environmental factor. The administration's focus on this unproven theory, while promoting a separate, little-tested treatment, has alarmed many in the scientific and autism advocacy communities.</p>

          <p>Defense technology company Anduril has announced that its YFQ-44A Fury drone, a candidate for the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, will attempt its first flight in a semi-autonomous mode. Instead of being remotely piloted, the drone is designed to take off, fly a pre-planned route, and land with the push of a button. While this software-first approach has delayed the maiden flight, the company believes it will accelerate the overall testing and development timeline. Anduril is currently producing multiple Fury aircraft to support an expansive flight test schedule over the next year, aiming to field the advanced capability quickly.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Mario Guevara, a Salvadoran journalist detained by ICE since June, are seeking an emergency hearing to prevent his imminent deportation. The move comes after the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened his 13-year-old immigration case and denied his release on bond. Guevara, who founded a Spanish-language news outlet, was arrested while covering a protest and has a pending pathway to citizenship through his U.S. citizen son. His legal team, including the ACLU, argues his detention is a retaliatory measure against his reporting on law enforcement, and a federal judge has ordered the government to respond by early October.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has created significant confusion and uncertainty, according to immigration attorneys. While the White House has clarified the fee applies only to new applicants, lawyers are advising caution, particularly for current visa holders who may need to travel abroad while an extension or change of employer is pending. Attorneys express concern that the high cost will have a chilling effect on the program, deterring companies in tech, healthcare, and other sectors from hiring skilled foreign talent. Questions also remain about the process for obtaining a national interest exemption from the fee.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has established a new immigration pathway, dubbed the "Trump Gold Card," which offers wealthy foreigners a fast track to permanent residency. Through an executive order, the program allows individuals to obtain an employment-based visa by making a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This policy marks a significant shift, tying immigration eligibility directly to personal wealth rather than the traditional criteria of extraordinary ability or specific employment needs. The administration suggests the funds will be used to promote American industry and pay down national debt, reformulating the American dream as a pay-to-play system.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England has introduced a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths. This "three strikes and rethink" approach aims to make a more cautious and thorough diagnostic process standard practice across the country.</p>

          <p>China has started the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial policy document that will guide the nation's economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This plan is seen as essential for achieving the country's long-term goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare for discussions in October, the blueprint is expected to address rising uncertainties both domestically and internationally. Experts suggest that to navigate these turbulent times, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets that have characterized past plans.

The tip alerted authorities to concerning social media posts by a former student, which referenced a local high school. In response, police locked down the high school and a nearby middle school until the student was located and weapons were recovered from their home. The tip line was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization dedicated to preventing gun violence, which stated this is the 19th credible school attack the system has helped thwart since 2018.</p>
