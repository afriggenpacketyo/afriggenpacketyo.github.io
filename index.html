          <p>President Trump is set to unveil a "most favored nation" plan aimed at cutting Medicare drug prices, a policy previously attempted during his first term. This initiative seeks to tie the prices of certain high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. The Biden administration abandoned a similar proposal in 2022 due to court orders and stakeholder concerns. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has hinted at the policy's return, citing high prices for drugs like Ozempic in Europe.</p>

The defense argued that lyrics previously cited by prosecutors were recorded before the shooting and that the case is not about his music but his conduct.

Studies from Arkansas' previous attempt at work requirements showed that many eligible adults lost coverage, and it did not result in increased employment.
