            <p>Two American Airlines jets had a minor collision on the taxiway at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, causing damage to a winglet on each aircraft. The incident occurred just three months after a deadly crash near the same airport, raising concerns about aviation safety. No injuries were reported among the 76 and 67 customers aboard the respective flights, and both planes returned to the terminal for inspection. The FAA is investigating the incident, while American Airlines apologized for the inconvenience and emphasized that safety is their top priority. There was no impact on overall flight operations at the airport.</p>

            <p>Financial anxiety is on the rise in America, with a CNBC|SurveyMonkey poll revealing that nearly half of Americans feel more stressed about their finances than a year ago. Inflation, high interest rates, and potential layoffs are contributing to this 'vibecession,' impacting individuals across all income levels. While lower-income households experience the highest levels of financial stress, even six-figure earners are feeling the squeeze. The rising cost of essentials and concerns about the economy are leading to cuts in discretionary spending, reflecting a deeper feeling of financial insecurity.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariff increase on imports from China could effectively end most trade between the two countries, according to economist Erica York. She noted that tariffs exceeding triple digits often cut off trade, as companies may be unable to absorb the costs. York also highlighted that even with a temporary pause, the tariffs still in place represent the most protectionist stance in decades. She estimates that the new tariffs will lead to a significant increase in federal tax revenues, making them the biggest tax increase since 1993. (not investment advice)</p>
