          <p>A 25-year-old man has been charged with stalking, attempted kidnapping, and aggravated criminal trespass after allegedly attempting to enter Memphis Mayor Paul Young's residence. Police recovered a taser, gloves, rope, and duct tape from the suspect's vehicle. Mayor Young expressed concern about the incident, especially after politically motivated shootings in Minnesota, and highlighted the link between angry online rhetoric and real-life violence. The mayor emphasized that political violence cannot become the norm and that online threats should be taken seriously. </p>

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being transformed into a space for healing, art, and reparative history through collaboration between 1504, a narrative studio, and the Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation. The initiative aims to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities through creative storytelling, inviting people to feel the weight of the past. The project includes a site-specific sculpture memorializing "hush harbors," places where enslaved people worshiped and resisted, and dialogues between descendants of enslavers and the enslaved. The exhibit "Out of Whole Cloth" tells the stories of three families of free people in post-Emancipation Alabama. </p>

          <p>Amidst escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, the UK is facing questions about its potential involvement. While Britain has called for de-escalation, its relationship with Israel has recently soured. The UK possesses strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base and military presence in Cyprus and the Gulf. The use of Diego Garcia by the U.S. would require UK permission, and any UK military involvement must be defensive to comply with the law. </p>

          <p>The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), or Iran nuclear deal, was signed in 2015 between Iran, the U.S., and other world powers, imposing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.

Since then, Iran has reduced its breakout time for accumulating enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon.

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, potentially triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank. The explosion occurred during the final stages of a countdown for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines. SpaceX is investigating the cause of the mishap, which is reminiscent of a Falcon 9 explosion in 2016. NASA is relying on the Starship for its Artemis moon mission, making the incident a setback for the program. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, arguing the states were likely to succeed in their claims that the administration was unlawfully holding federal funds hostage. The lawsuit was filed by Democratic state attorneys general who argued the policy was an attempt to coerce them into adhering to Trump’s immigration agenda. The states contended that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose such conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. </p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft resigned as a government whip over the government's plans to cut disability benefits. In a letter to the prime minister, Foxcroft stated that while she understood the need to address the welfare bill, cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. The government responded that it was fixing a broken welfare system that was failing the sick and vulnerable. The government's bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit. </p>

          <p>The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), a U.S.-produced bunker-buster bomb, and the B-2 Spirit bomber could be used to strike Iran's underground nuclear facility at Fordo. The MOP is designed to attack deeply-buried facilities and is guided by military GPS, while the B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft in the Air Force equipped to carry it. The B-2 Spirit is known for its stealth capabilities, making it difficult for defense systems to detect and track. The idea of providing Israel with these weapons has been controversial. </p>
