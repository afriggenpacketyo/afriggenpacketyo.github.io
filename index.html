        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread global tariffs, implemented using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), are an illegal overreach of executive power. The court's decision affirms that the IEEPA does not grant a president the authority to impose taxes or duties, a power that is constitutionally reserved for Congress. The tariffs will remain in effect until mid-October to allow for a potential appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which the Trump administration is expected to pursue. This ruling creates significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade relationships, potentially affecting businesses and ongoing international negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has launched a nationwide crackdown on undocumented immigrants residing in public housing. HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that all Public Housing Authorities have 30 days to conduct an audit to verify the citizenship or eligible immigration status of all residents. The administration states this move is intended to prioritize housing for American citizens, citing that HUD currently serves only one in four eligible families. The directive warns that non-compliant housing programs could face a review of their federal funding, a policy that has drawn both praise from Republicans and skepticism from critics who worry it will divert staff from other essential services.</p>

During his trip, he met with officials from the Treasury and Commerce Departments, as well as the U.S. Trade Representative's office. According to China's commerce ministry, the discussions focused on bilateral economic relations and the implementation of previous agreements reached during trade negotiations. These meetings are part of the preparations for an upcoming fourth round of trade talks, aimed at resolving ongoing economic tensions before a potential visit by President Trump to China.</p>

          <h2>Funding for Iowa Water Pollution Report's Public Outreach Mysteriously Withdrawn</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 11:00:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the completion of a landmark study linking Iowa's water pollution and high cancer rates to agricultural practices, public funding for promoting the report's findings has been quietly eliminated. The comprehensive, two-year study identified the state's powerful farm industry as a significant source of contaminants in drinking water sources for over 600,000 people. Sources involved in the project state that over $400,000, which was earmarked for public awareness campaigns and community meetings, was abruptly "zeroed out" without explanation. This move has raised concerns among environmental advocates that politically influential agricultural interests are attempting to suppress the report's controversial conclusions.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to $1 billion after 39 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner, making it the sixth-largest prize in the game's history. The odds of matching all six numbers to claim the jackpot are approximately 1 in 292.2 million. Winners can choose between a 30-year annuity for the full amount or a lump-sum cash option, which is valued at just under half the advertised prize. All winnings are subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding, with the total federal tax rate likely reaching 37%, in addition to applicable state taxes on lottery prizes.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have uncovered 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, due to receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe, ongoing drought plaguing the country has exposed archaeological sites that were previously submerged. The tombs, which date back to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period, were found in the Khanke region of Duhok province. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has provided a rare opportunity for excavation.

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate who was scheduled to die by firing squad. His attorneys successfully argued that his severe dementia renders him incompetent to be executed, as he cannot understand the reason for his punishment. Menzies has been on death row for 37 years for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. The court's ruling sends the case back to a lower court to re-evaluate his mental fitness, citing a significant question of his competency under the law. This decision aligns with U.S. Supreme Court precedents that prohibit executing individuals who lack a rational understanding of their fate.</p>

The project highlights how, as society becomes more disconnected from genuine nature, it creates illusions to satisfy a craving for it.

          <p>According to a new ranking from The Princeton Review, Princeton University offers the best return on investment (ROI) among private colleges in the United States. Despite a high sticker price, the average student receiving financial aid pays just over $10,500 per year and goes on to earn a median income of over $110,000 a decade after attending. The rankings considered factors like financial aid, cost after aid, and post-graduation earnings. Other top institutions for ROI include Caltech, MIT, and Stanford, many of which have generous "no-loan" financial aid policies that help students graduate with minimal debt.

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a significant position in Rexford Industrial Realty, a REIT specializing in Southern California industrial properties. Rexford's stock has recently traded at a substantial discount to its net asset value, attracting Elliott's attention. The activist firm is known for pushing for changes to improve shareholder value, and its engagement may lead to calls for better corporate governance, improved capital allocation, or even a strategic sale of the company. Given Rexford's premium assets and the consolidation trend in the REIT sector, the company is considered a natural acquisition target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook are part of a broader push that experts warn could undermine the central bank's long-standing political independence. A successful move to install loyalists on the seven-member Board of Governors could grant the administration influence over not just interest rates, but also bank regulation and the stability of the U.S. financial system. While the administration frames its actions as reforming an unpopular institution, critics fear it could lead to the politicization of monetary policy, potentially causing long-term economic damage and eroding the credibility the Fed has built over decades.

The plan includes stopping airdrops and reducing the number of aid trucks as Israel prepares to evacuate hundreds of thousands of residents from Gaza City. Aid organizations have warned that a mass evacuation would worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis, with authorities on food crises having already declared a famine in the area. The announcement has drawn condemnation from the International Committee of the Red Cross, which stated that a safe evacuation is impossible under current conditions.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two civilian workers for allegedly providing false information to the Navy following a major jet fuel spill at the Red Hill storage facility in 2021. The spill contaminated the drinking water for 90,000 people and sickened thousands. The indictment alleges that John Floyd and Nelson Wu misled the Hawaii Department of Health about the quantity of fuel leaked, reporting 1,618 gallons instead of the actual 20,000 gallons. These are the first criminal charges stemming from the incident, which led to the eventual decision to close the aging World War II-era fuel tanks.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies are growing increasingly concerned as far-right extremist groups show a significant interest in using commercially available drones for domestic attacks. Online chatter among these groups frequently discusses how cheap, first-person viewer (FPV) drones are being used in global conflicts and could be adapted for a future insurgency against the U.S. government. Analysts note that extremists are studying the tactics of drug cartels and terrorist groups like ISIS, who use drones for both reconnaissance and offensive operations. The FBI has expressed major concerns about accelerationist neo-Nazi sects, in particular, planning to target critical infrastructure with this technology.</p>
