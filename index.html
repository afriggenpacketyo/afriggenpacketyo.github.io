        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the constitutional requirements for 'due process' in the context of President Trump's deportation policies, explaining that while all non-citizens on U.S. soil are entitled to due process, the specifics vary depending on their circumstances, such as whether they were lawfully admitted, have community ties, or are seeking asylum. The article clarifies that due process does not necessarily mean a trial for every migrant, especially under expedited removal programs for those recently in the country illegally or arriving without valid documents. The article also notes ongoing legal challenges and the Supreme Court's likely involvement in defining the specifics of due process for deportees, with the administration stating it will follow the Supreme Court's guidance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade deal after three years of negotiations, which aims to reduce tariffs and boost trade between the two nations. The agreement will make it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars to India, while also cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports, but it does not include changes to immigration policy. The British government projects that the deal could increase trade by an additional £25.5 billion a year by 2040, with benefits for both UK businesses and consumers. Prime Ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Narendra Modi have hailed the agreement as a landmark achievement that will promote economic growth and job creation. </p>

          <p>This article discusses Palantir's first-quarter earnings report, which met expectations with adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents and revenue of $884 million, exceeding revenue estimates, and the company also raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, despite these positive results, Palantir's shares fell as analysts expressed concerns about a sequential margin decline and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. CEO Alex Karp remained optimistic, citing significant growth in the U.S. commercial and government sectors, attributing it to the increasing adoption of Palantir's AI software, but analysts noted that the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable to compression as revenue growth slows.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster CCTV has released footage of the electromagnetic catapult system in action on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian. The report also indicated that due to the complexity of the launch system, the Fujian would require longer sea trials than China’s other carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, and the crew have undertaken a complete reform in take-off and landing training to master the catapult system. The adoption of the electromagnetic catapult system means that the Fujian’s carrier-based aircraft would take off with full fuel and full ordnance. </p>

          <p>This article examines the impact of President Trump's trade tariffs, which have led to a decline in U.S. exports, particularly affecting the agricultural sector. Ports are experiencing significant decreases in export volumes, with the Port of Portland, Oregon, seeing a 51% drop, and the Port of Tacoma, Washington, a 28% decrease. The decline in exports is linked to a decrease in containerships coming to the U.S., as businesses cancel manufacturing orders. Retailers are urging consumers to buy sooner rather than later, as data suggests that retail inventories may become lean in the coming months. </p>

          <p>This article compares President Trump's second term to Vladimir Putin's rise in Russia, noting that while Trump has adopted similar autocratic measures, he lacks Putin's focus on economic stability. The article argues that Trump's administration has not delegated economic management to specialists, resulting in chaotic policies and a failure to reassure markets and voters. The author contrasts this with Putin's early economic reforms and his ability to maintain stability even during crises, suggesting that Trump's emphasis on cultural grievance and partisan backing may not be enough to sustain his power. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the potential impact of congressional Republicans curtailing or ending Medicaid provider taxes, a move that could save the federal government approximately $600 billion over the next decade. These taxes, used by states to increase federal matching funds for Medicaid, have become a mainstay of financing the program. The change could disproportionately affect Republican-led states, as their Medicaid budgets are more reliant on this strategy. The article provides an interactive graphic explaining how provider taxes work, and discusses potential consequences for states, including cuts to coverage and reduced payments to hospitals. </p>
