          <p>President Donald Trump is attempting to secure $230 million in taxpayer funds from the Justice Department to settle two administrative claims related to investigations into his 2016 campaign's Russia ties and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case. Critics deem this move highly unethical, particularly as two Trump appointees within the DOJ would need to approve the payment, raising significant conflict of interest concerns. Despite the lack of legal guardrails to prevent this, the payment, if approved, may not be publicly disclosed. This situation highlights Trump's history of demanding large sums for perceived grievances.</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted a joint Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation on Canal Street in New York City's Chinatown, leading to vendors fleeing and subsequent protests. City Hall officials, including Mayor Eric Adams, emphasized non-cooperation with federal civil deportation matters and stated that local law enforcement was not involved in the operation. The Mayor's office clarified that NYPD would only intervene if circumstances escalated to assault or interference with a legal law enforcement action. This developing story highlights ongoing tensions between federal immigration enforcement and local sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>A protest outside an asylum seeker hotel in Dublin escalated into violence, with Irish police being attacked with missiles and fireworks, and a police vehicle set on fire. Riot police used a water cannon to disperse several thousand protesters, and arrests are expected. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin condemned the attacks on police, stating there is no justification for such actions. Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan vowed a forceful response, emphasizing that the violence does not represent the local community but rather criminal elements.</p>

          <p>Former Representative George Santos shared details of his 84-day prison experience, describing it as "mentally torturous" and revealing he wrote three suicide notes. Following his sentence commutation, he expressed apologies to constituents and Republican colleagues for betraying their trust, vowing to live honorably moving forward. Santos also recounted a conversation with President Trump, where he expressed a desire to contribute to prison reform and youth programs. He dismissed concerns about potential state-level legal challenges, asserting his case was federal and over-politicized.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder, accused the Trump administration of using immigration court as a "kangaroo court" to re-detain and remove him, following his arrest by ICE agents in March. His attorneys argued before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, challenging the legality of his detention and the government's claim that his presence harms U.S. foreign policy. Khalil, who was released in June by a federal judge, remains confident in federal court, arguing immigration courts are not equipped for constitutional claims. A previous federal ruling found the government violated protesters' rights in similar efforts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's new $250 million White House ballroom project is raising ethics concerns regarding its funding, as the identities of wealthy donors remain largely undisclosed. Legal experts suggest the funding model could amount to "pay-to-play" for access to the administration, despite the White House insisting the renovation is privately funded and will benefit future administrations. YouTube is the only publicly known contributor, settling a lawsuit with Trump for $22 million. Critics argue the expanded space could increase political fundraising opportunities on White House premises, pushing ethical boundaries.</p>

Grijalva, elected in September, has been unable to take office due to the House's extended recess, which her supporters believe is a deliberate tactic to prevent her from signing a petition to release Jeffrey Epstein files. Johnson has dismissed the lawsuit as "patently absurd," citing scheduling issues and House precedent for the delay.

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Donald Trump's reliance on personal chemistry and "gut" instinct in his approach to Chinese leader Xi Jinping could paradoxically serve as a "guard rail" in US-China relations. Despite ongoing trade tensions and harsh rhetoric from some US officials, Trump has reportedly shown restraint in directly antagonizing Xi or challenging Beijing's red lines, such as Taiwan. Experts believe Trump's strong control over his administration, including China hawks, means leader-to-leader diplomacy has become increasingly crucial in shaping ties. However, Xi is seen as a cold-blooded calculator, not easily swayed by charm.</p>

This strategy, likened to the Bush administration's focus on WMDs as a unifying justification for war, is seen by some as a seductive but potentially distracting approach. While Trump's unpopularity offers a short-term rallying point, some Democrats worry that an over-reliance on anti-Trump messaging prevents the party from developing a strong, positive agenda.

          <p>North Carolina Republicans in the state senate have passed a new congressional map designed to shift the state's partisan split from 10-4 to 11-3 in favor of the GOP, targeting a Democratic-held seat. This move, which the Democratic governor cannot veto, is expected to quickly pass the state house. Critics argue it's an attack on bipartisanship and an attempt to further secure Republican control in Congress, particularly after a 2019 Supreme Court ruling allowed partisan gerrymandering. The redrawing raises concerns about representation for impoverished, majority-Black counties.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial regarding the wrongful death of his teammate Tyler Skaggs, who died from an overdose in 2019. Trout stated he loved Skaggs like a brother and never witnessed signs of drug use, though he did observe former communications director Eric Kay acting "wired" and suspected drug use. The lawsuit, brought by Skaggs' family, alleges the Angels were negligent in allowing Kay, an opioid dealer, access to players. Kay was previously convicted of providing the fentanyl-laced pill that caused Skaggs' death.</p>

Defence Secretary John Healey confirmed the UK's participation, emphasizing a supportive role rather than leadership. This deployment follows a fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, with US Vice-President JD Vance reporting better-than-expected implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A column explores the growing concern that modern, software-dependent electric vehicles, much like smartphones, are susceptible to software obsolescence, potentially shortening their usable lifespan. While traditional cars could be maintained for decades, EVs increasingly rely on complex software that may outpace hardware capabilities, leading to slow or buggy performance. Automakers have already shown a willingness to discontinue services for older connected cars, as seen with 3G network shutdowns. This trend challenges the inherent longevity of EVs, suggesting that despite fewer mechanical parts, software updates could dictate when a vehicle becomes practically "a brick."</p>
