          <h2>GM and LG to Produce Lower-Cost EV Batteries at Upgraded Tennessee Plant</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:39:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility to produce lower-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for electric vehicles. This strategic shift aims to significantly reduce EV battery pack expenses, as LFP technology avoids the use of costly minerals like cobalt and nickel. While the company did not disclose the new investment amount, commercial production of the LFP cells is slated to begin by late 2027. This development complements GM's broader strategy of diversifying its battery portfolio, which includes a separate $900 million investment in new battery development labs in Michigan.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the Fed's inspector general to review a contentious building expansion project that has drawn sharp criticism from the White House. The renovation, initially estimated at $2.5 billion, is under fire for significant cost overruns and accusations of mismanagement. Fed officials maintain the project is essential for addressing safety hazards like asbestos and updating the buildings to modern code. The controversy highlights a debate over the central bank's spending and oversight, even though it is not funded by taxpayers.</p>

          <h2>Kosovo War Crimes Convict's Sentence Reduced on Appeal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Hague tribunal has upheld the war crimes conviction of former Kosovo Liberation Army member Pjeter Shala but reduced his prison sentence from 18 to 13 years. Shala was found guilty of torture, murder, and arbitrary detention during the 1998-99 Kosovo uprising. The appeals judges reversed some convictions while confirming others, determining the original sentence was disproportionate to comparable cases. The court noted the reduction does not diminish the gravity of his crimes, which included acts of "particular cruelty" against detainees considered to be collaborators.</p>

This trend is driven by a combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand.

Alongside the tariff threat, Trump revealed a deal to sell U.S.-manufactured weapons to NATO allies, who will then provide their own stockpiles to Ukraine.

          <p>A new provision in the federal spending bill is anticipated to fuel a surge in private jet sales by reinstating "bonus depreciation." This allows businesses to write off 100% of a new or used jet's purchase price in the first year, a benefit that applies to planes used for business purposes. Aviation brokers report a subsequent burst of client activity, as the tax incentive comes at a time when the private jet market has been cooling from its post-pandemic highs. While the change makes purchases more attractive, experts suggest the main rush to buy will likely occur in the fall as companies finalize their annual tax strategies.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Downplays U.S. Concerns Over China's Military Use of AI Chips</h2>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed U.S. government fears that the company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military. In a recent interview, Huang argued that China cannot rely on American technology because access could be restricted at any time, and that the country already possesses sufficient computing capacity for its military needs. He reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to the goal of making American technology the global standard. The comments come as Huang navigates a delicate geopolitical balance between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece argues that despite decades of promises and the recent AI boom, fundamental interactions with personal computers remain frustratingly unintuitive. The author recounts failures with Apple's new AI-powered Siri, which struggled with simple, context-based commands like finding files or photos on the user's own device. The article reflects on the long-held vision of a seamless, conversational computer interface, first conceptualized by Apple in the 1980s, and questions why this goal remains so elusive. It concludes that if AI cannot even make our personal devices work effectively, its potential to revolutionize everything else seems doubtful.</p>

          <p>England's second-place finish in their Euro 2025 group has sparked debate over whether it provides them with a more favorable path in the knockout stages. By not finishing first, the Lionesses will face Sweden in the quarter-finals instead of eight-time champions Germany, and they also avoid a potential semi-final clash with powerhouse Spain. While Sweden is a formidable opponent, some analysts believe this draw is strategically better for England. However, the team now has less recovery time, playing their quarter-final on Thursday instead of Saturday, adding a layer of complexity to their championship pursuit.</p>

The Dragon Bravo Fire exhibited extreme behavior, fueled by high winds, and also damaged a water treatment facility, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighters to evacuate. While all guests and employees were safely evacuated, the loss of the iconic 1930s lodge is a devastating blow to the park's history.

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a resident has died from pneumonic plague, a severe and rare lung infection. This is the first such death in the county in 18 years, though officials state it is unrelated to a recent, potentially plague-related die-off of prairie dogs in the area. Pneumonic plague is caused by the same bacterium as bubonic plague but can be spread through airborne droplets. While the risk of human-to-human transmission is considered low, authorities have issued guidelines for avoiding contact with wild rodents and their habitats.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of women senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act" to address a significant safety disparity in vehicle crash testing. Federal data shows women are 73% more likely to suffer serious injuries and 17% more likely to be killed in a crash than men. The legislation aims to update federal standards by requiring the use of advanced crash test dummies that better reflect the public, including one simulating a smaller woman. Proponents argue this will provide crucial data to design safer cars, as current dummies are based on the size of an average 1990s man.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing a significant political crisis within his governing coalition after a parliamentary vote to elect three new Constitutional Court judges was abruptly canceled. The failure was due to a lack of support from within his own conservative bloc for one of the candidates, exposing deep divisions and questioning Merz's control over his party. The incident, unprecedented in modern German history, has damaged the coalition's stability and prompted warnings from Germany's president about endangering the rule of law. The turmoil comes as the government faces major pending reforms and new economic pressures.</p>

          <p>China's customs data for June shows that its overall exports accelerated, but shipments to the United States fell by 16% compared to the previous year. This decline occurred despite a temporary reprieve on U.S. tariffs that prompted some American companies to rush orders ahead of a potential August deadline for new duties. While global trade remained strong, with exports to Southeast Asia and Europe growing, the ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. continue to impact bilateral commerce. Analysts expect that high tariffs and other constraints will likely slow China's export growth in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the right certificate of deposit (CD) term. With short-term CD rates currently higher than many long-term options, some experts suggest sticking with shorter terms for flexibility. Others argue that locking in a competitive long-term rate now could be advantageous before rates fall. For those unsure, building a CD ladder with staggered maturity dates is recommended as a strategy to balance access to funds with securing higher long-term yields. (not investment advice)</p>

While highly effective against these targets, it is less so against smaller, low-flying drones. The system has a range of over 100 miles and requires about 90 troops to operate.
