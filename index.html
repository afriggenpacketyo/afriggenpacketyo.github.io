          <p>A Boston-based gastroenterologist recommends eating two kiwis daily to improve gut health and digestion. The fruit contains high levels of fiber and a unique enzyme called actinidin, which aids in breaking down proteins. Recent studies suggest kiwis can be more effective than other remedies for constipation and may also help reduce the risk of certain cancers and heart disease. The doctor emphasizes incorporating them into a balanced diet for overall wellness.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which were set to begin Monday. This decision provides a window until August 1st for negotiations after President Trump threatened new 30% tariffs on EU products. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated a preference for a negotiated solution but confirmed the EU is prepared to implement countermeasures if talks fail. The ongoing trade dispute creates uncertainty for the massive €1.7 trillion EU-U.S. trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Rand Paul detailed findings from his committee's report on the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, calling it a "cascade of errors." He claims the Secret Service repeatedly denied requests for enhanced security, including counter-snipers, prior to the event. Paul accuses the former Secret Service director of providing false testimony to Congress and suggests a "cultural cover-up" within the agency to avoid accountability.

This comment comes amid escalating criticism from the administration, which is scrutinizing a $700 million cost overrun on a Fed renovation project as potential grounds for removal. The administration's actions suggest it may be building a case to replace Powell, a frequent target of Trump's criticism, before his term expires. This creates significant uncertainty around the leadership and independence of the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

While the president focuses on deporting "the worst of the worst," the latest ICE statistics show that over 71% of currently detained individuals have no criminal convictions. Of those with convictions, a small fraction have committed high-level violent crimes. This data challenges the administration's claims that its mass deportation program is primarily targeting dangerous criminals to protect public safety.</p>

          <p>A Spanish government official has stated that recent anti-migrant violence in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco was fueled by far-right groups using social media. The disturbances, which resulted in five minor injuries and one arrest, saw groups armed with batons clashing with migrants. The unrest followed an assault on an elderly man, which was filmed and used online to incite a "hunt for migrants." Authorities are investigating possible hate crimes and have appealed for calm in the town, where migrants constitute a significant portion of the population.</p>

          <p>Amid geopolitical tensions with China, the U.S. is increasingly looking toward recycling electronic waste (e-waste) as a domestic source for rare earth metals and other critical materials. Next-generation recyclers are developing innovative ways to extract valuable elements like neodymium, copper, and gold from discarded electronics such as laptops, phones, and EV batteries. This "urban mining" strategy is gaining strategic importance as a way to build more resilient supply chains and reduce dependence on foreign producers. The trend is bolstered by unpredictable trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, Beijing will be closely watching Taiwan's large-scale military exercises. China's response is likely to be calibrated based on the perceived nature and intent of the drills. While Beijing typically responds to such actions with its own military posturing and strong rhetoric, the specifics will depend on whether it views the exercises as routine defense preparation or a provocative change in Taiwan's strategic posture. The situation highlights the delicate and tense security dynamic in the Taiwan Strait.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has implemented significant security upgrades, including a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts. These new assets are designed to prevent a repeat of the failures that occurred, such as missing a drone flown by the shooter and lacking direct radio communication with local police. The mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, will ensure consolidated communications at protected events. These changes represent a major technological and procedural overhaul for the agency.</p>

His firm stance contrasts with calls for calm from other European leaders, highlighting potential divisions within the bloc on how to handle the escalating trade dispute with the United States.</p>

          <p>Experts are actively debunking a conspiracy theory that claims the deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding, a weather modification technique to increase precipitation. This false narrative, which has been amplified by some politicians, is described as not only untrue but also actively harmful because it erodes public trust in science and government during a crisis. Scientists emphasize that the scale and intensity of the flooding are consistent with climate change patterns, not weather modification. The spread of such misinformation complicates disaster response and public understanding of climate events.</p>

          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she pointed to a new £25 million package for councils to install cross-pavement charging gullies for homes without driveways. The move aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which remains a significant barrier to adoption for many motorists. The government is under pressure to boost sales to meet its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.</p>
