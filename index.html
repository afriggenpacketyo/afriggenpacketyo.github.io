          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that the Supreme Court is increasingly enabling President Trump to consolidate power within the executive branch. The author, Kate Shaw, highlights a recent Supreme Court order that effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent, granting the president considerable new authority without full briefing or argument. Shaw contends that this decision, along with others regarding presidential immunity, risks undermining the rule of law and emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional boundaries. She warns that the court's actions could ultimately make it too late to check presidential overreach. </p>

          <p>Five skiers were found dead on the Adler Glacier near Zermatt, Switzerland, after two hikers reported seeing abandoned skis. Authorities are working to identify the victims and their nationalities, and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the accident, with weather conditions and avalanche activity being examined. Separately, an avalanche near Kandersteg, also in Switzerland, killed a 29-year-old Swiss citizen and left two others with minor injuries. These incidents highlight the dangers of high-altitude skiing, especially with varying weather conditions. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cindy McCain, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, stated that the current level of aid entering Gaza is drastically insufficient to address the widespread food insecurity and potential famine. She noted that while 600 trucks of aid were entering Gaza daily during a previous ceasefire, only about 100 trucks are currently being allowed in. McCain disputed claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it instead to the desperation of starving people. The ongoing conflict and restrictions on aid access have created a dire humanitarian crisis for the 2.3 million Palestinians living in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing deportation. The officer, Leslie O'Neal, initially pulled Arias-Cristobal over for a traffic violation that was later dropped, but local authorities then contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) due to her immigration status. Arias-Cristobal's arrest garnered national attention, with some advocating for her release and others demanding her deportation. The incident has also highlighted the controversy surrounding 287(g) contracts, which deputize local law enforcement to carry out immigration enforcement, and a new Georgia law requiring local law enforcement to apply for such contracts.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from Fox News argues that Democrats need to focus on persuasion and finding common ground with a broader range of Americans, rather than solely relying on left-wing media. The author, chief of staff to Congressman Ro Khanna, recounts how Khanna engaged in productive dialogue with conservative media host Glenn Beck despite disagreements. The piece advocates for Democrats to be fearless in reaching voters where they are, tailoring their message without compromising their values, and balancing viral moments with nuanced messages about complex issues. The author suggests that Democrats should aim to persuade figures like Joe Rogan, who has drifted away from supporting Democratic candidates. </p>

Parsons objected to President Trump's use of a Make America Great Again hat during his address to graduating cadets, viewing it as a blurring of the lines between the office of the presidency and personal politics. Parsons also stated that West Point began censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology, making his position professionally untenable.

However, the city council is divided on the future of the square, with some members and business owners preferring a flexible open street plan to increase traffic and revive local businesses.

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuel projects at the G7 summit, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas production, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. This contradicts Japan's leadership in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which aims to promote net-zero emissions in Asia. While Japan promotes LNG as a "transitional fuel," studies suggest it involves more emissions than coal when considering processing and shipping.

          <p>A parenting expert proposes a new framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach emphasizes accepting a child's emotions without judgment, responding without shaming, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents focus on their own inner healing to become less reactive and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. The article suggests practical steps for parents to implement this style, including reflecting on their own childhood triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame during conflicts.</p>

          <p>Across the United States, communities are remembering George Floyd on the fifth anniversary of his death, which sparked widespread protests against racism and police brutality. Events are being held in Houston, where Floyd grew up, and Minneapolis, where he was murdered. These commemorations occur amid concerns that the national "reckoning" with racism is fading, particularly as President Trump begins to roll back police reforms. The anniversary serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for police accountability and racial justice, despite the shifting political landscape. </p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed at least seven children of a Palestinian doctor, Alaa al-Najjar, according to Gaza health officials and family members. Two more children are missing and presumed dead, while the doctor's husband is in critical condition with severe brain injuries. The Israeli military stated that it had struck a number of suspects in a structure near Israeli forces but was checking if "uninvolved civilians were harmed." This incident highlights the ongoing conflict's devastating impact on civilians, particularly children, in Gaza. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has alleged that the "silence" from the U.S. following recent Russian attacks is encouraging President Vladimir Putin. This statement comes after Moscow launched one of its largest aerial attacks, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries across Ukraine. Zelensky is calling for stronger pressure on the Russian leadership to halt the violence, particularly through further sanctions. He argues that the world's focus on other matters allows Russia to continue its offensive with impunity, requiring a more assertive stance from the U.S. to bring about a ceasefire. </p>
