Salt Lake City approved flags with Pride, transgender Pride, and Juneteenth symbols, while Boise designated the rainbow Pride flag and a flag promoting organ donation as official. These actions are viewed as a response to state measures perceived as targeting L.G.B.T.Q. flags, with city officials emphasizing values of diversity and inclusion.

          <p>Republican lawmakers are re-introducing the "SAFE Home Act" to prevent federally funded agencies from discriminating against potential adoptive parents who object to gender-affirming treatments for children. The bill aims to ensure parents are not required to provide medical, surgical, or psychological treatments related to gender identity. This legislation is partly a response to a Biden-era HHS rule promoting homes that affirm a child's sexual orientation or gender identity. The act seeks to protect the rights of parents to raise children according to their beliefs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the Picasso Museum in Paris, titled “Degenerate Art: Modern Art on Trial Under the Nazis,” showcases artworks that were despised by Hitler and the Third Reich. The exhibit highlights the Nazi regime's campaign against modern art, deeming it “degenerate” and created by “idiots,” “criminals,” and “Jews.” The exhibit's themes include “Race and Purity,” “Purging German Museums,” and “Trade in Degenerate Art.” The article draws parallels to contemporary political climates, noting President Trump's efforts to end “woke” art in taxpayer-funded programs.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has stepped back into the public spotlight with criticism of President Trump's handling of foreign policy. In an interview with the BBC, Biden attacked Trump's management of the war in Ukraine and his dealings with global allies, describing some actions as “beneath America.” Biden also defended his decision to seek re-election despite polling showing many Democrats preferred a different candidate. The interview is part of a broader public re-emergence for Biden, who has kept a relatively low profile since leaving office.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are aiming to pass a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political standing, but the strategy faces challenges. The bill, centered on extending the 2017 tax law, is unlikely to offset the economic damage caused by President Trump's tariffs. While the extension of tax cuts is aimed at calming markets, the tariffs are raising costs and battering markets. The article suggests that congressional leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy to improve the economic outlook for Republicans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate dozens of National Park Service grants, including those related to climate change and diversity, equity, and inclusion (D.E.I.). An internal agency document reveals that the cuts could save $26 million by canceling grants to universities, state historic preservation offices, tribes, and youth corps. The stated reason for eliminating climate change-related programs is “Climate change/Sustainability,” while D.E.I. initiatives are targeted due to the administration's opposition to such programs. Critics argue the cuts would sacrifice knowledge and expertise for minimal savings.</p>

The decision requires the administration to comply within a week, allowing Öztürk to continue her immigration detention in Vermont while a judge decides whether to release her on bail. The Department of Homeland Security has accused her of engaging "in activities in support of Hamas" after she criticized the school for its handling of resolutions related to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

Following the April 22 terrorist attack, the image of a widowed woman, Himanshi Narwal, sitting by her dead husband, went viral, making her a symbol of the tragedy.</p>
