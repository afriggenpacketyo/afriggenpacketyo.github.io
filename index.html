          <p>Following a social media post by Donald Trump claiming Coca-Cola agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its U.S. products, shares of producer Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) dropped significantly. While Coca-Cola's public response remained noncommittal, appreciating the enthusiasm and teasing future innovative offerings, the announcement sparked immediate market reactions. The Corn Refiners Association issued a statement warning about potential job losses and an increased reliance on foreign sugar imports if such a change were implemented. This event aligns with the administration's broader push for reformulating food products with what it deems healthier ingredients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. The vote proceeded along party lines after a chaotic meeting where Democrats walked out in protest, accusing Republicans of rushing the nomination and refusing to hear testimony from a Justice Department whistleblower. Bove's nomination has been contentious due to his past work and allegations of unethical conduct, including pushing for a quid pro quo involving New York City's mayor. His confirmation by the full Senate remains uncertain, as he faces staunch opposition.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Significant and Persistent Wage Gap for Migrants in Germany</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 10:49:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study published in the journal Nature reveals that first-generation migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than their native-born counterparts. Researchers found this disparity is not due to unequal pay for the same job but rather to structural barriers limiting migrants' access to higher-paying industries and roles. The wage gap persists into the second generation, which still earns 7.7% less on average, a figure higher than in comparable Western nations. The report highlights the need for better language support, recognition of foreign qualifications, and expanded professional networks to foster true economic integration.</p>

          <p>Former chairs of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are raising alarms over the Trump administration's executive orders aimed at quadrupling U.S. nuclear power by 2050. They argue that the push to slash regulations and expedite plant approvals threatens the independence of the NRC, which is crucial for public safety. The former officials contend that the administration wrongly blames the regulator for the industry's slow growth, which they attribute to high construction costs rather than excessive caution. They warn that compromising the NRC's autonomy could increase the risk of a nuclear accident, drawing parallels to the Fukushima disaster in Japan.</p>

          <p>James Clapper, a former Director of National Intelligence under the Obama administration, was barred from attending the graduation of a CIA bomb-sniffing dog he had sponsored and named after his late wife. The decision reportedly stemmed from a Trump executive order that stripped security clearances from Clapper and other former officials who criticized the president. This article presents the incident as a petty yet illustrative example of the administration's focus on personal and political retribution against perceived 'deep state' enemies. Despite the event being unclassified, Clapper was denied entry, highlighting the extent of the administration's punitive measures against its critics.</p>

With inflation remaining persistent and a recent strong jobs report, the consensus is that the Fed will hold its key interest rate steady, giving it little reason to cut rates this month. Since home equity loan rates are closely tied to the federal funds rate, significant reductions are not anticipated until the central bank signals a clear shift in policy.

          <p>Connie Francis, a prominent female recording artist of the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 87. Her career, which included hits like "Stupid Cupid" and "Lipstick On Your Collar," recently saw a revival when her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" went viral on TikTok. Francis's life was marked by both immense success and significant personal tragedy, including a violent sexual assault in 1974 that led to a long period of reclusion and mental health struggles. She later became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and mental health awareness, resuming her career and performing for decades.</p>

This experiment is reportedly the first of its kind to use a highly integrated chip containing living human brain cells, immune cells, and a capillary network that mimics the blood-brain barrier. The research aims to understand and ultimately prevent cognitive issues experienced by astronauts during long-duration missions, such as dizziness and sleep problems. Scientists believe the three-dimensional model will provide more human-like data than previous experiments, advancing space medicine and neuroscience.</p>

          <p>Iran has intensified its long-standing policy of deporting Afghan migrants, expelling hundreds of thousands in recent months and separating thousands of children from their parents. The government is justifying the crackdown with unsubstantiated claims that Afghans assisted in recent Israeli military operations, a move widely seen as a cynical ploy to deflect from its own security failures. This mass deportation is occurring amid rising anti-immigrant sentiment in Iran, which is shared across the political spectrum. The policy is particularly devastating for Afghan women and girls, who are being sent back to a country under the oppressive rule of the Taliban.</p>

In a CNBC interview, Warsh criticized the current Fed's hesitancy to cut interest rates and suggested the need for a new accord between the Fed and the Treasury Department to manage the national debt, similar to the one established in 1951. His comments align with President Trump's public pressure on the Fed to lower rates and his criticism of current Chair Jerome Powell. Warsh's remarks signal a potential major shift in monetary policy and Fed independence if he were appointed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer advocates are expressing concern that the Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system will leave many borrowers without affordable repayment options. The Biden-era SAVE plan is now defunct, and a new bill is phasing out several other income-driven repayment plans, replacing them with a single, less generous option called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Experts calculate that monthly payments under RAP could be more than double what they were under SAVE for the same income level. This shift is expected to increase financial stress and the risk of default for millions of borrowers who relied on the more lenient terms.</p>

This approach is seen as business-friendly, with official memos emphasizing the need to avoid hindering innovation and risk-taking. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue this leniency on corporate criminals contrasts sharply with the administration's tough-on-crime rhetoric concerning immigrants and political opponents, creating a double standard in law enforcement.</p>
