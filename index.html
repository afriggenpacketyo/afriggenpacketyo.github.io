Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba also pledged continued support for Ukraine to achieve lasting peace, offering to host an international conference on landmines in October. Japan's trade deficit in May was 637.6 billion yen, with exports falling 1.7 percent and imports declining 7.7 percent. The activities of two Chinese aircraft carriers in the Pacific have been closely monitored, with a total of 520 landing and takeoff drills observed.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials indicated that the next 24 to 48 hours would be crucial in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible or if President Trump might resort to military action. Despite apparent saber-rattling, U.S. negotiators continued to assess that Iran is in a weak position and could be forced to return to the negotiating table and ultimately accept a deal that would require it abandon all nuclear enrichment. The U.S. military is already sending assets toward the region, including additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier and its strike group to the Middle East -- all moves that are defensive in nature, officials say. The situation remains fluid, with the potential for military action if diplomatic efforts fail.</p>

          <p>The leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) major democracies convened in Canada and unveiled an action plan to mitigate risks to their supply chains for critical minerals, essential for modern technologies, in response to China's dominance in the rare earth minerals market. The plan encompasses monitoring shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, manufacturing, and recycling. Six of the G7 leaders also reaffirmed their support for Ukraine as Russia continues its attacks and rejects cease-fire proposals, with Japan pledging continued assistance for a lasting peace and raising concerns about Russia's deepening ties with North Korea. (not investment advice) The leaders also addressed the global economy and the Israel-Iran conflict, emphasizing de-escalation and backing Israel's security. The situation in Ukraine and other key topics were addressed in this meeting, underlining the importance of international cooperation. The leaders are seeking to create a more stable global economy through their cooperation. The optimism score is self-contained and separate from this summary.</p>

          <p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather events are prompting significant shifts in holiday planning, with 81% of Europeans altering their travel arrangements due to climate change. Many are opting for destinations with milder weather or traveling during cooler months, leading to potential changes in the traditional "high season" for Mediterranean resorts. Destinations are adapting by investing in year-round tourism and offering indoor activities, while some regions are introducing climate crisis resilience taxes to support rebuilding efforts after climate-related disasters. The trend is also driving increased interest in staycations and less traditional European destinations like Scandinavia, as travelers seek alternatives to the increasingly hot Mediterranean summers. This article explores the changing trends in the travel industry and how the industry is adapting.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced a 1.7% year-over-year decline in May, the steepest drop since September 2024, influenced by trade uncertainties and a significant 11.1% decrease in exports to the U.S. The fall in exports was primarily driven by a 6.9% drop in global automobile exports, with a notable 24.7% plunge in motor vehicle exports to the U.S. The Bank of Japan acknowledged that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade-related factors, contributing to a 0.2% contraction in Japan's GDP in the quarter ending March. (not investment advice) Despite these challenges, Japan's trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, and the government is closely monitoring the situation amid ongoing trade talks with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based bioscience company with no revenue, has seen its stock surge by 59,000% this year, giving it a market value exceeding that of Lululemon, eBay, and Kraft Heinz. The company, which develops traditional Chinese herb treatments for childhood ADHD and autism, recently underwent a 38-for-1 stock split, purportedly to enhance liquidity. The surge also coincides with increased interest in alternative medicines following Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s appointment as Secretary of Health and Human Services. However, Regencell's business model relies on a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, and it has yet to generate revenue or file for regulatory approvals, prompting skepticism among investors and online communities.

          <p>Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier was found in civil contempt of court for challenging a federal judge's block on a new state law criminalizing illegal entry into Florida. The judge ruled that Uthmeier violated a temporary restraining order by sending a letter to law enforcement suggesting they were not restricted from enforcing the law. As a result, Uthmeier is required to file bi-weekly reports detailing arrests made under the law, starting July 1. The attorney general defended his actions, stating that he was standing behind President Trump's agenda on illegal immigration. This ruling underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration enforcement at the state level.</p>

President Trump initially appeared to respond by suggesting changes to immigration policies, but subsequent reversals have left farmers unsure of the administration's stance. Despite the uncertainty, workers have largely continued to show up for work, and employers are seeking guidance on how to protect their employees, highlighting an unusual alliance between farmers and worker advocates.</p>

          <p>Meta has expressed concern over Iranian state television's call for citizens to stop using WhatsApp, alleging it is being used by Israel to target individuals. WhatsApp refuted these claims, emphasizing its end-to-end encryption and commitment to user privacy.

This situation highlights the ongoing tension between autocratic governments and access to information, particularly during times of unrest and international conflict.</p>

An additional 46 projects representing 9GW were in the planning stages, it added.
