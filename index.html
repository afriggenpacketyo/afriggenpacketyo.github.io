          <p>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is under scrutiny for altering the demographic classifications on the Executive Yuan's website, categorizing Han Chinese, the majority population, as "other population." This change is perceived as an effort to distance Taiwan from mainland China and promote a distinct Taiwanese identity. The move has sparked criticism from the KMT, who view it as a denial of history and an attempt to erode cultural ties with the mainland. The revised web page now lists the population as 2.6% indigenous, 1.2% foreign, and 96.2% "other population.</p>

Yao suggests that a deal is likely, with potential terms involving a rollback of tariffs to around 34%. He notes growing recognition in the US that the trade war is not a viable solution, pointing to weak economic data and instability in the dollar. Yao also mentions potential US demands in negotiations, such as China buying more American goods like farm products and Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal healthcare system, celebrated for its affordability and support of a long-lived population, is facing strain due to a shrinking workforce and an aging demographic. Political maneuvering ahead of key elections is further complicating the system's future. The government's plan to secure funds for child-rearing by cutting medical system savings has sparked opposition, with concerns raised about the impact on patients facing high medical costs. Analysts warn that politicizing the healthcare system could undermine its stability and public trust, emphasizing the need for a measured, long-term debate.</p>

          <p>The United States has suspended all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to concerns over the spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the importance of protecting animals and the nation's food supply. The USDA said cases have surged in parts of Central America and are now being detected in some "remote farms" in Mexico about 700 miles from the U.S border. The ban will continue on a "month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved," according to the USDA.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, despite research indicating that Zepbound results in more weight loss. This decision exemplifies how insurance limits can disrupt patient treatments, as thousands of Americans will be forced to switch to a less effective drug. The move stems from secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, which prioritize lower drug prices for employers while restricting treatment options for employees. Doctors express concern about the reduced ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions to individual needs, noting that both drugs are effective but have varying results for different patients.</p>

Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, flips two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy, also known as semaglutide, mimics only one hormone released by the body after a meal. Researchers suggest that both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those with more weight to lose.</p>

Automatic settlement and citizenship after five years will end, requiring a ten-year wait.

The digital bridge circumvents the injury by sending signals wirelessly from the brain to the intact part of the spinal cord. This technology shows promise in restoring not only mobility but also critical functions like bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. Spinal cord stimulators may also help people with Parkinson's Disease regain mobility.</p>
