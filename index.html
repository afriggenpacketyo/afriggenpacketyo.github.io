          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist with permanent US residency, was released from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody after being detained during an American citizenship interview in Vermont. Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered his release on bail, challenging the detention. Mahdawi's lawyer, Luna Droubi, called the claims against him baseless and a disgrace to the US Constitution, while Mahdawi thanked supporters and expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people. Several politicians, including Senator Bernie Sanders, advocated for his release, highlighting concerns about the detention of students involved in protests against the war.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to establish a joint investment fund that will grant the U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral reserves. The deal, intended to signal the Trump administration's commitment to Ukraine's long-term peace and prosperity, will allow the U.S. to share future revenues from Ukraine's mineral resources. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that no entity that financed Russia's war efforts would benefit from Ukraine's reconstruction. The agreement comes after contentious negotiations and aims to give President Trump a personal stake in Ukraine's stability, although it doesn't include explicit guarantees of future U.S. security assistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted in favor of preliminary rent increases for nearly one million rent-stabilized apartments, citing rising landlord costs. The proposed increases range from 1.75 to 4.75 percent for one-year leases and 4.75 to 7.75 percent for two-year leases. Tenant advocates protested the increases, arguing they would exacerbate the housing crisis, while landlords claimed the adjustments were insufficient. Mayor Adams acknowledged the need to balance protecting rent-stabilized homes with avoiding infeasible rent increases for tenants, as the board's decision reflects the priorities of the current administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump insisted that a man his administration deported to El Salvador had an MS-13 tattoo on his hand, despite evidence showing the photo was altered. During an interview, Trump refused to acknowledge that the alphanumeric term "MS13" had been superimposed onto the photo, even when corrected by the interviewer. The White House defended Trump's assertion, maintaining that the man's tattoos were gang insignia, amid increasing scrutiny over the administration's handling of the case. This incident highlights the administration's public relations efforts to portray the deportee as a criminal, despite conflicting evidence and court rulings.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators concluded a controlled fire test in Pacific Palisades as part of the ongoing investigation into the January wildfire that caused significant damage. The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) conducted the test along the Temescal Ridge Trail to determine the fire's origin and how it spread during high winds. Investigators are considering whether the blaze was a re-ignition of an earlier fire sparked by fireworks or a new ignition event, with human activity being a likely cause. Some homeowners have sued the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, alleging inadequate preparation and response to the wildfire.</p>

          <p>Former Colorado football players are speaking out against the program's decision to retire Travis Hunter's and Shedeur Sanders' jerseys, citing a lack of established process and criteria. Michael Jones criticized the university for not having a formal jersey retirement process, while Darian Hagan expressed shock that the decision was at the discretion of the athletic director and head coach. Both Sanders and Hunter played their final game in a Colorado uniform in late December in the Alamo Bowl. The former players are concerned that the retirements effectively erase the football legacy of the program.</p>

          <p>A Senate effort to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs failed, with Republicans largely opposing the measure. The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden and Republican Sen. Rand Paul, aimed to terminate the national emergency used to impose the tariffs. The vote highlighted anxieties over the potential economic disruption caused by the tariffs. House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested Congress should not intervene so early in the administration's tariff policy, while acknowledging the executive branch's broad authority on trade. The tariffs are impacting economic growth, as indicated by a slowdown in the first quarter GDP.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas hospitality workers are still waiting for President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on tips to materialize. Despite two bills in Congress aiming to address the issue, no legislation has been enacted 100 days into Trump's second term.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggests revenue from tariffs could fund the plan, but bipartisan support is needed.

          <p>Robert “Bobby” Lozoff, the creator of the modern Tequila Sunrise cocktail, has died at the age of 77. Lozoff, a longtime bartender at The Trident in Sausalito, California, is credited with concocting the drink in the 1970s. He famously served the drink to a member of the Rolling Stones in 1972, who popularized it during their tour. Lozoff's version of the Tequila Sunrise, made with tequila, orange juice, and grenadine, became the ubiquitous recipe, replacing an earlier version made with créme de cassis.</p>

Finance chief Susan Li said that "Asia-based e-commerce exporters" have reduced their spending with the social media company, likely due to the impending closure of a trade loophole. Trump signed an executive order to end the de minimis trade exemptions for Chinese imports, which benefited online retailers like Temu and Shein.

The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Trump's tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy. Some economists are raising the chances of a recession in 2025. The increase in imports and a decline in government spending impacted growth. The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned.</p>
