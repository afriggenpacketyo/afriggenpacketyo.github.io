The bill emphasizes strengthening the common ideological foundation of ethnic unity under the leadership of the Communist Party, representing a significant step in the country's ongoing ethnic integration drive.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook while her lawsuit challenging the termination proceeds.

This legal intervention marks a significant development, as it represents the first time a president has attempted to remove a member of the Federal Reserve Board, an institution designed to operate with political independence.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) fell by 0.4% in August from the previous year, a larger decline than economists had anticipated, highlighting ongoing deflationary challenges. Concurrently, the producer price index (PPI) dropped by 2.9%, marking a persistent contraction in factory-gate prices as weak domestic demand continues to impact the economy. These figures are increasing calls for Beijing to implement stronger fiscal support measures to stimulate sluggish domestic demand and counteract weakening export growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the backlash and challenges from her rivals, Lyles, the city's first Black female mayor, will now face a Republican challenger in the general election for leadership of the Democrat-leaning city.</p>

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following massive, youth-led protests against government corruption that were initially sparked by a temporary ban on popular social media platforms. The demonstrations, largely organized by Gen Z activists, turned violent, resulting in at least 22 deaths and significant damage to government buildings in Kathmandu. With the prime minister's departure, the country faces political uncertainty as the military has signaled its readiness to control the unrest if it continues.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has issued a major downward revision, indicating the U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially reported. This annual benchmark revision suggests that the labor market was cooling more significantly last year than was previously understood. The data strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates to support the economy, as it points to less momentum in job growth heading into the current year.

          <p>The METRO bus system in Akron, Ohio, received the national mass transit system of the year award after a major overhaul led to a 24% increase in ridership. Under the leadership of CEO Dawn Distler, a former driver, the agency redesigned its routes, increased bus frequency to every 15 minutes, and began seven-day-a-week service based on direct feedback from passengers. By prioritizing the needs of its riders and implementing practical changes without a budget increase, Akron's transit system has become a model for effective public transportation.</p>

The policy shift aims to prevent young Ukrainians from losing their connection to the country and addresses concerns about a brain drain, though it also comes amid ongoing discussions about military manpower needs.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions without a PIN. If approved, banks and card providers would be able to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the growing popularity of tap-to-pay technology, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA insists that providers would implement risk-based controls and consumers would remain protected.</p>

Currently, only one of China's three major mobile carriers supports eSIMs, and regulators may require more time to approve and encourage broader adoption of the standard. This regulatory hurdle could create a temporary competitive advantage for domestic phone manufacturers in one of Apple's most important markets, as none currently use the technology.</p>

Critics argue Erdoğan is weaponizing the courts to eliminate rivals and consolidate power, turning Turkey towards a more autocratic style of governance while the international community remains largely silent.</p>

Residents and activists fear these spaces could be used to interrogate dissidents, and the lawyer contends that planning permission cannot be lawfully granted without full transparency due to security and safety implications.</p>
