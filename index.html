          <h2>Review Proposes Early Release for Violent Offenders to Ease Prison Overcrowding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 01:00:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A landmark independent sentencing review in the UK suggests releasing violent offenders, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, after serving just a third of their sentence. The review, chaired by former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, aims to alleviate dangerous prison overcrowding by managing more offenders in the community. The proposals also include shorter custodial sentences for less serious crimes, increased use of suspended sentences, and greater funding for the Probation Service and electronic monitoring. Concerns are raised by probation officers about the strain on the already stretched system. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses how South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy is often misunderstood, particularly by figures like Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump. The author, Richard Poplak, argues that claims of systemic discrimination and violence against white South Africans are false and are used to push a narrative of reverse racism. Poplak contends that while South Africa faces significant issues like inequality, violence, and corruption, the white minority continues to benefit from apartheid's economic legacy. The essay critiques the exploitation of this narrative by right-wing Afrikaners within MAGA circles and highlights the complexities of South Africa's ongoing transformation. </p>

          <p>Lawyers for Bryan Kohberger, accused of murdering four University of Idaho students, are requesting a trial postponement, citing a recent NBC "Dateline" special as prejudicial. The defense argues the program presented new information, including surveillance footage, and suggests some aired information was nonpublic, potentially tainting the jury pool. Concerns are also raised about an upcoming book on the case, further fueling the need for additional time to investigate leaks and mitigate the effects of pretrial publicity. A forensic expert noted the difficulty of finding an impartial jury in Ada County, Idaho, due to public opinions formed by media coverage. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans plan to vote to revoke three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling "the nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including a mandate for all new vehicle sales to be zero emissions by 2035. Republicans argue they have the right to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend it is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The California Air Resources Board claims the state has never had a waiver revoked and will sue if Congress proceeds with the action. </p>

          <p>Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng saw its shares in Hong Kong surge over 10% following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The Guangzhou-based carmaker's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales. Xpeng said it delivered 94,008 vehicles in the first three months this year, more than four times the sales volume a year earlier. Analysts expect Xpeng will likely turn profitable in the fourth quarter this year, thanks to its strong sales momentum and pipeline of new models.  (not investment advice)</p>
