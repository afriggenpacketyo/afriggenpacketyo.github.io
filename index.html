          <p>The People's Liberation Army (PLA) disclosed that Chinese helicopters had 11 close encounters with a foreign navy over ten days in the East China Sea, with aircraft coming within 10 meters of each other. The PLA did not specify the time, location, or the identity of the foreign force, but the report highlighted rising tensions in the region's airspace and sea. Chinese aircraft and naval warships have increasingly engaged in close encounters with foreign counterparts in recent years, raising concerns about potentially dangerous situations. The PLA's Eastern Theatre Command, overseeing the East China Sea and Taiwan Strait, was involved in these encounters.</p>

          <p>A Utah woman filed a lawsuit accusing BYU football player Jake Retzlaff of sexual assault, alleging the incident occurred at his home in November 2023.

Retzlaff is being sued for alleged battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, with the woman seeking punitive damages from the BYU quarterback.

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement contrasts with President Trump's view that the yen's weakness contributes to the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan, suggesting currency issues may not be a key point in tariff talks. Kato expressed concerns about the global economic impact of Trump's tariffs, emphasizing the inappropriateness of using tariffs to address trade imbalances. Both sides reaffirmed that exchange rates should be market-determined, avoiding discussions on desired exchange rate levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report suggests that immigration continues to be a contentious issue in UK politics, with figures expected to show a fall in net migration. The article examines how attitudes towards immigration have shaped British politics since 1968, highlighting the impact of Enoch Powell's 'Rivers of Blood' speech and subsequent shifts in party allegiances. While attitudes may be softening, concerns persist about the impact of migration on public services and the economy. Prime Minister Starmer's government, elected on a promise to reduce migration, faces the challenge of reaching a settlement with voters on this complex issue.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson aimed for a vote on the bill, though timing remained unclear due to Rules Committee meetings. The legislation faced opposition from conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and moderates concerned about changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). A manager's amendment was unveiled, addressing Medicaid work requirements and clean energy subsidies, along with increasing the SALT deduction to $40,000 for households earning up to $500,000.</p>

          <p>A new 5,000-ton destroyer, critical to North Korea's naval advancement, was damaged during its launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un. The ship slid off the ramp and became stuck after the flatcar failed to move alongside it, crushing parts of the ship’s bottom, according to state media. Kim blamed military officials, scientists, and shipyard operators for the incident, calling it a "serious accident and criminal act." The damaged vessel was likely in the same class as the country’s first destroyer, unveiled on April 25.</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the seas around the UK and Ireland have soared in the past week, with some areas now 4C warmer than normal. This marine heatwave is most intense off the west coast of Ireland and in pockets off the coasts of Cornwall and Devon. Scientists expect 2025 to be one of the hottest years on record for air temperatures, and climate change is causing oceans to warm around the globe, making marine heatwaves like this one more likely. The heatwave may disrupt species' breeding patterns and could bring an influx of jellyfish that like warmer waters to seas and beaches.</p>

          <p>Food banks in Florida are feeling the sting of funding cuts, with one organization, Feeding South Florida, facing a 40% reduction in its annual budget. The cuts, stemming from a White House decision to reduce funding for USDA programs, have led to empty shelves and increased demand from families in need. The situation is also affecting local farmers who partnered with food banks to process surplus produce. As a result, food banks are struggling to provide balanced meals to those who rely on their services.</p>

          <p>A man from mainland China reportedly entered Taiwan illegally by sea and spent more than a month travelling freely around the island before surrendering to immigration authorities. He boarded a mainland Chinese cargo vessel, sailing under the Tanzanian flag, in the Taiwan Strait after arrangements were made through a human smuggling network. The ship docked in Kaohsiung on October 7 of that year. With the help of a smuggling agent, Li disembarked illegally, checked into a guest house in the city’s Cijin district, and then travelled undetected across Taiwan for over a month.</p>
