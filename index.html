          <p>Former President Donald Trump has stated that New York City could lose federal funding if Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is elected mayor and fails to "do the right thing." In a Fox News interview, Trump reiterated his criticism of Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, and extended the financial threat to any future mayor of the city. This approach is consistent with Trump's previous actions, where he has threatened to cut federal funds to localities and states over policy disagreements, such as California's stance on transgender athletes.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program in just a matter of months following recent U.S. military strikes. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that while the attacked facilities suffered severe damage, Iran retains the necessary knowledge and industrial capacity to quickly rebuild. This assessment contrasts with the Trump administration's claims of having "totally obliterated" the facilities, as a preliminary U.S. intelligence report also suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be temporary.</p>

          <p>Karen Read has been found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile retrial. Jurors, however, convicted her of driving under the influence of alcohol. The defense successfully argued that Read was framed by an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, countering the prosecution's claim that she intentionally hit O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and left him to die. The verdict concludes a complex case that began with a hung jury and a mistrial in 2024.</p>

          <p>LeBron James will make NBA history by playing a 23rd season, after exercising his $52.6 million player option to remain with the Los Angeles Lakers for the 2025-26 season.

At 40, James is also approaching Robert Parish's record for the most regular-season games played.

          <p>Donald Trump stated he is considering compelling journalists to disclose their sources for a leaked intelligence report that downplayed the success of recent U.S. military strikes on Iran. In a Fox News interview, Trump threatened prosecution for both the reporters and their sources, reiterating his administration's claim that the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities. This comes after multiple news outlets reported on a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggesting the damage was limited and only set back Iran's program by months, which Trump dismissed as biased and incomplete.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has not yet endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, stating they do not know each other well.

Jeffries plans to meet with Mamdani to discuss his vision for the city and his stance on issues important to the communities he represents before considering an endorsement.</p>

The race was disastrous for Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who was taken out on the first lap in a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. The author contends that despite knowing about this vulnerability for over 15 years, the U.S. has failed to create a coherent strategy, allowing China to dominate over 90% of the refining capacity. The article calls for a long-term, unified national strategy that treats critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power, urging for investment in a complete domestic supply chain and stronger international partnerships.</p>

Consumer groups and some appliance manufacturers are resisting the changes, arguing that programs like Energy Star have saved consumers billions and promote energy independence.

President Biden protected the land from industrial development, but Donald Trump has vowed to undo this action if re-elected, as part of his pro-energy agenda. This has set the stage for a potential legal battle over a president's authority to rescind monument designations, a power that legal experts say is not clearly granted by the Antiquities Act.

It traces a direct line from Buckley's intellectual groundwork to figures like Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, and ultimately Donald Trump. The biography explores how Buckley's coalition-building and anti-establishment critiques paved the way for the current political landscape.</p>

          <p>Automaker Lotus has assured the UK government that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, following reports it was considering moving production to the United States. The concerns, which would put 1,300 jobs at risk, prompted an urgent meeting with Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds. Lotus, owned by Chinese company Geely, had paused production due to since-reduced U.S. tariffs and acknowledged it is exploring options to ensure global competitiveness. The company reiterated its commitment to its British heritage and UK operations.</p>

          <h2>USPS Warns of 'Brushing' Scam Involving Unsolicited Packages</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is alerting Americans to a growing "brushing" scam where people receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items. This scheme is used by third-party online sellers to post fake "verified" reviews in the recipient's name to boost product ratings. Officials warn that receiving such a package is a red flag that your personal information, including your name and address, has been compromised. This data could then be used for more serious crimes like identity theft, so consumers are advised to report the incidents and audit their personal accounts.</p>
