          <h2>Study Reveals High-Dose Radiotherapy May Promote Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 01:00:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Centre found that high doses of radiation, while intended to destroy cancer cells, could paradoxically promote the growth of existing metastatic tumors, even those not directly targeted by the radiation. The groundbreaking work, led by biochemist Yang Kaiting, suggests that radiation therapy, commonly used to control localized cancer tumors, may have unintended consequences. This finding raises concerns about the long-term effects of high-dose radiotherapy and the need for further investigation into its impact on cancer metastasis. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and to develop strategies to mitigate the risk of metastasis in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. </p>

          <p>The U.K. has suspended free trade talks with Israel and imposed sanctions on West Bank settlers in response to Israel's military actions in Gaza and the West Bank. Foreign Secretary David Lammy criticized the Israeli government's policies, including blocking aid and expanding the war, deeming them indefensible. The U.K. is also sanctioning individuals and organizations supporting violence against the Palestinian community, reflecting mounting international pressure on Israel to ease restrictions on humanitarian aid and pursue a ceasefire. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called for a ceasefire and increased aid shipments to Gaza, echoing concerns from other close allies like France and Canada. </p>

          <p>Fujirebio Holdings, a Japanese company, will launch the first blood test to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in the U.S. by late June, potentially revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The test, cleared by the FDA, detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in a process that takes approximately 30 minutes and costs significantly less than a PET scan. This development is expected to improve access to new Alzheimer's treatments and facilitate earlier diagnosis, enabling timely intervention for the nearly 7 million Americans affected by the memory-robbing disease. This non-invasive method is a critical step in making new types of Alzheimer’s treatments widely accessible. </p>

Sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz, the bill also extends business tax credits for payroll taxes on tips in beauty and spa services, aiming to provide financial relief to millions of workers in tipped occupations. To be eligible, an employee's compensation must not exceed $160,000 in the prior tax year, and the tips must be reported to the employer for payroll tax withholding. The bill's passage through the Senate marks a rare bipartisan achievement and now moves to the House of Representatives for consideration. </p>

The Ministry of Commerce condemned Washington's measures as unilateral bullying and protectionism, asserting that they violate international laws and harm the interests of Chinese enterprises. China's anti-sanction law, passed in 2021, stipulates that individuals or organizations implementing sanctions against China are subject to prosecution and liable for compensation. Beijing stated it would closely monitor the U.S. measures and take decisive actions to protect its interests, as the U.S. seeks to limit China's access to advanced chip technology. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that he will be spending less on political campaigns, following a significant but unsuccessful investment in Wisconsin's Supreme Court race. Musk's backing of a candidate who lost by a wide margin in Wisconsin, coupled with his role in the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal government, has led to criticism and a decline in his popularity. Democrats in Wisconsin have claimed that their efforts to make Musk's involvement in the election toxic were successful, though some analysts believe Musk could still engage in future races in a more low-profile manner. Musk's pullback comes as he focuses more on his businesses and faces scrutiny over his political spending and influence. </p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public criticism over his comments about receiving ample amounts of rice as gifts and never having to buy it himself. Eto's remarks were seen as insensitive amid soaring rice prices and growing discontent over the government's handling of the issue. Former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto as the new farm chief, as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. The incident highlights the challenges Japan faces in addressing rising food prices and maintaining public trust. </p>

          <p>New satellite analysis reveals that the world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires overtaking land clearances from agriculture as the primary cause. The destruction of 67,000 sq km of pristine forests released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. Researchers warn that some forests, like parts of the Amazon, may be approaching a tipping point, potentially leading to irreversible decline and savannization. While South East Asia saw a reduction in forest loss due to government policies, the overall trend raises concerns about the resilience of tropical forests in a warming world. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, with the goal of completion by the end of his term.

Trump has stated the project will cost $175 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office estimates it could reach $542 billion, and he expressed confidence in completing it within three years. The "Golden Dome" is intended to intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space, representing a next-generation military system overseen by Gen. Michael Guetlein. </p>

          <p>A new report indicates that record-breaking global temperatures contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide in 2024, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with two-thirds of the loss due to fires sparked primarily by human activity, and widespread drought fueled larger blazes across South America. While countries like Indonesia and Malaysia managed to reduce forest loss through prevention efforts and stricter laws, the underlying cause of the destruction is climate change, with the world entering a new amplifying phase where fires are more intense.

          <p>While media attention often focuses on young men supposedly voting for the far right, the article argues that a more significant shift is occurring among young women, who are increasingly turning towards left-wing politics. Studies show that young people, in general, hold more progressive values, and the gender gap is primarily driven by a sharp leftward turn among young women rather than a rightward shift among young men. This trend presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to prioritize the values of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than catering to reactionary politics. By focusing on female voters, progressive politics could transform the political debate and encourage greater participation from young women. </p>

          <p>Corey O'Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city's current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O'Connor's victory reflects a trend of losses for progressive candidates in deep-blue cities, raising questions about the power of progressive officeholders. Positioning himself as a pragmatic candidate, O'Connor pledged to improve city services and rebuild the tax base, contrasting with Gainey's focus on affordable housing. The outcome suggests a desire for more moderate leadership in Pittsburgh, a Democratic stronghold. </p>
