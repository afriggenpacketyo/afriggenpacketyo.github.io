          <p>Newspaper headlines highlight the global stock market's sharp decline following President Trump's tariff announcements, which include a 10% tariff on all imports and higher tariffs on specific countries like China and the EU.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from Asia, where Nike manufactures most of its shoes, are causing concern about potential price increases for consumers. Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia, and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes. Analysts estimate that Nike's prices could increase by 10% to 15%, but a large price increase could reduce demand. The company may also downgrade the level of tech in its shoes or refresh designs less frequently to keep retail prices low.</p>
