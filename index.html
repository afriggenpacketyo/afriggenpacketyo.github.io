          <p>Millions of student loan borrowers are bracing for wage garnishment as the Trump administration resumes collection activity on defaulted federal student loans.

Bessent stated that Walmart is promising to absorb some of the tariffs, similar to what it did in previous years.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson expressed optimism that the budget bill, which failed to exit committee on Friday, would reach the House floor before Memorial Day. Johnson blamed potential delays on states' abilities to implement new eligibility requirements. The bill is set for a revote at 10 p.m. ET Sunday night. Johnson said he has met regularly with Senate Majority Leader John Thune to ensure swift passage. The House is aiming to meet both the Memorial Day deadline and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's July 4 target.</p>

          <p>Saturday Night Live's 50th season ended with a successful run, but questions remain about the show's future. Despite the success, some critics still want to shade the show, but SNL remains one of the most powerful brands in comedy. Speculation surrounds the potential departure of Weekend Update hosts Colin Jost and Michael Che, and how the show will continue to lampoon modern politics. The 50th anniversary celebrations served as a potent reminder that there is no other program like it on American television.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the intelligence community is incorrect in its assessment that Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of Nicolás Maduro's government. The National Intelligence Council determined that the Maduro regime does not direct the gang's operations, contradicting the Trump administration's claims used to invoke the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. Rubio pointed to an FBI assessment that the gang is "exported by the Venezuelan regime" and has been contracted to murder an opposition member in Chile. The administration has pursued the swift apprehension and removal of Venezuelan nationals deemed alien enemies.</p>

Hawaiian leis are given for nearly every occasion, representing an expression of aloha and love. However, the future of lei making is in peril due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and the fact that a lei only lasts around two or three days. Some lei makers are adapting by using non-traditional materials, such as wood beads and unripe fruit, to create "forever leis."</p>
