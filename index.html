          <p>A comprehensive review by the DOJ and FBI, ordered by previous administration leadership, found no evidence of a "client list" associated with Jeffrey Epstein. The review also released footage confirming his 2019 death was a suicide, aiming to dispel long-standing conspiracy theories. Officials stated that the investigation is closed, with no further charges expected against any third parties, a decision likely to frustrate those who believed Epstein's powerful associates would be implicated. The memo concluded that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the goal of bringing justice to victims.</p>

          <p>An Australian court has convicted Erin Patterson of murdering three relatives by serving them a meal containing deadly death cap mushrooms. The jury also found her guilty of attempting to murder a fourth guest who survived the 2023 lunch. The prosecution argued the act was intentional, highlighting strained family relationships, while the defense claimed it was a tragic accident. Patterson now faces a potential life sentence for the killings, which captivated the nation.</p>

          <p>Hopes for a 60-day ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza are growing as Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with US President Donald Trump. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas have resumed, focusing on a US-sponsored proposal, though significant disagreements remain. The framework reportedly involves a phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces. Recent regional conflicts, particularly between Israel and Iran, may have created new leverage for reaching an agreement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a potential new 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." The threat came as the bloc of developing nations, including China and Russia, met and criticized unilateral protectionist measures in a joint statement. The BRICS group, which recently expanded, aims to challenge Western-dominated global governance and increase the influence of the Global South. This move signals a further escalation in global trade tensions under the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article argues that the increasing "financialization" of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's affordability crisis. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have purchased vast amounts of residential property, treating housing as a lucrative asset class. This has pushed up prices and rents, making homeownership unattainable for many and fueling political discontent. The author contends that this system prioritizes investor returns over residents' needs, leading to a crisis that threatens social and political stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, author Jessie Cole explores her lifelong relationship with her younger brother, who was profoundly quiet as a child, leading her to often speak for him. She reflects on how their bond was shaped by shared grief and how he found his voice not in words, but through playing the guitar. His instrumental music became a rich, expressive language that communicated his deep inner world of joy, sadness, and history. The author describes her journey from being his childhood "translator" to learning the importance of silence and listening to his melodies.</p>

          <h2>Questions Arise Over Adequacy of Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly flash floods in central Texas, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate and timely warnings to residents and campers. Local officials stated the deluge, which saw the Guadalupe River rise nearly 30 feet, was unexpectedly severe and that many affected areas lack cell coverage for modern alerts. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued flood watches and warnings with several hours of lead time. The tragedy has sparked a debate about the effectiveness of warning systems for unprecedented weather events.</p>

          <p>Mexico secured its 10th Gold Cup title with a 2-1 victory over the United States in a heated final in Houston. Edson Álvarez scored the decisive goal in the second half, which was confirmed after a VAR review for offside. The match was also marked by controversy, as US coach Mauricio Pochettino was incensed by a non-call on what he believed was a clear penalty for a handball against Mexico. The US took an early lead but was largely outplayed, with Mexico dominating possession and creating more scoring opportunities.</p>

          <p>This article explores the significant challenges Elon Musk would face in establishing his proposed "America Party." Creating a new national political party is a daunting task, requiring navigation of a complex web of 50 different state laws on ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the two major parties. The process would involve massive signature-gathering campaigns, potential multi-year legal battles, and hundreds of millions of dollars in spending. Experts note that even for the world's wealthiest person, building a viable third party from scratch is an extraordinarily difficult and time-consuming endeavor.</p>

          <p>The al-Qaeda affiliate JNIM has become the dominant jihadist force in the Sahel, responsible for a surge in violence across Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017 as a coalition of several militant groups, JNIM has exploited government instability and local grievances to expand its operations and recruitment. The group funds itself through various means, including cattle-rustling and imposing taxes, and has become adept at using modern technology like Starlink for its operations. Failed counterinsurgency efforts and a series of military coups have created a power vacuum, allowing the group to flourish.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress in containing the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California so far this year. As of Sunday, the blaze, which has burned over 80,000 acres, was 30% contained, a substantial increase from the previous day. Favorable weather conditions and an influx of firefighting personnel have bolstered the effort to control the fire, which threatens the Carrizo Plain National Monument.
