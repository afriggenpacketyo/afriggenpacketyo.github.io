          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor details her surreal experience investigating the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski. The case took an unexpected turn when she discovered the victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, was a former high school classmate whom she had not seen in decades. The article explores the complex dynamics, as Snyder's boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, while Snyder herself faced suspicion from the victim's family but was never charged. Snyder provides an exclusive interview addressing these suspicions and her decision to invoke the Fifth Amendment during Holbrook's trial.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a significant robbery occurred shortly after its Sunday opening. According to French officials, at least three suspects entered the Apollon Gallery and stole several pieces of jewelry described as having "inestimable" value. The thieves reportedly used construction equipment to gain access and fled the scene on motorcycles in an operation that lasted approximately seven minutes. The incident caused commotion among visitors waiting to enter, who witnessed police activity and people trapped inside the locked-down museum.</p>

          <p>In her new book, Amy Duggar King recounts a disturbing encounter with her cousin, Josh Duggar, after allegations of him molesting his sisters became public in 2015. She describes confronting him directly, only for him to respond with a "creepy smile" and the words, "I knew better," a moment she found haunting. The article also touches on her strained relationship with the wider Duggar family and her criticism of their rigid, "cult-like" upbringing under the teachings of Bill Gothard. Duggar King hopes her story encourages others to question authority and protect children from abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rising popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant increase in eye injuries, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that such injuries, including corneal abrasions and lacerations, have been increasing by over 400 cases annually, with adults aged 50 and older accounting for 70% of incidents. The study's authors call for standardized eye protection guidelines, similar to those in other sports, noting that proper eyewear can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. Experts suggest that many players are simply unaware of the risks associated with the fast-paced game.</p>

          <p>The article details the case of Roman Surovtsev, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from the former Soviet Union at age four and is now facing deportation by ICE. After a past criminal conviction revoked his green card, ICE has repeatedly tried to deport him to Ukraine, a country that cannot confirm his citizenship since he left before the Soviet Union's dissolution. Surovtsev was recently re-detained during a routine check-in, reflecting a broader trend under the current administration's deportation targets. His family and legal team are fighting the detention, arguing it is unconstitutional as there is no foreseeable likelihood of removal.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police are "actively" investigating reports that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection officers to obtain personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The allegations, published in the Mail on Sunday, claim the prince sought to "dig up dirt" on Giuffre in 2011 by providing her confidential social security number to an officer. This development comes shortly after Andrew voluntarily relinquished his royal titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The claims add another layer to the scandal that has severely damaged the prince's public standing.</p>

          <p>Forest Green Rovers manager Robbie Savage has condemned the personal abuse he received from opposition fans during a recent match, stating that the insults "crossed the line" from banter into something unacceptable. The former Wales international and current media pundit asserted that while he can handle typical songs and chants, the nature of the abuse has become increasingly nasty. Savage criticized the lack of action from stewards and authorities, arguing that such "vile abuse" should not be tolerated in football. He emphasized that people think it's acceptable to hurl shocking insults at him simply because of his public persona.</p>

The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, to support the expansion of renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match military veterans and ex-offenders with careers in the green economy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for lowering energy bills and providing well-paid, secure jobs in Britain's industrial heartlands. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, the common perception of memory as a faithful record of the past is incorrect. His research suggests memory's primary function is not to store facts like a filing cabinet, but to help us construct the story of our lives, understand the present, and plan for the future. The article discusses how emotion shapes recall, why forgetting is a crucial part of a healthy memory, and how our "remembering self" often dictates our satisfaction with past experiences more than the "experiencing self." This reframing highlights that memory is a dynamic, malleable tool for creating meaning.</p>

          <p>While numerous companies like Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce have publicly cited artificial intelligence as a reason for recent job cuts, some experts are skeptical. Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, suggests that AI has become a "good excuse" for firms to downsize for other reasons, such as overhiring during the pandemic. Critics argue that blaming technology allows companies to appear innovative while masking potential miscalculations or other business challenges. This narrative feeds employee anxiety about AI, even as recent data from the U.S. labor market shows little evidence of mass, AI-driven job disruption so far. (not investment advice)</p>

While NASA's Artemis program has faced technical delays, budget pressures, and shifting political priorities, China's state-led lunar program is progressing on schedule with key tests of its Long March 10 rocket and Lanyue lander. A Chinese lunar landing before NASA would carry significant geopolitical weight, projecting China as a leading space power and potentially influencing international partnerships and rules for lunar resource governance. The success of China's centralized approach highlights challenges for NASA's reliance on private partners like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that recent moves by the FDA to loosen approval standards for rare disease drugs are misguided and ultimately detrimental to patients. The author contends that while flexibility is needed, the agency is increasingly approving treatments based on weak evidence, such as single studies or anecdotal reports, rather than proven benefit. This shift risks giving patients false hope and exposing them to ineffective or unsafe therapies, undermining the very purpose of the FDA's gatekeeping role. The author suggests that instead of lowering the bar for approval, efforts should focus on better funding for research and improving access to investigational drugs.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of betting company Betfred, has warned that a potential increase in gambling taxes by the UK government could force the closure of all 1,287 of its high street shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers raising taxes on the sector, a move supported by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to fund child poverty initiatives. Done stated that even a moderate tax hike would eliminate profitability, echoing similar concerns from other industry players like William Hill. He argued that such a move would decimate a high street presence and push bettors to untaxed offshore sites. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea is actively pursuing stronger relationships with Southeast Asian nations, particularly Vietnam and Laos, as it seeks to bolster its diplomatic standing and circumvent international sanctions. High-ranking officials from both countries recently attended a major anniversary celebration in Pyongyang, signaling a deepening of ties. For North Korea, these partnerships offer a degree of international legitimacy and potential corridors for illicit trade. For Vietnam and Laos, it's an opportunity to engage with a fellow single-party state, though experts note that any cooperation, especially on trade, carries significant risks related to sanctions enforcement.</p>

          <p>For four decades, China has been engaged in a large-scale effort to combat the expansion of the Mu Us Desert in the Ningxia region, and is now claiming major success. Through extensive sand control and afforestation projects at the Baijitan National Nature Reserve, authorities have reportedly pushed the desert back by more than 20 kilometers. The project has stabilized vast areas of drifting sands that once threatened the provincial capital of Yinchuan and the crucial Yellow River. This environmental initiative highlights a significant achievement in reversing desertification and protecting agricultural land and livelihoods from encroaching sands.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" and a violation of sovereignty following a U.S. military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters. Petro stated the vessel, carrying a fisherman named Alejandro Carranza who he said had no ties to drug trafficking, was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure when it was attacked. The accusation comes after President Trump confirmed a series of strikes on suspected "drug-carrying" vessels in the Caribbean, part of a controversial clampdown on narcotics trafficking that has been criticized by human rights experts as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

German historian Jürgen Matthäus, aided by a tip from a relative and AI-based facial recognition software, made the breakthrough. Research also corrected the location of the mass execution from Vinnytsia to Berdychiv, Ukraine, in July 1941, based on a Wehrmacht soldier's war diary. This discovery represents a significant step in de-anonymizing the perpetrators of Nazi atrocities, though the identity of the victim kneeling at the edge of the mass grave remains unknown.</p>

          <p>Despite significant summer spending, Liverpool FC is experiencing tactical difficulties this season, which this analysis links to the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. The article argues his absence is felt beyond his direct goal contributions, particularly in the team's ability to build up play from the back and bypass high-pressing opponents. Alexander-Arnold's unique ability to play accurate long passes with both feet and find central midfielders is a quality his replacements lack, forcing compromises like using attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz in deeper roles. This has disrupted the team's offensive rhythm and ability to switch play effectively.</p>

Analysts expect European bank CEOs to face questions about their exposure to this risk and the potential for deteriorating credit quality, especially in their corporate loan books. The issue is gaining urgency as European bank stocks saw a sharp sell-off on Friday, signaling that credit fears are spreading across the Atlantic. (not investment advice)</p>
