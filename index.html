          <p>Larry Eugene Parks, found dead in Oregon in 1980, has been identified nearly 45 years later through forensic genetic genealogy, with Randy Kraft, the "Scorecard Killer," as the primary suspect. Kraft, already convicted of killing 16 men in California, is under investigation for Parks' murder, with authorities processing evidence to establish a definitive link. The identification brings closure to Parks' family, who lost contact with him in 1979, and highlights the continued use of genetic genealogy in solving cold cases. Kraft, who denied killing anyone, was apprehended in 1983 with a strangled Marine in his vehicle and a coded list potentially tallying 67 victims.</p>

          <p>European leaders, including those from Poland, the UK, France, and Germany, have urged Russia to agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire with Ukraine, starting on Monday, during a meeting in Kyiv with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The leaders threatened Russia with "massive" sanctions if it does not comply, emphasizing the importance of reconnecting Ukraine's economy and reuniting families. Russia has so far insisted that the West must halt its military aid to Ukraine before considering a ceasefire, but Zelensky stated that any conditions would undermine diplomacy. Despite claims of a temporary ceasefire by Russia, reports of Russian attacks across Ukraine continue, resulting in casualties and damage to residential areas.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space, splashing down in the Indian Ocean. The mission failed to reach Venus due to a rocket booster malfunction, becoming a relic of the Cold War-era space race. While the United States focused on Mars, the Soviet Union aimed at Venus through its Venera program, achieving milestones like the first probes to enter another planetâ€™s atmosphere and land on its surface. The re-entry serves as a reminder of the ambitious Soviet space program and its contributions to planetary exploration, though it also highlights the increasing amount of space debris orbiting Earth.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee shook homes across the southern US on Saturday morning, with tremors felt as far away as Atlanta. The earthquake's epicenter was located near Greenback, Tennessee, prompting over 23,000 reports to the USGS. While no major damage or injuries were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of the region's seismic activity, particularly within the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone. Residents described the shaking and rumbling, noting that earthquakes are less common in the area compared to tornadoes and floods.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's women's football team completed an "immaculate" unbeaten season in the Women's Super League (WSL), securing the title with 19 wins and 3 draws, finishing 12 points clear of their nearest rival. Manager Sonia Bompastor emphasized the team's consistency and strong mentality, particularly in grinding out one-goal victories and scoring late goals. The team's achievements are particularly noteworthy given the "transitional season" following Emma Hayes' departure and the integration of new players. Chelsea's dominance was evident in their perfect record against other top-four teams, solidifying their position as the best team in England for the past five years.</p>

          <p>Officials from the United States and China commenced trade-related discussions in Geneva, marking the first face-to-face conversations since President Trump imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aim to address the ongoing trade war that has impacted financial markets and import disruption. While Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter expressed hope for a positive outcome, experts anticipate a lengthy negotiation process as both sides seek to understand each other's objectives. The talks follow the United Kingdom's recent trade deal with the Trump administration, leaving China as the "missing piece" in U.S. trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is fast-tracking the relocation of white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, to the United States as refugees, alleging persecution by the Black-led government. The South African government denies these claims, citing Afrikaners' economic privilege and integration into society. Claims of persecution center on violent farm attacks and accusations of "reverse racism" through affirmative action policies. The U.S. alleges the South African government is not adequately protecting rural Afrikaner communities and is allowing anti-white rhetoric, while the South African government attributes the attacks to broader violent crime issues. The refugee program is limited to Afrikaners, seen as aligning with the Trump administration's conservative values.</p>

Hadden was convicted in 2023 and sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients across state lines to sexually abuse them.

The hoard, weighing about 15 pounds, included bracelets, snuff boxes, and gold coins dating from 1808 to 1915, originating from various countries. The location near a former border between Czech and German settlements suggests the treasure was likely buried by people fleeing Nazi Germany around 1938.

Diller argues that data can be harmful to instinct, particularly in creative and business contexts, and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He recalls instances where trusting his instincts led to successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," highlighting the value of simple human intuition. Diller also criticizes the over-reliance on structured information and PowerPoint presentations, suggesting they can narrow perspectives when a broader approach is needed.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," Mark Whitaker examines the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in the 1992 biopic "Malcolm X." Lee meticulously recreated the look and feel of Malcolm's life, from the bustling streets of Roxbury to the climactic assassination scene. The director's attention to detail extended to inviting figures who had interacted with Malcolm to make cameo appearances. Lee sought to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death through dialogue, music, and camera work, capturing a sense of stoic anticipation in Washington's performance.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly Sonoma County woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth, 81, gained the victim's trust while preparing her taxes and then offered fraudulent investment opportunities promising high returns with no risk. She ran a Ponzi scheme, using money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and funding a lavish lifestyle. The scheme collapsed in 2020 when the victim requested her money back, leaving her financially destitute. The judge imposed a reduced sentence due to Cohen-Roth's age.</p>

          <p>Migratory birds are facing increasing challenges due to climate change, which is altering their migration routes and impacting their ability to survive and reproduce. Rising sea levels are affecting coastal stopover locations, while ocean acidification is reducing the availability of small crustaceans, a key food source. Extreme weather events are also posing a threat. Warmer temperatures are leading some birds to shorten their routes or abandon their original habitats, potentially causing conflicts with resident animals. While some species are adapting, others, like the slender-billed curlew, have become extinct due to habitat loss and the inability to adjust to changing conditions.</p>
