          <p>A new short film, "Final Finishers," shifts focus from elite athletes to the amateur runners at the back of the New York City Marathon pack. The documentary, which premiered at the Tribeca Festival, highlights the inspiring and relatable stories of individuals who finish hours after the winners, often in the dark. By celebrating these everyday heroes, including a man who overcame paralysis to run, the film aims to show that extraordinary stories are not limited to the front of the race and can inspire a broader audience to see themselves as runners.</p>

          <p>During an event in Iowa, President Donald Trump announced his idea to stage a Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) match on the White House grounds. He suggested the event could host 20,000 to 25,000 spectators as part of the festivities celebrating America's 250th birthday in 2026. Trump, a known UFC enthusiast and friend of its president Dana White, also announced a festival on the National Mall and a national athletic competition for high school students. A White House spokesperson later confirmed that the president was "dead serious" about the plan.</p>

          <p>Paul Stephenson, 57, has been sentenced to life in prison plus 92 years for a drunk driving crash that killed U.S. Air Force veteran Matt Anderson and injured his four children. The incident occurred in August 2024 when Stephenson, whose blood alcohol level was 2.5 times the legal limit, crashed his truck into the Anderson family's vehicle at a gas station. This was Stephenson's third DUI conviction, and the District Attorney's office pursued a first-degree murder charge to send a strong message against drunk driving in the county.</p>

          <p>While Germany's manufacturing index recently hit a 34-month high, it still indicates a contraction, highlighting the challenges facing Europe's industrial sector. As the EU and China explore warmer diplomatic ties, a primary concern for Brussels is protecting its manufacturing base from an influx of inexpensive Chinese imports. Analysts suggest that Europe's ambition to rebuild its own industrial strength is a key factor shaping its economic and political dynamics with Beijing. The EU's manufacturing output remains significant, but it trails behind China's massive industrial production. (not investment advice)</p>

Democratic officials have labeled the legislation an "act of violence" and a "dark day for our country," signaling that its contents will be a central issue in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A new budget reconciliation bill, championed by President Trump, has passed Congress despite being widely viewed as devastating for many Americans. The legislation, which adds an estimated $3.3 trillion to the deficit, includes massive cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs, while expanding the budget for immigration enforcement and providing significant tax cuts for billionaires. This opinion article argues that the bill's passage demonstrates a perversion of national politics, where a measure that hurts the sick, poor, and elderly is pushed through to benefit the wealthy and powerful, warping American life in cruel ways.</p>

          <p>A year after returning to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is navigating a difficult path, with his popularity falling amid unfulfilled economic promises. The government's mission to boost growth has been hampered by high inflation and borrowing costs, while Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces a tough fiscal position, marked by U-turns on welfare and spending. While Labour has achieved some success on the international stage with new trade deals, it faces a rising threat from the rival Reform UK party, which is gaining support from disaffected voters.

Despite recent turmoil, including a costly reversal on welfare reforms that left his chancellor in tears, Starmer insisted his government has made significant achievements in healthcare, education, and securing international investment, and will emerge stronger from its challenges.</p>

          <p>After a strong victory against a former champion, British tennis player Emma Raducanu is preparing for a formidable challenge against world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon. Raducanu acknowledges she needs to add more weapons to her game to compete with the sport's top players, having lost decisively to them in previous Grand Slams this year. Sabalenka's powerful, first-strike tennis is particularly effective on Wimbledon's fast grass courts. Raducanu hopes that playing with more freedom in the familiar home environment will help her bridge the gap and contend with the dominant favorite.</p>

Students and long-term residents express frustration over the stench and the accumulation of waste, particularly as people move out for the summer.

          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," now passed by Congress, is a major legislative package designed to finance his key campaign promises. The bill includes massive spending increases for immigration control and defense, a ramp-up of fossil fuel incentives, and an estimated $4.5 trillion in tax cuts. Conversely, it makes significant cuts to health and social programs, with new eligibility rules projected to cause millions to lose Medicaid and food assistance. While a political victory for Trump, the bill is unpopular with the public and raises major concerns about its $3.4 trillion addition to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault, unlawful sexual penetration, and sexual abuse. The charges stemmed from an incident during a 2021 party where he sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman who prosecutors argued was incapacitated from heavy drinking and unable to consent. The defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The District Attorney praised the verdict, stating it shows that celebrity status does not protect individuals from prosecution. McLemore, 32, who played for several NBA teams, is scheduled for sentencing next week.</p>
