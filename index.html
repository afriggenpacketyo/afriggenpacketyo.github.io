          <p>Nico Iamaleava's brother, Madden, is reportedly switching his commitment from Arkansas to UCLA, following Nico's transfer. Arkansas' NIL collective has sent demand letters to players requesting the fulfillment of buyout clauses, seeking an estimated $200,000 from Madden Iamaleava. Nico Iamaleava was making $2.4 million on an NIL contract. He finished the 2024 season with 2,616 passing yards and 19 touchdowns. UCLA finished the 2024 campaign with a 5-7 record after the Bruins' first season in the Big Ten Conference.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a deadly missile and drone attack on Kyiv, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries, marking the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital since last July. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy cut short his trip to South Africa and returned home, branding the strike as "one of (Russia's) most outrageous." The attack occurred amidst stalled peace negotiations and accusations from President Trump that Zelenskyy is prolonging the conflict by refusing to cede Crimea. The EU condemned the attack, emphasizing that Russia is the primary obstacle to peace, while Ukraine reiterated that recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is "not happy" with the recent deadly Russian strikes on Kyiv and urged President Putin to "stop," although he did not indicate potential further actions against Russia. He emphasized his focus on saving lives and expressed frustration with Putin, but stated he would wait a week to see if a deal can be reached, warning that "things will happen" if the bombings persist. President Zelenskyy responded by suggesting the US could exert more pressure on Russia to secure a ceasefire, adding that a ceasefire must be the first step in negotiations. The attack caused Zelenskyy to cut his trip short and return home.</p>

          <p>Residents of St. Louis are grappling with a legacy of nuclear waste contamination in Coldwater Creek, with many families experiencing high rates of cancer.

A 2019 study linked living near Coldwater Creek to an increased risk of lung, bone cancer, or leukemia. Medical professionals are tracking cancer cases in the area, urging closer examination of the contamination's effects.</p>

          <p>Warnings of potential retail shortages have emerged due to the ongoing trade war, with apparel and footwear being key consumer product areas to watch. Imports from China account for a significant portion of U.S. apparel and footwear imports, and high tariff rates could act as an import ban. Companies are anticipating price increases and consumer wariness, and orders of big-ticket items have surged in anticipation of sticker shock. The risk of retail shortages will depend on the duration of the high tariff levels and the extent to which companies frontloaded inventory.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering recognizing Russian control over Crimea as part of a negotiated end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, potentially reversing over a decade of American policy. During his first term, Trump had suggested he would "take a look" at the issue, but ultimately doubled down against Moscow. This potential shift marks a significant departure from the U.S.'s long-standing rejection of Russia's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula in 2014.</p>

          <p>Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced a major workplace overhaul aimed at boosting innovation, including restructuring the company and mandating a four-day return to office policy. The company is also focused on attracting and retaining talent, following a period of high executive turnover. Intel is reportedly planning to cut 20% of its workforce, though this was not confirmed by the company. The changes are intended to empower smaller teams, reduce bureaucracy, and accelerate decision-making. Intel reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, but its disappointing outlook sent the stock plummeting. (not investment advice)</p>

The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, partly due to customers stockpiling chips ahead of tariffs. However, Intel's guidance for revenue and profit was below expectations, causing its stock to decline.

          <p>Intel reported first-quarter results that exceeded analysts' expectations but issued disappointing guidance and announced plans to slash expenses. The company expects second-quarter revenue of $11.8 billion, lower than the average analyst estimate of $12.82 billion. Intel's CFO cited elevated uncertainty driven by the macro environment and fluid trade policies as factors impacting the guidance. The company is planning to cut operational and capital expenses to improve efficiency, including job cuts, especially for managers. (not investment advice)</p>
