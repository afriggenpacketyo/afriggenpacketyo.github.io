          <p>President Trump announced a 25% tariff on countries purchasing Venezuelan oil, starting April 2nd. This action aims to pressure the Maduro regime and potentially benefits Chevron by limiting Chinese influence in Venezuela's oil sector.  The tariffs could also impact global oil prices.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a significant rebound, its best day since November 2024, following nine consecutive weeks of decline.  This surge is attributed to potential softening of Trump's tariff plans and improved market sentiment, although uncertainty remains.  Musk urged employees to hold onto their stock.</p>

          <p>Reports suggest the Trump administration's April 2nd tariff plan might be more targeted than initially threatened, focusing on specific countries rather than a broad range. While still significant, this narrower approach could lessen the negative impact on US allies and global markets.  The situation remains fluid.</p>
