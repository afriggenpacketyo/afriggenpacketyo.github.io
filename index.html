          <h2>China's Critical Metal Exports Plunge Amid Trade War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 02:00:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the US are significantly impacting trade, with exports of several minerals plummeting and some shipments ceasing entirely in March, according to customs data. This move is a response to Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods, putting pressure on US manufacturers reliant on Chinese rare earths, which are crucial for various industries, including smartphones and military equipment. Specifically, exports of tellurium and tungsten have seen dramatic declines or complete halts, indicating China's leveraging of its dominance in the rare earth supply chain amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>The wife of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian demonstrator detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), gave birth to their first child after ICE denied Khalil's request for temporary release to attend the delivery. Khalil's lawyers had proposed alternatives like an ankle monitor and check-ins with ICE. Khalil, who participated in protests against the war in Gaza while a student at Columbia University, was deemed deportable after Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited adverse consequences on foreign policy. The denial of his furlough has sparked criticism, with his wife accusing ICE and the Trump administration of deliberately causing suffering to silence Khalil's activism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced a deadline to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students, following a temporary restraining order issued by a U.S. District Court in Georgia. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), potentially leading to deportations. The students, some nearing graduation or enrolled in work programs, claim their statuses were revoked due to minor infractions or without cause.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all experienced substantial losses, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022.

          <p>Nationalities of foreign criminals to be published\n\nTuesday's commitment to publish nationality data about foreign criminals is - according to the Conservatives - evidence that Labour "buckled" after the Tories pressured the government to disclose the figures .\n\nThe latest official data shows there were more than 19,000 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of last year, up from almost 18,000 when the Conservatives left office in July.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is understood to have ordered officials to publish data by the end of the year, showing the nationalities and crimes of those awaiting deportation.\n\nThe nationalities of foreign criminals living in the UK will be published for the first time under plans to be unveiled later.\n\nIn response government sources insist the move was only possible because Cooper ordered Home Office statisticians to overhaul their systems.\n\nForeign nationals sentenced to 12 months or more in prison are subject to automatic deportation.\n\nThe home secretary has the power to deport people who receive a shorter sentence if she decides their presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.\n\nHome Office sources blame the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation on early releases due to prison overcrowding, instability in some countries making deportations difficult and a litany of appeals against deportation on human rights grounds.\n\nThe rise came despite more offenders being deported since Labour came to power.\n\nHome Office figures are expected to show the main three nationalities for foreign criminals living in the community are Albanians, Romanians and Poles.\n\nIt is understood their most common offences were the production of drugs, theft and robbery, and acts of violent assault.\n\nGovernment sources insist the change has only come about because ministers have addressed an issue that their Conservative predecessors ignored.\n\nA Home Office source said: "Not only are we deporting foreign criminals at a rate never seen when Chris Philp and Robert Jenrick were in charge at the Home Office, but we will also be publishing far more information about that cohort of offenders than the Tories ever did."\n\nThe source added: "We want to ensure the public is kept better informed about the number of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, where they are from and the crimes they have committed."\n\nWelcoming the news, shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick said: "We will finally see the hard reality that mass migration is fuelling crime across our country. Frankly, the public deserved to know this long ago."</p>

          <p>The UK government will begin publishing the nationalities of foreign criminals living in the country for the first time. Official data indicates a rise in the number of foreign offenders awaiting deportation. The move is intended to better inform the public about the foreign criminal population, their origins, and the crimes they have committed. Government sources attribute the increase in foreign criminals awaiting deportation to various factors, including early releases due to prison overcrowding and appeals against deportation based on human rights grounds.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks worldwide. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and reduce imported inflation, it also complicates export competitiveness and may lead to capital flight risks. Central banks are carefully balancing the need to support economic growth with concerns about inflation and financial stability. Some are cautiously considering currency devaluation, while others are avoiding actions that could spark a currency war. The situation is further complicated by renewed U.S. tariffs, adding to the uncertainty in the global economy.</p>
