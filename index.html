          <p>China's upcoming military parade, commemorating 80 years since the end of World War II, will showcase the nation's modernized military forces. However, some of the People's Liberation Army's most advanced and potent weapon systems will not be displayed. Key assets, such as the developmental sixth-generation J-36 and J-50 stealth fighters and strategic missile defense systems, will be kept from public view. The decision to exclude these technologies is due to their ongoing development, strategic sensitivity, or logistical challenges related to their inclusion in the parade.</p>

          <p>In a new court filing, Abbe Lowell, the attorney for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, asserted that his client "did not ever commit mortgage fraud." The filing aims to block President Trump's attempt to fire her, arguing the allegations are a pretext for his true goal of influencing the Fed to lower interest rates. Lowell emphasized that the financial documents in question were previously vetted by the White House and Senate during her confirmation process. The case has drawn significant attention, with nearly 600 economists signing a letter warning that her potential termination threatens the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson stated the GOP is committed to transparency and justice for Jeffrey Epstein's victims following an emotional meeting between survivors and lawmakers. However, the party is fractured on the methodology, with Johnson opposing a discharge petition filed by Rep. Thomas Massie that would force a vote on releasing the files. Johnson argues the House Oversight Committee's investigation is a better approach as it allows for the redaction of sensitive victim information. This internal conflict highlights the deep divisions and political pressures surrounding the controversial case.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. Space Command headquarters will move from Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama, reversing a Biden administration decision. Trump cited Alabama's strong support and criticized Colorado's mail-in voting system as a factor in the decision, calling it "corrupt." The move is expected to create over 30,000 jobs in the Republican-leaning state, which is already a hub for Army and NASA space operations. The announcement followed a week of public absence, which had fueled speculation about the president's health, a topic he dismissed as "fake news."</p>

This walkover sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejčíková in straight sets, 6-3 6-3. Vondroušová, the 2023 Wimbledon champion, has had a career marked by injuries and was seen with heavy strapping on her leg after cutting a practice session short.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has revealed that the company reduced its support staff from 9,000 to 5,000 employees as a direct result of implementing artificial intelligence. He explained that AI agents are now automating many customer service tasks, leading to a decline in support cases and eliminating the need to backfill certain roles. While Benioff emphasized that humans will work in partnership with AI, his comments highlight the tangible impact of AI on corporate workforces. The move reflects a broader trend in the tech industry of cutting staff while heavily investing in AI-driven efficiency.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin demonstrated resilience on Tuesday, rising over 1% to surpass the $110,000 mark even as traditional stock markets experienced a sell-off. The cryptocurrency's gain contrasted with a broader market downturn triggered by concerns over the legality of U.S. tariffs and a corresponding jump in bond yields. Meanwhile, gold surged to a new record high of over $3,500, reaffirming its status as a traditional safe-haven asset. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from similar economic uncertainty, its performance has also been influenced by a significant rotation of capital into Ethereum.

Despite the token's value dropping nearly 50% from its peak within two days of trading, the family's substantial holdings account for the massive valuation. The token gives holders governance rights over the company's financial decisions. This venture underscores President Trump's increasing embrace of the crypto industry, a shift from his previous skepticism, and has raised concerns among watchdog groups about potential conflicts of interest.

          <p>The Justice Department has authorized approximately 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges to address a massive case backlog and a recent decline in judicial staff. This move follows a change in qualification requirements, which no longer mandate prior immigration experience for these temporary roles. The immigration court system has been overwhelmed by an increase in arrests and has lost over 100 judges in the last nine months to firings and resignations. The military lawyers will receive about two weeks of training before being assigned to hear cases.</p>

          <p>Howard Webb, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has publicly acknowledged that a significant error was made in disallowing a goal for Fulham during their recent match against Chelsea. A goal scored by Fulham's Josh King was overturned after a lengthy VAR review identified a foul in the build-up, a decision Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that the intervention was a "misjudgement" and did not meet the high threshold required for VAR to overturn an on-field decision.

          <p>For individuals facing significant credit card debt, such as a $20,000 balance, several effective strategies can be employed to regain financial control. Options include working with a debt relief company for a management or settlement plan, or consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a potentially lower interest rate. Personal payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" (paying highest interest first) or "debt snowball" (paying smallest balance first) methods are also viable. Additionally, increasing income through a side hustle or taking out a home equity loan can provide the necessary funds to accelerate repayment. (not investment advice)</p>

This action is part of a broader Trump administration policy of deporting certain migrants to third-party countries.
