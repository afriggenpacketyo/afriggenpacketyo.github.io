          <h2>Lawyer Challenges Trump's Tariffs as Unlawful in Federal Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 14:21:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawyer representing small businesses argued in federal court that President Trump's tariffs are an unlawful expansion of executive power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Jeffrey Schwab of the Liberty Justice Center contended that the trade deficits cited by Trump do not meet the legal standard of a brief and rare emergency. The lawsuit, brought by several small businesses reliant on imports, claims the tariffs would cause irreparable harm. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that Congress allows the president to impose them, and Trump's declaration of a national emergency broadens his authority.</p>

Ventura described Combs' "freak-offs," drug-fueled sex marathons with prostitutes, and alleged physical assaults.

Combs' defense acknowledged his violent behavior but argued that his relationships were consensual, calling the civil lawsuits "money grabs."

Grocery prices saw a slight decline, particularly for eggs, though egg prices remain high due to bird flu outbreaks. Experts are closely watching for signs that Trump's tariffs are impacting consumer prices, but the effects may not be evident for several months due to front-loading of purchases and recent tariff easing.

          <p>State leaders are expressing concern over potential budgetary fallout from the Trump administration's economic agenda, which includes significant cuts to federal aid. Proposed reductions in areas like infrastructure, education, and health care could leave states struggling to maintain essential services. While Republicans argue that states should bear more financial responsibility, Democratic governors warn that they cannot absorb the federal cuts without significant consequences for their residents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is initiating a review process to potentially remove ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market. The agency cites concerns that ingested fluoride may alter the gut microbiome and be linked to thyroid disorders and decreased IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has long questioned fluoride's safety, while dental experts largely support its use for strengthening tooth enamel and reducing cavities. This action follows Kennedy's call to end community water fluoridation.</p>

Qatar itself earlier said the reports about the plane were "inaccurate", and that negotiations were continuing.

The article explains that economic improvements may not always translate to affordable living, especially when interest rates remain elevated. For those overwhelmed by debt, settling for less than what's owed can provide targeted relief and a path out of a debt cycle. The article also outlines how to determine if debt forgiveness is the right option, considering factors like unmanageable debt, delinquency, and access to a lump sum payment.</p>

          <p>Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) investors would be better off breaking up most or all of Google’s business as it struggles to prove that its search engine can maintain dominance in the AI chatbot era, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday. Luria said his clients — a broad range of institutional investors — want Google to undergo a “big bang breakup” rather than "isolated spinoffs" like the DOJ has suggested. He thinks Google should spin off each of its businesses into separately traded entities. According to Luria’s analysis, which used company earnings reports from Alphabet and rivals, Google’s individual businesses would be valued much more highly as separate entities.</p>
