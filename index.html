          <p>A farm worker has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an immigration raid at a California cannabis farm. The United Farm Workers union stated the death was a result of the enforcement action, while the Department of Homeland Security claimed the individual was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell. The incident, which led to the arrest of approximately 200 undocumented migrants, is part of a broader federal crackdown on illegal immigration. It has prompted protests and a legal challenge, resulting in a judge temporarily restricting certain aggressive arrest tactics.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to reach a high of 34C. The extreme heat has prompted amber health alerts for southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia, and wildfire warnings have been issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The conditions have also led to hosepipe bans affecting over seven million people in several regions due to record-level demand for drinking water. While impacting events like the Wimbledon tennis championships, the heatwave is expected to subside early next week as cooler Atlantic air moves in, bringing temperatures closer to the seasonal average.</p>

          <p>The Welsh national rugby team has ended an 18-match losing streak by defeating Japan 31-22 in a tense match in Kobe. This victory, their first in 644 days, allowed them to level the series at 1-1 and avoid setting a tier one record for successive international defeats. Wales established an early lead with tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams before holding off a determined second-half comeback from Japan. The win provides a significant morale boost for the team under interim head coach Matt Sherratt, concluding his tenure on a positive note before a new permanent coach is appointed.</p>

          <p>As France's far-right National Rally party gains popularity ahead of the 2027 presidential election, it is carefully managing its relationship with the Trump administration in the U.S. While ideologically aligned on many issues, the party maintains a cautious distance due to factors like potential U.S. tariffs harming its blue-collar voter base and a general skepticism of Trump among the French public. Party leader Marine Le Pen and president Jordan Bardella are balancing the potential benefits of association with a broader populist movement against the risks of alienating moderate voters needed for an electoral victory. This balancing act reflects the party's strategy to normalize its image and present itself as a viable governing force.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to consider a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a significant debate across Germany. The suggestion, aimed at improving educational outcomes by creating more mixed classroom compositions, has drawn criticism from school administrators, student bodies, and education researchers. Opponents argue that such a policy would be discriminatory, stigmatizing, and organizationally unfeasible, shifting the focus from the real issue of inadequate German language skills. The debate highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which faces performance issues and a need for reform, independent of students' backgrounds.</p>

          <p>The owner of a luxury penthouse in Mayfair, London, has been engaged in an eight-year legal battle with companies controlled by the family of the late Mohamed Al Fayed.

Court documents reveal a complex series of grievances and counterclaims, with the Fayed-controlled company seeking over £600,000 in unpaid ground rent and costs.

          <p>In an opinion piece, writer Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's announced plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah constitutes a plan for a crime against humanity. He contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, dating back to the 1948 Nakba, and that the current war has exposed the inability of global institutions to enforce their own rules. Despite this, Shehadeh finds hope not in legal frameworks but in the enduring resilience and sumoud (steadfastness) of the Palestinian people. He concludes that the world's accountability will ultimately be judged by its response to the humanitarian crisis and its support for rebuilding Gaza once hostilities end.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, which argued that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race, ethnicity, and location. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims that tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests were occurring. This order temporarily halts stops based solely on factors like skin color or speaking Spanish, marking a significant legal check on the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement operations.</p>

          <h2>Prada to Collaborate with Indian Artisans Following Backlash Over Sandal Design</h2>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for a design resembling traditional Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation. In response, Prada held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as an attempt to respectfully engage with the traditional community and address the backlash, while the Chamber is also pursuing a patent for the sandals to protect their cultural heritage.</p>

          <h2>Judge Allows Voice Actors' Lawsuit Against AI Firm Lovo to Proceed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 23:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices without permission to create and sell AI-generated voice clones after hiring them for what they were told were internal or research projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings as training data will proceed. The case represents a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over the use of creative work.</p>

          <h2>Air India Crash Investigation Deepens as Cockpit Audio Reveals Puzzling Final Moments</h2>

          <p>The investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has uncovered a mysterious cockpit recording from the flight's final seconds. Preliminary findings show that both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position shortly after takeoff, causing a total loss of engine power. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he activated the cut-off, with the other denying he did so, leaving the action unexplained. Investigators are now focused on identifying the voices and understanding why these critical switches, which have multiple safety features to prevent accidental use, were engaged at such a critical phase of flight.</p>

          <h2>Federal Authorities Arrest Approximately 200 in Raids on Southern California Cannabis Farms</h2>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities have confirmed the arrest of about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The Department of Homeland Security stated the operation was based on criminal warrants related to harboring and employment of undocumented immigrants. The raids prompted a tense standoff between protesters and federal agents in Camarillo, resulting in several injuries and the arrest of four U.S. citizens for allegedly assaulting officers. The event has intensified fear in local immigrant communities and has been met with a legal challenge, leading to a temporary halt on certain raid tactics by a federal judge.</p>
