          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded after being shot while responding to a wildfire near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Authorities believe the fire was intentionally set to lure the first responders into a deadly ambush. A tactical team later located the body of the suspected lone gunman in a wooded area near the fire, which had grown to approximately 20 acres. The incident prompted a large-scale law enforcement response, with officials describing it as a heinous and direct assault on public safety personnel.</p>

          <p>A social media post displaying McDonald's prices from 1991 has generated significant discussion among millennials on Reddit, sparking nostalgia for cheaper fast food. The graphic showed items like a 79-cent cheeseburger and a $1.85 Big Mac, leading to debates about both the cost and perceived quality of the food compared to today. While many fondly recalled the lower prices, others argued that when adjusted for inflation, the costs are comparable to modern prices, especially when using the company's app for deals. The discussion highlights generational perspectives on economic changes and consumer value.</p>

          <p>Amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions, security agencies have issued warnings about potential retaliatory attacks from Tehran-backed "sleeper cells" within the United States. This article analyzes the credibility of this threat, distinguishing between political rhetoric and the operational reality of Iran's clandestine capabilities. Experts suggest that while Iran likely maintains such cells for surveillance and targeted operations, a large-scale attack on U.S. soil remains a contingency for moments of existential desperation, not the current strategic environment. The analysis cautions against sensationalism while acknowledging the serious, albeit nuanced, nature of the national security risk.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chain Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC in annual U.S. sales, becoming the nation's third-largest chicken chain behind Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's success is attributed to its simple, focused menu of chicken fingers and its strategy of operating company-owned restaurants rather than franchising, ensuring quality control. With system sales reaching $5.1 billion last year and rapid expansion underway, the 28-year-old brand has seen remarkable growth. Founder Todd Graves aims for the chain to become a top 10 restaurant brand with over $10 billion in annual sales.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submission of both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-flu shot. The company plans to file for approval for both products later this year, with potential market availability in 2026. This development positions Moderna as a frontrunner in the race to market a combination respiratory vaccine.</p>

          <p>A new analysis argues that the global population is set to begin declining far earlier than official United Nations estimates, potentially starting around 2055 instead of the projected 2084. The article highlights that recent birth data from numerous countries, including Colombia and Thailand, are falling drastically below the UN's most pessimistic forecasts. Researcher JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde points out that the UN's models often assume fertility rates will rebound or stabilize, a projection that current trends contradict. This accelerated demographic shift signals profound future economic challenges, as many nations will face aging populations before achieving wealth.</p>

Examples include a university using funds for gym equipment and several provinces diverting over 15 billion yuan to cover basic public spending like civil-service wages or to falsely record expenditures.

The committee also criticized the product's complexity, its dual purpose for retirement and first-home savings, and "nonsensical" rules that penalize claimants of certain benefits.

Following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump, Canada announced it would drop the tax in anticipation of a broader trade deal.

          <p>This opinion piece by Robert Reich argues that the data analytics company Palantir, co-founded by Peter Thiel, represents a dangerous intersection of AI, military power, and the Trump administration's political agenda. The article warns that Palantir's contract to consolidate personal data from numerous federal agencies could create a super-database used to surveil and punish political opponents, immigrants, and critics. Reich frames Thiel and his associates as oligarchs intent on undermining democratic institutions, drawing parallels between the current era and the Gilded Age that preceded the rise of fascism.</p>

          <p>A group of over 200 disabled corporate workers at Amazon has accused the company of systemic discrimination, alleging that requests for legally mandated accommodations are often denied through automated systems. In a letter to executives, the workers claim that Amazon's policies on return-to-office mandates and accommodation procedures violate the Americans with Disabilities Act. The employees also allege that the company has retaliated against organizing efforts by repeatedly removing messages and a petition from an internal employee Slack channel. Amazon has disputed the allegations of discrimination and retaliation.</p>

Significantly, the scientists found that the common diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of this hearing loss in monkeys. These findings offer a new understanding of the condition and suggest a potential pathway for developing personalized treatments to combat age-related hearing decline in humans.</p>

This article explores how the pressure to hit high, often arbitrary, targets like 15,000 or 20,000 steps can lead to obsessive behavior and diminish the intrinsic motivation for movement. While tracking can be a useful tool for behavior change, experts warn that it can also make a leisurely activity feel like work.

          <p>The weather system formerly known as Tropical Storm Barry has weakened to a tropical depression after making landfall on Mexico's east coast, though it continues to bring heavy rain and a risk of flooding. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie has formed off Mexico's southwestern coast and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. The U.S. National Hurricane Center has issued tropical storm warnings for the southwestern coast of Mexico as Flossie is forecast to skirt the coastline for several days, bringing moderate rainfall to several states.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of intense Israeli airstrikes across the Gaza Strip has led to the mass displacement of hundreds of Palestinian families, according to witness reports. The bombardment targeted several densely populated eastern neighborhoods of Gaza City, including a school that was sheltering displaced people. Rescue teams have recovered at least five bodies from the rubble. The attacks followed one of the largest evacuation orders issued since the war resumed, compounding the severe humanitarian crisis as displaced families are once again forced into the streets with no food or water.</p>
