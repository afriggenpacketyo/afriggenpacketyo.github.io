        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's government, led by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, was ousted after losing a no-confidence vote, deepening the country's political crisis. The collapse was triggered by a deadlock over the 2026 budget, which aimed for significant spending cuts to reduce the national deficit. President Emmanuel Macron now faces difficult choices, including appointing a fifth prime minister in under two years or calling another snap election, which could empower far-right or far-left parties. This instability occurs as France faces pressure to implement fiscal consolidation, with credit rating agencies closely monitoring the situation.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has issued a comprehensive evacuation order for all residents of Gaza City, warning that it will soon operate "with great force" in the area. The directive urges civilians to move south to Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian zone, as part of Israel's stated objective to eliminate Hamas. This order follows Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's approval of a plan to seize the city, where ground operations have been ongoing. Many residents remain, citing the inability to afford transport, lack of space in safe zones, or fear for their safety even after evacuating.</p>

As Formula 1's popularity soars, sponsorship revenue has become a significant income stream for teams, with financial services being the second-largest contributing sector.

In the message, part of a "birthday book" compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, Mandelson described the convicted sex offender as his "best pal" and an "intelligent, sharp-witted man." The document was released as part of a larger trove of Epstein-related files from his estate. A spokesperson for Lord Mandelson stated that he has long expressed deep regret for ever having been introduced to Epstein.</p>

          <p>Michael Clune, author of the heroin addiction memoir "White Out," has written a new novel titled "Pan," which delves into the subjective and terrifying experience of adolescent panic attacks. The book's protagonist, Nicholas, navigates high school in the 1990s while besieged by anxiety that he comes to interpret not as a medical condition but as an encounter with the mischievous Greek god, Pan. The review praises Clune's uncanny ability to capture the visceral feeling of a panic attack, describing the novel as a blend of coming-of-age story and philosophical inquiry. It's a narrative that seeks to transform the horror of anxiety into a quest for higher meaning.</p>

          <p>While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a year, it remains significantly higher than the historic lows seen during the pandemic. Financial experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure a more favorable rate. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, as a higher FICO score directly translates to better loan terms. Additionally, providing a larger down payment and considering alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage, can also result in significant savings.

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed his country's commitment to strengthening strategic ties with North Korea in a message to its leader, Kim Jong-un. The message, sent to mark the 77th anniversary of North Korea's founding, described the relationship as an "unwavering strategic policy." This declaration of solidarity comes shortly after a historic visit by Kim to Beijing, where he appeared alongside Xi and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Xi stated that China is ready to enhance communication and cooperation to advance the friendship between the two nations and contribute to regional peace.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent National Conservatism Conference suggests the movement, while politically triumphant, is struggling with internal divisions, particularly over antisemitism. Yoram Hazony, one of the movement's Jewish founders, expressed surprise at the rise of anti-Jewish sentiment on the post-liberal right. The article argues this development is unsurprising given the movement's nativist and theocratic rhetoric, which often defines American identity in exclusionary, Christian terms. The rehabilitation of figures like Pat Buchanan indicates a growing comfort with ideas once banished from mainstream conservatism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing trend of institutional investors like Blackstone buying single-family homes to rent them out has drawn bipartisan criticism for making homeownership less affordable. However, recent research suggests a more nuanced impact on neighborhoods. While these corporate landlords can drive up sale prices, they also increase the availability of rental housing in suburban areas, which can make these communities more accessible to lower-income and nonwhite families. This creates a trade-off, potentially increasing diversity and access to better schools for some, while making it harder for middle-class families to purchase their first home.</p>

However, foreign policy experts suggest India is not abandoning its partnership with Washington but pursuing a policy of "multi-alignment" to maintain strategic autonomy.

The brief, unsigned decision allows ICE and Border Patrol to restart aggressive immigration sweeps that were halted by a lawsuit from the ACLU. The lawsuit claimed agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on their appearance and the type of work they do.

In Afghanistan, the closure of U.S.-funded health clinics preceded a recent earthquake, and the lack of American logistical support has slowed the response. This retreat from a long-held role as a primary funder and coordinator of emergency aid has created a massive logistical and financial vacuum.

While Trump publicizes the donation of his presidential salary, his family has launched ventures, including cryptocurrency tokens, that have generated billions in paper wealth since his return to office. The analysis points to the public trading of his media company and the sale of Trump-branded merchandise as further examples. It contends that these ventures leverage the presidency to attract investors, creating potential conflicts of interest and turning the office into a personal "cash grab."</p>

While this increased interest is a positive development for HBCUs, it also presents challenges, as many applicants require financial aid that these institutions, despite lower tuition, struggle to fully provide due to more limited resources.</p>
