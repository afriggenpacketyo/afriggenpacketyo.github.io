          <p>A recent study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The research, involving over one million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in vaccinated individuals. The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, those under 60, and individuals with unhealthy lifestyles. Researchers believe that preventing shingles through vaccination may reduce blood vessel damage and inflammation that can lead to heart issues.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a $2.5 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs, although the company aims to offset $1 billion of this impact through remediation efforts and pricing strategies. The suspension is attributed to near-term risks such as potential supply chain disruptions and the possibility of increased tariffs. This action follows a similar guidance reduction by General Motors, reflecting the broader automotive industry's struggle with the financial implications of the tariffs, which include levies on imported vehicles and auto parts.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have resulted in numerous delays and cancellations. Schumer points to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, DOGE cuts at the FAA, and outdated technology as contributing factors. He is also questioning why Newark was excluded from a bonus program offered to air traffic controllers. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily at Newark, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to release a plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>China's e-commerce giants like Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan are engaged in a new battleground called "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. Consumers in major cities can order a wide range of products, from iced tea to fast fashion, and have them delivered within an hour, often subsidized to be very cheap. Despite China's advanced transport and warehousing infrastructure, this intensified competition is causing investor concern, as it suggests limited room for further growth and forces platforms into a zero-sum game.

          <p>The Trump administration is urging a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, challenging the FDA's expanded access to mifepristone. Justice Department lawyers argue that the states lack legal standing and that the case was filed in an improper venue. This stance aligns with an earlier request from the Biden administration to dismiss the challenge, which seeks to roll back changes allowing mifepristone to be taken later in pregnancy and dispensed through the mail. The administration asserts that the states waited too long to challenge the FDA's actions, which began in 2016.</p>

          <p>Hollywood executives are struggling to understand President Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S., a move intended to revitalize the American film industry. The proposal has sparked confusion and dread, with questions arising about its implementation and potential impact on studios that frequently shoot films in countries offering financial incentives. Some industry figures hope for a national tax credit instead of tariffs, arguing that the latter could increase costs and harm the industry. The article also mentions a plan presented to Trump by Jon Voight and his manager, which included limited tariffs, tax incentives, and infrastructure subsidies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice is investigating a new Washington state law that requires clergy members to report confessions of child abuse or neglect, citing potential First Amendment violations. The law, which adds clergy to the list of mandatory reporters without exception for the seal of confession, is being scrutinized for potentially infringing on religious protections. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon argues that the law forces Catholic priests to violate their faith and singles out clergy compared to other reporting professionals. The investigation will examine whether the law unconstitutionally restricts the free exercise of religion.</p>

The pause includes medical research funding, and the university is under investigation by several federal agencies for various accusations, including failure to disclose foreign gifts and discrimination within the Harvard Law Review.

          <p>President Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, pushing the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. However, U.S. drivers are paying $3.165 per gallon on average. Trump was likely referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which did touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect what drivers are currently paying at the pump, as it tracks wholesale, unfinished gasoline before other costs are included. Analysts say the RBOB price is irrelevant to consumers because they are not paying the wholesale price.</p>

While few in the industry said that they understood Mr. Trump’s proposal, some worried that tariffs could cause more harm than good and called instead for federal help in the form of tax credits.</p>
