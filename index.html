          <p>Cooper Flagg, the first overall pick in the NBA draft, recently made his debut for the Dallas Mavericks in the Las Vegas Summer League. Despite a self-described poor first game, he demonstrated significant playmaking and defensive skills, following up with a 31-point performance in his second appearance. The 18-year-old phenom from Maine is widely considered one of the most complete teenage prospects in decades, drawing comparisons to NBA legends for his intense work ethic and focus. His reserved, professional demeanor off the court further highlights his singular dedication to basketball and continuous improvement.</p>

          <p>China has decreased its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities for the third month in a row, bringing its total to the lowest point since March 2009. According to U.S. Treasury data, Beijing's holdings fell to $756.3 billion, dropping China to the third-largest foreign holder of U.S. debt. This ongoing reduction occurs amidst persistent trade tensions and concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling. An economist from the China Chief Economists Forum noted that while direct financial sanctions are unlikely, the financial sector could emerge as a new area of conflict.</p>

          <p>The German government has resumed deportation flights to Afghanistan, sending back 81 Afghan men with criminal records. This marks the first such collective repatriation under the new government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz, which aims to increase deportations to the country. The move fulfills a coalition agreement to remove criminals and individuals deemed a threat, despite criticism from human rights groups over the situation under the Taliban regime. The operation was conducted with logistical support from Qatar, and deportees were given a cash sum to cover initial expenses upon their return.</p>

          <p>Government data reveals that serious water pollution incidents in England rose by 60% in 2024, reaching the highest number on record. These events, which have a significant environmental impact and pose risks to human health, were largely attributed to three companies: Thames Water, Southern Water, and Yorkshire Water. A cross-party parliamentary committee described the level of pollution as "woeful," criticizing regulators for failing to hold water companies accountable for infrastructure maintenance. Despite increased rainfall last year, these discharges represent a breach of the companies' legal obligations to protect the nation's waterways.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that its flagship late-night program, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," will end its run in May 2026. The network stated the cancellation is a purely financial decision and is not related to the show's content or performance. Host Stephen Colbert, who has been a prominent critic of Donald Trump, informed his audience during a taping, confirming that the show will not be replaced, ending the network's three-decade presence in late-night comedy.

          <p>British MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party for a second time following comments she made differentiating between racism based on skin color and other forms of prejudice. In a recent BBC interview, she defended a controversial 2023 letter, stating it's obvious the party leadership wants her out. The suspension means she will sit as an independent MP pending a new investigation. This development underscores ongoing tensions within the Labour Party regarding discipline and its approach to antisemitism, with prominent figures both criticizing and defending her statements.</p>

          <p>The recent move by India's securities regulator to ban high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has brought the complex distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into focus. The regulator accused the firm of deliberately distorting India's Nifty 50 index to profit from options trades, a charge Jane Street disputes as standard arbitrage. Financial experts explain that the key difference lies in intent, or 'mens rea.' While arbitrage exploits existing price inefficiencies, manipulation involves actively creating those inefficiencies, particularly by influencing less liquid markets to benefit positions in more liquid ones, which regulators argue was the case here.</p>

This development adds another layer to the ongoing controversy surrounding the Epstein case and the demands for transparency from some of Trump's own supporters.</p>

          <p>HMP Pentonville in London has been placed under special measures after a damning inspection revealed shocking failures, including illegally detaining inmates past their release dates. The chief inspector of prisons issued an urgent notification citing "frightening conditions," such as cockroach and mice infestations, severe overcrowding, and chaotic procedures for new arrivals. Inspectors found that staff had failed to accurately calculate sentences, leading to release errors, and discovered dangerously poor oversight of prisoners at risk of suicide. The report calls for significant investment and leadership changes to address the systemic problems at the Victorian-era prison.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a Trump administration plan to rescind $9 billion in federal funds, a move that eliminates all federal support for NPR and PBS and cuts billions from foreign aid. The bill passed the House by a slim 216-to-213 vote and now heads to the president's desk. The cuts will force the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to lose $1.1 billion, a decision NPR's CEO called an "irreversible loss" that will dismantle local civic institutions, especially in rural and underserved areas. The move has been criticized by Democrats as a betrayal of bipartisan agreements.</p>

          <p>Dozens of regions across Russia are experiencing widespread and unpredictable shutdowns of mobile internet service, a measure officials claim is necessary to counter Ukrainian drone attacks. The disruptions, which began in May, have spread from border regions to as far as Siberia, causing significant problems for daily life, including failures in electronic payments and navigation apps. While the Kremlin justifies the shutdowns on security grounds, digital rights experts warn the measures are unprecedented in scale. They fear it legitimizes a tool that could be used to further curtail already-stifled internet freedom in the country.</p>

House Speaker Mike Johnson and other Republicans framed the passage as a key victory for fiscal responsibility and a step toward controlling government spending.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump has linked the potential tariffs to the ongoing legal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula described the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and a grave attack on Brazil's national sovereignty, calling Brazilian politicians who support Trump's stance "traitors." The escalating dispute comes as Trump has publicly expressed sympathy for Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over an alleged coup attempt following his 2022 election loss to Lula.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood expectation that adults have everything figured out. The piece explores the idea that most people are 'winging it' through a continuous process of becoming. Drawing a parallel to the French comedy show "Bref," the author discusses themes of aging, regret, and identity, particularly as an immigrant who feels neither fully American nor fully French. Ultimately, the author embraces the uncertainty of life, finding value in relationships, self-acceptance, and remaining open to the unexpected, even amidst a turbulent world.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has fulfilled a lifelong dream by successfully building and piloting his own 7-meter-long submarine. The inventor, identified only as Zhang, was fascinated by machines since childhood but was inspired to build an underwater vessel after seeing one on a television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the submarine. His creation has since become a local spectacle, drawing stares from villagers as he navigates it through a quiet river near his home.</p>

          <p>A prominent index measuring China's level of marketization has declined, prompting calls from Chinese economists for renewed pro-market reforms to address economic imbalances. The report from the National Economic Research Institute showed the country's overall marketization score fell in 2023 from its 2021 peak. The most significant deterioration was in the sub-index for government-market relations, which tracks the reduction of government intervention in the economy. Researchers highlighted this as a significant change, urging action to reverse the trend and combat issues like inefficient resource allocation and intense intra-industry competition.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and meeting economists' expectations. The slowdown was partly driven by an easing in the rapid rise of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite the moderation, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent inflationary pressures and the risk of a depreciating yen could still pose challenges to the country's economic landscape.

          <p>This analysis questions CBS's stated financial reasons for ending 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' suggesting the decision may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Donald Trump. The article argues that the network, under its current ownership, has eroded its legacy of journalistic independence, citing the controversial settlement of Trump's lawsuit against '60 Minutes' as a key example. While CBS insists the cancellation is a business decision, the author posits that sacrificing a top-rated, Trump-critical host could be a strategic move to ensure federal approval for parent company Paramount's pending merger with Skydance.</p>
