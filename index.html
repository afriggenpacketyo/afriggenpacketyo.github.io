          <p>A long-standing succession dispute within the Murdoch family's media conglomerate has concluded with an agreement that places Lachlan Murdoch in control of a new trust. The deal ensures the continued conservative direction of properties like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. As part of the arrangement, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will be bought out for a reported $1.1 billion each, ending their influence over the company's editorial stance and resolving all related litigation.</p>

          <p>A Fort Myers, Florida country radio station, WHEL 93.7 FM, has rebranded itself as "Trump Country," utilizing Donald Trump's image, likeness, and campaign-style branding. The station, which uses the slogan "Make Country Great Again," has reportedly tripled its ratings since the change, reflecting the former president's strong support in the region. The general manager, who is also a Republican congressional candidate, stated the station did not seek permission for the branding, viewing it as a form of comedy and a unique commercial media strategy.</p>

The author argues that attacks on "divisive" museum exhibits or calls for a more "patriotic" curriculum are not mere culture wars, but ideological tools used to justify rolling back civil rights legislation and democratic protections won in the 20th century. The piece calls for cross-communal solidarity to resist these efforts.</p>
