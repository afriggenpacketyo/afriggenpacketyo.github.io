        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage confidently predicts the impending collapse of the Scottish Conservatives, as his party now consistently outpolls them and has seen multiple MSPs defect. Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay faces immense pressure, with a strategic shift to the right risking alienation of his party's moderate voter base, which was crucial to past successes. This political realignment is drawing parallels to Labour's fragmentation after the 2014 independence referendum, suggesting a significant reshaping of Scotland's political landscape. The upcoming Holyrood election next May is anticipated to be a fiercely contested battle, with Reform poised to make substantial electoral gains, potentially at the expense of established parties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's film "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life unravels into a violent crime caper in a gritty 1998 New York City. Following a car accident and an unfortunate cat-sitting gig, Hank finds himself pursued by various criminal factions, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, alongside a skeptical NYPD detective. The article praises Aronofsky's evocative portrayal of the city's pre-millennial underbelly, coated in "graffiti, booze or bodily fluids," and Butler's compelling performance as a self-loathing protagonist grappling with squandered potential. The narrative masterfully blends menace and dark humor, offering an intimate yet unromanticized tour of a chaotic urban environment.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are currently experiencing a significant bull run, with one software engineer reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating an additional 20% through early next year. This robust optimism is largely fueled by government pledges to stabilize and boost the stock market amidst a shaky broader economy. The strategy aims to create a "wealth effect" that will, in turn, spur increased consumption across the nation, despite underlying economic challenges. Traders are strategically concentrating their equity exposure on high-beta stocks within the new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors, anticipating further market stabilization and a strong comeback.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to attend China's World War Two Victory Day parade in Beijing, marking his first visit in over six years and a significant diplomatic event alongside Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. This gathering commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender and will showcase China's latest military capabilities, underscoring Xi's ambition for a new world order. The meeting provides Xi with a crucial opportunity to gain insights from both leaders before potential discussions with US President Donald Trump, thereby solidifying Beijing's growing geopolitical influence. The notable absence of most Western leaders highlights the deepening divisions in international relations.</p>

Japan is actively pushing for an amendment to a presidential order that would lower tariffs on automobiles and auto parts to 15%, seeking an arrangement similar to one made with the European Union to prevent tariff stacking. The Bank of Japan has warned that these persistent uncertainties and US tariffs are projected to negatively impact Japan's exports, industrial production, and corporate profits in the near future. Discussions are set to continue at an administrative level to resolve these critical sticking points.</p>

          <p>CDC Director Susan Monarez, confirmed just four weeks prior, is in a standoff with the Trump administration, firmly refusing to resign despite a White House statement declaring her termination. Her lawyers argue the dismissal is legally deficient and stems from her unwavering commitment to "protecting the public" over "a political agenda," specifically her refusal to endorse "unscientific, reckless directives" regarding COVID vaccine policy and staff firings. This profound dispute has triggered a wave of high-level resignations from senior CDC officials, who explicitly cite the "weaponization of public health" as their reason for leaving.

          <p>Florida is deploying an innovative strategy to combat invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades: 120 robot rabbits designed to lure and detect the destructive snakes. These solar-powered robotic decoys mimic real rabbits by emitting heat, scent, and natural movements, with integrated cameras alerting python hunters when a snake is nearby. This new approach aims to overcome the challenge of locating pythons, which are decimating native wildlife and have few natural enemies. Previous attempts using live rabbits proved too expensive. Officials express optimism about the early results of this costly yet promising detection method in controlling the rapidly reproducing python population.</p>

          <p>JD Property, the unlisted infrastructure investment and asset management platform of JD.com, is reportedly establishing a US$1 billion Singapore Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) in partnership with Swiss investment firm Partners Group and EZA Hill Property.

The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit for S$306 million, which are expected to form part of the new REIT's initial asset composition.

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of China's central bank, has urged a measured approach and "multidimensional assessment" regarding the global surge in stablecoins, warning against their excessive use for asset speculation. He cautioned that such speculation could trigger fraud and instability within the financial system. Zhou emphasized that some industry players might exploit stablecoin hype primarily to boost valuations for quick cash-outs, rather than focusing on sustainable business models, which could accumulate systemic risks detrimental to healthy financial development. His comments come as the US and Hong Kong develop regulatory frameworks, with ongoing speculation about China potentially introducing yuan-backed stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese envoy has issued a warning against fostering "fear and hostility" as the US government plans a significant revamp of its visa policies that will directly impact Chinese journalists, students, and scholars. The proposed rule by the US Department of Homeland Security seeks to cap stays for mainland Chinese journalists at 90 days and for international students and scholars on F and J visas at no longer than four years. The department cites challenges in monitoring and overseeing these non-immigrants as the reason for the changes. The envoy urged for the promotion of "win-win cooperation" and people-to-people exchanges instead of pursuing "decoupling" and erecting barriers.</p>

          <p>The US has reportedly told Denmark to "calm down" after its top diplomat in Copenhagen was summoned over allegations of covert American influence operations in Greenland. Danish public broadcaster DR reported that individuals with connections to President Trump were attempting to promote Greenland's secession to the US, a claim the White House official did not confirm. Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen called any interference in the Kingdom's internal affairs "unacceptable," while Danish intelligence warned of "various kinds of influence campaigns." This diplomatic spat follows President Trump's past interest in annexing Greenland and coincides with a separate dispute over a Danish wind farm project, adding complexity to US-Danish relations.</p>

          <p>Nevada's state government was severely impacted by a "sophisticated ransomware-based cybersecurity attack" that disrupted essential services statewide and potentially compromised personal information. Initially, Governor Joe Lombardo stated there were no signs of data theft, but later, the state's chief information officer confirmed evidence of data exfiltration. The attack crippled DMV offices and prevented law enforcement from accessing state records, highlighting the acute vulnerability of smaller government agencies to such cyber threats. Cybersecurity experts note a growing trend of ransomware attacks on state and local governments, emphasizing the critical need for robust defenses and proactive information sharing to prevent similar incidents.</p>

          <p>Jelena Ostapenko and Taylor Townsend engaged in a heated post-match confrontation at the US Open after Townsend's 7-5, 6-1 victory. Ostapenko accused Townsend of unsportsmanlike conduct, specifically for not apologizing after a net ball in a crucial moment and for her warm-up routine. Townsend, in turn, claimed Ostapenko insulted her by saying she had "no class, no education," and made a veiled threat about what would happen "outside the US." Townsend, who is Black, later addressed the "no education" comment, noting its historical stigma, while Ostapenko vehemently denied any allegations of racism.

          <p>Pre-owned Tesla Cybertrucks are experiencing an "unprecedented" plummet in value, with the average price dropping nearly 30% in the past year to just over $84,000.

Experts attribute the downturn partly to CEO Elon Musk and persistent negative public feedback regarding the vehicle. The Cybertruck's release price, which ultimately doubled earlier estimates, combined with its dwindling resale value, is causing many drivers and industry observers to question its long-term viability in the automotive market.
