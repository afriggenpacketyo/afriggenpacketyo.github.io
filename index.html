          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company announced significantly improved second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street expectations. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and a dramatically reduced net loss of $4.7 million, attributing the success to a recovering box office and increased attendance. CEO Adam Aron highlighted the company's progress in managing its debt and noted record-breaking revenue per patron, driven by growth in premium offerings.

          <p>Ticketing giant StubHub is reportedly moving forward with its initial public offering (IPO), aiming for a September debut after pausing its plans in April due to market volatility. The company, which was reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker in 2020, has filed an updated prospectus showing revenue growth but also a widening net loss. The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, with several tech and crypto firms recently going public.

          <p>President Trump has invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act to place the city's Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control, citing concerns over violent crime. The 1973 act allows the president to assume control for up to 30 days for federal purposes, a move D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser called "unsettling and unprecedented." While Republicans praised the action as a necessary step to restore order, Democrats have condemned it as a power grab and a distraction, noting that D.C.'s violent crime rates have recently fallen. The move has intensified the debate over D.C. statehood and local governance autonomy.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration is actively considering the reclassification of marijuana under federal law, a move that could happen within weeks. This statement prompted a significant rally in cannabis stocks, as reclassification would have major implications for the industry, including changes to tax regulations and increased access to institutional investment. Currently, cannabis is a Schedule I drug, alongside substances like heroin; a potential move to Schedule III would be a "game changer" for the market. Industry leaders are optimistic that the president's public engagement on the issue signals a high likelihood of impending reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly defended Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan after President Trump called for his resignation over alleged conflicts of interest. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, described Trump's attack as "artless bullying" and a "vindictive political sideshow." He urged Intel's board to show "backbone" and support Tan, citing his successful turnaround of Cadence Design Systems as evidence of his capability to lead Intel's transformation. Following the pressure, Tan visited the White House to discuss Intel's collaboration with the U.S. government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order delaying the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The extension was an expected outcome of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. Without the delay, U.S. duties on Chinese imports would have reverted to the peak levels seen in April, which were as high as 145%. This move illustrates the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused or altered with little advance notice for businesses.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the increasing use of facial recognition and ID checks for online age verification, as mandated by laws like the UK's Online Safety Act, is a flawed approach to internet safety. The author, an anti-surveillance advocate, demonstrates how he easily bypassed the security of a dating app by using a static photo, highlighting the system's vulnerabilities. The piece contends that such mandates erode online anonymity and create new security risks by centralizing sensitive data, without effectively preventing access to harmful content.

          <p>Citing research from Melius Research, this analysis explores the disruptive threat artificial intelligence poses to the traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, prompting a ratings downgrade for Salesforce. The core argument is that AI tools will enable companies to reduce their workforce, thereby shrinking the market for "seat-based" software licenses from companies like Salesforce and Adobe. While Salesforce is actively developing its own AI tools like Agentforce to adapt, the changing landscape creates significant uncertainty. The article compares this shift to the rise of cloud computing, which disrupted on-premise data center providers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study suggests the global transition to clean energy could face significant shortages of key minerals, but this article argues that such "peak mineral" fears may be premature. Just as technological advancements like fracking overcame "peak oil" concerns, rapid innovation in green technology is already reducing reliance on scarce materials. For example, battery manufacturers are moving away from cobalt, and solar panel makers are using less silver. While mining more minerals is necessary, the dynamic nature of technology, potential for substitutes, and government investment could mitigate the forecasted shortfalls.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska and will attempt to negotiate the return of some occupied Ukrainian territory. Trump characterized the summit as a "feel-out meeting" to urge Putin to end the war, stating he would know quickly if a deal was possible. He mentioned he would update European allies and speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before and after the talks. The announcement has been met with caution from Ukraine, with Zelensky stating that any deal made without Kyiv's involvement would be a "dead decision."</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared that gold will not be subject to tariffs, overriding a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face a 39% duty, causing the precious metal's price to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on social media, gold futures dropped significantly. The ruling would have applied to key types of gold bars used to back futures contracts on the COMEX exchange, potentially disrupting the international flow of physical gold.

          <p>The Trump administration has struck an unusual deal with Nvidia and AMD, granting them export licenses to sell specific AI chips to China in exchange for 15% of the revenue. This arrangement, described as an "indirect tariff at source," allows the companies to re-enter the lucrative Chinese market, which investors see as a net positive despite the revenue cut. The move highlights the administration's transactional approach to trade and national security, treating semiconductor technology as a unique strategic asset. While this provides short-term certainty, it raises questions about future government interventions and China's reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have uncovered an extensive collection of animal remains in a Norwegian cave, providing the oldest known evidence of Arctic biodiversity from a warmer period of the last Ice Age. The 75,000-year-old fossils include a wide range of species, from lemmings and fish to whales and a polar bear. The find fills a major gap in understanding how ecosystems responded to past climate change. DNA analysis revealed that the ancient animal lineages did not survive the subsequent refreezing of the glaciers, offering a stark warning about the vulnerability of cold-adapted species to rapid climatic shifts.</p>

Shearer criticized the club's lack of a chief executive and sporting director, questioning who is making key decisions.

Extreme heat warnings remain in effect for the Antelope Valley and Mojave Desert, with temperatures reaching up to 110 degrees.
