        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge a federal court's ruling that deemed its country-specific tariffs illegal. The administration argues that the lower court's decision undermines the president's authority to manage foreign policy and protect national security. The case centers on whether President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose levies, a power the appeals court stated belongs to Congress. The Supreme Court is expected to take up the case, with a potential decision impacting the future of the administration's trade agenda.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights how China's industrial policy, "Made in China 2025," is successfully transforming the nation into a high-tech powerhouse. Launched a decade ago, the plan strategically targeted key sectors like information technology, where China was previously a follower rather than an innovator. Through coordinated central leadership, flexible local implementation, and significant state funding, the policy has systematically addressed structural weaknesses. This institutionalized approach has been pivotal in elevating China's capacity for hi-tech innovation and moving its manufacturing focus away from low-tech products, paving the way for global tech leadership.</p>

          <p>Following Representative Jerry Nadler's announcement of his retirement, speculation has arisen about who will seek his influential New York congressional seat. A spokesperson for Chelsea Clinton confirmed she will not run, dismissing rumors of her candidacy. In contrast, John F. Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, has indicated that a campaign is "certainly a possibility," signaling potential political ambitions. Nadler's departure after over three decades opens up a key Democratic stronghold, potentially setting the stage for a high-profile primary race as a new generation of political figures considers entering the field.</p>

The company credited collaborations with actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce for boosting customer engagement and sales, leading to an optimistic forecast for the coming months. Despite a controversial ad featuring Sweeney that sparked public debate, the campaign proved highly successful, selling out her signature jeans within a week. The company expects the positive momentum to continue with future celebrity partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Survivors and victims' families from the 2023 Lewiston, Maine mass shooting are suing the U.S. government, alleging the U.S. Army was aware the shooter, an Army reservist, posed a significant threat due to severe mental health issues but failed to follow its own procedures to disarm him. The lawsuit cites numerous red flags and warnings from fellow soldiers and family that were allegedly ignored by Army leadership. This legal action, filed on behalf of over a hundred plaintiffs, seeks accountability for the attack that killed 18 people and aims to compel changes to prevent similar future tragedies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has voided the Trump administration's freeze on $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal and retaliatory. The court found the administration imposed the freeze after Harvard refused to comply with demands that violated First Amendment rights, such as ending diversity programs and screening students for ideological bias. Judge Allison Burroughs described the move as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" and stated the administration used antisemitism as a pretext for its actions. The ruling lifts the freeze on numerous critical research projects, though the White House has announced its intention to appeal.</p>

Moreno's lawsuit states her job responsibilities were stripped and a pay raise was denied before her termination.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has introduced a novel stimulus measure to encourage consumer spending: offering subsidies for large banquets. Under the new policy, individuals hosting events with five or more tables and spending over 10,000 yuan (US$700) will be eligible for subsidies up to 5,000 yuan. This initiative is part of a broader local government effort to invigorate the economy by boosting consumption in sectors like catering, retail, and housing. The move highlights the creative, and sometimes unusual, methods local officials are employing to stimulate economic growth amid national pressures to both encourage spending and curb extravagance.</p>

          <p>An article explores the phenomenon of some Gen Z members creating a facade of a luxurious travel lifestyle on social media, often funded by debt or clever staging. It details how young adults may book a single night at a high-end rental with friends or use day passes at exclusive resorts solely to capture photos that suggest a prolonged, lavish vacation. This curated online image can be a business strategy, with one entrepreneur reportedly turning a fabricated persona into $180,000 in annual brand partnerships. However, this trend also reflects a willingness to go into debt for travel, with many applications for "vacation funding" loans.</p>

          <p>China showcased a formidable array of advanced military hardware during a recent parade in Beijing, revealing new capabilities in drones, artificial intelligence, and long-range missiles. Among the new weapons displayed were the LY-1 laser weapon, a giant uncrewed submarine drone, and AI-powered "robotic wolves." The parade also featured new nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as the DF-5C, which is said to have an extended range and the ability to carry multiple warheads. This demonstration of military modernization underscores China's ambition to augment and potentially replace traditional military structures with high-tech, autonomous systems.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in Montana's Blackfoot Valley are challenging the conventional food system to ensure their long-term survival against threats from corporate agriculture and climate change. The Mannix family, along with other local ranchers in the Old Salt Co-op, are implementing regenerative ranching techniques, which involve rotating cattle to allow land to rest and recover, improving soil health and grass production. They are also bypassing large meatpackers by processing a portion of their livestock locally and selling directly to consumers through their own butcher shop and restaurants. This model aims to create a more resilient and economically viable system for local producers.</p>

          <p>The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the UK's main federation of trade unions, is calling on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider implementing wealth taxes to fund public services. The TUC suggests options like equalizing capital gains tax with income tax, increasing taxes on bank profits, or introducing a direct wealth tax, citing Spain's economic growth as an example of its success. The union group argues that with banks reporting record profits, they should be asked to pay a fairer share. The Treasury responded by stating the government believes it has already achieved the right balance in taxing the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has issued a stern warning to Israel, stating that any move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a "red line" and would undermine the 2020 Abraham Accords that normalized relations. An Emirati official emphasized that such an action would effectively end the possibility of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The warning came in response to a proposal by Israel's far-right finance minister to annex approximately 80% of the West Bank. The UAE's statement underscores the significant diplomatic risks Israel faces with its regional partners over its settlement policies.</p>

The Democratic National Committee intervened, arguing the demand violated federal law. Under the new agreement, these voters will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot and provide the necessary information at the polling place, thus ensuring their vote can be counted.</p>

An internal CDC document confirmed the appointments, which include a semi-retired transplant surgeon, an emergency medicine specialist, and a pediatric neurologist.

However, U.S. officials will only release them for air travel, for which they lack the necessary visas, creating a legal limbo.

Currently, Florida, like all other states, requires students to be vaccinated against diseases like polio, measles, and chickenpox, though it allows for religious exemptions.

This decision affects a group granted protections by the Biden administration in 2021 and follows an earlier termination for a separate group of 350,000 Venezuelans. The Department of Homeland Security argued that maintaining the program acts as a "magnet" for illegal immigration and undermines border security efforts.
