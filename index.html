          <p>An explosion at the Horizon Biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, has resulted in the deaths of an adult male employee and two young girls. The children, both under 12, were reportedly at the facility waiting for the man to attend a doctor's appointment with them. The blast caused significant structural damage to the plant, and a subsequent fire hampered initial rescue efforts, which later shifted to a recovery operation. The incident has been described as a tragedy by local officials, deeply affecting the community of about 27,000 people.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old student has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers during a violent altercation at Manchester Airport in July of the previous year. The man was convicted of causing actual bodily harm to one officer, breaking her nose, and assaulting another emergency worker. The jury could not reach a verdict on a separate assault charge involving a male officer, and prosecutors are seeking a retrial. The incident, captured on mobile phones, highlighted the risks officers face, with police officials condemning the level of violence displayed.</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democratic leaders has accused President Trump of making significant concessions to China that undermine U.S. national security and economic interests. They criticized the administration's decisions to allow the sale of certain Nvidia AI chips to China and to deny a planned stopover in the U.S. for Taiwan's president. The senators argue these moves cede leverage in trade negotiations without achieving any substantial breakthroughs, effectively weakening the American position against its primary geopolitical adversary. The White House has not yet responded to the criticism.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores President Trump's persistent public campaign to pressure Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell into cutting interest rates, a move that flouts historical norms of central bank independence. While Trump desires lower rates for a short-term economic boost, forcing Powell out would be legally dubious and could create market chaos, potentially leading to higher long-term rates. This situation highlights the very reason for the Fed's political independence: to prevent short-term political goals from overriding long-term economic stability and inflation control. The markets themselves may serve as the ultimate check on the president's actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is advising investors to purchase Starbucks shares, viewing their decline after a recent earnings report as a buying opportunity. Despite the stock giving up its initial post-earnings gains, Cramer expressed a high level of conviction in the company's turnaround plan under CEO Brian Niccol. He compared his current confidence in Starbucks to his earlier bullish stance on Chipotle before its significant stock appreciation. The recommendation suggests a belief that the market is overlooking the long-term potential of the coffee giant's strategic recovery efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula generated a tsunami that has traveled across the Pacific, with waves reaching Japan, Hawaii, and the U.S. West Coast. Tsunami warnings and advisories prompted evacuations in many coastal areas, although initial waves in Hawaii caused no major damage. Officials are warning residents in California, Oregon, and Washington to stay away from the coast, as tsunamis consist of a series of waves over many hours, and the first may not be the largest. Dangerous currents are expected to persist even after the initial threat subsides.</p>

          <p>Following the release of data showing the U.S. economy grew at a better-than-expected 3% annual pace, President Donald Trump immediately intensified his pressure on the Federal Reserve. On social media, Trump declared the figure "WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!" and demanded that Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom he nicknamed "Mr Too Late," must now lower interest rates. The president's public demands link the positive economic news directly to his ongoing campaign for looser monetary policy, despite the fact that strong growth typically reduces the need for rate cuts.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has stated he is not afraid of a potential trade showdown with the U.S. as a Friday deadline for new tariffs approaches. President Trump announced the tariffs partly in response to what he called a "witch-hunt" against his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, who faces charges over an alleged coup plot. In an interview, Lula urged Trump to avoid a "lose-lose" situation and asserted that Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign country, indicating that Bolsonaro's legal situation is a non-negotiable judicial matter.</p>

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the direct-action group Palestine Action can legally challenge the government's decision to ban it under terrorism legislation. The group, known for protests causing damage at firms linked to Israel's military, was proscribed by the Home Secretary last month. While the judge refused to temporarily lift the ban, he granted a full judicial review for November, citing the risk of "chaos" in the courts and the public interest in determining the ban's legality. The ruling allows the group to argue that the proscription unlawfully infringes on rights to free speech and protest.</p>

          <p>The recent temporary suspension of feline intake at Collier County's public animal shelter has placed immense pressure on local nonprofit rescues, which are already struggling with capacity issues. The county shelter, citing a spike in communicable diseases during peak kitten season, left residents and volunteer groups with nowhere to turn for services like trap-neuter-return (TNR). Rescue operators argue this is a recurring problem stemming from a lack of proactive measures and funding for on-the-ground fieldwork, forcing them to bear the financial and logistical burden of managing the area's animal overpopulation crisis.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, significantly exceeding forecasts and reversing the previous quarter's decline. This robust growth was largely driven by a sharp drop in imports, which positively impacts the GDP calculation, following a surge earlier in the year as businesses tried to get ahead of trade tariffs. Consumer spending also rebounded, and a key inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve showed a modest easing, though it remains slightly above the central bank's target.

He warned the union that the latest strike action has "squandered the considerable goodwill" they had with the government. The union is considering the offer, which falls short of their demand for talks on pay.</p>
