          <p>Corey O’Connor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for mayor, defeating the incumbent Ed Gainey. The New York Times article suggests this outcome reflects voter dissatisfaction with Gainey's progressive leadership. O'Connor, who will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate focused on revitalizing the city's economy and adopting a conciliatory approach towards institutions. Gainey's administration had faced criticism for police leadership turnover, budget concerns, and basic service issues, overshadowing his efforts to address affordable housing. The sharp-elbowed campaign highlighted divisions among city and county political leaders.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Chris Van Hollen engaged in a heated exchange regarding the Trump administration's foreign policy. Van Hollen criticized Rubio's handling of issues such as humanitarian aid to Sudan, deportations to El Salvador, and the refugee process. He expressed regret for voting to confirm Rubio, accusing him of not upholding democratic and human rights principles. Rubio defended his actions and ridiculed Van Hollen for his meeting with a deported individual, leading to further contentious exchanges and unsubstantiated claims.

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing backlash for stating he doesn't buy rice because he receives it from supporters, a comment deemed inappropriate amidst rising rice prices. Kyodo News reports that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to replace Eto with Shinjiro Koizumi. Ishiba acknowledged responsibility for appointing Eto and failing to address the objections promptly. The resignation occurs as Ishiba prepares for an upcoming House of Councillors election, a critical race for the ruling coalition.

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that a top aide to the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, pressured intelligence analysts to revise an assessment of the relationship between Venezuela's government and the Tren de Aragua gang. Joe Kent, the aide, sought to insulate President Trump and Gabbard from criticism regarding the administration's claim that Venezuela controls the gang. Emails show Kent requested rewrites to align the assessment with Trump's policy agenda, specifically the use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. The final memo still contradicted Trump's claims, causing further legal and political challenges for the administration, leading to internal concerns about politicizing intelligence analysis.</p>

          <p>A new test has been developed that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumours from weeks to hours, according to the BBC. Surgeons describe the method as a "game changer" that could improve care and treatment. The method, developed by the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate. The new technique returns results in as little as 90 minutes, enabling surgeons to perform more radical surgery during the initial procedure.
