            <p>Citigroup announced first-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts' estimates, driven by robust gains in fixed income and equities trading. The company reported earnings of $1.96 per share against an expected $1.85, with revenue also slightly above forecasts at $21.60 billion. While other Wall Street firms benefited from equities trading, Citigroup's strength lies in fixed income. Despite the positive results, Citigroup shares have declined 10% this year amidst broader concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariff policies on the banking sector.

Trump asserted that Zelensky shares responsibility with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the conflict's casualties. He criticized Zelensky's approach to the conflict and past requests for missiles. Trump has consistently faulted Zelensky and former President Biden for the ongoing war, despite Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 and the subsequent escalation in 2022.</p>

            <p>The US tourism industry, valued at $2.36 trillion, is expressing concerns about a potential "Trump slump" due to the administration's tariff policies and their impact on international relations. Preliminary figures indicate a decline in visits to the US from overseas, with some attributing it to Trump's trade policies. Airlines are adjusting expansion plans due to weaker travel demand, and Las Vegas is projecting a decrease in room tax revenue. Tourism Economics has revised its forecast, predicting a decline in international arrivals this year, citing a more contentious context for inbound travel.</p>

            <p>Farmers across the United States are facing potential financial ruin due to the combined impact of President Trump's tariffs, cuts to federal programs, and extreme weather events. Small and medium-sized farms are already struggling with climate shocks and volatile markets, exacerbated by corporate dominance. Recent heavy rainfall and flooding have caused millions in crop losses, while tariffs threaten access to key export markets. Farmers express concerns about being used as bargaining chips and the need for another bailout to avoid widespread devastation.

            <p>The X account of UK Minister Lucy Powell was hacked to promote a cryptocurrency scam. The hacked account posted about a fake "House of Commons" cryptocurrency. Cybercriminals often take over accounts to advertise scam crypto coins, hoping to encourage people to invest before the scam is detected. The MP's office confirmed the hack and took steps to secure the account and remove misleading posts. Other public figures, including BBC journalist Nick Robinson, have been similarly targeted.</p>

A Guardian analysis shows US tech moguls, fossil fuel executives and crypto tycoons collectively gave at least $243m to the president’s 2024 campaign. Some of the same donors also want to establish a largely autonomous libertarian utopian “post state” for the tech elite in Greenland that could be used to practice “terraforming” for a Mars colony.</p>

I do realize that it is not a typically American attitude, but it is an attitude that can bring about a fair degree of happiness. Perpetual striving leads only to more striving. Americans have grown accustomed to rapidly rising home values, and our federal, state, and local governments encourage this through zoning, mortgage, and tax policies.</p>

Oil prices have been dropping precipitously on fears that even a limited US-China trade war will trigger a global recession and reduce demand. It would be a supreme irony if the Trump administration found a more effective way to attack the most important sector of Russia’s economy while providing a boost to the west’s Ukrainian allies than the Biden administration ever did.

As the IRS says, "an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe." If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.</p>

            <p>Dutch prosecutors said Monday authorities on the Caribbean island of Curacao have detained a man "who played a leading role" in the high-profile murder of crime reporter Peter R. de Vries four years ago. De Vries was gunned down in broad daylight on a busy Amsterdam street in July 2021, sparking an outpouring of grief and concern over the influence of organized crime in the Netherlands. The 39-year-old man was detained on Monday in Willemstad on Curacao.</p>

            <p>More low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures. For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts. However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%. It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years.</p>
