        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a government shutdown impacting hundreds of thousands of federal employees, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their paychecks. This is due to Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution and a permanent appropriation for lawmakers' salaries established in 1983, which exempts their compensation from the annual funding battles. While essential federal workers must remain on the job without immediate pay and others are furloughed, the nation's top elected officials are financially insulated from the shutdown's direct consequences.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department is working on a potential $1 commemorative coin featuring President Trump's image to mark the 250th anniversary of American independence. A spokesperson emphasized that the design, which includes a profile of the president and an image of him with a raised fist, is a preliminary draft and not yet final. While federal law typically prohibits featuring a living president on currency, there may be more flexibility for commemorative coins produced by the U.S. Mint, which operates under different regulations than the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.</p>

          <p>While air travel is not immediately halted by a government shutdown, experts warn that a prolonged impasse could lead to major disruptions for passengers. Most TSA officers and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, but past shutdowns have shown that extended periods without wages lead to increased sick calls and staff shortages. This could result in significantly longer security lines and potential flight delays, creating a cascading negative effect on the U.S. travel economy, which could lose an estimated $1 billion per week.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown is the latest in a series of 14 such funding lapses that have occurred since 1980, when new legal interpretations required agencies to cease operations without funding. The article provides a historical review of these events, noting that they have become more frequent and contentious over the past decade. It highlights previous shutdowns under presidents Reagan, Clinton, Obama, and Trump, detailing the political disputes over spending, healthcare, and immigration that led to temporary closures of federal agencies and services.</p>

However, this means hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either furloughed or required to work without immediate pay, and public services from national parks to customer service at federal agencies can be significantly curtailed.</p>

Davis suggests this form of discovery is increasingly important in an era where thoughtful book criticism is declining and algorithms often limit exposure to the unexpected.</p>

          <p>Israeli and Hamas delegations are preparing for indirect negotiations in Egypt, sparking cautious optimism for a potential ceasefire to end the two-year war in Gaza. The talks are centered on a 20-point plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. While Hamas has agreed to some key aspects of the proposal, significant points of contention remain, making the outcome of the high-stakes negotiations uncertain.</p>

          <p>Newly obtained security footage appears to show Jihad Al-Shamie, the man responsible for the deadly terror attack at a Manchester synagogue, just minutes before the incident. The video captures a man matching his description being confronted and walking away from the synagogue, only to return shortly after in the black Kia used to ram into worshippers. The attack resulted in the deaths of two men, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, and has led to the detention of several individuals on suspicion of terror offenses.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed processing student debt cancellation for borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, ending a pause that began in July. Eligible borrowers who have been in repayment for 20 to 25 years are now receiving notifications that their remaining federal student loan balances will be forgiven. The temporary halt on these discharges had become a central issue in a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the Department of Education of unlawfully denying borrowers their entitled relief.</p>

          <p>In a bid to appeal to younger voters, the UK's Conservative party has unveiled a plan to offer a £5,000 tax rebate to help them buy their first home. Under the "First Job Bonus" proposal, the first £5,000 of National Insurance contributions paid during a person's first job would be placed into a savings account, accessible after five years. To fund this and a proposed abolition of business rates for high street shops, the party outlined £47 billion in annual savings derived from deep cuts to the welfare system, civil service, and foreign aid budget.</p>
