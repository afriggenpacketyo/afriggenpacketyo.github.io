          <p>Thabo Bester, a convicted murderer and perpetrator of sexual assault known as the "Facebook Rapist," lost his legal bid to halt a Netflix documentary detailing his crimes. Bester, who gained international notoriety after faking his own death in a fire to escape a South African prison in 2022, was later recaptured in Tanzania. A court dismissed his application, ruling that the documentary's release would not violate his right to a fair trial, as the details of his case and dramatic escape are already firmly in the public domain.</p>

          <p>A bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales is facing strong opposition during its review in the House of Lords. Former Prime Minister Theresa May argued against the legislation, referring to it as an "assisted suicide bill" and warning of insufficient safeguards to protect vulnerable individuals. The bill's sponsor, MP Kim Leadbeater, countered that the terminally ill people she has met are not suicidal but are seeking choice in the face of inevitable death, highlighting the deep ethical divisions on the issue.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at a university event in Utah. The breakthrough in the case came after the suspect's father recognized his son in images released by law enforcement and persuaded him to surrender. Investigators revealed that evidence, including a rifle and shell casings engraved with anti-fascist and taunting messages, was recovered, suggesting a politically motivated attack. The swift capture was announced by President Trump just 33 hours after the shooting occurred.</p>

          <p>Following days of violent anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, Nepal has appointed its first female leader, former Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The unrest, which resulted in over 50 deaths, was initially sparked by a government ban on social media platforms but grew into a wider movement against political corruption. Karki will lead an interim government tasked with holding general elections within six months, a move aimed at restoring stability to the nation.</p>

          <p>As Russia's summer offensive intensifies in the Donbas region, the remaining residents of frontline towns like Bilozerske must decide whether to flee or risk their lives by staying. An estimated 218,000 people, many of them elderly, are in need of evacuation from the Donetsk region amid constant threats from artillery and FPV drones. Many are reluctant to leave their homes and belongings behind, facing a life-or-death calculation as civilian casualties in Ukraine have reached a three-year high.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, who was killed at age 31, rose from a teenage activist to one of the most influential figures in modern conservative politics and a key ally of President Donald Trump. He co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012, building it into a powerful organization focused on mobilizing young conservatives on college campuses. Known for his close relationship with the Trump family and his hard-right political views, Kirk was instrumental in shaping the MAGA movement's youth outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, cementing his status as a pivotal voice for a new generation of Republicans.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is capitalizing on a recent drop in Boeing's stock price to increase its position in the aerospace company. Shares fell after CEO Kelly Ortberg acknowledged delays in the 777X aircraft certification process.

          <p>The U.S. government has begun using the term "monkeypox" again, reversing its 2022 adoption of "mpox," a name change led by the World Health Organization to reduce stigma. The original name was deemed racist and inaccurate, as the virus is transmitted by rodents, not monkeys. Public health experts have expressed confusion and concern over the unexplained reversion, suggesting it may be a politically motivated move by the Trump administration that could create confusion and reintroduce stigmatizing language.</p>
