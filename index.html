        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming week places a spotlight on Europe's financial sector, with major banks like Unicredit, BNP Paribas, and Deutsche Bank set to release their earnings reports. Analysts are optimistic, anticipating that the banking sector's performance will drive positive earnings growth for the Stoxx 600 index, following what was described as a resilient first quarter. This focus on banks contrasts with downgrades in other sectors like luxury and energy. However, this outlook is tempered by the European Central Bank's upcoming policy meeting and the looming threat of potential U.S. tariffs on EU imports, which could prompt the ECB to cut interest rates in response.

          <p>Five days of severe torrential rainfall across South Korea have resulted in a significant human toll, with government officials confirming at least 14 deaths and 12 individuals still missing. The extreme weather caused deadly landslides, flash floods, and building collapses, particularly in the southern town of Sancheong. Rescue operations have been underway, and thousands of residents were forced to evacuate their homes for safety. While the rain has subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, the country is now dealing with the tragic aftermath of the widespread destruction caused by the downpours.</p>

          <h2>Dodger Stadium Unveils New Mural Celebrating Legacy of Pitcher Fernando Valenzuela</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 01:21:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new mural honoring the late, iconic pitcher Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, serving as a permanent tribute to his impact on baseball and the Latino community. Created by artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his famous pitching motion and is intended to symbolize unity and representation. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, became a cultural phenomenon known as "Fernandomania," inspiring a generation of Latino fans. The tribute has been met with emotional approval from fans, who see it as a celebration of a player who represented triumph and hope.</p>

          <p>In Kerr County, Texas, officials announced a significant development in the search efforts following catastrophic July 4th floods, with the number of missing persons dropping from nearly 100 to just three. This progress comes after weeks of intensive search and rescue operations in the hard-hit Hill Country region. Despite this positive news, the disaster's death toll remains tragically high at 135 people, with most fatalities occurring along the Guadalupe River. The floods, which were far more severe than anticipated, devastated the popular tourist area and have led to scrutiny over the adequacy of local warning systems.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered an 8-7 defeat to the Milwaukee Brewers, marking their ninth loss in their last eleven games despite an improved offensive showing. The Dodgers' lineup, which had been slumping, produced seven runs and ten hits, including back-to-back home runs in the eighth inning. However, these efforts were undermined by a poor start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a bullpen that allowed crucial late-game runs. The loss highlighted the team's ongoing struggle to synchronize its pitching and hitting, as they failed to capitalize on key opportunities to take control of the game.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts of $1.1 billion in federal funding for public media are poised to severely impact small, rural radio stations that serve as vital sources of local news and information. Allegheny Mountain Radio, a cooperative serving remote communities in West Virginia and Virginia, is highlighted as an example, relying on the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for up to 65% of its budget. Station managers worry that the funding loss, driven by political motivations, could lead to staff cuts or even station closures.

This breakdown of a "permanent moral order" mirrors the collapse of the international rules-based system, making peaceful resolutions nearly impossible. The piece critiques political leaders and the public for their complicity or indifference, suggesting that a return to universal ethical principles is necessary to end the cycle of violence.</p>

          <p>The United States government has implemented a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, including tourists, business travelers, and students. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is mandated by the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying, implementation details remain unclear. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office anticipates few travelers will seek reimbursement, projecting the fee will generate nearly $29 billion in revenue over the next decade.
