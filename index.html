          <p>India launched strikes against Pakistan in response to a militant attack in Kashmir, targeting what it claimed were terrorist infrastructure sites. Pakistan condemned the strikes as an act of war and asserted its right to retaliate, claiming to have shot down Indian jets, a claim India has not confirmed. The strikes and counter-claims have raised concerns about escalating tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbors, with global leaders calling for restraint to avoid further military confrontation. The operation, named "Sindoor," reflects India's commitment to holding those responsible for the Kashmir attack accountable, while Pakistan views the strikes as a violation of its sovereignty.

          <p>China's securities regulator, CSRC, plans to further open financial markets and enhance foreign access, particularly promoting Hong Kong as a global finance hub amid trade war concerns. Measures include protecting interests of listed Chinese companies abroad, streamlining processes for overseas listings, and adding yuan-denominated stock counters to the Stock Connect mechanism. These moves aim to provide alternatives for companies facing potential delisting from U.S. exchanges and to attract foreign investment. The CSRC will also simplify approval processes for qualified foreign institutional investors and support yuan-denominated funds investing in China. Optimism score: 70</p>
