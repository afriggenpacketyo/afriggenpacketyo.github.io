          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents apprehended individuals with criminal histories, including murderers and sexual offenders, during operations in Los Angeles. The operations, conducted at various businesses, triggered protests and clashes, leading to the use of flash bangs by authorities. Among those arrested were individuals with convictions for murder, sexual assault, and firearm-related offenses. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials questioned the priorities of local leaders who seemed more concerned about the criminals than the safety of their own citizens, emphasizing the importance of ICE's work in protecting communities. The agency highlighted the arrests of individuals convicted of violent crimes, including those against children, underscoring the need for stricter immigration enforcement.

          <p>China's consumer prices fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling persistent deflationary pressures amid weak domestic demand and ongoing trade tensions. The consumer price index (CPI) dropped 0.1% year-on-year, slightly better than market expectations. Analysts attribute the decline to sluggish consumer demand and a bruising price war in the automotive industry. Despite strong exports, there are concerns about China's reliance on domestic demand to combat deflation, as policymakers have implemented measures to bolster the economy.

          <p>Britain's electricity grid is facing challenges as renewable energy sources like wind farms generate power in remote areas, but the grid lacks the capacity to transport it efficiently. Companies like Ocean Winds receive compensation payments for turning down their output when the system is overloaded. This has led to a situation where energy firms are paid significant amounts not to provide power, costing the country over £500 million this year alone. The government is considering a radical solution involving smaller regional markets to make the system more efficient and potentially lower bills. Optimism score is not included in the summary.</p>
