          <p>President Trump has reversed his position on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling his story a "success" after a meeting with him and cabinet members. This comes just days after Trump publicly demanded Tan's immediate resignation, citing concerns over his ties to China raised by Senator Tom Cotton. The sudden change in tone reflects the administration's active and often unpredictable involvement in the semiconductor industry, a key front in the economic competition with China. Intel's shares rose following the news of the meeting and the president's new supportive stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Aniston recently looked back on her 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, describing the period as a "vulnerable time" made more difficult by relentless tabloid coverage. In a new interview, she recalled how the public narrative of a "love triangle" with Angelina Jolie was "juicy reading for people" but something she took very personally. Aniston explained that at the time, she lacked the "strong enough constitution" to not get affected by the intense speculation. She reflected on the need to persevere through the painful public ordeal.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, European Union foreign ministers have firmly stated that any potential peace deal must involve Ukraine. The EU's stance emphasizes that a lasting resolution to the conflict cannot be imposed upon Ukraine without its direct participation and consent. This position highlights European concerns that a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Russia might sideline Ukrainian sovereignty and interests. The article also briefly notes the killing of an Al Jazeera journalist in a separate event in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Erin, has formed west of the Cabo Verde islands. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict the storm will move west and could intensify into the season's first hurricane later in the week. While it currently poses no immediate threat to the United States, early models suggest it may become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. The storm has already caused flooding in Cabo Verde, leading to a declared state of emergency.</p>

It advises preparing a detailed budget and documenting any financial hardship, such as job loss or medical bills, to strengthen one's negotiating position. Options include requesting a temporary hardship program to lower interest rates or pursuing a debt settlement by offering a lump-sum payment. It is crucial to remain calm during negotiations and to get any final agreement in writing before making a payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Satirical Piece Envisions a 'White House Makeover' Under Trump's Direction</h2>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic imagines an episode of "Extreme Home Makeover" set at the White House with the Trump family as the recipients. The piece humorously depicts President Trump directing a redesign to get rid of "bad energy" and ghosts, replace historical decor with excessive gold, and pave over the Rose Garden for a patio resembling an Au Bon Pain. Through parody, the article critiques the president's perceived tastes and his approach to governance and tradition. The narrative uses the home makeover format to satirize recent political events, including the deployment of troops in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that U.S. homeowners' tappable equity surged to a record $11.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with the average homeowner holding $213,000 in accessible value. For those looking to borrow against this equity, the article outlines several cost-effective methods. These include a home equity loan for a lump-sum payment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) for a flexible credit line, or a reverse mortgage for seniors who wish to avoid monthly repayments. Each option offers relatively low interest rates compared to other forms of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, pushing the deadline to mid-November. The tariffs were set to revert to their peak levels this week, but the extension follows recent trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. This move continues a pattern of unpredictable trade policy, where deadlines and tariff levels have been frequently altered with little notice. The pause prevents an immediate escalation of the trade war, providing temporary relief for businesses affected by the duties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than 30 years, AOL is officially shutting down its dial-up internet service in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 30. The service, famous for its distinctive connection sound, was a gateway to the internet for millions in the 1990s but has long been superseded by broadband. At its peak in 2001, AOL had over 30 million subscribers, but that number has dwindled significantly, with fewer than 300,000 Americans reporting a dial-up-only connection in 2023. The decision marks the end of an era for one of the original pioneers of home internet access.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, surged on Monday following news that a key mine in China has suspended its operations. The Yichun Project, operated by battery giant CATL, halted production after its permit expired, temporarily removing a source that accounts for about 4% of the world's projected 2025 lithium supply. Investors reacted to the anticipated drop in global supply by bidding up stock prices, expecting that lithium prices will rise. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production as soon as possible. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that the next major earthquake on California's San Andreas fault may not follow the patterns of past seismic events. Researchers analyzed a recent magnitude 7.7 earthquake in Myanmar on the Sagaing fault, which is geologically similar to the San Andreas, and found it ruptured a much longer section than expected. This implies that earthquakes do not repeat in exactly the same way and that stress can build and release in complex, unpredictable patterns. The findings challenge the idea of expecting a simple repeat of historical quakes like the 1906 or 1857 events.</p>

          <p>Enterprise AI company C3 AI saw its stock fall by nearly 26% after announcing disappointing preliminary first-quarter revenue and a restructuring of its sales organization. CEO Thomas Siebel labeled the sales results "completely unacceptable," attributing the poor performance to the disruptive effects of the reorganization and his own ongoing health issues. Siebel, who is currently searching for his successor, expressed confidence that the company is now positioned to accelerate its growth.

Companies like Canopy Growth and Tilray Brands saw their shares soar by over 25%, and cannabis-focused ETFs recorded their best daily gains in years. Currently, marijuana is a Schedule I drug, alongside heroin; reclassification could ease tax burdens and encourage institutional investment. While Trump stated a decision would be made in the coming weeks, the process ultimately falls under the authority of the Attorney General and the DEA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia and AMD have agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to share 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This unusual arrangement allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, respectively, to the crucial Chinese market after they were previously restricted by export controls. Analysts view the move as a net positive for the companies, as 85% of revenue is better than zero, but note it sets a strange precedent.

          <p>This article explains the legal basis for President Trump's move to place the Washington, D.C. police under federal control. The action invokes Section 740 of the 1973 D.C.

While the Home Rule Act grants D.C. an elected mayor and council, Congress retains oversight, and the president has this specific authority. The emergency control is limited to 30 days unless extended by Congress, and the move has been decried by Democrats.</p>
