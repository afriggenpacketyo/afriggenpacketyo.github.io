          <p>Following an Iranian missile strike on a hospital and residential buildings in Israel, Israeli leaders have vowed intensified attacks on Iran's military and government targets, accusing Iran of war crimes. The missile attack resulted in numerous injuries and significant damage, prompting condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israel's defense minister stated that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be held accountable for the attacks, while also instructing the Israeli military to increase attacks on strategic targets in Iran. The situation has escalated tensions in the region, with Israel carrying out strikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor. The article also notes that President Trump is considering direct US involvement in the conflict. The article does not contain investment advice.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that would have required President Trump to hand over control of the California National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The initial ruling by a U.S. District Judge found that Trump was illegally using the Guard in Los Angeles and exceeding his statutory authority. Trump federalized the Guard, citing a rebellion against federal authority due to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The appeals court's order provides a temporary stay, pending further legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering whether to join Israel's attacks on Iran, specifically targeting the Fordow nuclear enrichment site, but is unsure if US 'bunker busters' can effectively destroy the facility. The Fordow site is built deep into a mountain south of Tehran, making it a difficult target. Israel lacks the necessary bombs and aircraft to significantly damage the site, making the US's bunker busters a crucial asset. Trump has indicated he will take two weeks to decide whether to strike, while military analysts have echoed concerns about the bombs' effectiveness.</p>

Orano, which is 90% owned by the French state, holds a 63% stake in Somair. The decision comes after a deterioration in relations following a military coup in Niger in 2023, leading to the withdrawal of French troops. Orano has been pursuing legal means to regain control, claiming the state's actions have damaged the mine's finances.</p>

United Airlines will pause its daily flights between Newark and Dubai, while American Airlines will temporarily suspend flights between Philadelphia and Doha. Delta Air Lines has also suspended flights between New York and Tel Aviv until August 31. The suspensions are due to the closure of Ben Gurion International Airport in Israel and heightened tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering a strike on Iran's Fordo nuclear site, viewing it as necessary due to the risk of weapons production. He has approved attack plans but has not made a final decision, holding off in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program. The decision comes amid diplomatic efforts to find an off-ramp in the conflict, with the UK and other nations engaging with Iran. Trump is aware of intelligence reports indicating the speed at which Iran could produce bombs.</p>

The regulator has issued a warning notice requiring the trust to take immediate action to improve.
