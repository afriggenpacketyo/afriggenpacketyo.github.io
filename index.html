          <p>A New York City Department of Environmental Protection worker died, and two others were injured after a raw sewage boat exploded in the Hudson River. The explosion occurred on a city-owned vessel used to transport raw sewage to a treatment plant. One employee died after being "blown by a force explosion in between the pier and the vessel itself," while another was hospitalized, and a third refused medical treatment. The cause of the explosion is under investigation by the Bureau of Fire Investigation, and responding personnel were decontaminated due to the raw sewage on the ship's deck.</p>

          <p>Jon Worrell, a 57-year-old man from Georgia, was arrested and charged with the 2006 murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, after the case went cold for years. The investigation was reignited after investigators traveled to Costa Rica and found the family’s former live-in nanny, who provided crucial information. The nanny had an inappropriate relationship with Worrell and feared a divorce would cause him to lose access to his children, according to investigators. Worrell is charged with malice murder, felony murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and aggravated battery and is being held without bond.</p>

One example is a woman with early-stage lung cancer receiving the LK101 injection, a personalized mRNA vaccine designed to reduce the risk of relapse.

          <p>Jorge Humberto Figueroa, a leader of the Sinaloa cartel known as "El Perris," was killed in a clash with army troops in Mexico. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration had offered a $1 million reward for information leading to his arrest on suspicion of fentanyl trafficking and money laundering. Figueroa was reportedly a key figure in a 2019 clash with authorities in Culiacan, where cartel members fought to release Ovidio Guzman, a son of Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman.

Despite claims from the Trump administration linking him to MS-13, there is no official evidence to support this, and his tattoos do not definitively indicate gang affiliation. Abrego Garcia fled to the United States in 2011 after gang threats against him and his family, according to his attorneys. Federal judges and the Supreme Court have ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the United States.</p>

The man, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala. Judge Brian Murphy found the man’s deportation likely “lacked any semblance of due process”. The man has since been returned to Guatemala and is living in hiding. The judge noted that the government had given the seven men little more than 24 hours’ notice that they were being removed from the US, which he called “plainly insufficient”, and could result in a finding of criminal contempt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico despite his fears of harm. The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order. Judge Brian Murphy found the man's deportation likely lacked due process. The man had presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom in Mexico. The judge noted that the man is not held by any foreign government, making his return less complicated.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a commencement address at West Point, congratulating the cadets and taking credit for rebuilding the U.S. military. He detailed the shift in U.S. foreign policy away from nation-building and touted the administration's success in peacetime recruiting. Trump also stated that critical race theory would no longer be taught at military academies. The address comes after Vice President JD Vance emphasized the administration's shift in foreign policy against forever wars at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>
