            <h2>Trump Administration Grants Tariff Exemptions for Smartphones and Computers</h2>

            <p>President Trump exempted smartphones, computers, and certain electronic devices from tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. This decision came after concerns from U.S. tech companies about potential price increases, as much of their manufacturing is based in China. The exemptions, backdated to April 5th, also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House indicated the move was to allow companies more time to relocate production to the U.S., though these goods remain subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl.</p>

            <p>LSU head coach Brian Kelly commented on Nico Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee, suggesting such instances will become more frequent as NIL deals evolve. Iamaleava's exit was reportedly due to NIL contract disagreements, with Tennessee's coach emphasizing the program's enduring legacy over individual deals. Kelly believes better information on player compensation will help navigate the new NIL landscape, as NIL continues to reshape college sports with impacts on spring games and transfer decisions. Iamaleava was reportedly making $2.4 million on his NIL contract.</p>

            <p>The Gilgo Beach serial killings case has seen a major development with the arrest of Rex Heuermann, an architect from Massapequa Park, Long Island. Heuermann is charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello, and is the prime suspect in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes, all sex workers whose remains were found near Gilgo Beach. Evidence linking Heuermann includes a Chevy Avalanche matching a description from a witness, cell phone records placing him in the same areas as the victims, and DNA evidence from pizza crust he discarded. The investigation also explores the impact on Heuermann's family, including his wife and children.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States held indirect negotiations in Oman concerning Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, marking the first such talks since President Trump's return to the White House.

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, threatened closure due to substantial financial losses. Emergency legislation was passed to ensure the plant's two blast furnaces remain operational, safeguarding the UK's ability to produce virgin steel. The government stepped in after negotiations with Jingye broke down, with the company reportedly seeking excessive funds to continue operations. The move aims to secure private investment and prevent the UK from becoming the only G7 nation without virgin steel production capabilities.</p>

The helicopter, which was conducting sightseeing tours, did not have flight recorders or onboard video, making the recovery of physical evidence even more important.

A Lancet study projects that 450 million Indians could be overweight or obese by 2050. Studies show a link between belly fat and chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, with a high percentage of Indian women and men already showing signs of abdominal obesity. Scientists are exploring the evolutionary and biological reasons behind fat distribution patterns in South Asians, with lifestyle shifts also contributing to the rise in belly fat.</p>

            <p>Hashem Abedi, one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing, attacked three prison officers at HMP Frankland, resulting in life-threatening injuries. Abedi used hot cooking oil and homemade weapons in the attack, which occurred in a separation center for dangerous extremist prisoners. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation, and the incident has raised concerns about security measures in the high-security facility. The Justice Secretary has vowed to push for the strongest possible punishment.</p>

            <p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus concluded a visit to China, securing $2.1 billion in investments, loans, and grants. This may be seen as a pivot towards Beijing to escape India's foreign policy grip and draw closer to Southeast Asia and the Indo-Pacific. Yunus sought Chinese support to advance Bangladesh's textile, pharmaceutical, and renewable energy sectors. The move comes after Bangladesh strengthened ties with India under ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, bolstering economic and strategic connections.</p>
