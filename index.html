          <h2>Genetic Study Reveals Ancestral Origins of Indigenous Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 02:34:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent DNA study has provided insights into the migration patterns of the first people to colonize the Americas, tracing their origins back to modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, comparing them to ancient DNA to understand population history, migration, and adaptation. The study identified four distinct groups in South America—Amazonian, Andean, Chaco Amerindian, and Patagonian—that became isolated due to natural barriers like the Amazon rainforest and the Andes mountain range. These findings underscore the importance of ancestral knowledge for Indigenous communities and highlight genetic variations that affect their health, such as adaptations to low oxygen levels in Andean highlanders.</p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through the Midwest, resulting in at least seven deaths and widespread damage across Missouri and surrounding states. The storms tore roofs off buildings, downed trees and power lines, and caused traffic gridlock, leading to a state of emergency and overnight curfews in affected areas. In St. Louis, five deaths were confirmed, with over 5,000 homes affected and 100,000 customers without electricity; a tornado also struck in Scott County, killing two people and destroying multiple homes. The storms were part of a larger weather system that brought severe conditions to Appalachia and the Midwest, including tornado warnings and a dust storm warning around Chicago, while Texas faced a punishing heat wave.</p>

          <p>During the US PGA Championship, golfers Shane Lowry and Tyrrell Hatton exhibited visible frustration on the course, resulting in potential fines for their behavior. Lowry slammed his club into the turf and swore after being denied relief for an embedded ball, while Hatton swore at his driver after a poor tee shot. Hatton, who was briefly near the lead, finished his round seven shots behind the leader, Jhonattan Vegas, with Lowry missing the cut. This article notes that Hatton has a history of on-course outbursts, previously drawing criticism for his conduct during the DP World Tour Championship.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, possibly with assistance from jail staff. The inmates breached a cell wall and exited through a loading dock before scaling a perimeter wall; three have since been apprehended, one found hiding under a car in a hotel garage. Sheriff Susan Hutson indicated that the escapees likely received inside help and noted defective locks and doors contributed to the breach, adding that the incident has highlighted the urgent need for facility repairs and more staffing. Authorities are conducting a full-scale search operation, and the FBI is offering a reward for information leading to the arrest of the remaining escapees.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the Trump administration's evolving tariff policies, highlighting the active, paused, and exempted tariffs on imported goods. While some tariffs, such as the 10% universal tariff and tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico not covered by the USMCA, are currently in place, others have been paused, including higher tariffs on Chinese goods and so-called "reciprocal" tariffs. Key exemptions have been made for goods covered in the USMCA and certain electronics imported from China. The article notes that Trump continues to threaten more tariffs on specific industries, though the implementation remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Two countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, Haiti and St Lucia, sent delegations to a high-level forum in Beijing, signaling a flexible approach by mainland China in courting Taipei's remaining official partners. According to analysts, this participation does not necessarily indicate a shift in allegiance but reflects a trend towards more pragmatic diplomacy. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries had notified them in advance of their officials' attendance and that relations remained "friendly and stable". The flags of Guatemala and Belize, two other Celac members that have ties with Taiwan, were not seen at the forum.</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was reported in the center of the Gaza Strip early Saturday, hours after the Israeli military announced its troops were preparing for a major advance into the territory. The gunfire, heard from Deir al Balah, followed intense Israeli bombardment overnight and prompted some civilians to flee westward. This development occurred as mediators sought to broker a new temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, amid ongoing conflict since October 2023. Despite the immense toll of Israel’s military campaign, it has not decisively defeated Hamas or secured the release of all hostages.</p>

          <p>Poland is preparing for the first round of its presidential election, which will determine whether the pro-European government led by Donald Tusk can advance its reform plans, currently blocked by President Andrzej Duda. The two front-runners are left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, and national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice party. Tusk's coalition government has struggled to implement reforms due to Duda's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court, leading to disappointment among voters. The outcome of the election will significantly impact the government's ability to restore the rule of law, liberalize abortion legislation, and address corruption.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity in response to Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which described him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." Audio from Biden's 2023 interviews with Hur, released by Axios, revealed instances where Biden struggled to remember key dates, including the death of his son Beau and the year Donald Trump was elected. Despite these memory lapses, Biden defended his ability to lead, stating, "I know what the hell I'm doing." The report amplified Republican concerns about Biden's mental fitness, while Democrats initially criticized Hur for being politically motivated.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time such a warning has included the city itself. The storm, fueled by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and delayed flights at Midway International Airport. Residents described the event as "something out of the history books," with dust causing discomfort and debris blowing in the wind. Skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most affected areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent tour of the Middle East was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the controversies he faces at home. In Saudi Arabia, he received a standing ovation for lifting sanctions on Syria, while in Qatar, he secured billions of dollars in investment pledges. The United Arab Emirates awarded him the country’s highest civilian honor, and he praised the “perfect marble” and “those camels.” Trump surrounded himself with friendly audiences and turned events into campaign-style rallies, reiterating false claims about the 2020 election and hinting at an unconstitutional third term.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear they may not survive the tariffs imposed on goods sent to their biggest market, the United States, as a result of scattershot tariffs announced by President Trump. The United States' appetite for guns has long provided a steady market for Gorazde’s main industry, but the tariffs have caused Ginex, a local company that makes ignition devices used in ammunition, to stall expansion plans. Gorazde’s mayor worries that the United States has abandoned a faith in free trade and economic development as a path to peace, while the Trump administration's dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. has also negatively impacted the town.</p>

          <p>The case of a Wisconsin judge charged with helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities is rare, but a similar case involving Judge Shelley Joseph in Massachusetts has been ongoing for years. Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape through a back door of a courtroom. While some view these cases as federal overreach, others see them as necessary to uphold the rule of law and prevent judges from treating individuals differently based on their immigration status.

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment, aid, and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its influence on the continent through strategic investments in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. The Emirates is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, and it sees Africa as an essential part of the plan, with investments primarily made by corporations closely aligned with the ruling powers. While the Trump administration has fast-tracked America’s exit from Africa, Washington considers the Emirates a reliable ally in the region, but may underestimate the commercial partnership between the Emirates and China.</p>
