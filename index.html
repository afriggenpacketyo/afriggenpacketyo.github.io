          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced plans to force a full, hours-long reading of the Republican's 940-page legislative package on the Senate floor. This procedural maneuver is intended to delay the vote and provide Democrats with more time to analyze the bill's extensive contents. The reading is expected to take up to 15 hours, after which a 20-hour debate period will commence, followed by a series of amendment votes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has again rejected former President Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men formerly known as the Central Park Five. U.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made alleging the exonerated men had killed someone and pled guilty to the crime.</p>

This indicates that men may have moved into their wives' households upon marriage and that female offspring often remained, suggesting a society where identity and social structure were passed down through mothers.</p>

          <p>In an interview, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi described the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan as very serious, confirming a significant setback to its program. He emphasized the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to assess the remaining material and activities, stating that a long-term solution must be diplomatic. Grossi noted that while Iran's program is damaged, the knowledge and industrial capacity remain, making verification crucial for any future agreements.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that at least 81 Palestinians were killed and over 400 were injured in Israeli strikes over a 24-hour period. One strike near a stadium in Gaza City, where displaced people were sheltering in tents, killed at least 11 people, including children. The continued violence comes as U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope for a ceasefire agreement in the coming week, following the collapse of a previous truce in March.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on three Iranian nuclear sites, descriptions of the damage from the Trump administration have shifted throughout the week. Initial claims that the program was "obliterated" were later nuanced by intelligence reports suggesting the setback might be a matter of months, not years. Officials' focus also appeared to shift, with some later emphasizing the attack's success in achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than the complete destruction of nuclear capabilities.</p>
