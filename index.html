This investment comes despite UnitedHealth facing a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock value this year, aligning with Buffett's history of value investing. The disclosure led to a 6% rise in UnitedHealth's shares, with other notable investors also showing interest in the undervalued company. (not investment advice)</p>

Trump alluded to a potential agreement that might involve "divvying things up," a comment that could cause concern in Kyiv as it implies possible territorial concessions. He expressed confidence in quickly assessing the meeting's potential for success and suggested a follow-up trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could happen soon.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national AI body, have acknowledged recent challenges for staff following a government mandate to prioritize defense research. This comes after a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission warned of a potential collapse and a "toxic" internal culture. In a letter, management confirmed the shift in focus while stating some health and environmental work would continue, but did not address leadership changes demanded by staff and the technology secretary.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives that restricted cooperation between Washington, D.C. police and federal immigration agents. The move effectively ends "sanctuary city" policies in the capital, allowing local police to assist with federal immigration enforcement, including honoring ICE detainer requests without a judicial warrant. This action is part of a broader anti-crime crackdown initiated by President Trump, who recently placed the city's police department under temporary federal control, though D.C. officials are challenging the legality of the order.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is facing imminent collapse after the government decided against providing a financial rescue package. The country's two main producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus, warned they would be forced to close following a recent UK-US trade deal that removed tariffs on American ethanol imports, rendering their businesses unviable. The government stated that direct funding would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term issues, a decision that could impact hundreds of jobs and thousands more in the supply chain.</p>

This event serves as a prominent display of China's growing ambitions and advancements in the rapidly developing field of humanoid robotics.

          <p>A Labour councillor, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he was filmed telling an anti-racism crowd that far-right protesters' throats should be cut. At his trial, Jones argued his comment, made at a rally in Walthamstow, was not directed at the demonstrators present but at individuals who had reportedly hidden razor blades behind neo-Nazi stickers on a train. The jury acquitted the 58-year-old Dartford councillor, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, after just over 30 minutes of deliberation.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow him to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the upper chamber's composition is undemocratic, as his party has four MPs and significant voter support but no representation, while smaller parties do. Political appointments to the Lords are made at the prime minister's discretion, and while opposition leaders are often invited to nominate peers, there is no constitutional requirement to do so.</p>

          <p>A senior defense lawyer in Australia has apologized to a Supreme Court judge for filing submissions in a murder case that contained fake quotes and non-existent legal precedents created by artificial intelligence. The errors, which included fabricated case citations, were discovered by the judge's staff and caused a 24-hour delay in the proceedings. This incident is the latest example of AI "hallucinations" causing serious problems in legal systems globally, prompting the judge to reiterate that AI-generated material must be independently and thoroughly verified by legal professionals.</p>

          <p>Despite their crucial roles in the 1998/99 Kosovo war, many of the country's 3,600 women veterans struggle for public recognition and face significant socio-economic challenges. While they receive official benefits, their contributions are often overlooked by institutions and society, which still largely celebrates only male veterans. Women who served as soldiers, nurses, and in logistical roles report feeling discriminated against and forgotten, a situation exacerbated by a patriarchal mentality that can discourage their participation in public life and decision-making roles post-war.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Census Bureau report reveals a significant decline in the number of young adults aged 25 to 34 reaching traditional life milestones compared to previous generations. Fewer are getting married, having children, working full-time, or living independently from their parents. Economic factors, including the rising cost of college, student loan debt, and a housing affordability crisis, are identified as major drivers delaying family formation and financial independence. Today, less than a quarter of young adults have achieved these four benchmarks, compared to almost half 50 years ago.</p>

City leaders and residents dispute the narrative of a crime wave, and many fear the federal presence is more about political optics than public safety, creating an atmosphere of fear.</p>

          <p>The escalating mid-decade redistricting battle, exemplified by California's plan to counter a new Republican-drawn map in Texas, is highlighting concerns about the integrity of U.S. elections. This "fighting fire with fire" approach, where Democrats adopt partisan gerrymandering tactics to neutralize GOP advantages, could further entrench the idea that legislative maneuvering, not voting, determines control of Congress. While some reformers see it as a necessary evil, critics warn that continuous re-drawing of maps based on recent data undermines democratic legitimacy and increases political cynicism.</p>
