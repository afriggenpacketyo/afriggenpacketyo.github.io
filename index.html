          <h2>Japanese Farm Minister Resigns Following Rice Remark Controversy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:15:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating he never buys rice because he receives it as gifts, a tone-deaf remark given rising rice prices in Japan. The resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government struggles with low approval ratings and tariff negotiations with the U.S. Soaring rice prices are due to inclement weather, policies protecting local farmers, and increased demand from tourism. The agriculture ministry has released government stockpiles to curb prices, but the move has had little effect, and panic-driven hoarding has exacerbated the problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent satellite analysis indicates that tropical forests were destroyed at the fastest rate ever recorded in 2024, with fires overtaking agriculture as the primary cause. The Amazon rainforest has been particularly affected by record drought conditions, leading to out-of-control fires. The loss of these forests, which store vast amounts of carbon, is releasing billions of tons of planet-warming gases, exacerbating climate change. However, Southeast Asian countries like Indonesia have shown progress in reducing forest loss through government policies and community efforts focused on enforcing "no burning" laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for a comprehensive missile defense shield, dubbed the "Golden Dome," aimed at protecting the United States from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. The ambitious project, modeled after Israel's Iron Dome, faces technical and financial hurdles due to the country's vast size. The president estimates the cost at $175 billion, while the Congressional Budget Office projects a much higher figure. Despite the challenges, Trump expressed confidence in completing the project within his term, emphasizing its ability to intercept missiles launched from anywhere, including space.</p>

          <p>Malaysia's semiconductor industry, a key player in the global supply chain, is facing uncertainty due to President Trump's evolving trade policies. While Malaysia was initially seen as a beneficiary of U.S. efforts to limit China's access to advanced chips, new tariffs on Malaysian exports threaten the country's ambitions to develop high-tech chip manufacturing capabilities. The proposed tariffs could undermine Malaysia's plans and potentially increase costs for American consumers. Some companies are exploring ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs by diversifying their supply chains, while others are awaiting clarity on the final tariff comparisons.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights a catastrophic surge in global forest loss in 2024, primarily driven by wildfires exacerbated by record-breaking temperatures. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with the Amazon rainforest significantly impacted. While some countries, like Indonesia and Malaysia, managed to reduce forest loss through prevention efforts, the overall trend indicates a climate change feedback loop where drier conditions lead to more intense and widespread fires.

This practice also appears to be common among U.S. presidents, as highlighted by the recent example of Joe Biden. A new book has exposed how the political and media establishment in Washington collectively covered up Biden's declining mental health during the latter years of his presidency, and the family has recently announced that Biden is suffering from an aggressive form of prostate cancer, raising questions about when they knew about the condition.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a maintenance worker who is suspected of helping 10 inmates break out of a New Orleans jail. The employee, Sterling Williams, is accused of turning off the water to the cell used for the escape, which involved removing a toilet from the wall. Williams claimed an inmate threatened him with a makeshift knife if he did not help. Five of the inmates have been recaptured so far, and the investigation is ongoing to uncover all the facts and prosecute anyone who aided the escape.</p>

          <p>China's youth unemployment rate eased in April, falling to 15.8% from 16.5% in March, as the nation prepares for a record number of university graduates entering the job market. Despite the decrease, youth unemployment remains higher than the same period last year. An estimated 12.22 million people are set to graduate from Chinese universities this year, raising concerns that the jobless rate may climb again after the academic year ends in the summer. The youth unemployment rate soared during the pandemic and remains a major concern.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports to the U.S. have shrunk for the first time this year, reflecting the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs. Overall exports growth has slowed, and the trade surplus with the U.S. has narrowed. Japan is subject to a 25% levy on auto, steel, and aluminum exports to the U.S., as well as baseline tariffs. Experts anticipate the central bank to delay its next interest rate hike due to uncertainty on U.S. tariffs. Trade policy "flip-flops" risk creating whiplash that would ripple through the economy, hurting growth.</p>

The legislators are advocating for alternative water solutions, including wastewater recycling, increased water storage, and levee improvements.
