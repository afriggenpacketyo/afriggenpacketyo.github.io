          <p>More than 30 people were killed and many wounded in an attack near a food aid distribution center in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials. Witnesses reported fire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the Israeli military denied involvement, stating their forces did not fire at civilians near the site. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claimed it delivered aid without incident, dismissing reports of casualties, while the U.N. and other aid groups have criticized the GHF's system.

          <p>Wesleyan University President Michael Roth expressed concern over potential restrictions on Chinese students and the broader implications for higher education in the United States. He views the increased scrutiny of Chinese students as an act of intimidation aimed at scaring schools into conforming to the current administration's policies. Roth emphasized the importance of attracting international students to learn about American values and freedoms, noting that limiting their access undermines the country's free atmosphere. While acknowledging legitimate criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, he cautioned against addressing these issues under pressure from an authoritarian administration.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party in the UK is advocating for prison officers to be armed with Taser stun guns and baton rounds to manage violent inmates more effectively. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick stated that specialist guards should have access to these weapons as a last resort, with secure armouries introduced at maximum security jails. This proposal follows a review conducted for the party by former prison governor Ian Acheson and aims to provide officers with greater confidence in handling threats. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said some prison officers will use Tasers this summer on a trial basis, but argued that giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.</p>
