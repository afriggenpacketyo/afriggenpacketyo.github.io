The win significantly narrows the championship points gap between the two drivers to just 15. The race was dominated by the McLarens, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing a distant third. A first-lap incident involving Max Verstappen and Kimi Antonelli resulted in Verstappen being taken out of the race, further impacting the championship standings and marking a difficult day for Red Bull at their home track.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to dismantle federal energy efficiency regulations, including the popular Energy Star program and standards governed by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). Following an executive order, the Department of Energy is preparing to eliminate or modify 47 regulations affecting home appliances like dishwashers and light bulbs. Consumer groups and appliance manufacturers have expressed concern, arguing the changes could lead to higher utility bills and a less transparent market for consumers.

Key changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and allowing the health-related component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation.

Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon, finding that about 17% had incorrect levels of active ingredients. This issue, which can lead to continued tumor growth, stems from problems like manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products.

          <p>British sports car maker Lotus has assured the UK's business secretary that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, following rumors of a potential production move to the US. The concerns, which could have jeopardized 1,300 jobs, arose after the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was reportedly exploring options to avoid US tariffs. Production at the Hethel plant was paused in May due to these tariffs but is expected to resume as they are reduced. The government expressed its commitment to supporting the UK automotive sector to ensure its global competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Inspection Service is alerting Americans to a growing "brushing" scam where people receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items. This scheme is used by third-party sellers to post fake "verified" reviews to boost their product ratings, but it signals a more serious problem: the recipient's personal information has likely been compromised. Experts warn that having your name and address exposed in this way can be a precursor to identity theft or financial fraud. The USPS advises reporting such incidents, checking financial accounts for suspicious activity, and updating passwords.</p>

Rather than imposing mandatory targets, the voluntary strategy will ask businesses to find their own ways to promote healthy food, such as through special offers or loyalty point incentives. The initiative, part of a forthcoming 10-year plan for the NHS, aims to make healthy eating more accessible and relieve pressure on the health service.

The study highlights the positive impact of automatic enrollment in employer-sponsored plans, as participants who were auto-enrolled have median balances roughly 60% higher than those who enrolled voluntarily after ten years of service.
