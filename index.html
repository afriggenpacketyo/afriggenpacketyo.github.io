            <p>Kyren Lacy, a former LSU star wide receiver and NFL prospect, has died at the age of 24 in Houston. His death comes as a grand jury was set to convene to hear evidence in a case where Lacy was under investigation for a December crash that resulted in the death of a 78-year-old man. Lacy was accused of reckless driving and fleeing the scene; he had turned himself in to police in January and was released on bail. Lacy transferred to LSU in 2022 and had a successful season in 2024 with 58 catches for 866 yards and nine touchdowns.</p>

            <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the recent exemptions for electronic devices from tariffs are temporary, with these items expected to fall under "semiconductor tariffs" within a couple of months. Lutnick emphasized the administration's commitment to reshoring semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries to the United States for national security reasons. He expressed confidence that President Trump and President Xi will resolve tariff negotiations positively for the U.S., despite current challenges. Lutnick also addressed VP Vance's comments about Chinese people, deferring to Vance while asserting that China has historically undermined American businesses through government-backed competition.</p>

            <p>Despite a tariff reprieve for Apple's iPhone and other technology hardware, many U.S. businesses face potentially "irreversible" damage from President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China as businesses halt container exports. Economist Erica York warns that the high tariffs could effectively stop most trade between the U.S. and China. Stephen Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, highlights the disruption to supply chains and the risk of lost sales and product shortages for small businesses.</p>

            <p>A rare split has emerged between the dollar's value and U.S. Treasury yields, signaling a potential decline in investor confidence in the U.S. economy. Typically, the dollar and yields move in tandem, but recent tariff-fueled financial turmoil has caused them to diverge, with the dollar plunging as borrowing costs rise. This trend, coupled with stock market declines, suggests a shift in America's fiscal landscape and its status as a safe haven. Barclays analysts note this parallel sell-off in equity, rates, and currency is more typical of emerging markets than core safe-haven markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Clinical psychologist Diana Hill and movement specialist Katy Bowman suggest retraining the brain to crave physical activity instead of phone scrolling using psychological flexibility. Scrolling activates the brain's reward pathways, leading to dopamine release, while physical activity triggers a more gradual release of dopamine and other mood-boosting neurochemicals. They propose six strategies, including 'surfing' the urge to scroll, stretching or dancing while surfing, savoring favorite activities, giving familiar movements a makeover, turning worry into compassionate action, and taking the news to-go by combining movement with nature. The goal is to build a new habit of reaching for movement instead of your phone.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs have thrown the global trading order into disarray, causing concern among supply chain specialists. Companies are scrambling to adjust their sourcing and shipping strategies, leading to increased costs and volatility in the shipping market. The situation is particularly challenging for U.S. importers who are finalizing annual shipping contracts. Experts warn that trade diversion and product dumping could further disrupt global trade flows, potentially harming manufacturing industries. Adding to the uncertainty, the U.S. is considering imposing costly port fees on Chinese-built ships.</p>

            <p>The renewable energy sector faces significant challenges due to rising electricity grid demands, funding freezes, subsidy rollbacks, and tariffs on key components. While renewable energy is essential to a broader energy supply equation, companies are working to make their business models viable despite these headwinds. President Trump has targeted renewable energy subsidies, while simultaneously pushing for increased fossil fuel exploration and production. Experts believe that clean energy companies can handle either subsidy decreases or tariff increases, but the combination of both will add substantial stress to the market.</p>

            <p>With searches for “parenting styles” on the rise, it's important to differentiate between authoritarian and authoritative approaches. Authoritarian parenting involves a rigid, top-down approach with high control and low warmth, often relying on punishments without explanation. Experts recommend against this style, citing its potential to damage children's communication skills and mental health. Authoritative parenting, which is often confused with authoritarian, involves clear boundaries, open communication, and warmth, fostering independence and problem-solving skills in children.</p>
