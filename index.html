The stock, which had more than tripled on its first day of trading, experienced a sharp correction, though its valuation remains well above what Adobe had offered in a failed 2022 acquisition attempt. The initial surge indicated a strong investor appetite for high-growth tech IPOs, but the subsequent drop reflects market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has warned that U.S. inflation could rise as businesses begin passing the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs onto consumers. She noted that many companies have so far absorbed these costs by selling off stockpiled inventory, but are now facing squeezed margins. Hammack also described a "two-speed economy," where high-income individuals are thriving while lower-income households struggle with rising living costs, creating a challenging environment for monetary policy.

          <p>The search for Michael Paul Brown, a military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has entered its fourth day. A multi-agency manhunt is underway in the rugged terrain west of the town, with authorities considering the 45-year-old suspect armed and dangerous. Investigators believe Brown, who lived next door to the bar, knew the victims, but a motive for the killings remains unclear in the tight-knit community.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is set to execute inmate Byron Black without deactivating his implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a device that can shock his heart. Black's lawyers argued that leaving the device active could cause extreme, unnecessary pain during the lethal injection, but the state Supreme Court overturned a lower court's order to disable it. The case presents a unique and troubling ethical dilemma, as medical professionals generally refuse to participate in executions, and there is no precedent for this situation.</p>
