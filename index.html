          <h2>Trump's Foreign Policy Unaligned with Right-Wing Allies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's foreign policy decisions, noting that they often don't align with the expectations of his right-wing populist allies around the world. Despite endorsements and cultivated ties, leaders like Netanyahu, Modi, and Orbán have found themselves at odds with Trump's actions, particularly regarding trade, negotiations with adversaries, and economic partnerships. The article highlights that Trump's approach is driven more by transactional interests and quick wins than by political affinity, as demonstrated by tariffs affecting even right-leaning governments. This divergence underscores the unpredictable nature of Trump's foreign policy and its focus on immediate gains over ideological alignment.</p>

          <p>In Game 1 of the Western Conference finals, the Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 114-88, led by Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 31 points. After a slow start, Gilgeous-Alexander scored 20 points in the second half, while Julius Randle led Minnesota with 28 points. Anthony Edwards struggled, scoring only 18 points on 5-of-13 shooting, as the Thunder packed the paint defensively. Oklahoma City's victory came shortly after eliminating Denver in Game 7, while Minnesota had a week-long break before the game, and Minnesota will need to adjust their offensive strategy to counter Oklahoma City's defense in Game 2.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber attacked a school bus in Pakistan's Balochistan province, killing at least four children and two adults.

          <p>A federal judge is investigating whether the Trump administration violated a previous order by deporting migrants to South Sudan and other third-party countries without due process. The judge's order requires the government to maintain custody of those deported to ensure their return if the removals are found unlawful. The emergency motion was filed after lawyers indicated that at least 12 migrants had been sent to South Sudan, including one from Myanmar and another from Vietnam, both of whom had removal orders to their home countries. The State Department advises against travel to South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to pressure them to support a massive budget package, but the bill faces significant opposition from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives are demanding deeper spending cuts and the elimination of clean energy subsidies, while moderates are resisting changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). The Rules Committee met through the night to debate the bill, with Speaker Johnson working to find a compromise before the Memorial Day deadline. The legislation, which is estimated to add trillions to the deficit, remains deeply divided, and its fate is uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in Devon, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued permission was needed. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, including camping. The Dartmoor National Park Association hailed the decision as a landmark victory for access rights, emphasizing the importance of responsible camping. Campaigners are now calling for the right to wild camp to be extended to other parts of England.</p>

The export volume reached a nine-month high, with niche rare earth metals also increasing.

Experts warn that many borrowers may have forgotten the severe financial consequences of defaulting due to the five-year pause during the pandemic.

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by President Trump are amplifying debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates on various debts. Investors are on edge over Trump's tariff policy, and the attempt to push through tax cuts without significantly slashing spending has triggered bond market turmoil. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen above 4.5 percent, and the 30-year yield has jumped above 5 percent, reflecting deficit worries. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta warned that volatility in the Treasury market could add to uncertainty about the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged House Republicans not to alter Medicaid as they attempt to pass a budget bill advancing his agenda. Hard-liners are pushing for stricter Medicaid cuts, while others are focused on the state and local tax deduction cap. Trump told Republicans to stick together and pass the bill, but some remain hesitant, potentially jeopardizing its passage in the House. The bill also faces challenges in the Senate, where Republicans plan to make changes, creating further hurdles for House leadership.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he never had to buy rice because he received it as gifts. This comment came as locals struggle with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and protectionist policies. His resignation adds to Prime Minister Ishiba's challenges ahead of an Upper House election, with voters discontent over rice prices and inflation. The agriculture ministry has attempted to curb prices by releasing government stockpiles, but with limited effect, and Japan's inflation is high compared to other developed countries.</p>

          <p>UK inflation has risen to 3.5% in April, the highest rate in over a year, driven by increases in household bills, particularly for water, gas, and electricity. The rise in inflation is higher than economists had expected, and it has pushed inflation further above the Bank of England's target of 2%. The Bank of England previously anticipated a spike in inflation before dropping back to its target. Analysts suggest that the latest inflation data casts doubt on additional interest rate cuts this year.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for Congress to pass President Trump's tax reform bill, highlighting its potential to reward hard work, bring jobs back home, and rebuild the American economy. The bill aims to make permanent the 2017 tax cuts, eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, and provide tax relief for seniors. It also includes measures to hold elite universities and nonprofits accountable, end Biden-era tax breaks, and ensure taxpayer-funded benefits serve citizens. The bill projects to increase take-home pay for families and stimulate economic growth.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the disillusionment and distrust in the status quo of healthcare in America, partly due to the actions of companies like Johnson & Johnson, helped create space for the rise of figures like Robert F.

          <p>President Trump's announced "most favored nation" policy to peg drug costs to lower prices paid in other developed countries is largely nonexistent. The executive order directs the HHS secretary to identify a "price target" and asks the pharmaceutical industry to voluntarily comply, with no enforcement mechanism. This article argues that Trump's lack of seriousness and blaming of foreign countries reveals the plan's weakness. It suggests that Trump could have worked with Congress to expand the federal government's ability to negotiate drug prices or supported a bill allowing affordable generic versions of overpriced drugs.</p>

The book's hostility to liberal governance, skepticism of democracy, and faith in the wealthy over the law, prefigured Trump's actions and DOGE's gutting of the federal government in 2025.
