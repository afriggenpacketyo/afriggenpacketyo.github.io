        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Nippon Steel stated that tariffs will not help revive U.S. manufacturing. This statement comes amid ongoing discussions about trade policies and their impact on domestic industries. The CEO's perspective highlights concerns that tariffs may not be the most effective solution for strengthening manufacturing in the United States, suggesting alternative strategies should be considered to bolster the sector. It is important to consider the potential drawbacks and unintended consequences of relying solely on tariffs to achieve economic goals. The CEO's comment adds to the ongoing debate about the best approaches to support and grow American manufacturing. </p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in January 2022, leading to jubilant celebrations among her supporters. The trial garnered significant attention, fueled by a strong TikTok following and multiple documentaries, with many viewing the case as emblematic of flaws within the criminal justice system. Read, a financial analyst, maintained her innocence, claiming she was framed by police, and was able to post bail, allowing her to engage with the public narrative in a way most defendants cannot. The case has highlighted the power of online communities and content creators in shaping public perception during high-profile trials, illustrating a shift in crisis messaging from traditional press releases to social media engagement.</p>

          <p>Amid the Los Angeles Dodgers' silence on mass immigration raids, Jaime Jarr√≠n, the Spanish-language voice of the Dodgers, and player Kik√© Hern√°ndez have voiced their support for the immigrant community. Jarr√≠n, a Hall of Fame broadcaster, emphasized the importance of treating everyone with dignity and respect, while Hern√°ndez expressed sadness and anger at the treatment of immigrants. Their statements contrast with the Dodgers' silence, which has drawn criticism given the team's large Latino and immigrant fan base. This divergence highlights the growing pressure on sports teams to address social issues and the potential consequences of remaining silent on matters of community concern.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Board of Trustees' annual report projects that the trust fund relied upon for retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033, unchanged from last year's projections, at which point only 77% of scheduled benefits would be payable. The combined trust funds, including disability insurance, are expected to last until 2034, one year earlier than previously estimated, with 81% of benefits payable at that time. The report considers the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners. However, it does not account for potential impacts from new tax proposals, tariffs, or deportations, which could further threaten Social Security's financing (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Many Californians struggle with high transportation costs, making car ownership unaffordable, as illustrated by Franchescoli Andrade's daily 20-mile commute via bike, train, and bus. A United Way study reveals that 35% of California households cannot afford basic living costs, including transportation, with the average cost of owning a new car exceeding $12,000 annually. The financial burden of transportation is steadily rising, along with housing and childcare, posing a significant challenge for low-income families. While moving to more affordable areas might seem like a solution, it's often impractical due to family and community ties.</p>

While Jeanie Buss will remain as Lakers governor, the change in ownership is expected to bring increased investment in infrastructure, coaching, and scouting.

          <p>3D-printed guns are increasingly accessible online, raising concerns that they could become the "weapon of choice" for criminals and violent extremists. These untraceable firearms can be assembled using 3D printers, downloadable blueprints, and basic materials, evading gun-control laws. Social media platforms like Telegram, Facebook, and Instagram are being used to advertise and sell these weapons. While companies claim to be removing such content, loopholes persist, allowing dealers to operate. The availability of free guides and blueprints further enables individuals to build their own 3D-printed guns, making it difficult to control their spread.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog has stated that Israel would welcome international support in its efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. Herzog claimed that Israel shared intelligence with the U.S. indicating Iran's plans to develop nuclear weapons, leading to Israel's decision to launch attacks. While Israel has not explicitly requested U.S. military involvement, it believes U.S. intervention could be crucial, particularly in destroying the heavily fortified Fordow nuclear site. Herzog also suggested that weakening Iran's regime could lead to broader regional changes, including resolving the conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts in Michigan successfully trapped a black bear and removed a large plastic lid that had been stuck around its neck for two years. The bear, first spotted as a cub in 2023, had survived despite the obstruction, which caused scarring and hair loss around its neck. The Department of Natural Resources lured the bear into a trap, anesthetized it, and cut off the lid, after which the bear was released back into the wild. It remains unclear how the lid became stuck, but the bear's survival is considered remarkable.</p>

The remaining "carbon budget" to maintain a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C has shrunk to 130 billion tonnes of CO2. Last year was the first on record with global average air temperatures exceeding 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

This guidance comes as the OfS releases new guidelines for universities in England on upholding free speech, following a recent fine imposed on the University of Sussex for policies that had a "chilling effect" on freedom of speech. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for non-compliance. The guidelines aim to ensure that diverse perspectives can be discussed and taught within the bounds of the law.</p>

          <p>Two breakthrough Alzheimer's drugs, donanemab and lecanemab, have been deemed too expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, despite their ability to slow the disease's progression. NICE concluded that the drugs' benefits were too limited to justify their cost, potentially leading to cuts in other essential services. While clinical trials showed that these drugs could delay the transition from mild to moderate dementia, the high cost and modest benefits have sparked debate. The decision highlights the challenges of balancing innovation in healthcare with the efficient allocation of limited resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government plans to combat the spread of New World screwworms by building an $8.5 million insect dispersal facility in Texas. The facility will breed millions of sterile male flies, which will then be released to mate with females and prevent them from laying eggs in open wounds. The USDA also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility in Mexico into one for breeding sterile screwworm flies. The goal is to prevent the spread of the "man-eater" parasites from flies that lay eggs in open wounds, nostrils, eyes and mouths. (The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to "man-eater," according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.)</p>
