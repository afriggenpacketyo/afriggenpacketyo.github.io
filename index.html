          <p>Country music star Mark Chesnutt was hospitalized in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after experiencing a low sodium count and extremely high blood pressure, forcing the cancellation of several upcoming concerts. This health issue follows a previous emergency quadruple bypass surgery he underwent in 2024, from which he had been recovering at his home in Texas. His representative stated that he is currently in stable condition and has apologized to fans for the missed performances. The singer hopes to reschedule the canceled shows in Louisiana and New Mexico in the near future.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators are participating in 'No Kings' protests across the United States, with major rallies planned in New York City, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles to challenge what organizers call President Trump's authoritarianism. In response, Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have activated their National Guard troops, citing concerns over potential unrest linked to Antifa, though organizers maintain the protests are peaceful. The rallies have drawn support from various public figures and have seen solidarity protests emerge in several European capitals. The events highlight the deep political divisions currently present within the country.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his Duke of York title and other honors, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre has publicly called on King Charles to take the further step of stripping him of his 'prince' title. Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexual assault, reached an out-of-court settlement with him in 2022, though he has consistently denied the allegations. Her brother, Sky Roberts, expressed that this move would bring a greater sense of justice and accountability for survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's network. Prince Andrew's decision to step back further from public life comes amid increasing pressure over his association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>An apartment balcony collapsed in Cincinnati's Corryville neighborhood, injuring at least ten people, one of whom is in critical condition. The incident occurred at a complex near the University of Cincinnati, and several of the injured were students who were reportedly celebrating after a major exam. According to fire officials, the 8-by-12-foot wooden balcony gave way from the third floor of the building. An investigation is now underway to determine the cause of the collapse, and the university is providing support, including counseling and housing assistance, for any affected students.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The dismissal followed a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea, which left the club with only one point from his five league matches in charge and hovering just above the relegation zone. Postecoglou failed to secure a single win across eight games in all competitions. The club's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, is reportedly seeking a quick replacement, with former Burnley manager Sean Dyche and Fulham's Marco Silva being considered for the position.</p>

          <p>George Santos, the disgraced former Republican congressman, was released from a New Jersey prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Santos had served less than three months of his sentence before the decision, which followed public advocacy from allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The commutation has sparked criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, who view it as an example of executive overreach. In a letter to Trump prior to his release, Santos had pleaded for fairness and described himself as a steadfast supporter of the president's political agenda.</p>

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center suggested the ship was hit by a projectile, while an EU naval force indicated the fire may have been accidental.

The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, found that financial stability was a primary motivator for men. Experts suggest this trend may also be linked to men's reliance on romantic relationships as their main source of social and emotional support, whereas women often maintain stronger support networks through friendships and family.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who won 30 scholarships to graduate debt-free, advises prospective college students to avoid common application mistakes to maximize their chances of securing financial aid. She recommends focusing on local and state-level scholarships, as well as those with multiple specific criteria, to face less competition than large national awards. Greene stresses that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and suggests that students should apply for 100 to 200 different awards. She also emphasizes the importance of treating the application essay as a marketing tool to convince committees to invest in one's education.</p>

Wells Fargo notably beat expectations and raised its profitability targets, leading to a significant weekly gain in its stock price.

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) following a significant drop in the beverage company's stock price. The decline was triggered by KDP's announcement of a merger with JDE Peet's, a move that surprised investors who had been advocating for a simpler separation of KDP's coffee and beverage assets. The deal's structure is seen as highly favorable to JAB Holdings, which has a controlling interest in JDE Peet's and was formerly the majority owner of KDP. Starboard's involvement may aim to restore investor confidence and guide the company through this strategic shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A citizen-led group in Missouri, 'People Not Politicians,' is gathering signatures for a ballot referendum to overturn a new congressional map signed into law by the state's Republican governor. Critics argue the map is aggressively gerrymandered to favor Republicans by targeting the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II in Kansas City. The effort has faced legal challenges from the state's attorney general and secretary of state but has reportedly collected over 100,000 signatures. If successful, the referendum would allow voters to decide the map's fate in 2026, potentially stalling its implementation for the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge recommends that parents delay giving children smartphones until they can drive and restrict social media access until age 16 to promote better mental health outcomes. To prepare for this, she advises parents to begin conversations about responsible technology use when children are in late elementary school. Key strategies include teaching kids about online privacy, the value of their time, and setting firm rules such as no phones in bedrooms overnight. Twenge also suggests using parental controls and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone to help children build a healthier relationship with technology.</p>

The brand, now profitable and sold in over 100 stores like Saks Fifth Avenue, has gained a following among financiers, politicians, and billionaires, with coats ranging from $1,545 to $2,945.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) rule requires airlines to input either 'M' or 'F' for a traveler's sex, disregarding the 'X' gender marker available on U.S. passports since 2022. This change has caused confusion and concern among non-binary and transgender travelers, who fear it could lead to difficulties or discrimination during international travel. While U.S. courts have affirmed the validity of 'X' marker passports, advocacy groups state the new rule creates ambiguity and could empower individual agents to act on personal biases. The CBP maintains that travelers with valid documents will be processed as they were previously.</p>
