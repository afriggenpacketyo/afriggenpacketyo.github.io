        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv that resulted in at least ten deaths and ninety injuries, former President Trump issued a public statement urging Vladimir Putin to "STOP!" The attack, the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since last summer, prompted Trump to express his dissatisfaction with the strikes and emphasize the need for a peace deal. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, currently in South Africa, condemned the attack and announced his early return to Ukraine. The Russian attack occurred amidst ongoing negotiations aimed at ending the war, with the United States pressuring Ukraine to consider a peace plan that may involve ceding territory to Russia.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble (P&G) reported mixed quarterly results, leading to a lowered outlook for the current quarter and potential price hikes. The company cited a consumer slowdown, new tariffs, and planned brand investments as reasons for the adjusted forecast. CEO Moeller indicated that tariffs are inherently inflationary, suggesting that price increases are likely in the next fiscal year. Uncertainty surrounding tariffs and global divisiveness have created a more nervous consumer, impacting sales volume. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Airlines has withdrawn its 2025 financial guidance due to an uncertain economic outlook and weaker-than-expected leisure travel bookings. CEO Robert Isom noted a significant drop in domestic leisure travel starting in February, although international bookings and premium cabins remain strong. The airline forecasts second-quarter revenue to be slightly below expectations, with adjusted per-share earnings also projected to be lower.

          <p>President Zelenskyy of Ukraine has firmly rejected a proposed peace plan from the Trump administration that would recognize Russian control over Crimea. Zelenskyy emphasized that such recognition would violate the Ukrainian Constitution and betray Ukrainians living in the region. Within Ukraine, formal recognition of Russian control over Crimea would be widely viewed as a dangerous concession to a duplicitous rival and an abandonment of Ukrainians still living in the region. No Ukrainian politician would vote to legalize the occupation of Ukrainian territories.</p>

          <p>A Harvard survey found that 42% of Americans under 30 report barely getting by financially, citing struggles with limited security or making ends meet. Financial insecurity disproportionately affects women, Hispanics, and those without college degrees.

Many young adults are graduating with significant college debt and struggling to find careers that adequately cover their loans and basic expenses.</p>

          <p>The German government has revised its economic growth forecast to 0% for the year, citing the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs, particularly on automobiles, steel, and aluminum, are expected to significantly harm Germany's export-oriented economy. Germany's economy minister, Robert Habeck, stated that the U.S. trade policy is particularly affecting the German economy, which is already struggling with weak foreign demand and reduced competitiveness. Germany is currently the only G7 nation whose economy has not grown in the past two years.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack advocates for a patient approach in evaluating the impact of tariffs on inflation and growth, rather than preemptive action.

She expresses concern over potential conflicts between the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and full employment. Hammack emphasizes that the Fed's focus is on the real economy and how market movements affect households and businesses.</p>

          <p>Anthony Coulson, general manager at the McVitie's chocolate refinery and bakery in Stockport, suggests that chocolate digestives should be eaten with the chocolate-covered side facing down. He claims this allows the chocolate to melt and release its flavor first. The factory, which has been producing chocolate digestives for 100 years, makes approximately 80 million packets annually. Despite Coulson's preference, he acknowledges that people can eat the biscuit however they prefer.</p>
