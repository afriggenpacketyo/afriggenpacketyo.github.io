        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has announced the removal of many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products, effective September 1st, signaling a significant step towards improving strained trade relations. These counter-tariffs, initially set at 25% on CA$30 billion worth of U.S. goods, were a response to the U.S. imposing 25% duties on steel and aluminum. While specific tariffs on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum will remain in place for now, Prime Minister Mark Carney emphasized Canada's focus on strategic sectors and its belief in having the best trade deal with the U.S. This development, following a "productive" phone call between Carney and President Donald Trump, aims to kickstart negotiations as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement nears its review, with the White House calling the move "long overdue."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a notably dovish speech at Jackson Hole, signaling that interest rate cuts are likely in the near future. He cited rising downside risks to employment and suggested that the inflationary impact of elevated tariffs would be a temporary, rather than spiraling, concern. The market responded with a significant rally, particularly benefiting cyclical stocks in sectors like consumer discretionary, real estate, industrials, and materials, which thrive on increased economic activity spurred by lower borrowing costs. This shift has boosted investor confidence for at least two, and potentially three, rate cuts this year, with a September reduction now seen as highly probable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI agents conducted searches at the Maryland residence and Washington D.C. office of former Trump national security adviser John Bolton on Friday morning. Sources indicate these searches are related to allegations that Bolton is in unauthorized possession of classified records, an assertion publicly echoed by FBI director Kash Patel. Although the execution of a search warrant requires probable cause of a federal law violation, it does not imply Bolton has been formally charged or committed a crime. This high-profile action unfolds as President Donald Trump has recently intensified calls for the Justice Department to investigate his political adversaries, including Bolton, over various issues, including Bolton's criticisms of Trump's engagements with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack voiced skepticism about lowering interest rates, despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent dovish remarks. Hammack emphasized the need to maintain a "modestly restrictive" policy stance to bring inflation back to target, noting that inflation has been above the Fed's goal for four years. She expressed concern that an accommodative stance could reignite inflationary pressures, advocating for caution. While not a voting member on the Federal Open Market Committee this year, her hawkish perspective highlights internal divisions within the Fed regarding future monetary policy, contrasting sharply with current market expectations for a September rate cut.

A $10,000 deposit can yield substantial earnings, such as approximately $107.50 over three months at 4.30% APY or around $2,100 over five years at 4.20% APY. These accounts provide guaranteed returns and FDIC insurance up to $250,000, locking in rates for the entire term. The choice of CD term should align with an individual's liquidity needs and financial goals, as longer terms often offer enhanced yields and the benefits of compounding interest, providing peace of mind in a stable, low-risk investment.

          <p>Serena Williams has partnered with telehealth service Ro to promote GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, citing her personal struggles with weight loss post-pregnancy. This multi-year campaign, which includes Williams stating the medicine was "what my body needed," has ignited a divided public response and sparked significant debate. Critics argue that a global sporting icon, previously celebrated for defying toxic beauty standards, is now normalizing these drugs as lifestyle products for people who aren't typical patients, potentially reinforcing thinness culture. The endorsement is viewed by many as a strategic commercial move, raising questions about its impact on her athletic legacy and the broader implications for societal perceptions of health and body image, especially given the drugs' controversial over-prescription and accessibility issues.</p>

Notable finds include statues of royal figures, sphinxes (one with Ramses II's cartouche), a merchant ship, and stone anchors, offering invaluable insights into ancient history.

Nearly 2,000 National Guard members are stationed in the city, primarily tasked with protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control, with no overt indications of threats requiring weapons.

Nuno openly acknowledged the strained dynamic, stating, "where there's smoke, there's fire," and expressed concern that the lack of communication is unsettling the playing squad. Speculation suggests Nuno's limited involvement in the club's summer recruitment, which saw seven new players signed and a key winger sold, is a primary factor in the deteriorating relationship. This internal uncertainty creates significant instability for the club, which is embarking on its first European adventure in three decades and had only recently signed Nuno to a new three-year contract.</p>

          <p>European leaders are actively discussing potential troop deployments in Ukraine, with scenarios ranging from non-combat peacekeepers and trainers to a combat-ready deterrent force. Experts suggest that sending a few thousand trainers could modernize Ukraine's military structures and align them with NATO standards, improving efficiency and defense culture. A larger deterrent force, potentially up to 150,000 troops, could signal strong commitment without direct engagement, but faces significant challenges including member states' reluctance to divert national soldiers and differing political opinions. The article also explores a "trip wire" scenario with fewer troops. This complex discussion highlights the strategic considerations, risks, and lack of unified command involved as the "coalition of the willing" seeks robust security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Approach Offers a Path to End the Ukraine War</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's "America First" foreign policy and "art of the deal" strategy offer the clearest roadmap to ending the tragic war in Ukraine. The author contends that Trump's sober realism, unlike previous administrations' "idealistic slogans," prioritizes U.S. national interests and a transactional approach, enabling him to navigate complex relationships with leaders like Putin and Zelenskyy. Key principles for a grand Russo-Ukrainian peace accord are outlined: Ukrainian neutrality (no NATO membership), pragmatic land swaps (Crimea remaining with Russia, Donbas border redrawing), a Marshall Plan-style economic reconstruction package, and robust enforcement mechanisms. The article suggests Trump's track record in other conflict resolutions positions him uniquely to achieve a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plunged, shedding nearly $100 million in market value, following the release of its new logo, which eliminates the long-standing drawing of an overall-clad man. This updated design is part of a broader brand refresh overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, aiming to modernize the 55-year-old chain's image, menu, and store decor. While the company stated its values and the "Uncle Herschel" figure remain central, conservative commentators and marketing experts widely criticized the rebrand, with some labeling it "woke" or a "fiasco" for abandoning a cherished brand element. This incident highlights how marketing missteps, particularly in politically charged environments, can significantly impact investor confidence and company valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent speech, hinting at potential interest rate cuts, offers significant good news for homeowners hoping to refinance high-rate mortgages. Mortgage rates typically track 10-year Treasury yields, which are sensitive to Fed monetary policy decisions and broader economic changes. Experts suggest that if the Fed proceeds with rate cuts, potentially in September, it could lead to lower borrowing costs, benefiting both prospective homebuyers and those seeking to refinance existing loans. Homeowners are advised to proactively prepare for these opportunities by reviewing credit reports, maintaining strong credit scores, estimating home equity, and gathering essential documents to enable swift action when favorable rates emerge.

Jackson argued that "life-saving biomedical research" was at stake, with grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, COVID-19, and gender identity being impacted.

          <p>While girls continue to outperform boys in GCSE pass rates, their performance has dipped this year, narrowing the gap to its smallest on record, prompting concerns from education experts. Analysis suggests a decline in girls' attainment since the Covid pandemic, directly linked to "worrying trends around girls' wellbeing," including worsening mental health, insufficient sleep, and pervasive social media use. Data indicates girls are now more likely to be persistently absent from secondary school, and an international study showed them lagging further behind boys in maths and science. Experts are calling for a greater emphasis on "belonging and emotional security" in schools and actively addressing the impact of misogyny to prevent further academic and well-being declines.</p>

Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov countered that Putin is ready to meet when the agenda is prepared, blaming Zelenskyy for rejecting key principles like Ukrainian neutrality and territorial discussions. These diplomatic stalemates occur amidst renewed Russian attacks on Ukraine, including a heavy drone and missile barrage, and Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, underscoring the ongoing conflict and severe challenges to achieving a lasting peace agreement.</p>

          <p>Global postal services, including Royal Mail and Germany's DHL, are temporarily halting some deliveries to the U.S. due to widespread confusion surrounding new import tariffs. President Trump's executive order, effective August 29th, ends the global import tax exemption on low-value parcels, meaning most packages will now face the same tariff rates as other goods from their country of origin. The White House justified the change by citing "escalating deceptive shipping practices" and the influx of illicit drugs. Postal companies are struggling to rapidly implement systems to comply with the new rules, leading to service suspensions that impact businesses and consumers globally, as key questions about duty payment mechanisms and responsibilities remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting undocumented migrants from the U.S. to African "third countries" is raising significant concerns and questions about its implications. Uganda recently became the latest nation to accept a deal, following South Sudan and Eswatini, to take in migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States. Human rights groups are particularly alarmed by sending immigrants to countries with troubling human rights records or those already burdened with large refugee populations, such as Uganda. Critics question the true purpose and benefits for these African nations, suggesting the agreements are driven by geopolitics and a desire for improved relationships with the Trump administration, rather than genuine humanitarian considerations.</p>

Newsom's press office X account has gained significant traction and impressions, generating memes and directly responding to critics, including a jab at Senator Ted Cruz and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

          <p>Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) are a popular option for homeowners to tap into their equity for various needs, but lending experts warn that maxing them out carries significant financial risks. Unlike fixed-rate loans, HELOCs have variable interest rates, meaning monthly payments can become unaffordable if rates climb, potentially leading to default and even foreclosure. High credit utilization from a maxed-out HELOC also negatively impacts credit scores. For those who have already drawn the full amount, strategies include building a disciplined repayment plan, closely monitoring interest rate changes, and considering refinancing to a fixed-rate home equity loan or cash-out refinance. Exploring personal loans or 0% APR credit cards are also alternatives, though each comes with its own trade-offs and potential fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez appeared before California's parole board, arguing for his freedom decades after being convicted alongside his brother Erik for their parents' 1989 murders. This hearing follows Erik's denial of parole just one day prior, primarily due to "behavior in prison," including multiple policy violations since 2013. Both brothers maintain they acted in self-defense after years of alleged sexual assault and physical abuse from their parents, a claim vehemently disputed by Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman, who believes they lied and have not taken full responsibility. Their sentences were recently reduced, making them eligible for parole under California's youth offender law, and the proceedings underscore the complex legal and emotional dimensions of their high-profile case.</p>
