          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks in Switzerland, a significant decrease from the current 145% but still higher than desired by investors. This move signals a potential shift in Trump's approach, as he previously stated he wouldn't lower tariffs to initiate negotiations. The talks aim to establish stability and a foundation for future agreements, amidst concerns over declining goods movement from China to the U.S. The article emphasizes the importance of China as a major U.S. trading partner, with substantial import and export volumes.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the beginning of a difficult period for college students, marked by the resumption of strict debt collection and potential reductions in financial aid. The Trump administration is restarting collections of defaulted student loans, while House Republicans are proposing changes that would reduce aid eligibility and increase loan payments. The Republican plan is part of a budget reconciliation bill likely to pass Congress, signaling a shift away from broad-scale debt relief. The author warns of a grim financial aid landscape for future students, with limited borrowing options and fewer protections against predatory colleges.</p>
