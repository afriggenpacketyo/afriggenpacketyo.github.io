          <h2>Analyst Questions the Feasibility of Moving iPhone Assembly to India</h2>

          <p>Craig Moffett, a top analyst, doubts Apple's plans to shift U.S. iPhone assembly to India, citing the continued reliance on Chinese components and potential resistance. He argues that moving assembly alone won't solve tariff-related cost issues and that Apple's supply chain will remain anchored in China. Moffett also points to potential backlash in China and reduced carrier subsidies as factors impacting iPhone sales, cutting his Apple price target to $141. He emphasizes that while Apple is a strong company, valuation concerns and macroeconomic headwinds pose challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll reveals that voters are concerned about President Trump's aggressive expansion of executive power and express doubts about his agenda. Majorities view his administration's early months as chaotic and scary, even among those who approve of his job performance. Voters feel Trump doesn't understand their daily struggles, and confidence in his handling of the economy and immigration is waning. His approval rating stands at 42%, historically low for this stage in a presidency.</p>

          <p>Critics argue that President Trump's policies and actions, whether intentional or not, are benefiting Vladimir Putin's agenda. These include pressuring Ukraine to cede territory, hinting at sanctions relief, and creating rifts with traditional U.S. allies. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine is seen as favoring Russia, allowing them to keep seized regions and preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. His approach is viewed as undermining U.S. institutions and interests to Russia's advantage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is investigating the potential deportation of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen to Honduras, raising concerns about due process. The child, along with her mother and sister, was allegedly deported despite the girl's U.S. citizenship. The Department of Homeland Security asserts the parent chose to take the child, but the father claims he was given little notice and was threatened with arrest if he tried to intervene. A hearing is scheduled to address the matter.</p>

          <p>Despite the establishment of a special tribunal to prosecute Russia's crimes in Ukraine, several challenges hinder its progress. These include the immunity of acting heads of state, such as Vladimir Putin, and the need for international cooperation. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leadership, it lacks the UN Security Council's power to waive immunity. Experts debate the scope of the tribunal's jurisdiction and the inclusion of events before the full-scale invasion in 2022.
