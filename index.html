          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite US Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:38:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, primarily fueled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which effectively compensated for a significant decline in exports to the United States due to tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, shipments to ASEAN countries rose by 20.8%, with notable growth in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. This surge is attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, with experts anticipating a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months, especially with the number of container vessels from China to the U.S. dropping dramatically. Optimism is tempered by the expectation of future trade challenges.</p>

The water level has already reached 2,344 meters, 80 meters above the original river level.

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale, curated by Carlo Ratti, addresses the urgent need for cities to adapt to extreme heat and other climate change impacts. With the theme "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective," the biennale emphasizes collaboration across disciplines and generations to rethink the built environment. The focus is on mitigating urban overheating through solutions like increasing green spaces and permeable surfaces, drawing inspiration from cities like Paris, Copenhagen, and Rotterdam, which are implementing climate adaptation strategies. The German Pavilion's "Stress Test" exhibition offers an immersive experience of future urban climates, highlighting the necessity for rapid action to ensure the habitability of European cities.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to impose sanctions on Russia's 'shadow fleet,' a group of oil tankers used to circumvent existing sanctions on Russian energy exports. The sanctions target up to 100 vessels that have carried over Â£18 billion worth of cargo since the start of 2024. These measures aim to disrupt President Vladimir Putin's oil revenue streams and protect subsea infrastructure, with the UK vowing to 'destroy' the shadow fleet operation. The announcement is expected at a summit of north European leaders, and further support for Ukraine's war efforts is anticipated.</p>

          <p>Japan is maintaining its demand for the complete removal of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, despite a recent U.S.-Britain trade agreement that left some levies in place. Tokyo seeks the full elimination of reciprocal tariffs, including a 25% levy on cars and steel/aluminum, as a condition for reaching an agreement with Washington. The government is dismissing the idea of reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs. Japan's household spending in fiscal year 2024 also saw a slight decrease due to rising prices.</p>

          <p>Country music legend Randy Travis, who suffered a near-fatal stroke in 2013, has made a remarkable comeback with the help of artificial intelligence. Collaborating with musician James DuprÃ© and producer Kyle Lehning, Travis has released two new songs, "Where That Came From" and "Horses in Heaven," using AI to recreate his voice. The process involved inputting raw vocals from 45 of Travis's songs into an AI model and refining the output to match his tone and inflections. Travis has also returned to touring, with DuprÃ© assisting as a special guest vocalist, marking a significant milestone in his career and demonstrating the potential of AI in music.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline after its first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. While revenue increased by 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed LSEG mean estimates due to 'production fluctuations' which sent blended average selling prices falling. SMIC forecasts revenue to decrease by 4% to 6% sequentially in the current quarter, with gross margin also expected to decline. Despite this, wafer shipments increased by 15% from the previous quarter, driven by geopolitical factors and government policies.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum, the U.S. aluminum sector is not experiencing a revival due to high electricity prices. While tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, they have not spurred domestic aluminum production. Rising electricity costs in the U.S., relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures instead of restarts. The article cites the artificial intelligence boom and proliferation of data centers as new competitors for power, which the tech sector can afford more easily than the aluminum industry.

In the Eaton burn scar, around 27% of soil samples from scraped areas and nearly 44% from unscraped areas exceeded California's state standards for residential properties. This discovery has led to recommendations that property owners consider soil impact assessments before rebuilding, as county and city officials have issued rebuilding permits without soil testing requirements.

She recounted how Weinstein ordered her to remove her blouse, touched her inappropriately, and instructed her to stay silent about the incident. Weinstein, who denies sexually assaulting anyone, faces charges related to a later incident where he allegedly forced Sokola to perform oral sex on him. Sokola's testimony is part of the retrial following the overturning of Weinstein's conviction last year, with claims against him being a major catalyst for the #MeToo movement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-3 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, highlighting the competitive nature of the National League West. Yoshinobu Yamamoto struggled, giving up five runs, while Arizona starter Brandon Pfaadt pitched six scoreless innings. The loss comes as the Dodgers enter a challenging stretch of intradivision games, with five of their next 12 series against division rivals. Despite Shohei Ohtani's late home run, the Dodgers couldn't overcome the Diamondbacks' strong performance, underscoring the difficulty of defending a World Series title in a tough division.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests a revival of U.S. strategic interest and involvement in Greenland due to its geographic location and climate considerations. Greenland's location is critical for routes between Russia and the U.S., and the opening of the Arctic Sea gives Russia unimpeded access to open waters. The author proposes the United States, Denmark, and Greenland apply a Pacific model in the Arctic to assure NATO security interests and reinforce international stability. Russia occupies two-thirds of the Arctic coastline, and its portion shows prospects of being ice-free much earlier than the Canadian or the American portion of the Arctic Sea.</p>

          <p>The European wind industry is reassessing its strategy due to policy shifts in the U.S. under the Trump administration, which has halted offshore wind projects. Industry executives are now relying on Europe to compensate for the pullback in the U.S., with expectations that offshore wind will significantly increase its share of Europe's electric power generation by 2050. Despite positive financial results from companies like Vestas and Orsted, challenges remain, including rising prices and regulatory uncertainty. The industry is adapting to these changes, with Vestas geographically arranging its turbine manufacturing to reduce damage from tariffs.</p>

This move has drawn criticism for prioritizing one group while thousands of other refugees face delays and inaction, despite court orders.

The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs â€” and the threat of the levies â€” as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration. The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.</p>

Exports to the United States, however, fell by 21%, the sharpest drop in 21 months. Experts suggest the full impact of US tariffs may not yet be visible in the data, and exporters are finding ways around the tariffs. The upcoming US-China talks this weekend could pave the way for a partial rollback of US duties, but a full reversal is unlikely, and tariffs will likely remain elevated.</p>
