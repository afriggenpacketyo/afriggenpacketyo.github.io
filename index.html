          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by reactions to the chancellor's Spending Review, with varying perspectives on its impact. Some papers, like the Daily Express, warn of impending tax increases to support the NHS, while others, such as the Daily Mail, criticize the review as a reckless spending spree. The Guardian highlights the NHS and defense as the "big winners," while the Financial Times notes that the Home Office and Foreign Office face budget constraints. The Spending Review is seen by some as a rejection of austerity, but concerns remain about potential tax hikes and the long-term fiscal situation, especially given the potential for increased taxes and cuts to the Home Office. The Daily Mirror welcomes the plans as prioritizing ordinary citizens over the privileged few, while the Financial Times calls for broader tax system reforms.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump attended a performance of 'Les Misérables' at the Kennedy Center amidst ongoing protests in Los Angeles, creating a scene of irony and political theater. Trump's appearance, intended to boost fundraising for the Kennedy Center, was met with a mix of cheers and boos, with drag queens present in the audience in response to his criticism of the venue for hosting drag shows. The event was marked by cultural ignorance from some of Trump's allies, and the atmosphere was described as different from the Kennedy Center's traditional Democratic events. Trump stated he loved Les Misérables and that he was untroubled by reports of understudies performing due to boycotts by cast members.</p>

          <p>A former Mace B cruise missile launch site in Onna, Okinawa, has been reopened to the public, revealing a dark legacy of the Cold War. The site, one of four constructed in the 1960s during the U.S. military occupation, highlights the deployment of nuclear weapons on the island despite anti-nuclear sentiment in Japan. Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist organization, purchased the land in 1976 and restored the site, opening it to the public to educate about Okinawa's past. The missiles deployed at these bases could strike China and parts of the Soviet Union, and the site serves as a reminder of the crises faced during the Cold War era.</p>

The facility's design is similar to an existing uranium enrichment plant in Kangson near Pyongyang, featuring a large central hall where centrifuges could be installed. The images and analysis suggest North Korea is expanding its production of enriched uranium, despite international monitoring and sanctions.

          <p>Japan remains 118th out of 148 countries in the 2025 gender gap rankings, the worst among the Group of Seven nations, according to the World Economic Forum. The report indicates that Japan's poor political participation by women significantly impacts its ranking, despite improvements in women's economic participation. The country ranks 125th in political empowerment, reflecting the low number of female government ministers and the absence of a female prime minister. The report estimates that it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally, with Japan showing slow progress in narrowing the gender gap.</p>

The astronomers spotted a mysterious new star glowing in the southern sky, near the heart of the Milky Way, describing it as "about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp, with a pure yellow colour, smooth and bright." The rediscovered memorial confirms that the phenomenon was a nova, a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star, rather than a comet or meteor. The unprecedented details, including the star’s size and brightness, helped narrow down the star’s possible position.</p>
