          <p>Home Depot has announced its acquisition of GMS, a distributor of building products, in a deal valued at around $4.3 billion. This strategic move is part of Home Depot's effort to increase its market share among professional contractors, such as electricians and renovators, who represent a steady and lucrative customer base. The acquisition, which is expected to close by early 2026, also concludes a potential bidding war with billionaire Brad Jacobs' company, QXO. The deal aims to accelerate Home Depot's strategy of catering to home professionals for sustained growth and market expansion.</p>

          <p>A new report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) reveals steady growth in cosmetic procedures, with body contouring and minimally invasive treatments showing notable increases in 2024. Liposuction and breast augmentation remained the most popular surgical procedures, while neuromodulator injections like Botox were the top minimally invasive treatment. Surgeons suggest the rise in body lift procedures may be linked to the increased use of GLP-1 weight-loss medications, which can result in sagging skin. The report also highlights the normalization of aesthetic procedures, driven by social media and a growing view of them as part of holistic self-care.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate engaged in a lengthy session known as a "vote-a-rama" to consider numerous amendments to President Trump's domestic spending package. The process allows senators to introduce unlimited amendments, forcing back-to-back votes primarily intended to send political messages or register opposition. While most votes fell along party lines, a Democratic amendment by Sen. Ed Markey to protect rural hospitals from Medicaid cuts garnered support from Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, though it ultimately failed. The session highlights the deep partisan divisions over the bill's contents, including controversial provisions like Medicaid work requirements and the elimination of electric vehicle tax credits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order officially lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to support the country's path toward stability under its new government. The action follows a promise made in May during a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former insurgent. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, it maintains targeted restrictions on former president Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Administration officials stated the goal is to give Syria's interim government an opportunity to stabilize and normalize relations with its neighbors, including Israel, without the U.S. dictating its political framework.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man facing human smuggling charges, until at least mid-July due to concerns he might be immediately deported. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported earlier this year despite having a legal status that protected him, and was then returned to the U.S. to face prosecution. His lawyers requested the delay after the Trump administration made conflicting statements about whether he would be removed from the country upon release from Justice Department custody. The case highlights the complex intersection of immigration law and the criminal justice system under the current administration.</p>

This pilot program aims to address the rise of romance scams and build trust by verifying user authenticity, awarding a blue checkmark to confirmed profiles.

          <p>A proposal to tax remittances sent abroad by individuals without Social Security numbers, currently before the Senate, poses significant risks to financial transparency and national security, according to this article. The author argues that even a small levy would push billions of dollars into unregulated channels like cryptocurrency, making it harder for law enforcement to track illicit funds used for crime and terrorism. Furthermore, the tax could damage U.S. economic diplomacy with countries dependent on these funds, such as Mexico, undermining cooperation on critical issues like border security and drug trafficking. The policy could ultimately destabilize the very communities the U.S. aims to support.</p>

          <p>Health policy experts are expressing concern over significant changes to Medicaid proposed in President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill. The Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion and leave an additional 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. A key provision introduces an 80-hour monthly work requirement for many recipients, which analysis from UC Berkeley suggests could disproportionately harm older adults aged 50-64 who face barriers to employment. These proposed cuts also pose a significant risk to the financial stability of rural hospitals and community health centers that rely heavily on Medicaid revenue.</p>

          <p>After a significant price surge over the last 18 months, gold's performance in July is expected to be influenced by several key economic indicators. Analysts suggest the price may remain relatively stable, with minor fluctuations, if inflation continues to hold steady around its current low rate. The Federal Reserve's likely decision to keep interest rates paused until a potential cut in September is also expected to contribute to this stability. However, unpredictable geopolitical tensions remain a significant variable that could cause sudden shifts in the precious metal's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the "department of government efficiency" (Doge), has created a national citizenship database by combining records from immigration agencies and the Social Security Administration. The centralized, searchable database is designed to allow state and local election officials to verify the citizenship status of potential voters, an effort the administration says will eliminate voter fraud. The project is one of the first major outcomes of Doge's initiative to merge data from across federal agencies, a move that has sparked privacy concerns and lawsuits from civil rights advocates and government unions.</p>

          <p>Recent events in the Middle East include deadly Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, with one attack on a seaside cafe reportedly killing at least 20 people. In parallel, Israeli forces allegedly opened fire near an aid distribution site, resulting in more Palestinian casualties. Tensions with Iran have also heightened, as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom jointly condemned Tehran's "threats" against the UN's nuclear watchdog after Iran refused inspectors access to bombed nuclear sites. Meanwhile, Israel's foreign minister has signaled an interest in normalizing relations with Syria and Lebanon, adding another layer to the region's complex dynamics.</p>

This incident is the latest example of the president's family business leveraging his political brand for commercial ventures while he is in office, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

The case has gained further attention as GarcÃ­a Aquino is an undocumented immigrant, a detail emphasized by federal authorities.

The event, with its superyacht parties and celebrity guests, mirrors the city's own history of unapologetic magnificence. However, the choice is also layered with contradictions, as Bezos, a purveyor of modern convenience, celebrated in a sinking city threatened by the very consumption and modernity his empire represents, sparking protests from local residents.</p>

          <p>The FBI and federal cybersecurity agencies have issued a warning that the threat of cyberattacks from Iranian-affiliated hacking groups persists despite the recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel. A public bulletin cautioned that these groups may still attempt to disrupt critical U.S. infrastructure, including utilities and transportation systems. The agencies also noted that defense contractors and other American companies with connections to Israel could be targeted. This reflects the complex nature of modern conflict, where non-state or loosely affiliated actors can continue hostile actions even after a formal halt to military warfare, prompting calls for heightened digital defenses.</p>

After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade deal negotiations in response to the tax, Canada announced it would halt collection and introduce legislation to scrap it. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Google, and Apple. The reversal marks a significant development in the ongoing trade disputes between the two neighboring countries.</p>
