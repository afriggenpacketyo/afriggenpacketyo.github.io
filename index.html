          <p>Officials reported escalating conflict between India and Pakistan after India conducted airstrikes on Pakistani targets, claiming retaliation for a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 civilians. Pakistan responded by stating that Indian strikes were an unprovoked act of war, claiming to have downed five Indian aircraft, though this could not be verified. The Indian government acknowledged the loss of aircraft, but the reasons for the crashes remained unclear. The strikes mark a significant escalation, including strikes on Punjab, mainland Pakistan, for the first time in over half a century, raising concerns about a potential full-scale conflict between the two nuclear powers.</p>

          <p>A Treasury Inspector General report reveals that the IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors due to budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency. As of March 2025, the IRS workforce decreased by 11%, including a significant reduction in revenue agents who conduct audits. Treasury Secretary defended the reduced spending, stating that $2 billion was cut from the IT budget without operational disruptions. This report coincides with President Trump's budget request calling for further IRS budget cuts to end what he terms 'weaponization of IRS enforcement'.</p>

          <p>Major cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by the Trump administration are causing alarm among cancer patients and doctors, who fear the impact on research and treatments. The NIH, the largest funder of cancer research, is expected to cut 1,200 jobs and cancel hundreds of grants, potentially slowing biomedical research and delaying drug approvals. Patients surveyed express worry that these cuts will delay their care and hinder progress in cancer research.

          <p>A key indicator of used vehicle prices, the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, jumped to its highest level since October 2023, increasing by 4.9% year-over-year. This surge is attributed to consumers rushing to purchase used vehicles amid concerns of price increases due to new auto tariffs. While the tariffs don't directly impact used car sales, they affect new vehicle prices, production, and demand, which subsequently influence the used car market. Retail used-vehicle sales have seen a slight decrease compared to March, but are up year-over-year, with average listing prices exceeding $25,000.</p>

          <p>India's military operation against Pakistan, named 'Operation Sindoor,' references the red vermilion powder worn by Hindu married women, a symbol that becomes associated with widowhood when a husband dies. This choice of name is meant to avenge widowed women after a terrorist attack in Kashmir killed 26 civilians, mostly Hindu men. While the name resonates with right-wing Hindu groups seeking vengeance, some feminists criticize its use, arguing that it reinforces traditional gender roles. The article explores the complex symbolism and societal implications of this operational name in the context of Hindu nationalism and regional conflict.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for bankruptcy as more Americans turn to weight loss drugs like Ozempic to manage their weight. The company aims to eliminate $1.1 billion in debt as part of the Chapter 11 filing and focus on expanding its telehealth business. Services to WeightWatchers customers will continue uninterrupted, and the company expects to complete the reorganization in 40 days and emerge as a publicly traded entity. The move reflects a shift in the weight loss market, with pharmaceutical options gaining traction over traditional programs.</p>

          <p>As of today, U.S. travelers are now required to present a Real ID for domestic air travel at airport checkpoints. The May 7 deadline follows multiple delays over more than 20 years. Those without a Real ID can still fly using alternative forms of identification, such as a passport, but may face additional security screenings. The TSA reports approximately 81% Real ID compliance at airports and advises travelers to arrive early to avoid potential delays.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the new German Chancellor, is prioritizing foreign policy by visiting France and Poland on his first day in office, aiming to revive Germany's relationships with these key partners. He intends to strengthen Franco-German relations, which he believes were neglected under his predecessor, and to revitalize the Weimar Triangle. Merz also faces challenges related to transatlantic relations, the war in Ukraine, and trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The new government's focus on foreign policy may be hindered by domestic policy issues and political divisions within the EU.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest several scenarios that could lead to a decrease in gold prices, which have recently reached record highs. These include investors taking profits, a sharp strengthening of the U.S. dollar, economic recovery reducing safe-haven demand, cooling political and economic tensions, a breakout equity market rally, and deflationary pressure. While these factors could trigger a gold price drop, experts advise that gold investing should be a long-term strategy, offering financial protection against economic uncertainties.

The bill is supported by families of victims whose killers refused to attend their sentencing hearings, and it is seen as a step in the right direction to provide some peace and justice to victims' families.</p>

          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration, totaling billions of dollars, are putting major partnerships at risk and shifting priorities from the moon to Mars. The European Space Agency (ESA) is assessing the impact of these cuts on its own research and collaborations. While the cuts would avoid NASA's human exploration portfolio, they would significantly reduce the agency's overall budget, potentially affecting various science projects and the work of researchers worldwide.
