          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek has won her first Wimbledon women's singles title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova in a decisive 6-0, 6-0 final. The match, lasting under an hour, marked only the second "double bagel" victory in a Wimbledon final during the Open era. The win is a historic first for a Polish singles player at the tournament and a remarkable achievement for Anisimova, who reached the final after taking a break from tennis in 2023 for mental health reasons. Kate, the Princess of Wales, presented the trophy.</p>

          <p>Police across the United Kingdom have arrested 71 individuals during protests against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The arrests in London, Cardiff, and Manchester were primarily for suspicion of supporting a banned group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The proscription followed an incident where activists targeted military aircraft, which the group claimed responsibility for. Critics, including Palestine Action's legal representatives, argue the ban is an authoritarian misuse of power, while the government maintains the group's actions threaten national security.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' rookie pitcher Jacob Misiorowski has been named a Major League Baseball All-Star after just five games, a decision that has generated significant controversy. The 23-year-old, known for his 103 mph fastball, has an impressive 2.81 ERA but his limited experience has led many to question the selection. Critics point to more established pitchers like Christopher Sanchez of the Philadelphia Phillies who were overlooked despite strong seasons. Supporters, however, argue that MLB is wisely using the opportunity to market one of its bright, emerging stars.</p>

          <p>The European Union has vowed to respond decisively after the Trump administration announced it would impose a 30% tariff on EU goods starting August 1. EU leaders, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron, expressed strong disapproval of the move, which followed weeks of tense negotiations. The article provides a detailed timeline of the escalating trade dispute, noting that the EU is prepared to use its Anti-Coercion Instrument for countermeasures if a deal is not reached. German industry leaders have also warned of the significant economic consequences for key sectors like automotive manufacturing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has officially announced that imports from the European Union and Mexico will be subject to a 30% tariff beginning August 1, escalating global trade tensions. In letters to the respective leaders, Trump cited persistent trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking. The announcement drew sharp criticism from EU officials, who pledged to safeguard the bloc's interests with countermeasures if necessary. This move is part of a broader tariff strategy that has also targeted Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Brazil, fundamentally challenging long-standing global trade norms.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is publicly defending its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation in response to escalating attacks from the Trump administration. Using a new FAQ page on its website, the central bank refutes claims made by Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who criticized the project as an "ostentatious overhaul." The Fed clarifies that there are no new VIP dining rooms and explains that cost increases were driven by unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes. This quiet pushback comes as the administration intensifies its campaign against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic portrays conservative commentator Dan Bongino dramatically resigning from a fictional post as Deputy Director of the FBI. In the piece, the character of Bongino declares he must leave the agency to properly investigate the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy from the outside, humorously suggesting that true insight is found far from government. The satire mocks conspiracy theory culture by having the character claim he can't see the truth from within the FBI's top leadership. The piece uses irony to critique the handling and public perception of the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>The burger chain Wahlburgers has quietly closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO has clarified the context behind the move. The closures are primarily the result of ending a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, affecting small food court kiosks rather than full-service restaurants. CEO Randy Sharpe emphasized that these were not significant revenue drivers and that the company is now focused on quality over quantity. To signal its forward momentum, the chain recently launched a new summer menu featuring items like a Teriyaki Pineapple Smashburger and a Strawberry Shortcake Shake.</p>

They cite concerns over access to violent and sexual content, cyberbullying, and manipulation by online predators.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated on social media that he is giving "serious consideration" to revoking the U.S. citizenship of his longtime critic, actress Rosie O’Donnell. In his post, Trump called O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity" and suggested she should remain in Ireland, where she recently moved. O'Donnell responded on Instagram, calling the president a "criminal con man" and stating she stands in opposition to him. Legal experts note that birthright citizenship is protected under the 14th Amendment and cannot be revoked by a presidential order.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has begun laying off over 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The move, which aims to cut the domestic workforce by about 15%, is intended to streamline the department and eliminate redundant offices. Many of the cuts targeted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee assistance, and foreign aid, drawing sharp criticism from Democratic senators who argue it weakens U.S. diplomacy. The layoffs follow a recent Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for the administration's plans to reduce the federal workforce.</p>

The report found that the plane's fuel was cut off moments after takeoff but did not assign a cause. Ria Patel, whose grandmother was among the 260 victims, described the findings as incomplete and stated she cannot find peace until accountability is established. Other family members and friends of victims have echoed this sentiment, stressing the importance of understanding the root cause of the tragic crash in Ahmedabad.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has agreed to be extradited to the United States to face cocaine and weapons smuggling charges. Macias, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a nationwide wave of violence. During a virtual court hearing, he consented to the extradition, which will make him the first Ecuadorian to be handed over under a new law. His escape and the subsequent gang warfare prompted Ecuador's president to declare an "internal armed conflict."</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved with former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Trump. Sources indicate that these firings are part of a broader purge of officials associated with the probes, which has caused significant unease among the Justice Department's career employees. The removals were conducted through the department's "weaponization working group," and some of those terminated were support staff with non-prosecutorial roles.

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the economic strength of all 50 U.S. states, evaluating their preparedness for a potential recession amid risks from federal budget cuts and trade tariffs. The study considered factors like GDP growth, job creation, fiscal health, and exposure to international trade conflicts. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina were ranked as the top three states with the most resilient economies, credited with strong growth, solid finances, and diverse business landscapes that help insulate them from economic shocks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariffs and trade uncertainty, U.S. companies are increasingly utilizing Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce tax burdens on imported goods. These customs-sanctioned areas allow businesses to store, assemble, or modify foreign components duty-free, with tariffs only applied when the final product enters U.S. commerce. While this strategy preserves cash flow, recent executive orders have eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product. This change has created new challenges for manufacturers reliant on the zones.</p>

          <p>An investigation found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) granted multiple appeals to remove buildings at Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, from a 100-year flood map in the years before a catastrophic flood killed at least 27 people. This re-designation loosened safety regulations and insurance requirements for the camp, which operated and expanded in a known flood plain. Experts find it disturbing that a facility responsible for children would seek exemptions from basic flood oversight. The tragedy has raised serious questions about FEMA's map amendment process and local oversight of construction in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the reasons behind Russia's recent escalation of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine. Experts suggest the intensified campaign aims to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses, destroy military-industrial infrastructure, and demoralize the civilian population to pressure the government. Russia's ability to conduct these large-scale attacks is attributed to a significant expansion of its domestic drone production, reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers like Iran. Military analysts believe this strategy is preparation for a potential new summer offensive, making Western support for Ukraine's air defense systems, like the Patriot missiles, increasingly critical.</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" analyzed President Trump's response to the recent devastating floods in central Texas, contrasting his approach with that of past presidents. Panelists noted that while Trump can be effective at mobilizing resources, he often struggles to connect emotionally with victims of disasters and show empathy for their suffering. The discussion highlighted that the current administration's strategy appears to rely more on state and local officials for disaster response rather than a large-scale federal presence. This represents a shift from the more hands-on, federally-led approach seen in previous administrations.</p>

They argue that third parties in the U.S. historically succeed by disrupting and influencing the major parties on specific issues, not by winning elections, due to the entrenched structural and financial power of Democrats and Republicans. With Musk's high public unfavorability and a vague platform, the venture faces significant obstacles.</p>
