          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched in Tunisia's capital, calling for the end of what they term an "authoritarian regime" under President Kais Saied. The protests mark four years since Saied dissolved parliament and began ruling by decree, a move critics labeled a coup. Protesters, rallying under the theme "The Republic is a large prison," demanded the release of jailed opposition figures, journalists, and activists. Rights groups have condemned the use of vague legal charges to suppress dissent, with many Tunisians now living in fear of arrest in a country they feel is being dismantled.</p>

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing more than 20% of its total workforce, have applied to leave through a deferred resignation program. This potential exodus would shrink the agency's civil servant staff from approximately 18,000 to 14,000. The departures come as NASA faces a proposed 25% budget cut for fiscal year 2026 and grapples with a leadership crisis following the withdrawal of a nominee for administrator. The agency maintains that safety remains a top priority as it aims to become a more streamlined organization for future exploration.</p>

          <p>A shooting at a University of New Mexico dormitory resulted in the death of a 14-year-old and injury to another individual, with an 18-year-old suspect taken into custody. The incident occurred early Friday morning in a student housing center while four people were playing video games. The campus was closed as a precaution, and the university is providing counseling services to the community. A state representative noted the tragedy occurred during new student orientation, a time that should be filled with hope but was instead marred by violence.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly explosion that killed three Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives, authorities have revealed that one of the two hand grenades recovered from the scene is missing. The ATF determined that one grenade detonated on July 18 while being handled by a bomb squad, but the second device is currently unaccounted for despite extensive searches. Investigators are looking into the origin of the military-grade explosives, which were found in a storage unit. The sheriff has ordered an independent review of the department's disposal procedures to prevent future tragedies.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that the United Kingdom will participate in airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, following Israel's approval for such deliveries. This comes as Starmer faces increasing pressure from within his own party and across Parliament to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a move France has already committed to. The prime minister stated the government would "pull every lever" to deliver life-saving support to Palestinians, describing the situation as a humanitarian catastrophe that must end. Aid agencies, however, caution that airdrops are an inefficient method of delivering supplies.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The conservation effort involves capturing healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd and airlifting them to an isolated, protected mountain range. The mission is already showing signs of success, as biologists recently observed a group of nine sheep that included several newborn lambs. The project represents a monumental effort to ensure the survival of this iconic native species.</p>

          <p>The latest round of Gaza ceasefire negotiations has stalled, with President Trump's special envoy stating the U.S. team is returning home after Hamas showed a "lack of desire" to reach a deal. This diplomatic failure occurs as the humanitarian crisis deepens, with the United Nations reporting that children in Gaza are starving to death due to the ongoing war and blockade. UNICEF stated that deaths from malnutrition are rising, with thousands of children found in a state of acute malnourishment. The conflicting demands of Israel and Hamas continue to prevent an end to the 21-month war.</p>

          <p>Following a two-day interview with a top Justice Department official, Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney stated that his client was questioned about roughly 100 different people. The lawyer, David Oscar Markus, said Maxwell answered every question posed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and "didn't hold anything back." He also commented on President Trump's power to grant a pardon, stating that while they have not yet requested one, they hope the president uses his authority in a "just way." The extensive questioning suggests the DOJ is exploring numerous connections within the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Multiple former federal prosecutors have described the direct involvement of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in interviewing Ghislaine Maxwell as unorthodox and concerning. They noted that such interviews are typically handled by line prosecutors with deep case knowledge, not high-ranking political appointees. Experts raised concerns about the credibility of any information from a desperate, convicted felon and suggested the meeting appeared to be a political move to address public pressure rather than a standard investigative procedure. The lack of clarity on whether FBI agents were present to document the interview also drew criticism.</p>

          <p>This article examines the scientific basis for popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, sleeping seven to nine hours, and exercising 150 minutes weekly. Experts suggest that while these are good guidelines, there can be flexibility. For instance, thirst is generally a reliable indicator for hydration, but consistent water intake can help with other health issues. However, getting adequate sleep is considered less negotiable due to its profound impact on long-term health, including reducing the risk of obesity, diabetes, and depression. The consensus is to incorporate a balanced, non-rigid approach to these healthy habits.</p>

This shift marks a significant departure from the past, when data and training methods were often based on male athletes. The growing body of knowledge is helping to improve performance, prevent injuries, and keep more women and girls engaged in sports.</p>

New observations show a 4.3% chance the city-killer-sized object could slam into the lunar surface in late 2032. While not a direct danger to people on Earth, such an impact could create a visible flash and send a shower of debris toward our planet, potentially damaging satellites.
