Xi emphasized the need to defend the UN-centered international system and promote multilateralism, while Putin highlighted the development of strategic relations for mutual benefit, with no intention of working against third parties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent University of Florida study analyzing nearly 300 years of human-alligator interactions found that 96% of alligator bites are preceded by human inattention or risk-taking behavior. The study categorized incidents based on the level of human risk, with most bites occurring after moderate-risk behaviors like swimming in alligator-inhabited areas, and fatal bites resulting from high-risk actions like deliberately entering those waters. Researchers emphasize that alligator bites are preventable and urge the public to maintain situational awareness around wildlife, minimizing risky behaviors such as walking small pets near water or swimming in known alligator habitats. By creating a ranking system, the team underscored that the majority of bites stemmed from risky human behavior.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era Venus mission lander, Cosmos 482, which failed to leave Earth's orbit in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. This piece of space debris is unique because Venera spacecraft were designed to withstand Venus's harsh atmospheric conditions, potentially allowing Cosmos 482 to survive its re-entry. Weighing 495 kilograms, it is larger than most space debris, but the risk of it hitting someone on Earth is low. The re-entry is uncontrolled, but its smooth shape may allow for reasonably accurate calculations of its descent.</p>

          <p>Ofcom has initiated investigations into two pornographic websites, Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC, for potentially violating the UK's new child safety regulations. The regulator alleges that these sites have not provided sufficient details on how they prevent children from accessing their platforms, as required by the Online Safety Act. Compliance with the Act mandates the implementation of robust age-checking techniques on websites featuring pornographic content, and failure to do so can result in significant fines. While many services have submitted plans for effective age assurance methods, these two companies have reportedly failed to respond or demonstrate any age verification measures.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers is pressing the Trump administration to utilize the designation of Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations to curb the trafficking of American-made guns into Mexico. They are advocating for enhanced interagency collaboration, increased inspections at border crossings, and stricter enforcement against straw purchasers and gun dealers. The lawmakers emphasize that stopping the flow of firearms from the U.S. is essential to disrupting the power of cartels involved in fentanyl and human trafficking. The appeal follows concerns that between 200,000 and 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico annually, fueling violence and undermining Mexican law enforcement.</p>

The plan also seeks to cut Medicaid without explicitly stating the cuts, likely reducing coverage for vulnerable populations.
