          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man accused of murdering four University of Idaho students in 2022, has agreed to plead guilty to all charges. This plea deal will spare him the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences without parole. The agreement was announced to the victims' families, some of whom expressed anger and frustration with the prosecutor's office, stating they were not adequately consulted on the deal. The university expressed that no outcome can replace the lives lost, keeping the families in their thoughts during this difficult time.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his opposition to a major tax and spending bill supported by former President Donald Trump, threatening to support primary challengers against any Republicans who vote for it. Musk labeled the legislation a "disgusting abomination" and the "biggest debt increase in history," vowing that its supporters will "lose their primary next year." In response, Trump criticized Musk on social media, highlighting that Musk's companies have benefited from federal subsidies that the new bill would eliminate.

          <p>A 26-year-old former teacher in Michigan, Jocelyn Sanroman, has been charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with a 16-year-old male student. The allegations came to light after Sanroman reportedly confided in a coworker, who then alerted the police. The Oakland County Prosecutor emphasized that this represents a severe breach of trust, regardless of consent laws, because of the teacher's position of authority. If convicted of the charges, the former teacher could face a prison sentence of up to 15 years.</p>

          <p>A coalition of more than 130 non-governmental organizations, including Oxfam and Amnesty International, is demanding the shutdown of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The groups allege that since the Israeli and US-backed GHF began operations, over 500 Palestinians have been killed and thousands injured while trying to access aid at its militarized distribution sites. The statement claims the system violates humanitarian norms by forcing people into dangerous zones where they face gunfire. The United Nations has also condemned the GHF, with the Secretary-General calling the aid system "inherently unsafe."</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament are set to vote on the government's controversial welfare reform bill, which faces significant opposition from within the ruling Labour Party. Despite some government concessions, around 35 Labour MPs are still planning to vote against the measures, which aim to tighten eligibility for disability benefits. The Conservative opposition has stated they will also vote against the bill, arguing the reforms do not go far enough to reduce spending.

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is expected to feature new fighter jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and uncrewed systems, many of which were developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind.

          <p>This opinion article argues that French cinema has largely failed to confront the country's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and its colonial past, unlike American filmmaking. The author notes that foundational stories about this history are often learned through US productions like "12 Years a Slave." While recent films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" are beginning to address these topics, they remain on the margins of the mainstream industry. The piece suggests that while French audiences are ready to engage with this history, the cinematic establishment is not.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since last November and is projected to continue its appreciation through 2025. In June, the onshore yuan gained 0.41 percent against the dollar, contributing to a 1.86 percent rise in the first half of the year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs attribute this trend to a less bearish outlook on China's economy and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt.

This growth was largely driven by an expansion in production, as improved trade conditions and promotional efforts boosted new orders.

          <p>Approximately 1,200 children in Melbourne, Australia, are being advised to undergo testing for infectious diseases as a precaution. This follows the arrest of a 26-year-old childcare worker, Joshua Dale Brown, who faces 70 charges, including the sexual assault of eight children under five. The accused worked at 20 different childcare centers since 2017, prompting a wide-ranging health alert to families whose children may have been in his care. Authorities took the unusual step of identifying the suspect to ensure all potentially affected parents are aware of the situation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has moved to withhold an estimated $6.8 billion in education funds that Congress had already appropriated for the current fiscal year. The freeze impacts programs supporting teacher training, after-school activities, and aid for English learners and migrant students, with California set to lose over $800 million. State education officials have condemned the action as illegal, warning that it will immediately harm students as school districts have already hired staff based on the expected funding.

          <p>A group of six Republican legislators from California has sent a letter to former President Trump, asking his administration to shift the focus of immigration enforcement. They argue that sweeping ICE raids are targeting non-criminal workers, creating widespread fear and causing labor shortages in key industries like agriculture and construction. The lawmakers urged that enforcement should be prioritized on violent criminals to avoid disrupting communities and businesses. This request highlights a rare instance of Republicans breaking with the administration's hardline immigration tactics due to negative economic impacts in their districts.</p>

Tolentino was a principal author of the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, which Beijing has strongly opposed.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills designed to accelerate construction by easing environmental review standards. The legislation, which faced opposition from some labor and environmental groups, exempts most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process. Newsom forced the bills through the legislature by linking their passage to the state budget, a move he described as necessary to overcome historical opposition. Experts believe these reforms could be the most substantial changes to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects.</p>

In response, Canadian officials framed the decision as part of a "bigger negotiation," confirming that trade talks with the US had resumed.

This finding helps to explain the molecular mechanism behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity.
