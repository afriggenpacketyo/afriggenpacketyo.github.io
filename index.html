          <p>Chinese artificial intelligence chip company Cambricon has issued a warning to investors about significant risks after its stock price soared by 533% in a year. The company, sometimes called China's "little Nvidia," attributed the recent rally to favorable government policies and a new AI model, but stated in a filing that its stock price may be deviating from fundamental value. Cambricon also highlighted ongoing supply chain vulnerabilities due to its inclusion on a U.S. trade blacklist, which could negatively impact its operational performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children starting in January 2026. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, to protect against the varicella virus. Health officials hope the program will prevent severe complications, which though rare can be life-threatening, and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

          <p>Former England football star Wayne Rooney has revealed that he received a surprising phone call from teammate Paul Scholes urging him to sign for Manchester United while he was a teenager. Speaking on his podcast, Rooney recalled watching television at home when Scholes called to ask if he was joining the club, an unusual move for a player to be involved in recruitment. Rooney also shared that he nearly signed for Newcastle instead and that the last-minute deal was so rushed he signed his contract while wearing his wife's cousin's jumper.</p>

While deep-seated mistrust and border disputes remain, both nations are facing economic pressures from U.S. tariffs, potentially pushing them toward cautious cooperation. Experts suggest that while the meeting is unlikely to resolve major conflicts, it signals a willingness to find common ground on economic necessities, such as India's reliance on Chinese supply chains for key industries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) over potential discriminatory employment practices. The probe, initiated by the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, will examine whether CalEPA's hiring and training programs violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by using race, color, sex, or national origin as a factor. The investigation specifically cites a CalEPA document that encourages applying a "racial equity lens" to workforce development and ensuring interview panels reflect diversity.</p>

          <p>A recent surge of merger and acquisition activity among Italy's major banks has significantly slowed down, with several high-profile takeover bids being dropped or rejected. UniCredit abandoned its bid for Banco BPM citing opaque government conditions, while Mediobanca's offer for Banca Generali was voted down by shareholders, thwarting a defensive move against a rival. Analysts note that while this consolidation wave has stalled, the underlying drive for Italian banks to increase their scale to compete with larger European and U.S. counterparts remains strong.

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is planning the first test launch of its new Soyuz-5 rocket for December, despite facing significant challenges.

The project proceeds amid funding shortages and the severing of ties with the European Space Agency following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which ended partnerships and deprived Russia of its European launchpad in French Guiana.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed a private contractor, Mitie, to remove job advertisements for floristry and hairdressing tutors at an immigration removal center near Heathrow Airport. The advertised roles, which included teaching skills like cake decorating and "ballooncraft," drew criticism from opposition politicians who called them indefensible perks for detainees awaiting deportation. A Home Office minister stated that the government did not believe all the advertised roles were necessary and ordered their removal from recruitment websites.</p>

Nichols, 29, died three days after being severely beaten by officers during a traffic stop, an event that led to widespread protests against police brutality.</p>
