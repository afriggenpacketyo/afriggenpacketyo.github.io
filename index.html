          <p>Canadians cast their votes in a pivotal election influenced by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, along with domestic issues such as affordability and immigration. Preliminary results are expected late Monday or early Tuesday, with the possibility of an early call if either the Conservatives or Liberals secure significant wins in eastern Canada. The election's outcome will determine whether the Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, continues its hold on power or if the Conservatives, under Pierre Poilievre, will take control. The focus remains on who can best manage the economy and navigate the challenges posed by the United States. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>An Iraqi man was charged with illegally voting in the 2020 presidential election, with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) assisting in the investigation.

          <p>A California bill aimed at combating child sexual assault trafficking has been weakened after the author, Assemblywoman Maggy Krell, reluctantly agreed to remove a provision that would have made it a felony for buyers of 16 and 17-year-old victims. The decision was made to ensure the bill could proceed, despite Krell's disagreement with the amendment. Republicans have criticized the Democrats for the change, arguing that it fails to adequately protect children. The bill still includes measures to criminalize those who loiter to buy teenagers for sex and establishes a fund to support victims. Optimism score is 50.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a $254 billion state budget agreement, resolving a month-long stalemate over public safety issues. The budget includes changes to facilitate the removal of individuals in psychiatric crisis for evaluation and eases evidence discovery requirements for prosecutors.

          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab can eliminate tumors in some early-stage cancer patients, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded well to the drug and no longer required an operation. The study focused on patients with tumors that had a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic issue that makes cells more responsive to immunotherapy. While promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital, and further research is needed to confirm the results for larger groups of patients. Optimism score is 85.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's civil rights division is experiencing a significant exodus of lawyers and staff due to the Trump administration's shift in priorities. Veterans of the office report being driven out by officials who aim to drop traditional civil rights work and aggressively pursue cases against liberal cities and schools. The administration's new focus on "woke ideology" has led to a wave of departures, with over 100 lawyers expected to resign. Optimism score is 35.</p>
