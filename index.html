          <p>A man was arrested at Dulles International Airport after allegedly kicking a Customs and Border Protection K9 named Freddy. The affidavit states that Freddy, a beagle trained to find agricultural contraband, was screening luggage when the man, Hamed Aly Marie, allegedly kicked the dog so hard it was lifted off the ground. Freddy was injured and taken to a veterinary emergency room, and Marie is charged with willfully and maliciously harming a police animal. An interpreter has been secured for Marie, but his country of origin was not specified in the charging document. The alleged incident occurred after Freddy alerted to a piece of luggage and tried to inspect it further. </p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was previously deported and then returned to the U.S. for prosecution, will remain in jail as lawyers debate his potential deportation by ICE. A judge had ordered his release with conditions, but acknowledged he would likely be detained by immigration authorities. The Justice Department appealed the release order, expressing concerns that deportation would prevent his criminal trial on human smuggling charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue that the potential deportation is a self-inflicted injury by the Department of Homeland Security, as he had previously been granted withholding of removal in 2019. </p>

          <p>President Trump's claim that U.S. strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites is under scrutiny, despite a preliminary U.S. intelligence analysis suggesting the program was only set back by a few months. Trump defended his description at the NATO summit, stating that Israel is conducting its own report on the damage. General Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it was too early to know the full extent of the damage, although he confirmed that all three targeted sites sustained severe destruction. Democratic lawmakers have criticized the administration's handling of the situation, while Trump maintains that the sites are obliterated. </p>

          <p>Senators from both parties are questioning the Trump administration's plan to cut federal funding for PBS, NPR, and some foreign aid programs. Republicans such as Susan Collins acknowledged concerns about NPR's partisan slant but suggested more targeted approaches than eliminating all funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The White House defends the cuts by stating that the targeted foreign aid programs are against American interests and that CPB is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Democrats, including Sen. Patty Murray, questioned the legality of the White House's request, arguing that the cuts would harm rural communities and children. </p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is being viewed by some Democrats as a sign of hope for the party, offering a potential path forward after recent defeats. Mamdani, a relatively unknown state assemblyman, ran an energetic campaign embracing progressive ideas, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Republicans are eager to portray Mamdani's policies as evidence of the Democratic Party's leftward shift. While the race was influenced by unique local factors, including Cuomo's scandals and Eric Adams' independent run, Mamdani's win highlights the importance of economic issues and engaging with new voters. </p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This decision marks a significant shift in the U.S. housing finance system, potentially integrating digital assets into traditional home lending. The directive requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals that include digital assets, without mandating borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars before closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated that this move aligns with President Trump's vision of making the United States the crypto capital of the world. Previously, cryptocurrency was excluded due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty. </p>

The Department of Transportation has stated that the Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster and failed to deliver EV chargers.

          <p>The rise of generative AI poses an existential threat to news publishers and journalists, as chatbots summarize articles and keep users within AI platforms, reducing traffic to news websites. Google's AI Overviews has reportedly reduced traffic to outside websites by over 34 percent, leading to concerns about a "Google Zero" scenario. AI companies train chatbots on stolen books and articles, intercepting audiences, subscription fees, and ad revenue from publishers. Publishers are responding through legal action and licensing deals with AI companies, but these deals may not be enough to recoup lost revenue. If news publishers go out of business, the ability to perform investigative journalism that holds the powerful accountable will be severely threatened. </p>

The medical community is mobilizing to produce alternative vaccine guidance to counter Kennedy's influence.
