          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has confirmed it will lose access to a key satellite data program by July 31, just as the U.S. enters peak hurricane season.

          <p>Recent polling data from multiple sources indicates that a majority of Americans oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," but public opinion is more divided on its specific components. While polls from Quinnipiac, Fox News, and Pew Research show overall opposition ranging from 55% to 59%, they also reveal a near-even split on provisions like imposing new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. There is also significant support for extending tax cuts for lower and middle-income individuals, a key feature of the wide-ranging legislative package.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to sign an executive order that will lift some, but not all, financial sanctions against Syria. The move is intended to help stabilize the country's fragile transitional government following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. While sanctions related to the 2004 chemical weapons program will be terminated, restrictions targeting the former president, his associates, human rights abusers, and terrorist-linked entities will remain in place. The new Syrian leader had complained that the sanctions were hindering reconstruction and government operations. (not investment advice)</p>

The review describes the plot, featuring a new cast including Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, as predictable and lacking the sense of wonder that defined the original film. While the absence of previous star Chris Pratt was noted, the film is criticized for its incurious approach to its dinosaurs, bloodless action sequences, and characters that are barely developed.

          <p>The United Kingdom experienced the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures reaching 33.1Â°C (91.6Â°F) at London's Heathrow Airport. The hot weather, which prompted an amber health alert across most of England, led to the hottest opening day on record at the Wimbledon tennis tournament. While many people flocked to beaches to cool off, the dry conditions contributed to wildfires in the Scottish Highlands. The UK Health Security Agency warned that the high temperatures are likely to increase mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is continuing its strategic push to capture more professional contractor business by acquiring GMS, a major distributor of building materials like drywall and steel studs. The $5.5 billion deal follows Home Depot's recent large acquisition of SRS Distribution and will further expand its network for servicing professional customers. The move comes as the company's do-it-yourself segment has slowed with the housing market. While strategically sound, the acquisition has raised some concerns about delaying the restart of the company's stock buyback program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 67 people were killed in Gaza on Monday in a series of attacks, according to health officials and witnesses. An Israeli airstrike on a crowded seaside cafe in Gaza City reportedly killed at least 30 people, including women and children. Separately, witnesses and hospital officials reported that Israeli forces shot and killed at least 22 Palestinians who were attempting to get food from an aid distribution site.

          <h2>Christian Community in Syria Expresses Fear for its Future After Deadly Church Bombing</h2>

          <p>Syria's Christian minority is feeling increasingly unsafe following a suicide bombing at a Greek Orthodox church in Damascus that killed 25 worshippers and injured 60 more. The attack, the first of its kind since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, has shattered the community's sense of security, which they felt was protected under the previous regime. Despite pledges of protection from the new Islamist-led government, many Christians, including survivors of the attack, now feel there is no future for them in the country and wish to leave.</p>
