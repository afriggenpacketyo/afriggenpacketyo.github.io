          <p>Major medical and scientific organizations are strongly refuting President Trump's assertion that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism. Groups like ACOG and SMFM emphasize over two decades of research showing no direct causal link, stating that untreated fever and pain in pregnancy pose greater risks. They also contradicted claims about vaccines and autism, and cautioned against the premature promotion of leucovorin as an autism treatment, calling for rigorous, peer-reviewed research.</p>

          <p>President Trump's appearance at the UN General Assembly was marked by a chaotic and at times incoherent speech, where he attacked other nations and climate change efforts. Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump unexpectedly reversed his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, suggesting NATO should shoot down Russian jets violating airspace and that Ukraine could reclaim all its original territory. This shift represents a more aggressive posture towards Russia, though his policy positions remain fluid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article explores President Trump's sudden reversal on Ukraine policy, moving from advocating territorial concessions to suggesting Ukraine can win back all its land. This shift followed his UN speech and meetings with Zelenskyy and Macron, where he called Russia a "paper tiger" and supported shooting down Russian aircraft. The analysis questions whether this reflects a genuine change of heart or a strategic tantrum, noting the absence of concrete action items to bolster Ukraine's war effort. The article suggests it might be Trump "washing his hands of the conflict."</p>

          <p>As China develops its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is addressing the urgent financial needs of local governments. Recent actions, such as a crackdown on undeclared overseas income, highlight the central government's efforts to boost revenue. This clampdown has seen wealthy individuals hit with substantial back taxes and late fees, signaling a broader enforcement of existing tax laws. The article examines how the upcoming plan could provide solutions to these local-level financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

With a highly anticipated SEC game between No. 4 LSU and No. 13 Ole Miss approaching, a fan on social media joked about the Kiffin household being in "shambles." Kiffin replied, "Take the over," predicting a high-scoring game. Weeks, a top defender, will be on the opposing side, adding an extra layer of family rivalry to the upcoming match.</p>

          <p>This article investigates the deadly conditions faced by Palestinians seeking food aid in Gaza, highlighting the case of 19-year-old Abdullah, shot dead near a food distribution site. The BBC Panorama investigation, "Gaza: Dying for Food," uncovers evidence of Israeli military forces using live fire to control crowds, leading to at least 1,300 deaths at or around aid sites since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began operations. Israel denies these figures and allegations of deliberate firing at civilians, while the UN Human Rights Commissioner condemns the killings as grave breaches of international law.</p>

          <p>TV personality Dani Dyer has withdrawn from this year's "Strictly Come Dancing" after sustaining a broken ankle during rehearsals. Dyer, 29, expressed immense heartbreak, explaining she "landed funny" and a scan confirmed a fracture. Her injury occurred after the pre-recorded launch show but before the competitive series began, meaning she will miss dancing with her partner Nikita Kuzmin. The show's executive producer and judges have sent their well wishes for her swift recovery.</p>

          <p>Car buyers are rushing to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) to capitalize on federal tax credits before they expire on September 30, due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. This urgency has driven record-high EV sales in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% and used EV sales up 59% year-over-year. Dealerships are offering additional incentives to clear inventory, with some lease rates as low as $40 a month. Experts anticipate a potential sales shift post-expiration, though some believe the impact might be limited due to previously low sales volumes. (not investment advice)</p>

Medical experts emphasize the dangers of untreated fever and pain in pregnancy, for which acetaminophen remains the safest over-the-counter option.
