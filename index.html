          <p>The U.S. Food & Drug Administration is warning consumers about a production mix-up affecting Celsius Astro Vibe Blue Razz energy drinks. A packaging supplier mistakenly sent empty Celsius cans to High Noon, a vodka seltzer company, which then filled them with alcohol. The recall also impacts certain High Noon Beach Variety packs from the same production line, which were distributed in several states. Consumers are advised to check the lot codes on the bottom of the cans and dispose of any affected products.</p>

The company's guidance for the second quarter was in line with analyst predictions, but executives noted that growth in the smartphone sector was weaker than anticipated. CEO Rene Haas also confirmed Arm is considering designing its own processors or chiplets, a move that could create competition with its existing customers but also open new revenue streams.</p>

          <p>A jury has convicted Colorado dentist James Craig of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her protein shakes, resulting in a sentence of life in prison without parole. The investigation began after Angela's health rapidly declined, leading to her death in March 2023. Evidence revealed that Craig had researched and purchased poisons like potassium cyanide and arsenic, allegedly motivated by a desire to start a new life with another woman and collect on life insurance policies. The case was cracked open when a colleague at his dental practice discovered a suspicious package containing cyanide.</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas and five others have been arrested and charged with conspiracy for allegedly running a high-stakes illegal poker ring from a mansion Arenas owned in Encino. Prosecutors claim the operation, which ran from 2021 to 2022, charged players a "rake" and hired women to provide companionship for gamblers. Arenas, who pleaded not guilty, is also accused of making false statements to federal investigators after a 2022 raid on the property.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer explained that the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates due to a mixed and uncertain macroeconomic environment. He noted that while factors like a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth argue against a cut, persistent housing costs and potentially weakening consumer spending create a case for one. Cramer believes the market's negative reaction was due to the Fed not only holding rates steady but also failing to signal that future cuts are inevitable. He concluded that the central bank is waiting for more clarity before making a move, fearing a premature cut could reignite inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House stated the move is necessary to prevent tariff evasion and to stop the funneling of illicit drugs into the country. The order uses emergency powers to implement the change by late August, much earlier than a deadline set by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of twelve House Democrats, including several from California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were unlawfully blocked from conducting oversight visits at immigrant detention facilities. The lawsuit claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has repeatedly denied lawmakers entry, violating a federal law that guarantees them access. The lawmakers argue that oversight is crucial amid reports of overcrowding and poor conditions, while the Department of Homeland Security maintains that visits must be scheduled in advance to avoid interference with operations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasing pressure on Brazil by imposing 50 percent tariffs and sanctioning a Supreme Court justice, actions widely seen as an attempt to influence the criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro. The U.S. has accused Brazil of a "witch hunt" against Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump who is facing charges related to a planned coup attempt. The Treasury Department sanctioned Justice Alexandre de Moraes under a human rights law, a move critics call a misuse of the act. Brazil's government has so far responded with defiance to the U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, prompting warnings and advisories in multiple countries. While the most severe warnings for Hawaii were later downgraded and then canceled, advisories remained in effect for parts of the U.S. West Coast and several South American and Pacific island nations. The quake caused flooding in Russia, but no major damage or grave injuries were reported.

In her statement, the former vice president and 2024 presidential nominee said her public service would not be in elected office "for now," but did not rule out a future bid for the White House. Harris's decision had effectively frozen the gubernatorial field, and her absence now clears the way for a crowded field of Democratic candidates to compete for the position.</p>

The series captures Brady's visit to the club in November 2023, where he expresses concern about Rooney's approach and also describes the players as "lazy and entitled." Rooney's tenure as manager was brief, lasting only 83 days as the team's performance plummeted. The documentary provides a behind-the-scenes look at a turbulent period for the club, which was ultimately relegated to League One.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Americans' views of the national economy have improved slightly, but their outlook remains clouded by widespread expectation of future price increases. While ratings for the stock market are more positive, two-thirds of respondents believe the prices of goods will rise in the coming months, dampening consumer confidence. This concern is particularly acute for lower-income households, with half of all Americans planning to cut back on discretionary spending. The poll suggests that inflation concerns continue to have a more significant impact on public sentiment than stock market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

These ongoing commitments have drained American resources and diplomatic attention, preventing the intended pivot to Asia.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on imported copper pipes, tubes, and wiring, citing national security concerns. The move, however, fell short of broader restrictions that were expected to include raw copper materials like cathodes and concentrates. This narrower scope caused U.S. copper prices to fall sharply, as the policy primarily aids domestic manufacturers rather than providing a significant boost to the U.S. copper mining industry. Major copper-producing nations like Chile and Peru, which are key suppliers of raw copper to the U.S., will be largely unaffected by the new levy. (not investment advice)</p>

Attempting to run the nation's most populous state while simultaneously pursuing the presidency would have been practically and politically difficult. While she would enter a 2028 race with high name recognition, she would also face a large field of Democratic challengers and carry the burden of the 2024 election loss.
