        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China faces a nationwide demographic chill, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, bucks the trend due to strong cultural traditions valuing larger families. In 2024, Guangdong recorded 1.13 million births, a year-on-year increase of 100,000, making it China's top province for new births for the seventh consecutive year. The region's birth rate of 8.89 per thousand people is among the highest in the country. The idea that more children bring more blessings, especially sons, remains deeply rooted in Chaoshan culture, contributing to the province's unique demographic landscape.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the US food supply by the end of next year.

          <p>The Education Department will resume collecting payments for defaulted student loans, including wage garnishment, starting May 5. Over 5 million borrowers are in default, with millions more at risk. The department will notify borrowers of repayment options. No federal student loans have been referred to collections since March 2020, when President Trump paused payments during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration's efforts to erase student loan debt were rejected by courts.</p>
