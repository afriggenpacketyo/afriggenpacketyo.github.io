          <p>The brokerage arm of China Merchants Bank, CMBI, has been granted a virtual asset license by Hong Kong regulators, allowing it to offer services like crypto trading, custody, and advisory. This move signifies a growing trend of mainland Chinese financial institutions engaging with the digital asset industry through Hong Kong's regulated market. The development highlights the city's strategy to become a crypto hub, balancing innovation with strict regulatory boundaries that prevent direct participation from mainland China.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump humorously suggested he could issue an executive order to change the American term 'soccer' to 'football,' aligning with global usage. The comments were made during the FIFA Club World Cup final, where Trump appeared alongside the winning team, Chelsea. While the seriousness of the proposal is unclear, it reflects his recent engagement with the sport, which held its newly expanded tournament across the United States.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The high cost is attributed to India's substantial import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against brands like BMW rather than mass-market EVs. While opening its first showrooms, Tesla is seen as "testing the waters" in the world's third-largest auto market, with large-scale manufacturing commitments not expected for several years.

          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson has signed a two-year deal with Premier League club Brentford following his departure from Ajax. The 35-year-old former Liverpool captain brings extensive experience, having won numerous major trophies during his 12 years at Anfield. His move to Brentford is seen as a way to add veteran leadership to the squad after the departure of other senior players. Henderson's brief and sometimes controversial stint at Ajax ended a year early, partly due to the club's financial difficulties.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has ruled that the German government did not violate international law by failing to prevent a 2012 US drone strike in Yemen that was facilitated by signals from the Ramstein air base. The case was brought by two Yemeni men whose relatives were killed in the attack, arguing Germany had an obligation to protect their right to life. The court determined that while Germany has some protective duties abroad, it could not establish that the US used unjustifiable targeting criteria in this instance.</p>

          <p>The shares of dual-listed Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are now at their smallest discount compared to their mainland-listed counterparts in nearly five years. This narrowing gap, tracked by a Hang Seng gauge, is attributed to a weaker U.S. dollar prompting global investors to diversify into Hong Kong's market. Additionally, strong buying from mainland investors seeking exposure to China's major technology firms has helped boost the value of the Hong Kong-traded H shares. (not investment advice)</p>

Leaders have increasingly condemned what they term coercive Western economic tactics and called for a move away from U.S. dollar dominance. However, the article argues that the bloc's effectiveness is undermined by internal contradictions and diverging interests among its members, such as India's careful balancing act and Brazil's pragmatic diplomacy.</p>

The platform will use a third-party service, Persona, to verify age via a government ID or selfie, a move that regulator Ofcom expects other companies to follow. While intended to protect children, the measure has drawn criticism from civil liberties groups over privacy concerns and the requirement for users to provide identification to access parts of the internet.</p>

          <p>China's voluntary health insurance scheme for urban and rural residents saw another decline in enrollment last year, with nearly 16 million fewer people participating compared to the previous year. This ongoing trend is driven by rising premiums combined with stagnating incomes, creating a significant financial burden for many families, especially in rural areas.
