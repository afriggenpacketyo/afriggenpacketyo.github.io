          <p>Former President Trump has claimed on his Truth Social platform that he successfully convinced Coca-Cola to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to real cane sugar for its sodas sold in the United States. He praised the move, stating it is "just better" for the product. In response, Coca-Cola acknowledged Trump's enthusiasm and hinted at forthcoming "new innovative offerings" without directly confirming the specific change. The company already uses cane sugar in products sold in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has cleared the names of Errol Campbell and Ronald De Souza, who were wrongly convicted of crimes in the 1970s based on fabricated evidence from a corrupt British Transport Police officer, Derek Ridgewell. Ridgewell, who was later jailed for theft, systematically framed young Black men, and these exonerations are the latest in a series of overturned convictions linked to his misconduct. The son of Mr. Campbell, who passed away in 2004, expressed that the wrongful conviction caused immense misery for his family.</p>

          <p>NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher has warned that proposed federal funding cuts to public broadcasting could endanger public safety, as many local stations are integral to state emergency alert systems. The statement comes as the Senate passed a rescissions package to claw back $9.4 billion in previously approved funds, including $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The legislation, championed by former President Trump, alleges partisan bias, a claim Maher and other public media advocates dispute while highlighting the critical role of local stations.

          <p>An apparent Israeli military strike has hit the Holy Family Compound, Gaza's sole Catholic church, resulting in the deaths of two people and injuring several others, including the parish priest. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed the fatalities and condemned the attack, which has also drawn criticism from Pope Leo XIV and the Italian Prime Minister. The Israel Defense Forces stated it is reviewing the incident, which occurred at a site that was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a rescissions package that claws back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The bill, passed 51-48, is a key part of former President Trump's push to reduce government spending. An amendment to protect funding for the PEPFAR global HIV/AIDS program was included to secure enough Republican votes, but efforts by Democrats to save other aid and public media funds were rejected. The bill now returns to the House for a final vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has released a series of updates on recent military drills, with the timing suggesting a direct response to Taiwan's annual Han Kuang exercises. The PLA's Eastern Theatre Command detailed activities such as nighttime flight training and coordinated multi-force operations. These announcements correspond with a period of increased military activity monitored by Taipei. The 10-day Han Kuang exercise, Taiwan's largest in its 41-year history, is set to conclude this week.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic critiques the Department of Homeland Security's rationale for detaining over 250 people in a Florida facility despite them having no criminal convictions or pending charges. A DHS official claimed these individuals are "terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more" who simply lack a U.S. rap sheet, and that entering the country illegally is itself a crime. The piece sarcastically lampoons this logic, pointing out the absurdity of treating people as "the worst of the worst" based on suspicion alone and without due process.</p>

          <p>A fact-check by DW has determined that social media claims linking sunscreen use to an increased risk of skin cancer are false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence for this assertion; in fact, UV radiation is the primary cause of melanoma, and sunscreen helps protect against it. The article explains that rising skin cancer incidence globally is likely due to factors such as better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and more comprehensive reporting, not the use of protective lotions.</p>

          <p>A state-contracted liquor store owner in rural Utah has closed her shop rather than sign a new contract that she claims would have eliminated her profits by shifting credit card fees to her. The owner is one of several plaintiffs in a lawsuit arguing the state misclassifies them as independent contractors instead of employees. The closure has a ripple effect on the small community, forcing local bars to drive long distances to restock and leaving residents without a local liquor outlet.</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing public health concern linked to anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. This article outlines scientifically-backed methods to reduce dependency, which is often as challenging as quitting other behavioral addictions. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. Experts suggest combining multiple methods and, for severe cases, seeking professional help like cognitive behavioral therapy to address the root causes of the addiction.</p>

          <p>Russian customs and security services have intercepted a massive 1,800-pound shipment of cocaine, valued at over $153 million, hidden within banana containers. The discovery, described as the largest bust of drugs from Latin America this year, was made following a tip from foreign intelligence about a South American criminal group's smuggling operation. This incident is part of a global trend where large quantities of cocaine are frequently found concealed in banana shipments, with traffickers increasingly using Russia as a transit hub.</p>

          <p>The United States has funded the construction of a new naval logistics facility at Oyster Bay in the Philippines, intended to provide maintenance and repair capabilities for small Philippine military watercraft. While the U.S. embassy has clarified that it is not a military base, analysts suggest the facility will directly enhance the Philippine Navy's operational capacity in the contested South China Sea. This development is seen as potentially strengthening Manila's hand in its maritime disputes with China and could pave the way for shared use of naval facilities.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from Donald Trump, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This aggressive gerrymandering effort would likely dilute the voting power of the state's growing non-white population and could make existing Republican districts more competitive. Critics and legal experts argue the move is undemocratic and potentially discriminatory, with watchdog groups warning that it would be impossible to achieve without "trampling on minority voting rights."</p>
