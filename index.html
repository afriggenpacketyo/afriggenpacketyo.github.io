          <p>Tina Knowles, mother of Beyonc√© and Solange, shared her experience with Stage 1 breast cancer, emphasizing the importance of regular mammograms. Knowles discovered two tumors during a delayed screening, attributing the delay to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the late detection, the cancer had not spread, and she underwent a lumpectomy, with support from her daughters. She encourages others to prioritize their health and screenings, noting that early detection could have led to a Stage 0 diagnosis.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has rebounded, exceeding $90,000 for the first time since March, as investors seek alternative assets amidst stock market instability. This surge coincides with President Trump's increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets is evident, with positive inflows into U.S. ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest that breaking the $88,000 resistance level is a positive sign, but light trading volumes temper convictions about further gains without a significant catalyst.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged to over $3,500 an ounce as President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve undermine investor confidence in the U.S. economy. Trump's repeated criticisms of Fed Chair Jerome Powell have sparked concerns about the Fed's independence and the stability of the financial system. Gold, viewed as a safe-haven asset, has benefited from this uncertainty, with central banks increasing their gold reserves. Analysts suggest further upside potential for gold due to ongoing trade uncertainty and central bank diversification.</p>

          <p>Climate change is posing a significant threat to the $100 billion U.S. fishing industry, as rising river temperatures reduce oxygen levels and harm fish populations. A recent study found that the majority of rivers in the U.S. and Europe are warming and losing oxygen, impacting species like trout. Fishermen are finding it increasingly difficult to make a living as the water temperature exceeds the threshold for good fishing. Efforts are underway to restore river flow and protect the fishing-tourism economy.</p>

Prioritizing sleep is crucial for brain health, as it allows the brain to consolidate memories and repair itself.

          <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is gathering private medical records from various sources to support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new autism study. This initiative aims to provide researchers with comprehensive patient data to study autism.
