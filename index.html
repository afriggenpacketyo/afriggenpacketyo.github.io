          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still grappling with calls for police reform, with Police Chief Brian O'Hara implementing changes to improve safety and community trust. While shootings are trending down, violent crime rates remain high compared to other major cities, exacerbated by an officer shortage. O'Hara is focused on "getting back to the basics," restoring pride in the profession, and adjusting arrest tactics. Despite the challenges, some residents have noted positive changes in police behavior and community engagement.</p>

          <p>A major power outage affected the Cannes region in France, disrupting the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The outage was caused by a fire at a substation and damage to an electricity pylon, with officials suspecting a criminal act. Despite the disruption, the Cannes Film Festival organizers ensured that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned by switching to an alternative power supply. The outage affected 160,000 homes, causing traffic light failures and shop closures, but power was gradually restored.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a global challenger in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter. Analysts attribute On's success to its unique shoe aesthetic and strategic timing during periods of declining sales for Nike and Adidas. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market, On's growth rate has outpaced both companies in recent quarters. However, On faces potential challenges from Nike's turnaround plan and tariff uncertainties, as most of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance during a contentious clergy sexual abuse bankruptcy case. The archdiocese, facing claims from hundreds of abuse survivors, filed for bankruptcy protection five years ago. Aymond expressed concern for the survivors and a desire to expedite negotiations, while some claimants criticized his previous lack of involvement. The proposed settlement, involving $130 million in cash and potential property sales, has faced opposition, with some attorneys seeking to return their clients' cases to individual lawsuits.</p>
