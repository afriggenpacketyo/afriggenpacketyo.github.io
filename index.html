          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has recommended that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in treasury bonds to swap for the hidden debts of local governments. This measure aims to tackle significant financial risks and stimulate economic growth, which has shown signs of stabilization but remains fragile. The proposal from Tsinghua University's economic center argues that resolving the local debt crisis is crucial for China's financial stability and long-term economic health. The report also suggests additional bonds to support the property market and boost consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has placed 139 employees on administrative leave after they signed a public letter criticizing the Trump administration's environmental policies. The letter, titled a "Declaration of Dissent," accused the administration of promoting deregulation and disregarding scientific expertise, thereby undermining the EPA's core mission. An agency spokesperson stated a "zero-tolerance policy" for career staff undermining the administration's agenda. The employees will be on paid leave for two weeks pending an investigation, which the EPA clarified is not a disciplinary action at this stage.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new interstellar comet, designated 3I/ATLAS, which is the third such object known to have passed through our solar system. The comet, spotted using a telescope in Chile, is currently 420 million miles from Earth and poses no threat. Scientists are actively monitoring the object to determine its size and composition as it approaches its closest point to the sun in late October. The discovery is considered exciting for astronomers, providing another rare opportunity to study a visitor from another star system.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have arrested Mexican boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. in Los Angeles with plans for his deportation. Officials state that Chávez Jr. has an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged involvement in organized crime and is believed to have affiliations with the Sinaloa cartel. The Department of Homeland Security announced he is being processed for "expedited removal," citing his criminal history in the U.S. and alleged fraudulent statements on his residency application. His lawyer has denied the allegations, calling the arrest an attempt to terrorize the Latin community.</p>

          <p>A newly passed Republican tax and spending bill will introduce significant changes affecting millions of Americans, though many impacts will be staggered over several years. The legislation imposes new work requirements for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), with some changes taking effect this year and others in 2026. Tax modifications, including deductions for tips and overtime and an increased SALT deduction cap, will be reflected in 2026 tax filings. The bill is projected to cut federal spending on Medicaid by $1 trillion and increase the number of uninsured people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article sharply criticizes First Lady Melania Trump for a photo opportunity at a children's hospital, which coincided with the passage of a Republican bill cutting over $1 trillion from Medicaid. The author describes the timing as "questionable at best — and cruel at worst," given that millions of children rely on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for their healthcare. The piece argues that the visit served as a distraction from the legislation's severe impact on healthcare for vulnerable populations.

The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, proposing that manufacturers charge health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month. Employers could then contribute a portion of this cost, significantly lowering the out-of-pocket expense for employees. This approach would simplify pricing, increase access to transformative medications for metabolic health, and reduce the administrative burden of prior authorizations for doctors.</p>

          <p>A High Court in London has strongly criticized Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, for its lack of transparency and for repeatedly misleading courts about an informant. The case involves a man accused of severe domestic abuse who was also an MI5 informant, and the agency's failure to be truthful about his status. The ruling highlighted serious questions about MI5's conduct and its long-held policy of "Neither Confirm Nor Deny." While the head of MI5 apologized, the court recommended a robust and independent inquiry into the agency's internal failures and handling of the matter.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite slowing economic growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest level since February. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink. The strong report suggests the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting interest rates in the near term as it monitors the potential economic impact of new trade tariffs.

          <p>A new Republican spending bill contains several new tax breaks for individuals, but four of them are temporary and scheduled to expire at the end of 2028. These include federal income tax deductions for tips and overtime pay, both of which were key campaign promises from President Trump. The other temporary provisions are a deduction for interest on new auto loans and the creation of new government-seeded children's savings accounts, called "Trump accounts." While these tax changes are currently set to sunset, their long-term future could be subject to further legislative action. (not investment advice)</p>

Three individuals are in critical condition, while others sustained various extremity injuries.

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic envisions the Founding Fathers observing the chaotic passage of a recent 940-page bill through Congress. In a fictional dialogue, James Madison describes the process—including last-minute deals, record-long votes, and presidential pressure—as the perfect system they designed, much to the confusion of Alexander Hamilton. The piece uses humor and irony to critique the current state of American legislative politics, contrasting it with the idealized principles of governance. It portrays the process as absurd and dysfunctional, far from the orderly system the founders might have intended.</p>

It also states that a chemical compound used for tranquilizing wildlife, which Barry Morphew had access to, was found in her bone marrow. Barry Morphew was re-arrested based on this new evidence, though he maintains his innocence and his daughters have previously supported him.</p>

In AI, China's control over vast amounts of data for training models could provide a significant advantage for industry expansion. Meanwhile, the country's EV industry is characterized by an intense price war among domestic manufacturers, driving innovation and affordability. The analysis underscores China's strategic focus on these key industries as central to its future economic and technological ambitions on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A new independent study led by researchers at the University of London estimates that the death toll in Gaza is substantially higher than figures reported by the Gazan Ministry of Health. The study, which surveyed households directly, projects over 80,000 deaths between October 2023 and January 2025, including both violent and nonviolent war-related fatalities. This figure is roughly 40% higher than the ministry's tally for the same period. The research suggests that while the ministry's data is not an exaggeration, it is a conservative minimum, and that the actual number of casualties is much greater.</p>
