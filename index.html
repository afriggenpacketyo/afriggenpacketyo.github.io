          <p>A wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has consumed over 13,250 acres and is approximately 50% contained, prompting evacuations and road closures, though all power has been restored to affected customers. The New Jersey Forest Fire Service is using air support and ground crews to combat the blaze, which is suspected to be the largest in the state in 20 years. Dry conditions and low humidity have contributed to the fire's intensity, and smoke is expected to impact air quality in the New York City area. A state of emergency has been declared for Ocean County, and the cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongfully deported to El Salvador, for one week at the request of the Trump administration. The judge previously criticized the Justice Department's inaction and ordered government officials to testify under oath. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fears of persecution, and the administration claims his alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return, a claim his wife and attorney deny.</p>

          <p>South Korea's GDP contracted by 0.1% in the first quarter, marking the first contraction in four years, primarily due to a significant decline in construction activity. The Bank of Korea had previously warned of slower growth, citing domestic political uncertainties and deteriorating trade conditions. Impeachment trials and ongoing trade disputes with the U.S., including tariffs on steel and automobiles, have contributed to the economic slowdown. Analysts anticipate further rate cuts by the central bank and potential fiscal stimulus to address the challenging economic environment.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg revealed that Chinese airlines have ceased accepting deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the U.S. This has led Boeing to consider reallocating aircraft intended for Chinese customers to other airlines, mitigating potential disruptions to the company's recovery. Despite this setback, Boeing reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter, with airplane deliveries exceeding expectations.

          <p>SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, reported first-quarter earnings exceeding estimates due to strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose 42% and operating profit surged 158% year-on-year, but the company cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policy, could create demand volatility in the second half of the year. While expecting limited impact from tariffs on AI server demand, SK Hynix anticipates consumer electronics to benefit from new AI functionalities. The company cited the rise of open-source AI models and sovereign AI projects as drivers of memory demand.</p>

          <p>A fossil discovery in northeastern China has revealed a complex prehistoric food chain involving dinosaurs and mammals. The fossilized remains of Huadanosaurus sinensis, a newly identified dinosaur, contained two small mammals in its stomach, including a relative of a mammal known to prey on small dinosaurs. This discovery highlights a predator-prey dynamic where dinosaurs preyed on mammals that themselves preyed on dinosaurs, showcasing a twisted ecological loop from 125 million years ago.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has indicated he will reduce his involvement with the federal government, amidst growing scrutiny of his influence and policies. Musk, who previously brandished a chainsaw onstage to dramatize his role as a government reformer, has faced criticism for his role in driving radical change across the government. While he will continue advocating for lower tariffs, he acknowledged the President's decision-making power, signaling a shift in his approach to Washington.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's congressional delegation are urging President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March.

          <p>A bill in California to sharply reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels is generating significant controversy. Assembly Bill 942, proposed by a former Edison executive, would limit the credits to 10 years and end them upon the sale of the house, impacting those who installed systems before April 15, 2023. Supporters argue the bill would alleviate financial burden on non-solar ratepayers, while opponents claim it undermines the state's commitment to renewable energy and benefits utility companies at the expense of homeowners.</p>

The industry body, Water UK, stated that they never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to "reduce the administrative burden" on the Environment Agency (EA). A report from the National Audit Office (NAO) is expected to say on Friday that the Environment Agency does not currently have enough capacity to take on any new monitoring.
