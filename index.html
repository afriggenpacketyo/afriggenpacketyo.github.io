          <p>A fatal explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, is under investigation as an intentional act of violence, according to local police. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, damaged several buildings, including the American Reproductive Centers clinic, though officials report that the clinic's IVF lab and stored embryos were unharmed. One person was killed, and at least five others were injured, prompting a response from local, state, and federal authorities, including the FBI and ATF.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio engaged in discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to gain insight into the recent talks between Russia and Ukraine, as the U.S. seeks to determine if Russia is genuinely pursuing a ceasefire.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the European Union. This arrangement would allow young people to work abroad for up to two years, but specific details, such as age eligibility and number caps, are still under discussion. The BBC reports that the EU has been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is not contemplating more than one or two. Starmer emphasized that the scheme would be reciprocal and would not represent a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, aiming to strengthen the partnership between the UK and the EU.</p>

          <p>Hamas has proposed a new Gaza ceasefire deal, offering to release more hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel. This proposal follows Israel's launch of a major new offensive, dubbed "Operation Gideon's Chariots," amid the deadliest wave of strikes in months, resulting in numerous casualties. The proposed deal would reinstate a previous humanitarian protocol, including the entry of aid trucks and evacuation of medical patients, but would not include an explicit end to the war or Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The intensified offensive has drawn condemnation from the UN and European leaders, raising concerns about the humanitarian crisis and risk of famine in Gaza.</p>

The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing a more complex body structure than previously observed in other radiodonts.

          <p>Donald Trump has said that he will speak to both Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an effort to stop the war in Ukraine. Trump, posting on his Truth Social account on Saturday, wrote that he will speak to Putin on Monday morning. Trump‚Äôs call with the Russian president will be followed by a separate conversation with Zelenskyy, Ukraine‚Äôs leader, and Nato leaders as part of the US effort to end the war that has raged since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. In a separate Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump complained about the impact of tariffs he has imposed, after Walmart, among other retailers, warned it will have to raise prices for Americans in response.</p>

          <p>Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota criticized Donald Trump in a law school graduation speech Saturday, accusing the Republican president of creating a national emergency by repeatedly violating the rule of law. Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, used his remarks at the University of Minnesota's law school commencement ceremony to call on graduates to stand up to abuses of power. He also attacked "feckless" and "cowardly" big law firms that have acquiesced to Trump in the face of threats, with some offering millions in pro bono work and other benefits.</p>

          <p>Federal courts have consistently pushed back against the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive deportation policies, insisting on the fundamental principle of due process for immigrants. In numerous cases, the judiciary has emphasized that immigrants should have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly as the administration claims novel powers to remove them. This legal stance was underscored by the Supreme Court's rebuke of the administration's attempt to provide Venezuelan immigrants with only a day's warning before deportation, deeming it insufficient to meet due process requirements.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria came as a surprise to senior officials inside the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy. The announcement was also short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back, and at what pace. The lack of clarity sent senior officials at Treasury scrambling to understand what he meant. Relief was a key topic in meetings between Syrian officials, including its Central Bank Governor Abdelkadir Husrieh, and other world leaders at the IMF and World Bank Spring Meetings last month in Washington.</p>

          <p>Opinion writer John McWhorter visits the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. in response to President Trump's criticism of the museum. The museum has so much to see, hear and read that the museum would require multiple visits to fully take in. The museum‚Äôs teachings are never strident or rhetorical. One example that struck me: an exhibition text that stated that starting in the 1950s, when Black people moved into previously white neighborhoods, white flight ‚Äúoften‚Äù ensued. Often, rather than always.</p>
