          <p>Legal challenges have stalled the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan, leaving millions of borrowers, like Aubrey Bertram, in limbo.  Bertram, who was nearing forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, is now facing further delays.  The challenges affect various income-driven repayment plans, potentially costing borrowers over a year of progress toward debt cancellation.  Borrowers are advised to explore alternative income-driven repayment plans that are currently open for applications.</p>
