          <p>UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2025 indicates a negative outlook for international investment due to escalating trade tensions and tariff uncertainty, reversing earlier modest growth.

Companies are delaying investment projects, particularly in manufacturing, due to tariff-related uncertainties. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to this downturn, especially in sectors aligned with sustainable development goals, although there is growth in semiconductor and digital infrastructure projects.

          <p>President Trump is considering military options, including disabling Iran's Fordo nuclear site, due to concerns about Iran's nuclear weapons capabilities.

The UK is actively involved in diplomacy, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy meeting Secretary of State Marco Rubio to present a proposal to Iran. Trump is aware of ongoing diplomatic efforts involving European and Iranian officials in Geneva.

          <p>Fox Corp has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to bolster its sports programming and expand its streaming services. Carlos Martinez, a former executive at Turner, Discovery, and Fox, will lead Latin American operations for Fox Corp. The acquisition is part of Fox's strategy to increase its sports content as streaming becomes the dominant form of TV consumption. Fox plans to launch its own streaming service, Fox One, later this year, adding to its existing Tubi platform. The company's broadcast rights include the Big Ten Conference, The United Football League, and the Premier League and the FA Cup.</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing Â£150 off energy bills to millions more households this winter. The changes remove property-related qualifications, allowing anyone on means-tested benefits to receive the discount. While welcomed by debt charities and energy groups, some argue the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means-tested benefits. The expansion could be funded by raising fees on all customer bills, but the government aims to offset this with savings from energy companies. Current market expectations suggest another rise in gas and electricity bills from October due to higher oil and gas prices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has extended the enforcement deadline for a law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. for another 90 days, now until September 17, due to unresolved issues with separating TikTok from its parent company, ByteDance. The delay marks the third extension since January, as Congress passed the law last year citing national security concerns. The administration is working to ensure a deal is reached so Americans can continue using TikTok with data security assurances. Trump has expressed confidence that China will ultimately approve the deal.</p>

Edmunds learned that enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to guide runaways to freedom. The quilts displayed patterns such as the "monkey wrench," "north star," and "bow tie" to convey instructions and warnings. While some historians doubt the use of quilts as codes due to lack of written evidence, others argue that the secrecy surrounding the Underground Railroad would explain the absence of documentation.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has urged further negotiations instead of escalating the Israel-Iran conflict, while President Trump considers joining Israeli strikes. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel has called on the UK government to back the US if it attacks Iran. Starmer emphasized that the nuclear issue needs to be dealt with through negotiation rather than conflict, stressing the need for de-escalation. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is meeting with US and EU counterparts, as well as Iran's foreign minister, to seek diplomatic solutions.</p>

The Takanami entered the strait from the East China Sea and headed south, with the entire transit monitored by the Chinese military.

          <p>A new study indicates that offsetting emissions from the world's 200 largest oil and gas companies would require planting a forest the size of North America. The research highlights the insurmountable land use and financial challenges of relying on afforestation to balance carbon emissions. The study estimates that the worldâ€™s 200 largest fossil-fuel companies hold about 200 billion tons of carbon in their reserves, which would generate as much as 742 billion tons of CO2 if burned. The findings underscore the need for reducing emissions at the source, as offsetting alone is not a viable solution.</p>
