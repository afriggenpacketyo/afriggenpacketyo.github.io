          <p>Israeli military forces intercepted a Gaza-bound aid ship carrying climate activist Greta Thunberg, vowing to prevent it from breaching a naval blockade. The ship, named Madleen, was carrying humanitarian aid and activists seeking to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza, which Israel maintains is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Hamas. Israel's Foreign Ministry stated that the ship was safely making its way to Israeli shores and that the passengers were expected to return to their home countries, and any aid would be delivered through proper channels. The incident highlights the ongoing tensions surrounding the delivery of aid to Gaza and the enforcement of Israel's blockade. The interception was met with mixed reactions, with some criticizing Israel's actions and others supporting its security measures.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom formally requested the Trump administration to withdraw the National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles. Newsom called the deployment unlawful and a breach of state sovereignty, stating that there was no need for the troops in Los Angeles. The National Guard had been deployed in response to protests against immigration authorities, which had led to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. The move has sparked controversy, with Democratic governors condemning Trump's actions as an abuse of power, while the White House portrayed the unrest as widespread.</p>

          <p>An editorial criticizes President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles without the request of state leaders. The editorial argues that the deployment is based on false pretenses and is likely to escalate tensions, creating the very chaos it was intended to prevent. The editorial contrasts Trump's actions with historical precedents, such as John F. Kennedy's deployment of troops to desegregate the University of Alabama, and suggests that Trump's invocation of a rebellion is unfounded. It also points out the irony of Trump accusing others of rebellion when his own supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in 2021.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein discusses the internal conflicts within the Democratic Party following the release of his book "Abundance." The book, co-authored with Derek Thompson, critiques how Democrats have governed in areas where they hold power. The backlash to the book has come from anti-corporate populists who worry that "Abundance" will derail their ascendance. The debate centers on whether the focus of American politics should be on addressing concentrated power or on increasing the production of essential resources.</p>

          <p>Energy firms in Britain are being paid substantial sums to not provide power due to limitations in the electricity grid's capacity to handle renewable energy. Wind farms in Scotland, for example, are sometimes paid to reduce output because the grid cannot transport the electricity to areas where it is needed. The government is considering a radical solution of regional electricity markets to address the issue, but this has sparked debate and concerns about potentially higher bills for some consumers. The current system is costing the country hundreds of millions of pounds, raising questions about the feasibility of net zero policies.</p>
