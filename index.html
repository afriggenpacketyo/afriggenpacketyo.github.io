          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 05:03:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the government is considering eliminating the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Phillipson acknowledged that while removing the cap would be costly, it has pushed many families into poverty and has scarred the life chances of children in the country. The government is expected to announce its decision on the cap in the autumn, following a review by the Child Poverty Taskforce, with Phillipson emphasizing that "nothing is off the table" and a Labour government would never have introduced such a cap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, caution against Republican lawmakers' proposal to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They argue that the P.C.A.O.B., created after the Enron and WorldCom scandals, is crucial for protecting against accounting fraud and audit failures. The authors emphasize that the board's independence from the S.E.C. is a strength, enabling rigorous inspections and enforcement that have improved audit quality and maintained investor confidence. Eliminating the P.C.A.O.B. would increase the risk of corporate disasters and shift its costs to the public, undermining essential safeguards.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emily Keegin critiques President Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office, describing it as a "gilded rococo hellscape" and questioning whether it reflects American values. The author delves into the history of Rococo design, noting its association with European royalty and its later adoption by the bourgeoisie, as well as the style's reemergence in America during times of economic prosperity and uncertainty. Keegin argues that Trump's embrace of Rococo reflects a uniquely American desire to emulate royalty while simultaneously embracing a populist image, concluding that Americans often prefer the facade of wealth over genuine progress.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential impact of President Trump's proposed budget cuts on federally funded after-school programs, particularly the 21st Century Community Learning Centers (CCLC) grant. The REACH Afterschool Program in rural Maine, which provides enriching activities for students in a low-income community, is highlighted as an example of a program that could be affected. Advocates emphasize that these programs improve academic performance, attendance, and overall well-being for students who may not have access to such opportunities otherwise, and also serve as an essential service for working parents.</p>

He addresses concerns about antisemitism and political viewpoint diversity on campus, emphasizing the importance of free speech and civil discourse. Garber warns that the administration's actions serve as a warning to universities to comply with demands or face consequences.</p>

          <p>An NPR report reveals that Corporate America's shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives has resulted in the elimination of over 2,600 DEI-related jobs since early 2023. This decline follows a period of increased DEI hiring after George Floyd's murder in 2020, but a conservative backlash against DEI programs has led major companies to end or rename their diversity efforts. The change is impacting DEI professionals, particularly women and people of color, who are facing prolonged unemployment and a shrinking job market, despite the continued need for inclusive workplace practices.</p>

          <p>A former federal prison warden described the New Orleans jail as a "train wreck" due to deficient security protocols that enabled 10 inmates, including a serial escape artist, to break out. The warden highlighted failures such as inadequate inmate supervision, non-existent security inspections, and a lack of emergency preparedness. A compliance report revealed ongoing violence, drug use, and extortion schemes within the jail, as well as a failure to conduct regular security checks. The former warden criticized the jail's leadership and emphasized the need for stricter measures, particularly for high-risk inmates.</p>
