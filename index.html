          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has returned to the United States to face smuggling charges. The indictment alleges his involvement in smuggling undocumented migrants into the US, with Attorney General Pam Bondi claiming he played a significant role in an alien smuggling ring. Abrego Garcia's lawyer dismisses the charges as baseless, arguing that the administration is prosecuting him to justify his initial deportation. His arraignment is set for June 13, and if convicted, he will be deported after serving his sentence.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to take a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. This shift follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential change in Seoul's foreign policy. While Lee's party is viewed as more amicable towards China and North Korea, analysts anticipate continued trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. Under Yoon, South Korea emphasized its alliance with the US and expressed concerns about Chinese military activities in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea.</p>

She contrasts the focus on individual responsibility in countries like the UK with the government and culturally supported healthy lifestyles in places like Japan.

          <p>Japan and the United States have yet to reach a consensus on tariff issues, according to Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, despite aiming to finalize a mutually beneficial deal by mid-June.

          <p>Labubu, a monster character created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung, has become a global hit, driven by celebrity endorsements and strategic marketing. The rabbit-like plush toy, sold in "blind boxes," has attracted a large following, with limited-edition items reselling for high prices. The success of Labubu reflects China's transformation in the toy market, shifting from subcontracting to creating original products. Pop Mart shares are now valued higher than Sanrio Co., the company behind Hello Kitty.</p>
