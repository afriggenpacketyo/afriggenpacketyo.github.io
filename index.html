          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative, "AI Fluency," requiring all incoming students to study artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. The program aims to equip graduates with essential AI skills for a job market that has seen a 619% increase in demand for such expertise over the past decade. While some remain skeptical about AI's impact on critical thinking, the university believes this requirement will provide its students with a significant competitive advantage in the workforce. The initiative includes a mandatory generative AI course and workshops focused on practical, real-world applications of the technology.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's move, described as a "risk management cut," was widely expected and signaled the possibility of two more reductions by the end of the year. While the Japanese market reacted positively, other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi rising and Australia's ASX 200 declining. The Bank of Japan is currently holding its own policy meeting, with most economists predicting it will maintain its current rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire daycare worker who admitted to secretly adding melatonin to children's food has been spared jail time, receiving a suspended sentence of up to seven years. The 53-year-old pleaded guilty to reckless conduct and falsifying evidence in a case that involved three other employees. As part of her sentence, she is barred from working in daycare, must perform 100 hours of community service, and pay restitution. The prosecutor noted that the light sentence reflects a "blind spot" in state law, as a bill to strengthen child endangerment statutes was recently rejected by lawmakers.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air indefinitely following intense backlash over comments the host made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel had suggested in his monologue that the accused killer was aligned with the MAGA movement, prompting criticism and a call from the FCC chair to review ABC's broadcast license. Nexstar Media Group, a major affiliate owner, had already announced it would preempt the show. The suspension is the latest in a series of professional consequences for media figures who have commented on the politically charged killing.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to designate the loose affiliation of anti-fascist activists known as "antifa" as a major terrorist organization. In a post on his social media platform, Trump called the group a "sick, dangerous, radical left disaster" and recommended investigations into its funding sources. It remains unclear what the legal and practical implications of such a designation would be or when it might officially take place. Antifa is generally not considered a formally structured group, which could complicate the application of terrorism-related laws and sanctions against it.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock declined after the company reported mixed fourth-quarter earnings and announced it was refocusing on its traditional guest experience. The report follows a significant public backlash against a recent rebranding effort that included a modernized logo, which was widely criticized and quickly abandoned. CEO Julie Masino acknowledged the customer passion for the brand's heritage and confirmed the company is reverting to its classic "Old Timer" signage and suspending restaurant remodels. The company issued a cautious financial outlook for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting lower-than-expected revenue and a decline in same-store traffic. (not investment advice)</p>

The National Academies asserts that the scientific certainty of climate change has only grown since 2009 and warns of a future where climate-induced harm worsens.

Harris writes that while Buttigieg would have been an "ideal partner," she felt the combination was asking too much of America at the time.

The study notes that the chimps are not getting drunk but are exposed to a steady, low dose of alcohol.

          <p>Enrique Tarrio, a key leader of the far-right group the Proud Boys, has stated he is activating his network to identify and seek the firing of individuals who celebrated the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Tarrio described the effort as adopting a tactic previously used against his own group, saying, "An eye for an eye right now." He claims the campaign has resulted in over 100 firings, which supporters refer to as "scalps." The movement is part of a broader right-wing reaction to the killing, which has also seen some militia groups use the event as a recruiting opportunity.</p>

          <p>During his second state visit to the United Kingdom, Donald Trump celebrated the "priceless and eternal" bond between the two nations at a lavish banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The visit featured extensive royal pageantry, which Trump called one of the highest honors of his life. The trip is seen as an effort by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to secure deeper economic ties and investment, with companies already pledging $42 billion. However, the visit was also met with significant public opposition, as thousands of protesters marched in London to voice their anger.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:13:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a 0.25% interest rate cut, a move that comes amid an ongoing pressure campaign from Donald Trump for more significant reductions. The decision reflects the central bank's balancing act between managing inflation and responding to recent weak jobs reports. The Fed's independence is being tested by the administration's attempt to oust board member Lisa Cook and the recent appointment of Stephen Miran, who remains a White House economic adviser. Miran was the sole dissenting vote, pushing for a larger 0.5% cut, fueling speculation about his alignment with the president's demands. (not investment advice)</p>
