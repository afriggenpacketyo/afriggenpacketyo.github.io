          <p>The British government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, allowing millions more households to receive £150 off their energy bills this winter. The changes remove property size and energy score qualifications, extending the discount to 2.7 million more homes, including those with children. Energy companies will fund the expansion, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills to offset the cost. The government also plans to expand automatic compensation schemes for energy customers, including those experiencing long hold times or unexpectedly high bills. The goal is to improve energy efficiency and reduce heating costs for vulnerable households (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, with temperatures reaching 32.2C in London, leading to the declaration of a heatwave in Suffolk. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England, with warnings of potential strain on health and social care services. Temperatures are expected to rise further, potentially reaching 33C, with regional fire services issuing water safety warnings and health organizations advising precautions for vulnerable individuals. A change in wind direction on Sunday is expected to bring cooler temperatures and break the heatwave. The current high temperatures are due to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe.</p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by reflecting on the potential role of quilts in the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that enslaved people used encoded messages in quilts to guide their escape to the North. These quilts, displayed publicly, contained patterns that conveyed information about safe houses, routes, and necessary preparations. While some historians debate the lack of written evidence, Edmunds believes the secrecy surrounding the Underground Railroad would explain the absence of documentation. Edmunds continues to quilt, honoring her ancestors and sharing the stories of those who sought freedom.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been briefed on potential risks and benefits of military action against Fordo, a secure Iranian nuclear site, believing it necessary to prevent weapons production. While approving attack plans, Trump has not made a final decision, hoping Tehran will abandon its nuclear program. The UK is attempting diplomacy, offering Iran a take-it-or-leave-it deal, while Trump reviews intelligence reports on Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iran has prepared missiles for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, and insists it will not negotiate under duress.</p>

          <p>Strawberry Fanta, known as Fanta nam daeng, is a common offering at Thai spirit houses in Los Angeles, reflecting a blend of animistic and Brahmanic beliefs integrated into Buddhist practices. The red soda is believed to have replaced blood offerings to appease spirits, particularly Kuman Thong, the spirit of a deceased boy. Red Fanta's popularity is likely linked to Coca-Cola's long-standing presence in Thailand, with the drink serving as a sweet offering to gain favor with the spirits. Spirit houses, found outside Thai establishments, serve as a place for spirits to dwell and receive offerings.</p>

          <p>At least 12 Palestinians have reportedly been killed by Israeli forces while waiting for aid in central Gaza, according to rescuers and medics. The group was allegedly killed by gunfire near an aid distribution site run by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Israeli military said its forces fired warning shots at individuals approaching them near Netzarim, but it is unaware of any injuries. The GHF denied there were any incidents near its site, while Hamas has called for the UN to be the sole distributor of aid in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (MSDF) destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, days after a Chinese fighter jet approached a Japanese patrol plane. This marks the third known passage by an MSDF ship in the past year, signaling a warning to China amid increasing pressure on Taiwan. The transit occurred after Japan reported a close encounter between a Chinese J-15 fighter jet and a Japanese P-3C surveillance plane. The Japanese government has traditionally avoided sending vessels through the Strait but has shifted its stance amid Beijing's assertiveness.</p>

Trump's criticism reflects his ongoing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates (not investment advice).</p>

Researchers found that the economic and ecological challenges of such afforestation are insurmountable.

The Trump administration's shift away from decarbonization efforts further exacerbates the problem, highlighting the urgency of reducing carbon emissions (not investment advice).</p>

Affected vehicles will display a warning light and exhibit an abnormal pedal feeling, and owners will be contacted to have the brake pedal replaced.</p>
