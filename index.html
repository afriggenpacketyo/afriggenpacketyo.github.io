        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former chair of the Environment Agency is warning about the potential dangers of using sewage sludge, the solid waste from human sewage treatment, as fertilizer on agricultural fields due to the presence of toxic chemicals. The sludge can contain cancer-linked chemicals, microplastics, and industrial pollutants, including PFAS, or "forever chemicals," which don't degrade quickly and have been linked to cancer. There are concerns that these chemicals could contaminate the soil for hundreds or thousands of years, potentially harming human health and the food chain, and the water industry is lobbying regulators and making contingency plans in case rules change. The article highlights the need for stricter regulations and testing to ensure the safe and sustainable use of sludge in agriculture. Optimism surrounding the issue is low considering the potential implications for public health and the environment.</p>

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to protests over immigration enforcement, arguing it is an unlawful power grab. The lawsuit asserts that President Trump bypassed California Governor Gavin Newsom by placing the National Guard under federal control without the governor's consent. The state argues that the deployment has stoked fear and terror, heightened tensions, and that local police have effectively handled the protests. The suit seeks to restore state control over its National Guard forces, claiming the federal government's actions are unconstitutional. The situation reflects escalating tensions between the state and the federal government, and the potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on Operation Babylift, a mission during the final days of the Vietnam War to evacuate children fathered by U.S. servicemen, highlighting both its humanitarian intent and ethical complexities. The operation, initiated by President Gerald Ford, aimed to rescue these children from potential harm, yet faced tragedy with the crash of its first flight. The article explores the mixed legacy of the mission, acknowledging criticisms regarding the evacuation of children without parental consent while also recognizing the opportunities it provided to many. The story of Thuy Williams, who was evacuated and later reunited with her mother, illustrates the complicated yet ultimately life-saving impact of the operation.</p>

          <p>Japan has confirmed that two Chinese aircraft carriers are operating simultaneously in the Pacific Ocean, raising concerns in Tokyo about Beijing's increasing military activities. The Shandong was spotted near Japan's southernmost Okinotori Island, while the Liaoning was observed near Japan's easternmost Minamitori Island, marking the first confirmed navigation by a Chinese carrier in those waters. The Chinese Foreign Ministry defended the activities as consistent with international law, stating that China pursues a defensive national policy.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that President Trump plans to deploy an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, doubling the initial deployment, which he criticizes as reckless and disrespectful. The Defense Department has also mobilized 700 U.S. Marines to support the National Guard, a move condemned by the ACLU, which argues the Marines lack the training to police protests while respecting constitutional rights. Newsom has also sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the initial deployment, claiming it was done without the state's consent or request.

          <p>Over 300 scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have signed an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's policies, expressing concerns about the politicization of research, interruptions in global collaboration, and budget cuts. The letter calls for the reversal of delayed or terminated grants, the reinstatement of staff, and the allowance of work with foreign collaborators. The Trump administration defended its policies, stating that they have not halted legitimate international collaborations and that other funders also cap indirect costs.

          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department after officials demanded that the state's public high schools confirm they will bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' sports. The state argues that the Justice Department has no right to make such a demand and that California's laws allowing athletes to participate in sports consistent with their gender identity do not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The lawsuit seeks an injunction against the demand letter, while Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon argues that knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities constitutes unconstitutional sexual discrimination. This legal battle underscores the ongoing debate over transgender rights and the role of government in regulating sports participation.</p>

          <p>A small marble sculpture, once believed to be a copy of Auguste Rodin's work, has been authenticated as a genuine piece by the famed French artist and sold for nearly $1 million at auction. The sculpture, titled "Despair," had disappeared after a 1906 auction, and its rediscovery brought delight to its owners, who had previously thought it was a mere replica. The Comite Rodin confirmed its authenticity after a six-week investigation, leading to its sale as an "extremely rare" find.

          <p>Dr. Phil's presence during ICE raids in Los Angeles, where he spent time with President Trump's border czar, has sparked questions and controversy.

          <p>Los Angeles is in recovery mode after a weekend of protests against Donald Trump's immigration roundups, marked by vandalism and violence, with street cleaning crews working to remove graffiti. Despite the clean-up efforts, protests continued, with city officials and union leaders demanding the release of a labor leader arrested during an immigration raid. The National Guard, which played a minimal role in policing the protests, remained largely out of sight, while police forces from neighboring cities were drafted in to help. The article captures the city's resilience and the ongoing tensions between protesters and authorities.</p>

          <p>The government has committed Â£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" that would kickstart "economic growth", while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said nuclear energy would "deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance". Critics, however, condemn the announcement, fearing the project will be a costly mistake and add to consumer bills. The investment is part of a series of announcements leading up to the government's Spending Review.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom are engaged in a heated dispute over protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with Trump threatening to arrest Newsom and Newsom accusing the White House of exacerbating the situation for political gain. Trump has deployed National Guard members to Los Angeles, a move Newsom is challenging in court, claiming Trump illegally federalized the National Guard. The conflict highlights the deep political divide between the Trump administration and Democratic-run states, with both sides framing the situation in familiar political terms. The situation also places Newsom back in the national spotlight, amid speculation about a potential presidential run in 2028.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advises investors to wait for a pullback before buying Circle Internet stock, citing its recent surge and the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. While acknowledging Circle Internet as a solid company with a more transparent stablecoin business compared to Tether, Cramer believes the stock has become too hot. He suggests patience, stating that a better buying opportunity will arise, and warns about the overall craziness in the IPO market. Cramer believes the company is still linked to the ever-volatile crypto ecosystem (not investment advice).</p>
