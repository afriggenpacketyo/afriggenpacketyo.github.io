          <p>The NATO summit in the Netherlands will decide on a proposed defense spending increase.  Allies are under pressure to raise spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, a target some find unreasonable.  President Trump's questioning of Article 5's definition adds to the complexity, though NATO's Secretary General aims to reassure allies of continued U.S. commitment.  The final decision and timeline for the increase remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) approved an $18.8-billion budget that avoids immediate layoffs but reduces contributions to a retiree health benefits trust fund.  The decision follows objections from employee unions who argued the proposed increase in contributions was excessive.  The revised budget allocates more funds towards current employee needs and programs supporting Black students and immigrants.  The district faces a structural deficit and potential future cuts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore millions of dollars in research grants to UC researchers after finding evidence of viewpoint discrimination. The case, spearheaded by two UC Berkeley law professors, could become a class-action suit, potentially covering grants across the UC system.

          <p>An initial intelligence assessment contradicts President Trump's claims that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities "obliterated" the program.  The assessment suggests the strikes caused limited damage and only set back the program by months.  The White House disputes the assessment, calling it a leak by a disgruntled intelligence official.
