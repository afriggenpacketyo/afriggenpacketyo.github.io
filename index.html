          <p>A severe heatwave sweeping across Europe has resulted in multiple fatalities, with authorities in Spain and France reporting several deaths. In Spain's Catalonia region, two individuals were discovered deceased by firefighters battling a wildfire, while France confirmed two heat-related deaths. The extreme temperatures, which have set new records for June in both Spain and England, are also causing significant disruptions, including power outages in Italian cities like Florence and Bergamo due to overloaded electrical grids. The UN's World Meteorological Organization attributes the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to human-induced climate change, warning that urban areas are particularly vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A massive tax and spending bill, central to Donald Trump's second-term agenda, faces significant hurdles in the House of Representatives due to deep divisions within the Republican party. After narrowly passing the Senate, the legislation is now opposed by conservative fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus, who are concerned about the bill's projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national deficit. Furthermore, moderate Republicans from poorer districts are worried about proposed cuts to Medicaid, which could strip health insurance from millions of Americans. These internal conflicts create uncertainty for House Speaker Mike Johnson as he attempts to unify his party for a vote.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York has acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most severe charges he faced, including racketeering and sex trafficking. However, he was found guilty on two counts of transporting individuals across state lines for prostitution, which could result in a prison sentence of up to 10 years per count. The verdict concludes a high-profile trial that featured graphic testimony from former girlfriends about coercive, drug-fueled sexual encounters. While the prosecution argued these events were part of a criminal enterprise, the defense maintained the encounters were consensual aspects of a swinger lifestyle, successfully challenging the more serious allegations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which includes imposing a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. In exchange, Vietnam has agreed to grant the United States complete, tariff-free access to its markets for American products. This agreement aims to curb the practice of transshipping, where goods from countries like China are routed through Vietnam to avoid higher duties. The deal was finalized shortly before a 90-day pause on many of Trump's broader reciprocal tariffs was set to expire.</p>

          <p>Athletic apparel company Lululemon has initiated legal action against Costco, accusing the wholesale retailer of selling replicas of its popular clothing items. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, claims that certain Costco products, such as hoodies and pants, are "confusingly similar" to Lululemon's designs, constituting trade dress infringement. Lululemon argues that these so-called "dupes" mislead consumers and unfairly capitalize on its brand's reputation for unique construction and design. The company is seeking financial damages for lost profits and a court order to halt the sale of the contested products.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. department stores, including Macy's and Nordstrom, are showing increasing evidence of price hikes on goods like apparel and footwear due to President Trump's tariffs. Data analysis reveals that prices, particularly for footwear, began a noticeable ascent in May, with some items now costing up to 4% more than at the start of the year. Retailers have warned that tariffs would inevitably impact consumer prices, and these effects are now becoming visible as new inventory subject to the duties reaches store shelves. The trend reflects the complex flow of costs through the supply chain, with retailers passing on what they cannot absorb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent youth-led protests in Kenya are being compared to the historic "Saba Saba" (Seven Seven) demonstrations of the 1990s, which were pivotal in moving the country toward multi-party democracy. Analysts note that both movements share a core demand for better governance, accountability, and an end to corruption and state-sanctioned violence. While the original Saba Saba protests had clear political leaders, the current demonstrations are seen as a more decentralized, grassroots movement. The government's forceful response, including a "shoot to kill" directive and claims of an attempted coup, mirrors the repressive tactics used by the authoritarian regime in the 1990s.</p>

The team hopes this object is the wreckage of Earhart's Lockheed 10-E Electra, which disappeared 88 years ago during her attempt to circumnavigate the globe. If the plane is identified, it could finally solve one of the 20th century's most enduring mysteries and fulfill Earhart's wish to return the aircraft to Purdue University.</p>

The report from the National Energy System Operator found that the catastrophic failure of a transformer was preceded by a fault that operator National Grid was warned about seven years prior but failed to fix. The investigation also revealed that while Heathrow knew a single point of failure could close the airport, National Grid was unaware of the critical importance of this specific substation. In response to the findings, Heathrow is now considering legal action against National Grid for what it calls "clear and repeated failings."</p>

The judges commended the BBC for exposing the issue and stated that the new investigation will be overseen by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, hoping such an event will never be repeated and trust in the courts can be maintained.</p>

          <p>Researchers have successfully sequenced the first whole ancient Egyptian genome from the remains of a man who lived as a potter between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The study, which analyzed well-preserved DNA from the man's tooth, revealed he had brown eyes, stood 5.2 feet tall, and lived a physically demanding life. Significantly, the genetic analysis showed that about 20% of his ancestry traced back to the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, providing the first direct genetic evidence of population mixing between North Africa and the Levant during this critical period of Egyptian history. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for understanding the genetic history of ancient Egypt.</p>

          <p>Private sector employment in the U.S. unexpectedly contracted in June, with a loss of 33,000 jobs, according to the latest ADP report. This figure starkly contrasts with economists' expectations of a 100,000-job gain and marks the first decrease since March 2023. The job losses were concentrated in service-providing sectors like professional services and healthcare, while goods-producing roles saw a modest expansion. ADP's chief economist attributed the decline to a hesitancy among businesses to hire and replace departing workers, suggesting a potential cooling in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

While Israeli officials indicated strong backing for a proposed framework, they clarified it is not a final agreement, and far-right members of the government have voiced opposition. Hamas stated it is reviewing the proposal with a "high sense of responsibility" but reiterated its demands for a permanent end to the war. The diplomatic uncertainty persists as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, with hundreds of civilians reportedly killed while trying to access aid from distribution hubs.</p>

          <p>Del Monte Foods, a nearly 140-year-old company known for its canned fruits and vegetables, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced its intention to find a buyer. The company stated the court-supervised sale is the most effective path to accelerate its turnaround amid declining consumer demand and shifting preferences toward healthier, non-preservative-laden alternatives. Del Monte has secured over $900 million in financing from its lenders to continue operations during the sale process. The company is the fourth in the food and beverage sector to file for bankruptcy this year, reflecting broader challenges in the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was delayed for two hours after a snake was discovered in the aircraft's cargo hold as passengers were boarding. A professional snake catcher was called to the scene to remove the reptile, which was identified as a harmless 2-foot green tree snake. The snake catcher noted the situation could have been much worse, as he initially thought the snake might be venomous and could have disappeared into the plane's interior. Officials suspect the snake, which is native to the Brisbane area, hitched a ride in a passenger's luggage on the inbound flight.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is preparing to take up a massive domestic policy bill that was recently passed by the Senate, aiming for a final vote before the July 4th deadline. The legislation, a cornerstone of President Trump's agenda, includes increased spending on border security and defense, extends tax cuts, and makes significant reductions to healthcare and nutrition programs. Despite Republican control, the bill's passage is uncertain due to opposition from both Democrats and some hardline conservatives who are unhappy with changes made in the Senate version.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, the man charged with the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is expected to plead guilty in a deal that will spare him the death penalty. In exchange for pleading guilty to four counts of murder and one count of burglary, he will receive four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The victims' families have expressed mixed reactions to the plea deal, with some feeling relief at avoiding a painful trial and others expressing anger at the state for not pursuing the death penalty.

          <p>In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's liberal majority has overturned the state's 1849 law that banned nearly all abortions. The court ruled that the historic ban was superseded by a more recent 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. The 1849 law had been dormant since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision but was argued to be reactivated after Roe was overturned in 2022. This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers and patients in Wisconsin, affirming that consensual abortions are not outlawed by the archaic feticide statute and will remain legal in the state under the framework of the 1985 law.</p>

          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components as it seeks to reduce its dependence on China. A recent report shows Germany has become the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones, a trend driven by security concerns and China's tightening export controls. While a complete decoupling from China's dominant drone market is considered unrealistic, Germany aims to diversify its supply of critical parts like software and sensors. Taiwan is positioning itself to fill this role by developing a "non-red" supply chain free from Chinese influence, which is attractive to European partners.</p>
