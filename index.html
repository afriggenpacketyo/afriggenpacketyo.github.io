          <p>A new report from Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office reveals that domestic violence cases reached a record high in 2024, with over 256,000 registered victims. This equates to an incident occurring approximately every two minutes, with women comprising 73% of the victims. The article also notes other German news, including the reopening of a major railway line after suspected sabotage by left-wing extremists and a consumer group's lawsuit against budget airlines over hand luggage fees, which they argue violate existing law.</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier Liu Guozhong has visited Foshan, a major manufacturing hub in Guangdong province, to address a significant Chikungunya outbreak. With the city accounting for nearly 60% of the 4,824 cases in the province, Liu urged local authorities to enhance prevention measures, eliminate mosquitoes, and cut off transmission channels. This represents China's most severe outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in decades, prompting authorities to implement nucleic acid PCR testing in affected neighborhoods, though no fatalities have been reported.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has commented on the "complex" and "far from ideal" situation regarding a potential transfer for striker Alexander Isak. The club recently rejected a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old player, whom they value at around £150 million. Howe expressed his desire to keep Isak on the team but noted his lack of direct contact with the player, who is currently training alone at his former club in Spain. Isak was Newcastle's top scorer last season, contributing to their Carabao Cup victory.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following the release of jobs data that was weaker than expected. Trump alleged without evidence that the figures were "RIGGED," a move that caused US stock markets to fall and drew criticism for politicizing economic data. The jobs report showed only 73,000 new jobs in July, far below forecasts, intensifying concerns about the economic impact of his tariff policies. Critics warned that such actions erode public trust and are characteristic of authoritarian regimes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration have sent shockwaves through the global economy, causing stock markets in the US, Europe, and Asia to decline. The executive order introduces steep duties on imports from numerous countries, including Canada, India, and Switzerland, prompting sharp reactions from trade partners. Nations like South Africa and India are now engaged in urgent negotiations to avert the economic damage, which some estimate could lead to significant job losses. The move coincides with weak US jobs data, amplifying fears of a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers discovered that a forerunner of the modern tomato crossbred with a tuberless, potato-like plant. This pivotal event was a key driver in the development of the potato's tuber, the edible part that has made it the world's third most consumed food crop.

          <h2>Thousands of Hot Dogs Spill Across Pennsylvania Highway After Truck Mishap</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A truck carrying hot dogs caused a significant traffic disruption in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, after spilling its entire load across a major highway. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to scrape against a concrete divider, tearing it open and scattering the sausages onto the road during the Friday morning commute. Cleanup crews were dispatched to the scene, with the local fire chief noting that the spilled hot dogs were surprisingly slippery. A front-end loader was ultimately used to scoop the discarded wieners into a dump truck for disposal.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Hear Case on Constitutionality of Racial Redistricting in Louisiana</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 22:28:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to decide whether creating a congressional district based on race is unconstitutional. The case centers on Louisiana's new map, which includes a second majority-Black district, and was challenged by a group of "non-African-American voters" as an illegal racial gerrymander. This legal battle forces lawmakers to balance the requirements of the Voting Rights Act with the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The court's ruling could have significant implications for future redistricting efforts nationwide.</p>
