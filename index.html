          <p>Boston Red Sox third baseman Alex Bregman had a memorable return to Houston, the city where he won two World Series titles with the Astros. In his first at-bat as a visiting player, Bregman hit a two-run home run, becoming the first MLB player in over 60 years to homer on the road against a former team with which he won at least two championships. While he was met with cheers initially and honored with a video tribute, fans booed him in subsequent at-bats. Bregman took the mixed reception in stride, calling the experience a cool moment he will never forget.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by the end of the week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused flooding and at least eight reported deaths. As of Tuesday evening, Erin was located over 1,600 miles east of the Caribbean's Leeward Islands with winds of 45 mph. While it poses no immediate threat to the U.S., early models project it could become a major hurricane as it nears the Caribbean, with its long-term path still uncertain.</p>

While officials state the Guard's role is supportive, the move has created tension with local D.C. leaders over the chain of command and the necessity of the federal intervention.

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the former first lady of South Korea, has been arrested on multiple charges including bribery and stock manipulation. A Seoul court issued the warrant, citing the risk of evidence destruction after she denied all allegations during a four-hour hearing. Prosecutors accuse Kim of illegally profiting over $577,000 from a stock price-rigging scheme and accepting luxury items as bribes. This marks a historic moment, as both she and her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, are now in jail simultaneously, following his detention over a failed martial law declaration.</p>

Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, is positioning itself aggressively in the competitive AI landscape, viewing Chrome as a critical gateway to the internet for rival search engines.

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study reveals that progress has been highly uneven, with survival rates for some of the deadliest cancers showing little improvement.

In contrast, cancers like melanoma and breast cancer now have significantly higher survival rates due to advances in screening and targeted therapies. Researchers also noted that the overall rate of improvement in survival slowed during the 2010s.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates that Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% support among registered voters, while Cuomo, running as an independent, has 25%, and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails with just 7%. Mamdani's strength is concentrated among younger voters, though he underperforms with Black and Jewish voters compared to Cuomo. The results signal a potential major political shift in the city, though leading centrist Democrats have not yet endorsed Mamdani.</p>

With sales declining, the company may be forced to accelerate its pivot toward autonomous driving and robotics, though its Robotaxi rollout has faced performance issues.

This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France, which detailed mass displacements, internment camps, and support for brutal militias that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.

The river has already risen into moderate flood stage, and forecasters predict it could surpass last year's record-breaking levels.

          <p>A report by a committee of UK Members of Parliament has recommended piloting a free bus pass program for individuals under 22 in England to improve access to work and education. The report highlights that declining bus services and fares rising faster than inflation have created barriers to opportunity, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. Citing the success of a similar program in Scotland, MPs argue that free travel would help young people who rely on public transport overcome financial hurdles. The proposal aims to address social exclusion and boost local economies.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to power AI data centers with its small modular reactors (SMRs) could make it the UK's most valuable company. The engineering firm has secured deals with the UK and Czech governments to provide its nuclear technology for the energy-intensive AI industry. Erginbilgic expressed confidence in dominating the future SMR market, which he estimates could be worth over a trillion dollars by 2050. This ambitious strategy is part of a major turnaround that has seen the company's share price increase tenfold since 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's motor industry is at a critical juncture, with vehicle production in the first half of 2025 hitting its lowest level since 1953. Factory closures, Brexit-related uncertainty, and high energy and labor costs have contributed to a steep decline, threatening a sector that contributes £22 billion to the economy. Experts warn that falling below a critical mass of production could cause the entire ecosystem of suppliers and engineers to collapse. While recent investments in electric vehicle and battery production offer some hope, the industry faces a significant challenge to recover its former scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an unconventional deal with Nvidia and AMD, permitting them to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% share of the revenue. The agreement has sparked concerns from lawmakers on both sides, who question its legality and potential national security implications, as the Constitution bars taxes on exports. While the White House is still working out the mechanics, the deal is seen as a way for tech companies to navigate export controls while contributing to U.S. interests, though critics argue it monetizes national security.

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The nomination has alarmed many economists, who view Antoni as a partisan figure unqualified for the traditionally nonpartisan role and a longtime critic of the agency he would lead. Concerns were amplified when Antoni suggested the BLS could stop issuing its influential monthly jobs reports in favor of quarterly data. This move follows the recent firing of the previous commissioner, raising fears of political pressure to manipulate crucial economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

Specific areas of concern include limits on political speech deemed hateful, public space protection orders, and the Online Safety Act.

          <p>L.A. County prosecutors have filed two new corruption charges against City Councilman Curren Price, who was already facing counts of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest. The original charges alleged Price's wife received over $150,000 from developers for whom Price later voted to approve projects. The new charges stem from evidence that Price also voted on city grants and funding for agencies that were paying his wife's consulting firm hundreds of thousands of dollars. Price's attorney called the new charges an attempt to bolster a weak case, maintaining the councilman was unaware of the conflicts.</p>

          <p>Several hundred people, including union members and immigrant advocates, gathered at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles to protest the Trump administration's recent immigration raids. Organizers denounced the operations as "Trump terror" and called for an end to the federal agent presence in the city, the release of detainees, and a halt to the expansion of private detention centers. The protest included a call to boycott major retailers for not sufficiently protecting their immigrant employees. The park has become a symbol of resistance since federal agents staged a large-scale operation there in July.</p>

The summit was arranged as part of Trump's push to end the war in Ukraine, a key campaign promise, following an unmet deadline for a ceasefire. The location in Alaska, once Russian territory, adds historical resonance to the high-stakes diplomatic event. While the White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," it is widely seen as an attempt to broker a deal, though Ukraine will not be physically present for the talks.</p>
