          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, is urging Japanese lawmakers to abolish the death penalty, despite significant public support for it in Japan. Elbegdorj successfully terminated capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017 and suggests that the Japanese government should provide more information about the death penalty to foster an open debate. He emphasizes that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and respects human rights, while also pointing out the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. Elbegdorj highlights that abolishing the death penalty led to a decrease in violent crimes in Mongolia, and he believes Japan would have a better relationship with Mongolia if it abandoned the practice.</p>

          <p>Following two days of negotiations in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators have agreed on a "framework" to move forward on trade talks. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this framework aims to implement the Geneva consensus, and both U.S. and Chinese sides will now seek approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping. This agreement comes after a period of escalating trade tensions, including disputes over visas, minerals, and microchips, which threatened to derail a fragile truce reached in Geneva last month. The Geneva agreement involved a 90-day suspension of tariffs imposed by both countries in an escalating trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a curfew for downtown Los Angeles in response to ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew, effective from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., covers a one-square-mile area in downtown L.A., and Bass cited the need to stop vandalism and looting as the reason for the measure. Protests have persisted for five days following immigration raids, resulting in nearly 200 arrests and incidents of violence.

Newsom claims Trump's deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines was an intentional act to incite violence and divert attention from his actions in Washington. The governor stated that state and local law enforcement were successfully maintaining peace before federal authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets on protesters. Newsom has filed a request for a restraining order to halt the Department of Defense's militarization of Los Angeles and the takeover of the California National Guard unit.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court has agreed to maintain Trump's tariffs intact as the appeal process gets underway, delivering an important but interim victory for the Trump administration. This decision means that the tariffs will remain in place while the court considers the legal challenges against them. The legal battle over the tariffs is expected to continue, with potential implications for international trade and the U.S. economy. The appeals court's decision provides temporary relief for the Trump administration but does not resolve the underlying legal questions surrounding the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A UN panel has called on the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, stating that the agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returned sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius while allowing the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel argues that preventing the Chagossian people from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return and exercise their cultural rights. The panel has requested the current deal be suspended and a new agreement negotiated.</p>

          <p>Residents in Japan with foreign roots are increasingly speaking out against racial profiling by police, with some taking legal action. A recent survey revealed that over 71% of foreign nationals in Japan have been questioned by police in the past five years, significantly higher than the rate for Japanese citizens. Advocates argue that these questionings often lack sufficient cause and are based on appearance. The National Police Agency has issued advisories to avoid racially motivated questioning, but concerns persist about discriminatory attitudes and the potential for increased surveillance.</p>
