          <p>An Israeli strike in Khan Younis, Gaza, killed nine children of a doctor couple, according to Gaza's civil defense agency. The Israeli military stated they struck suspects operating near their forces in a dangerous war zone and are reviewing the claim of harm to uninvolved civilians. The pediatrician mother was at Nasser Hospital when the strike occurred, and the father is in intensive care. Germany's antisemitism chief questioned the proportionality of Israel's military actions, emphasizing the need to balance Israel's security with humanitarian concerns. This strike adds to growing international criticism of Israel's operations amid a catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

He highlighted his administration's commitment to national security, border protection, and building in America, including the "Golden Dome" missile defense system. Trump also criticized his predecessors for involving the military in nation-building crusades and praised his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the military academies, including the removal of critical race theory and restrictions on transgender individuals in sports.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, despite his fears of harm there. The man, who is gay, was protected from deportation to his home country but was sent to Mexico instead, a move the judge deemed lacking due process. The man presented evidence of being sexually assaulted and held for ransom in Mexico while seeking asylum in the U.S. The judge emphasized that the man poses no security threat and that facilitating his return should not be complicated, contrasting it with other cases involving foreign governments.</p>

          <p>During his commencement speech at West Point, President Trump reiterated his stance that biological males should not compete in women's sports. He emphasized that his administration ended the practice, deeming it demeaning to women. Trump's executive order prohibits biological males from competing in girls' and women's sports. This stance aligns with a New York Times/Ipsos survey indicating that a majority of Americans, including Democrats, oppose transgender athletes competing in women's sports. Several states have defied Trump's order, leading to federal Title IX investigations.</p>

The incident occurred on May 1, and the loss of contact lasted approximately 20 seconds. The Army attributed the issue to a temporary antenna that was not maintaining contact with the helicopter. The FAA directed go-arounds for the commercial aircraft as a precaution. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before briefing the agency.</p>

Bethell, who had a promising debut series against New Zealand, missed the Zimbabwe match due to his participation in the Indian Premier League (IPL).</p>

          <p>California has initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shore of the shrinking Salton Sea, aiming to provide habitat for wildlife and control dust pollution. The state began filling a complex of shallow ponds with water, representing its largest effort to address the environmental problems plaguing the Salton Sea. The $200 million project is expected to cover 2,000 acres initially, with plans to expand to over 9,000 acres using additional federal funds. The project aims to create lower-salinity habitats for fish and birds, mitigating the impacts of the lake's increasing salinity.</p>

          <p>Myanmar is experiencing a surge in rare earth mineral extraction, leading to environmental devastation and health risks in Kachin State. The in-situ leaching technique used to extract these minerals involves injecting chemicals into the ground, causing toxic leakage and harming local villagers. Chinese companies are sourcing rare earths from Myanmar, which are then used in products by global auto giants and wind power firms. Activists are calling for responsible mining practices and greater oversight to protect the environment and ensure local communities benefit from the extraction.</p>
