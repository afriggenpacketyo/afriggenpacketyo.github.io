          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, experienced an uncontrolled reentry after mission control lost contact with the upper stage during its ninth uncrewed test flight. The spacecraft leaked fuel, spun out of control, and reentered the Earth's atmosphere, likely disintegrating over the Indian Ocean. Despite the failure to complete the mission, SpaceX confirmed that Starship had suffered from "a rapid unscheduled disassembly," with the likeliest cause being a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage. The company views the test as a learning opportunity to improve Starship's reliability for future interplanetary travel.</p>

          <p>The CDC will no longer advise that healthy children receive routine COVID-19 shots, a change from its previous recommendation for annual shots for everyone 6 months and older. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited a lack of data supporting shots for healthy children and pregnant women, echoing his skepticism about the need to vaccinate children against the virus. While many agree that the original vaccination course offered significant protection against serious illness in children, the question of whether children need annual vaccines is more contentious. Doctors said the question comes down to how families make sense of the risk to their children.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk voiced his disappointment with the price tag on the domestic policy bill passed by Republicans in the House, which was heavily backed by President Trump. Musk stated that the bill increases the budget deficit and undermines the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The legislation, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boost border security spending, but is projected to increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034. Musk also said that a bill can be big or beautiful, but perhaps not both.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered US embassies to stop scheduling appointments for student visas as it prepares to expand social media vetting of applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the pause would last “until further guidance is issued,” citing significant implications for embassies and consulates. This move comes amid Trump's ongoing feud with elite colleges, which he accuses of enabling antisemitism and upholding discriminatory admissions policies. Many institutions rely on foreign students for funding, as they often pay higher tuition fees.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as "excellent" dropped, while those reporting poor mental health increased, especially among single parents and those with uninsured children. Researchers point to factors such as high housing and childcare costs, lack of paid parental leave, and the continued burden of household responsibilities on women. Experts hope the findings will help mothers recognize they are not alone in their struggles.</p>

          <p>The remains of freelance writer Matthew Kelemen, 56, were discovered inside a container at a downtown business in Las Vegas. Police identified Kelemen’s 63-year-old roommate as the suspect in his death, but the suspect died in a car crash during a high-speed chase in Utah. Kelemen’s sister stated that her brother had been planning to move out of the residence due to unease with his roommate. Kelemen had contributed to local publications for two decades, including Las Vegas Weekly.</p>
