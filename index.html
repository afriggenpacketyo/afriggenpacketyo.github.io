          <p>The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, is refusing to resign despite being publicly ousted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Her lawyers allege she was targeted for resisting unscientific directives, particularly concerning recent changes to vaccine policy. In the wake of the announcement, three of the CDC's most senior career officials resigned in protest, citing the "weaponization of public health" and political interference. This leadership crisis unfolds amid broader changes to vaccine guidance and follows a recent shooting at the CDC's Atlanta campus.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicted Hollywood producer David Brown on 21 counts, including wire fraud and money laundering, for allegedly defrauding partners out of over $12 million. Brown, known for films like "The Fallout," is accused of diverting funds intended for film projects into a scheme to finance a lavish lifestyle. The indictment alleges he used the stolen money for luxury cars, home renovations, and surrogacy costs while concealing his fraudulent past from new investors.

          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are projected to meet the long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also highlights that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to a sharp increase in threats against members of Congress, a new bipartisan pilot program is providing lawmakers with increased funding for personal and home security. The program offers up to $20,000 for home security upgrades and $5,000 per month for hiring security personnel, running through the 2025 fiscal year. This initiative follows several high-profile incidents of political violence, including an assassination attempt on President Trump. Both Democratic and Republican representatives have expressed feeling unsafe, highlighting the need for enhanced protection in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted two employees of an Ontario, California surgery center for allegedly assaulting and interfering with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Nadine Davila face felony charges for obstructing agents who were trying to detain landscapers that had fled into the facility. The incident, captured on video, shows staffers telling agents to leave and physically intervening in the arrest. The charges reflect an aggressive prosecutorial stance on interference with federal immigration operations.</p>

          <p>A controversial immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The announcement comes after the facility, which has been visited by President Trump and is estimated to cost around $400 million, was the subject of lawsuits that successfully halted the intake of new detainees. The emptying of this center occurs as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's administration prepares to open a new immigration facility in the state called "Deportation Depot."</p>

This article argues that Cracker Barrel has always been a corporate simulation of authentic rural life, designed to capitalize on nostalgia.

          <p>Documents from the UK's data regulator reveal that Ministry of Defence (MoD) staff had been warned about the risks of sharing spreadsheets with hidden data prior to a major leak. Last month, it was revealed that an official mistakenly shared a file containing the details of nearly 19,000 Afghan resettlement applicants because the information was in a hidden tab. The 2022 breach is estimated to cost around £850 million. Internal documents from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) also show staff questioned why the MoD was not fined for the incident.</p>

          <p>China's rapid expansion in the electric vehicle (EV) market has made it a dominant force, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023. Led by companies like BYD, which has overtaken Tesla in revenue, Chinese manufacturers are leveraging government subsidies, lower costs, and a strong battery supply chain to gain global market share. This ascent has prompted regulatory scrutiny and new tariffs from the U.S. and E.U. to protect their domestic industries. Analysts predict China will produce four out of every ten cars globally by 2030, fundamentally altering the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Nvidia's strong earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the idea that the market is in an artificial intelligence bubble. He asserted that the massive AI spending by Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer noted that while Nvidia's stock dipped slightly after the report, the underlying growth is real and driven by competent industry leaders. He drew parallels to the dot-com era, suggesting that even if there is a shakeout, dominant companies will ultimately survive and thrive. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the record-equalling European loss and a chaotic start that included an early red card, Martin insisted he has no concerns about his job security and believes the team will ultimately progress and grow from the experience.</p>

          <p>In a provocative political move, California's Assembly Republican leader has proposed a "two-state solution" that would split the state, separating the liberal coastal region from the more conservative inland areas. The proposal is a direct response to a Democratic-led ballot initiative that seeks to redraw the state's congressional districts, which Republicans claim would silence rural and conservative voices. While the plan to create a new state has virtually no chance of succeeding, it serves as a powerful messaging tool for Republicans as they campaign against the redistricting measure ahead of a November special election.</p>
