          <p>A software issue caused widespread outages for Verizon customers across the United States, leaving many phones in SOS-only mode for several hours. The company acknowledged the problem and stated their engineers were working on a solution. Reports on social media and outage-tracking sites like DownDetector showed thousands of complaints, indicating a significant disruption to the network's service from coast to coast. This incident follows a similar large-scale outage the company experienced in October 2024.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a plan to rebrand the Department of Defense back to its historical name, the Department of War. White House officials state the change reflects a renewed focus on military offense and warfighting capabilities, moving away from what they term "woke ideology." President Trump argued the original name better represents the military's purpose and is associated with historical victories like World War I and II. The change would legally require an act of Congress, though the administration suggests it could also be rebranded informally.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article explores the largely unregulated for-profit "body broker" industry in the United States, which acquires, dissects, and sells human remains for profit. The piece highlights cases of exploitation, where grieving families believed they were donating loved ones' bodies to science, only to discover they were dismembered and sold without dignity. While proponents argue these brokers fill a critical need for medical research and training, critics point to a lack of oversight that allows for horrific practices and preys on vulnerable individuals. The US's loose laws have made it a global exporter of cadavers, sparking a debate on ethics and the need for stricter regulation.</p>

          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education reveal a strong correlation between student absences in the first week of school and persistent absenteeism throughout the academic year. Over half of the pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to be "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with perfect attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat what she calls a "critically high" absence level that jeopardizes children's futures. The data highlights ongoing challenges in post-pandemic school attendance.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa will not run for reelection in 2026, according to a senior GOP official familiar with her decision. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and has held several leadership positions within her party. Her departure will create an open seat, with Representative Ashley Hinson reportedly planning to run for the Republican nomination. Democrats, who have not won a Senate race in Iowa since 2008, are also lining up several candidates for what is expected to be a competitive race.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has strongly condemned reports of a potential Trump administration plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling it a secretive "invasion." Pritzker expressed concern that the president's motives extend beyond crime control, suggesting it could be a move to interfere with future elections. The statement comes amid reports that the Pentagon is drafting plans for a National Guard deployment and after President Trump criticized the city's crime rates. The White House responded by criticizing Pritzker's handling of crime in Chicago, escalating the tension between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations. As a major economic power not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Indonesia can act as a bridge between competing global powers. This unique position allows it to champion a "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation and practical solutions over confrontation. The article argues this philosophy could serve as a valuable road map for a currently dysfunctional international system that is often paralyzed by competing national interests.</p>

          <p>In response to potential federal intervention, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights and limiting the power of federal agents. The order seeks to prevent federal forces from deputizing Chicago police, demands that agents be clearly identifiable, and prohibits them from wearing masks. This largely symbolic measure directs all city departments to protect residents from federal overreach and pursue legal action if necessary. The move underscores the escalating conflict between the city's leadership and the Trump administration over crime and jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. Del Toro described the project as a "religion" for him, fulfilling a lifelong dream to bring his vision of the classic story to the screen on an epic scale. The film, which runs for 149 minutes, is split into three parts and explores the narrative from the perspectives of both the creator and the creature.

          <p>Lee Roy Jordan, a legendary linebacker for the Dallas Cowboys and a key member of the famed "Doomsday" defense, has passed away at the age of 84. Jordan was a five-time Pro Bowler who helped lead the Cowboys to their first Super Bowl victory in 1972. After a standout college career at Alabama under coach Paul "Bear" Bryant, he played his entire 14-year NFL career with Dallas, retiring as one of the franchise's all-time great defensive players. In 1989, he became the first player inducted into the team's prestigious Ring of Honor by new owner Jerry Jones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on numerous countries, deeming most of them illegal. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to implement such broad levies, stating that authority rests with Congress. This decision jeopardizes tariffs affecting a significant portion of U.S. goods imports, though sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum remain unaffected. The Trump administration has announced its intention to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article synthesizes expert advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that guidelines are linked to developmental stages. For toddlers, the consensus is "screen-free until age three," as this period is critical for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, limited and supervised screen time is recommended to avoid stunting imagination and social skills learned through play. As children get older, the focus shifts from time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, with experts warning that excessive screen use can negatively impact language skills, motor development, and social behavior.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and Council on Foreign Relations fellow Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve could threaten the central bank's crucial independence. She specifically cited the potential firing of Governor Lisa Cook as a move to install loyalists who would push for lower interest rates, regardless of economic conditions. Patterson cautioned that while markets might react positively to lower rates in the short term, politicizing the Fed could lead to higher inflation, a weaker dollar, and reduced foreign investment in the long run. This erosion of institutional integrity could have severe, lasting consequences for the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with plans to cut over 500 jobs at the Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM). The announcement was made by acting CEO Kari Lake, who stated the move was directed by the president to reduce federal bureaucracy. This action comes despite a recent federal court order that blocked the firing of VOA's director and questioned the administration's compliance with previous rulings meant to protect the broadcaster's operations. The move is seen by critics as part of an ongoing effort to dismantle the federally funded news organization.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK plan to continue their legal efforts to block the housing of asylum seekers in local hotels, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling against a similar injunction. The court overturned a temporary ban obtained by Epping Forest District Council, but the council is now considering an appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling has not deterred other councils, who argue the practice violates planning laws and creates public safety risks. The situation highlights the ongoing political and legal battles across the country surrounding the government's asylum policies and the use of hotel accommodations.</p>

After a summer of prolonged dry weather caused water levels in Aberhafesp Brook to disappear, local man Dave Lister discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking puddle. After reporting the issue to Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and receiving no immediate response, he and his friends organized a rescue effort, moving the fish to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during such conditions can be stressful for them, but the residents felt they had no other choice.</p>
