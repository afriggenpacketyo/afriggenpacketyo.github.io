          <p>A significant cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace's 'Muse' software has caused extensive travel disruptions across several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Dublin. The software, which manages check-in and baggage systems for multiple airlines, failed on Saturday, forcing staff to resort to manual processing with pen and paper. This led to hundreds of flight delays and long queues, with Brussels Airport canceling half of its departing flights on Sunday. The software's owner, RTX, acknowledged the disruption and is working to resolve the issue while national cybersecurity agencies investigate the incident.</p>

          <p>Major corporate conferences hosted by Goldman Sachs and Berenberg are highlighting a growing sense of optimism regarding Europe's economic future, particularly for Germany. Investment banks note a potential for Germany to overcome its recent economic underperformance, while London's Canary Wharf is experiencing a revival with office leasing expected to hit a decade high. This positive outlook is also mirrored in the private markets sector, with investors seeking to hedge against U.S. policy uncertainty. These developments suggest a potential comeback for European economies after several years of struggle. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite leaving her studies to accept a Thiel Fellowship and co-founding the successful company Scale AI, Guo emphasizes that higher education is invaluable for building a network. She argues that college provides a unique environment with a high concentration of intelligent people who are open to forming friendships, which can become crucial for future hiring and collaboration. This network of talented peers is one of the greatest assets a founder can have.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans football team defeated Michigan State 45-31, maintaining their undefeated record at 4-0 for the season. Wide receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, accounting for 127 receiving yards and two touchdowns, including the crucial score that sealed the win in the fourth quarter. Despite a strong offensive performance with 517 total yards, USC's victory was complicated by defensive penalties that allowed Michigan State to remain competitive.

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had run a charitable training program in the country for years, were held under harrowing conditions since February without a publicly disclosed reason. Their release followed months of lobbying by their family, who had raised concerns about their deteriorating health in detention. Upon their return, the couple expressed relief and a desire to eventually continue their humanitarian work in Afghanistan.</p>

This trend provides a new revenue stream for property developers facing cash flow shortages and project delays. The popularity of micro-dramas has surged, with viewership surpassing 660 million people and revenues overtaking the national box office for the first time in 2024.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a contentious debate has erupted on Capitol Hill and across the nation regarding the role of inflammatory political rhetoric in fostering violence.

Some Republicans accuse the left of promoting an "assassination culture," while some Democrats point to GOP attacks on free speech. The discussion highlights deep national divisions, with calls from both sides to "turn down the heat" and address the surge in political violence.</p>

This move has drawn criticism from the Israeli government and some UK conservatives, who argue it rewards terrorism.

          <p>Top Premier League clubs Arsenal and Manchester City are increasingly incorporating a more direct, long-ball style of play, a tactic traditionally associated with lower-league teams. This shift is seen as a response to the effectiveness of high-pressing defenses, which make building up play with short passes from the back riskier. By utilizing long goal-kicks and quick transitions, teams can bypass the opposition's press, gain territory, and create scoring opportunities through players like Erling Haaland and Kai Havertz. This evolution demonstrates how top managers like Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta are adapting their strategies to counter modern defensive systems.</p>

          <p>As several Western nations move to recognize a Palestinian state, analysts are debating what this diplomatic gesture will actually achieve on the ground. Supporters argue that recognition elevates Palestine's standing in international negotiations and reaffirms the right to self-determination, putting pressure on Israel. However, critics, including some Palestinian advocates, contend that it is a largely symbolic and performative act that does little to stop the ongoing war in Gaza or the expansion of Israeli settlements.

The call for accountability follows Musk's recent criticism of the act as a threat to free speech and his appearance at a far-right rally where he made controversial remarks.

The appointment follows the resignation of the previous prosecutor, Erik Siebert, who was reportedly pressured by the administration to pursue a criminal mortgage fraud case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. In a social media post, Trump openly criticized Attorney General Pam Bondi for a perceived lack of action against his political opponents, demanding that "JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!" The move to install a loyalist in a key prosecutorial role has raised concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is continuing to strengthen over the central Atlantic. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it will become a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters, passing east of Bermuda on Monday. As of Saturday night, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and was moving northwest. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, distant swells from Gabrielle are forecast to reach the U.S. East Coast and Atlantic Canada early next week.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Find Evidence of Recent Moonquakes Triggering Landslides</h2>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered evidence of recent landslide activity on the moon, likely triggered by moonquakes. By comparing high-resolution images taken since 2009, researchers identified 41 new landslides, challenging the long-held belief that the moon is geologically dormant. The findings, published in the National Science Review, have significant implications for future lunar missions and the establishment of permanent bases on the moon. This discovery suggests that geological hazards from seismic activity must be considered in the planning and construction of any lunar infrastructure.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed the "No Secret Police Act," a new law that prohibits on-duty federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings. The legislation, which also requires officers to be identifiable by name and badge number, is a direct response to ongoing federal immigration enforcement operations in the state. Proponents of the bill argue it is a necessary measure to resist what they call a "terror campaign" by masked officers. However, federal officials have stated that Newsom has no jurisdiction over their operations and that agents will continue to protect their identities.</p>
