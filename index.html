          <p>At least 37 people have been killed and approximately 50 wounded in southern Syria following violent clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and the Druze community in the city of Sweida. The conflict, reportedly sparked by a series of kidnappings, represents a significant escalation of long-running tensions in the region. This violence occurs as the new post-Assad government struggles to maintain security and protect minority rights, highlighting the country's fragile state and the persistent threat of sectarian strife.</p>

          <p>Australia is enhancing its strategic partnership with the Philippines through increased investment in a civil maritime cooperation program, which includes vessel donations, training, and educational scholarships. This move aims to bolster regional security and is part of a broader effort to deepen diplomatic relations ahead of their 80th anniversary in 2026. The strengthening ties reflect a strategic balancing act, as Australia continues to manage its significant trade relationship with China while reinforcing its defense alliances in the region.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology-focused majors like information technology and vehicle engineering over previously popular fields such as international trade. This trend is driven by a state-led push to bolster technological self-sufficiency amid intensified competition with the United States. The academic priorities of a new generation are aligning with national industrial development goals, reshaping the landscape of university programs and future career paths in the country.</p>

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) has reported a significant increase in prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground, reaching the highest level in six years with 3,691 cases in 2024-25. Alongside prosecutions, TfL issued over 13,000 penalty fare notices as part of a broader crackdown on fare dodging, which it states costs Londoners vital investment. The agency has committed to reducing the fare evasion rate and is expanding its enforcement teams to target prolific offenders across the network.</p>
