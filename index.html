          <h2>NTSB Finds Overweight Plane and Drag from Moose Antlers Caused Fatal Alaskan Crash</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 07:39:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board concluded its investigation into a 2023 plane crash in Alaska that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., the husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The report determined the primary causes were the aircraft being overweight from a load of moose meat and added drag from a set of moose antlers attached to the wing strut. Turbulent weather conditions also contributed to the accident, which occurred in a remote area near St. Mary's. The NTSB noted that carrying antlers externally is common in Alaska but requires FAA approval, which this plane lacked, and that the combination of factors made the crash tragically unavoidable.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, who is serving a prison sentence for the 1989 murders of his parents, has been hospitalized with a "serious medical condition," according to his lawyer. Menendez was transferred from a San Diego prison to an external medical facility, where he is reported to be in fair condition. This development comes just weeks before he and his brother, Lyle, are scheduled for a parole hearing on August 21. The brothers were recently resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole, after a judge found they no longer posed an unreasonable risk if released.</p>

This initiative aims to modernize the $7.1 trillion money market industry by increasing transaction efficiency and reducing friction. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity have already signed on to the project. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for institutional investors to park cash and paving the way for a real-time, digital financial ecosystem.

          <p>A coalition of 115 international aid organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam, has issued a joint statement warning of "mass starvation" in Gaza. The groups accuse the Israeli government's siege of causing the crisis through restrictions and delays on aid, leading to chaos and death. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, dozens have died from famine and malnutrition in recent days, with children and the elderly facing record rates of acute malnutrition. The statement highlights the desperation, noting that some aid workers are now joining food lines and children express a desire to go to heaven for food.</p>

          <p>The U.S. special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, is set to travel to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. According to officials, indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent Israeli proposal that includes a new map for potential IDF withdrawal zones. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough that could lead to a 60-day ceasefire and the release of hostages. A key sticking point remains the presence of Israeli troops in a southern Gaza corridor during any truce.</p>

D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson suggested that previous opposition was more related to former owner Dan Snyder than the name itself. Trump had posted on Truth Social that the team should "IMMEDIATELY" revert to its old name and threatened to block a stadium deal if they did not. Current team owner Josh Harris has previously stated the organization is moving forward with the Commanders name and not looking back.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest-rate rigging quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among 19 traders jailed in the UK and US for manipulating the Libor and Euribor benchmark rates, which affect global borrowing costs. The court ruled that errors in jury direction during their original trials made the convictions unsafe, vindicating the traders who argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what they claimed were normal commercial practices. The Serious Fraud Office, which brought the original case, stated it will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, a woman convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off part of her attacker's tongue during a sexual assault. At 19, Choi was given a suspended sentence for what the court at the time deemed an act that "exceeded the reasonable bounds of legally permissible self-defense." Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now in her 80s, successfully petitioned for a retrial to clear her name after 61 years. In a significant turn, the prosecution at the new hearing has asked the court to acquit her, with a final verdict expected in September.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Russia to speed up negotiations, while the Kremlin maintains that the two sides remain "diametrically opposed" and that no breakthroughs are expected. Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russia, threatening "severe" penalties and shifting U.S. policy to endorse weapons sales to Ukraine. Moscow analysts suggest the Kremlin is reacting cautiously, believing U.S. support for Ukraine will ultimately diminish regardless.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the controversial appointment of David Geier by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to investigate the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink. The piece details the history of Geier and his late father, who were sanctioned for promoting an unproven autism treatment and had their access to the CDC database revoked in the 2000s for unauthorized research. Experts have criticized the Geiers' published work for containing fundamental statistical errors that render their conclusions invalid. Geier's appointment raises concerns that he will use his government position to resurrect debunked claims about vaccine harms.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges that he condoned a criminal offense through satirical social media posts made after last year's assassination attempt on Donald Trump. The prosecution had argued his posts, including one finding it "absolutely fantastic when fascists die," constituted hate crimes and called for a fine. However, the judge ruled the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and did not have the intention of disturbing public order or inciting crime, affirming the importance of debate in a liberal democracy.</p>

The Reform UK councillor, who still lives at home, stepped into the role after his predecessor resigned for health reasons. Finch has dismissed criticism about his lack of life experience as "ageist," stating that his appointment shows that Reform UK operates on a merit-based system. He said he was inspired to enter politics by a desire to counter what he calls "socialist wokeism" in education and has already used his influence to promote British culture in local schools.</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a Royal Navy frigate that fought in the American War of Independence. Originally named HMS Hind and built in 1749, the vessel later had a second life as an Arctic whaling ship before it was wrecked in a storm in 1788. Archaeologists and local researchers used dendrochronology and archival records to identify the ship. The community-led effort successfully recovered the 12-ton oak timbers, which are now being preserved with plans for a permanent public display on the island.</p>

          <p>Tributes are pouring in from the music world for Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, who has died at the age of 76. His family announced his passing on Tuesday, just weeks after the band's farewell concert in their hometown of Birmingham. Bandmates Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler expressed their sorrow, while artists like Metallica and Henry Rollins hailed him as a hero and pioneer of the genre. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's wild stage persona and influential music career were later contrasted by his portrayal as a lovable patriarch on the reality show "The Osbournes."</p>

          <p>Relations between the European Union and China have deteriorated ahead of a high-stakes summit in Beijing, with prospects for resolving trade disputes appearing slim. The EU is frustrated by a €400 billion trade deficit, restrictive Chinese market access, and a flood of subsidized Chinese electric vehicles. Further tensions arise from China's export curbs on rare earth minerals and its tacit support for Russia, which led to recent EU sanctions against Chinese firms. Despite the friction, some analysts believe the EU has an opportunity to press for concessions, as China faces its own trade pressures from the United States.</p>

Police discovered the body of a 27-year-old woman and determined it was a homicide. Authorities confirmed the victim and suspect knew each other and it was not a random act of violence.</p>

The judge granted the unusual sentence after a psychological assessment concluded she was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time, having been recently homeless and financially stressed.
