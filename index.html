          <p>Authorities apprehended Vance Luther Boelter on Sunday, the suspect in the Saturday killing of Minnesota Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in what was called a "politically motivated assassination." Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack on Saturday morning, with the couple in stable condition as of Sunday evening. Authorities located what they believe to be the suspect's vehicle in Sibley County, Minnesota, about an hour outside of Minneapolis. The governor stated "We got him" after the arrest, marking the end of a manhunt. Optimism is tempered by the tragic loss of life and the politically motivated nature of the crime. The apprehension of the suspect provides some relief and a sense of justice being served. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to return as a pitcher on Tuesday against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB pitching appearance since August 2023.

However, injuries to the Dodgers' bullpen accelerated his return, and Ohtani is expected to pitch short innings at Dodger Stadium. Ohtani demonstrated strong batting performance on Sunday, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a win against the San Francisco Giants, adding to the anticipation for his pitching return.

          <p>Shared ownership schemes, intended as a stepping stone to property ownership, are facing increasing criticism due to rising complaints about repairs, costs, and difficulties in selling. Many shared owners report feeling trapped, lacking the rights of homeowners while bearing the obligations of renters, with complaints to the housing ombudsman increasing nearly 400% in the past five years. Shared owners face challenges such as escalating service charges, lengthy repair times, and complexities in dealing with multiple involved companies. The Housing Ombudsman and campaign groups are calling for greater transparency, improved communication, and government intervention to address fundamental inequities in the shared ownership system. </p>

          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate surrounding the assisted dying bill, which would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives in England and Wales.

Hospices, largely funded by charity, face funding shortages, raising concerns about the resources available for end-of-life care if the bill passes. Staff express uncertainty about the impact on their services, emphasizing the importance of informed choices for patients regarding both assisted dying and palliative care. </p>

This convergence is evident in areas such as migration, climate, and civil society, weakening Europe's ability to respond to global threats.
