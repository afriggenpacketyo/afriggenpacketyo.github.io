          <p>A 19-year-old Indonesian gymnast, Naufal Takdir Al Bari, died following a severe neck injury sustained during a high bar training accident in Russia. Al Bari, who had Olympic aspirations for 2028 and was preparing for this year's World Championships, spent 12 days in intensive care before his passing. An investigation by the Russian Gymnastics Federation concluded that the athlete was ill-prepared for the complex element he attempted. The Indonesian Gymnastics Federation expressed deep sorrow, mourning the loss of a talented young figure.</p>

          <p>Tech mogul Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David Ellison, are significantly expanding their influence in the US media landscape, pursuing deals for major companies like TikTok and CNN. Larry Ellison's fortune has surged to $370 billion, partly due to AI infrastructure, and his ties with former President Donald Trump have reportedly facilitated these acquisitions. David Ellison's Skydance recently took over Paramount, including CBS, and the family is reportedly eyeing Warner Brothers Discovery. These moves are raising concerns about media concentration and potential political influence, with some lawmakers calling for scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Thousands marched in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to demand justice for three young women—Morena Verdi, Brenda Del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez—whose torture and murders were reportedly broadcast live on social media. The victims' bodies were found buried five days after their disappearance, with investigators linking the triple femicide to drug gangs. Officials believe the livestream, watched by 45 members, was a "punishment" and "warning" for breaking gang rules. Five suspects have been arrested, though the alleged Peruvian mastermind remains at large. Instagram's parent company, Meta, has disputed that the livestream occurred on its platform.</p>

Simultaneously, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek and Portland officials have rejected Trump's order to deploy federal troops to the city, calling it a "threat" and unnecessary, as police report no uptick in violent unrest. Trump had authorized "Full Force" to protect ICE facilities from "antifa" and "domestic terrorists," following a presidential memorandum on cracking down on organized political violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi also announced the deployment of DOJ agents to safeguard ICE facilities nationwide.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on the science behind foul-smelling shoes and their impact on shoe rack design. Their research, initially aimed at designing better shoe racks for students, uncovered that bacterial growth (Kytococcus sedentarius) was the primary cause of odor. Experiments showed that a short blast of UVC light could effectively kill these microbes and eliminate the smell. The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack, earning recognition from the quirky scientific award for making people "laugh, then think."</p>

          <p>Europe holds a commanding 11½-4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day's 12 singles matches at the Ryder Cup, needing just three points to secure victory. Captain Luke Donald is on the verge of becoming only the second European captain to win both home and away matches. No team has ever overcome a deficit larger than 10-6, making a US comeback statistically improbable. This lead marks Europe's largest ever before the singles matches, surpassing their 2004 Oakland Hills advantage. Despite Donald's cautious remarks, the team is well-positioned to claim their fifth away win.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has reached a confidential settlement with Dominion Voting Systems in their $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit concerning his baseless claims of 2020 election rigging.

This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion reached with Fox News and Newsmax. The lawsuit is one of several legal and financial setbacks for Giuliani, who has also been disbarred and ordered to pay $148 million to defamed Georgia election workers.</p>

The rivalry, reportedly stemming from a 2001 cocaine theft, has seen multiple murders and brutal assaults over the decades.

Despite his dominant individual form this year, Scheffler's authority dissolved in the team format, where his usually magnificent ball-striking was undermined by fragile putting. The article suggests that his detached mindset, an asset in stroke play, may be a liability in the intense team crucible of the Ryder Cup.

This analysis posits that Trump views professional disapproval as validation, reinforcing his image as a challenger of conventions. From international forums like the UN to domestic issues, he consistently projects an image of being above normal political, legal, or diplomatic consequences. His reaction to James Comey's indictment, framing it as vindication, further supports the idea that he believes his enemies fall while he survives, solidifying his "untouchable" political persona.</p>

          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic. While some users report positive results like brighter skin and stronger hair, consultant dermatologists express skepticism about oral collagen's ability to reach and impact skin cells directly. Collagen is a large molecule that needs to be broken down into peptides to be absorbed, and even then, its targeted delivery to the skin is uncertain. Experts recommend marine collagen over vegan options and suggest that sunblock, a healthy diet, and stopping smoking offer far greater benefits for skin health than supplements.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of US troops to Portland, Oregon, and authorized "full force" if necessary, to suppress protests targeting immigration detention centers. Trump claimed the move was to protect ICE facilities from "Antifa and other domestic terrorists." This announcement has drawn strong opposition from Democratic lawmakers and Oregon's Governor Tina Kotek, who called it an "abuse of power" and unnecessary. The Department of Homeland Security previously stated that Portland's ICE facility had been repeatedly attacked, leading to federal charges against protesters. Legal experts question the designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization due to First Amendment concerns.</p>

          <p>Major Hurricane Humberto, currently north of the Caribbean, could potentially interact with a developing tropical depression nearby, possibly leading to the rare Fujiwhara effect. This meteorological phenomenon involves two storms merging or spinning around a common center. While unlikely to result in a full gravitational "dance" due to Humberto's greater strength and distance from the weaker system, a slight alteration in their forecast paths is possible. Humberto has strengthened to a Category 5 hurricane and is expected to move northwest, passing west of Bermuda, while the second system, Tropical Depression Nine, is forecast to become Tropical Storm Imelda and track towards the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted an AI-generated cartoon image on Truth Social depicting himself firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, continuing his criticism of Powell's monetary policy. Trump has repeatedly labeled Powell "Too Late Powell" for his cautious approach to interest rate cuts, despite a recent reduction. Firing a Fed chair would be an unprecedented move, and a recent Supreme Court decision suggests the president lacks the authority to remove Fed officials at will. The financial markets have shown little reaction to these threats, though economists warn that such an action could undermine Fed independence and cause long-term interest rates to rise.

The National Hurricane Center reports Humberto is moving west at 10 mph with sustained winds of 160 mph and is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days. Swells generated by the storm are anticipated to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast starting Monday. Additionally, Tropical Depression Nine, near Humberto, is expected to strengthen into a named tropical storm, bringing significant rainfall and flooding risks to Cuba and the Bahamas before approaching the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>
