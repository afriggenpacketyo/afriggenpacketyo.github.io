          <p>President Donald Trump has privately expressed his frustration with Supreme Court justices he appointed, particularly Amy Coney Barrett, because he believes they are not sufficiently supporting his agenda. Several Trump allies have also criticized Barrett, with some labeling her as "weak". Trump is reportedly seeking to nominate judges in the mold of Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas, and Antonin Scalia in the future. Despite private complaints, Trump has publicly defended Barrett in the past.</p>

Morales-Reyes was arrested outside a Milwaukee school after dropping off his daughter, but the investigation revealed that the letters were not written by him.

          <p>Court documents reveal that three sisters from Wenatchee, Washington, likely died of asphyxiation. The girls were reported missing after a visit with their father, Travis Decker, who is currently being sought by law enforcement. Zip ties and plastic bags were found in the area where Decker's truck was located, and the truck had what appeared to be bloody handprints. The documents also suggest that the murders may have been premeditated, based on cellphone records indicating Decker visited the area prior to picking up the girls.</p>

          <p>Labor groups and elected officials are advocating for a minimum wage of at least $25 an hour in Los Angeles County. The campaign aims to address the steep increase in the cost of living, with advocates arguing that a person living in L.A. County needs to earn around $28 an hour to cover basic expenses. The proposal is expected to face opposition from business groups, who warn that it could lead to closures and job losses. The campaign has the backing of L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, who supports an across-the-board minimum wage increase.</p>
