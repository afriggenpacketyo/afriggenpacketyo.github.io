          <h2>USAID Lawyers Investigate Employees for Media Contact Amidst Downsizing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 21:50:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is hiring lawyers to investigate employees for "unauthorized communications with the media," following mass firings led by Elon Musk and DOGE. This move is seen as an attempt to intimidate workers who object to the downsizing, with employees receiving emails about "administrative inquiry" for speaking to the press. Critics argue this action infringes on constitutional rights, as employees believed they had already lost their jobs when speaking out. Federal workers are generally prohibited from doing interviews with the press without agency permission. </p>

The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings and then to the governor's office, with relatives expressing hope for their release.

Ventura also detailed so-called "freak-offs" where she was forced to have sex with male escorts while Combs watched, leading her to feel "worthless." She claimed she used drugs to cope with these encounters, which prosecutors are using to build a case of sex trafficking against Combs. </p>

          <p>Victims of the Palisades and Eaton fires in Los Angeles are now facing a 17% emergency rate hike from State Farm, approved by state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. This decision has sparked outrage among homeowners who claim State Farm is mishandling their claims, with many reporting delays, denials, and lowball offers. Consumer advocates criticize Lara for prioritizing the insurance industry over policyholders, especially given the increased fire danger in California. Some customers feel State Farm has not been a good neighbor and has not met its obligations in handling claims. </p>

          <p>Kansas City is implementing a new strategy to address its homeless crisis, aiming for "functional zero" by ensuring anyone who becomes homeless is back on their feet within 30 days. The plan involves coordinating resources from churches, aid organizations, and shelters to provide comprehensive support, including housing and addressing core issues like addiction and mental health. Homelessness prevention coordinator Josh Henges believes the current system is uncoordinated, and the new approach seeks to align resources to help people transition out of homelessness more effectively. Smoke and Serena, formerly homeless, are getting a new home through a federal voucher program. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would lift U.S. sanctions on Syria, offering an economic boost to the war-torn country, after speaking with Saudi Arabia’s crown prince. The decision came as Trump was expected to meet with Syria’s new president, Ahmed al-Shara, in Saudi Arabia. Trump cited a desire to give the new Syrian government a chance to stabilize the country and keep peace. The move was praised by Syria's foreign minister, who called it a new beginning for reconstruction. </p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details how former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s aides quashed concerns about his age and mental acuity during his time in the White House. The book describes instances where Biden forgot names of longtime aides and allies, appeared frail in meetings, and confused details during discussions. Despite these observations, few Biden allies would openly speak about his decline, highlighting the enduring chill within the Democratic Party regarding the issue. Aides are reportedly seeking to shift the blame for Biden's shortcomings onto his inner circle. </p>

          <p>GOP lawmakers, led by Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Mary Miller, are targeting online pornography with the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which aims to criminalize the transmission of obscene content across state lines. The bill seeks to clarify the definition of obscenity, replacing subjective standards with practical ones to make it easier to prosecute offenders. The IODA defines obscenity as material that appeals to prurient interests in nudity, sex, or excretion and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The bill also removes the "intent" requirement, prohibiting transmission regardless of intent. </p>
