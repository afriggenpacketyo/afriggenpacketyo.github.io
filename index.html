          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on imported cars and parts will likely lead to higher vehicle prices for consumers.  Experts predict significant price increases, potentially exceeding $10,000 for some models, impacting both new and used car markets.  The policy's details remain unclear, but its broad scope suggests a widespread impact on the auto industry.</p>

The order prevents the deportation of alleged gang members to El Salvador without due process.
