          <h2>SpaceX's Starship Experiences Uncontrolled Re-entry After Test Flight</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, experienced an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere after its ninth uncrewed test flight. Contact was lost with the upper stage of the rocket, which then leaked fuel and spun out of control. The likely cause of the loss of control was a propellant leak or engine failure in the upper stage. SpaceX considers the test a success due to the data collected, which will help improve Starship's reliability for future interplanetary travel, with the ultimate goal of making life multiplanetary. The spacecraft likely disintegrated over the Indian Ocean.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics reveals that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, contributing significantly to the rise in the national unemployment rate. The unemployment rate for recent graduates aged 22-27 is nearing 6%, surpassing the national average, with a mismatch between graduates' fields of study and current business demands being a key factor. The tech sector, which previously experienced rapid hiring, has seen a slowdown, impacting job prospects for computer science graduates, and automation and artificial intelligence are also affecting lower-level positions. Economic uncertainty and tariffs further contribute to the challenges faced by recent graduates (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge will allow prosecutors to downgrade charges against Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was convicted of using excessive force, to a misdemeanor. This decision comes after a controversial move by the U.S. Attorney to offer Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal, which led to multiple federal prosecutors resigning. While the judge rejected the original plea deal, he granted the motion to lessen the charges, meaning Kirk could still face jail time, despite the jury's felony conviction.

Factors contributing to this decline may include high housing costs, increasing child care expenses, and the lack of national paid parental leave.
