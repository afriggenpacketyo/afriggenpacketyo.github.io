          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly advised President Donald Trump to decline the $400 million jet offered as a gift from the Qatari royal family, citing significant national security concerns. Pence emphasized Qatar's history of 'playing both sides' and argued that accepting such a gift would compromise U.S. intelligence and security protocols. Trump's intentions to accept the Boeing 747-8, intended for conversion into Air Force One, have stirred considerable controversy regarding legality, ethics, and national security implications. Pence suggested that if Qatar wishes to make a contribution, they should invest the funds in U.S. military base infrastructure instead of a lavish aircraft. </p>

          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in two deaths and multiple injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before drifting into the bridge, causing its masts to break apart and leaving sailors dangling. Bridge inspectors found no immediate structural damage, but police urged people to avoid the area, and the NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate the incident. Witnesses reported hearing a loud crunch followed by screams, and the ship was en route from Cozumel, Mexico, to Iceland after arriving in New York on May 13. </p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a $258.4 billion budget surplus in April, marking the second-largest monthly surplus in U.S. history, driven by substantial individual tax deposits. Despite this, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains over $1 trillion due to ongoing government spending. The surplus was largely attributed to final payments on prior-year taxes and the first installment of quarterly estimated taxes from individuals and businesses, and the article discusses ways to improve personal finances by cutting spending and creating passive income. </p>
