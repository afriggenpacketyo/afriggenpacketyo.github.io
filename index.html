          <p>Elon Musk has announced the end of his time as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, thanking President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's departure comes as his 130-day appointment limit nears its end, a limit imposed on special government employees, and he has been critical of Trump's recent budget bill. Musk has stated that the DOGE mission will continue to strengthen throughout the government, even with his exit from the administration. The White House will begin Musk's off-boarding process, marking the end of his official role in the administration.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is closing its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) office, known as the Institute Community and Equity Office (ICEO), following a comprehensive assessment that began nearly 18 months ago. MIT President Sally Kornbluth emphasized that the university's success depends on attracting talented people from every background and ensuring everyone feels welcome and supported. The decision to eliminate the ICEO and the role of vice president for equity and inclusion comes after MIT scrapped diversity pledges in its hiring and admissions processes.

          <p>With negotiations to end the war in Ukraine faltering, the Trump administration is focusing on the Middle East, seeking to broker deals and fulfill President Trump's promise to be a global peacemaker. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced a potential temporary truce in Gaza, which could lead to a peaceful resolution. U.S. officials believe the terms of the new proposal for ensuring talks continue after an initial hostage release and ceasefire would appeal to both parties. Trump has also taken a harsher stance towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, advising against striking Iranian nuclear facilities, as the administration aims to broker a nuclear agreement with Iran.</p>

          <p>President Trump has commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences in federal prison. Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 while already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges for a 1973 murder. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude to President Trump for delivering justice, emphasizing Hoover's rehabilitation despite the courts' unwillingness to consider it. While the federal sentence has been commuted, Hoover still faces the remainder of his state sentence in Illinois.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, delivering a blow to a major tenet of his economic agenda. The court determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling, arguing that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled America's trade deficits, creating a national emergency. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield called the ruling a victory for working families, small businesses, and everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed plans to bolster advanced manufacturing, which could put China on a collision course with the Trump administration's trade goals. Trump wants China to address trade imbalances and has criticized Beijing for providing state subsidies to Chinese companies. Experts warn that China's push to expand its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in high-tech sectors, runs counter to the Trump administration's core demands in ongoing trade talks. Despite the support, China has missed several key targets from its ten-year plan, including those for aerospace and high-end robots, and fostered unhealthy industrial competition that worsened global trade tensions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested limiting the number of international students at Harvard to create more spots for American students. His comments came in response to the Department of Homeland Security's recent move to revoke the school's ability to enroll foreign students, a decision challenged by the college in court. Trump expressed concern that about one-fourth of Harvard's student body is international, and he wants to ensure that foreign students "love our country." The State Department has halted interviews abroad with foreign citizens applying for student visas, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the Trump administration would begin revoking student visas for Chinese citizens.</p>

          <p>California has joined 15 other states in a lawsuit against the National Science Foundation (NSF), alleging the agency illegally terminated millions of dollars in grants and imposed new fees that have crippled vital research. The lawsuit targets the NSF for terminating grants for scientific research that seeks to promote and understand diversity in higher education and the workforce. The suit also seeks to overturn the Trump administrationâ€™s cap on indirect costs related to research, which universities say are critical to carrying out their work. The lawsuit highlights the potential loss of billions of dollars in research funding across California's university systems.</p>

The court also blocked levies imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada in response to the flow of drugs and illegal immigrants into the US. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal, while White House officials maintain that it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.</p>

          <p>A limo company is accused of taking thousands of dollars from a nonprofit organization, Alice's Kids, meant to provide prom transportation for young Eaton fire survivors, and then failing to provide the service. Students at Marshall Fundamental Secondary School, many of whom lost their homes in the January fire, were left without a ride on prom night. Alice's Kids is demanding a full refund and is prepared to pursue legal avenues to ensure accountability. The students were able to attend prom after parents arranged for Ubers, but they missed a scheduled professional photo shoot.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is revising visa criteria to "enhance scrutiny" of all future applications from China, including Hong Kong. This move is expected to cause anxiety across university campuses in the United States, as many universities rely on Chinese and other international students paying full tuition. Rubio also announced that the State Department would not give visas to foreign officials who engage in the censorship of the speech of American citizens.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided strong guidance, but the market response was muted due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Revenue in its fiscal 2026 first quarter rose 8% year over year to $9.83 billion, topping expectations, and adjusted earnings per share beat consensus estimates. The company is seeing progress on AI, with the combined annual recurring revenue for Data Cloud and Agentforce exceeding $1 billion. Salesforce also announced its acquisition of Informatica, which is expected to strengthen Data Cloud and its overall AI strategy, but the benefits are not expected to be fully realized until 2027.

          <p>A U.S. judge has stated that the Trump administrationâ€™s bid to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and pro-Palestinian activist, is likely unconstitutional. Judge Michael Farbiarz wrote that the governmentâ€™s justification for removing Khalil, based on his beliefs posing a threat to U.S. foreign policy, could lead to arbitrary enforcement. However, the judge did not order Khalil's release, citing unresolved issues with his residency application. Khalil's attorneys argue his detention is part of an attempt to suppress free speech, as he has been detained for nearly 12 weeks and missed the birth of his first child.</p>

          <p>Pedestrian deaths have surged 78% in the past 15 years, partly due to the rising size and weight of vehicles like SUVs and trucks, which create large blind zones and require longer braking distances. Over the past three decades, the average passenger vehicle has gotten heavier and taller. Demonstrations highlight the danger of blind spots in front of larger vehicles, making it difficult for drivers to see pedestrians, especially small children. While the popularity of large vehicles is unlikely to change, automakers have started repositioning front cameras lower, which may help drivers see pedestrians.</p>

Experts criticized the decision, arguing that it puts the lives and health of Americans at risk and makes the country less prepared for a potential influenza pandemic.
