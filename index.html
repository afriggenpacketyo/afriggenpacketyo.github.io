          <p>A federal judge in Texas has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to deport a Venezuelan couple with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), citing a lack of evidence. The judge accused the government of falsely claiming the couple had ties to a terrorist organization.  The couple's attorneys argued that their TPS status should have protected them from detention, and they were subsequently released. This ruling highlights concerns about due process in deportation proceedings.</p>
