          <p>A 14-year-old girl has been sentenced to 15 years in detention after stabbing two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Carmarthenshire, Wales, last April. The girl, who cannot be named, was found guilty of attempted murder after a second trial. During the attack, she repeatedly stabbed teachers Fiona Elias and Liz Hopkin, and a 14-year-old pupil, while shouting threats. The judge emphasized the lack of remorse and the attention-seeking nature of the crime, as the teachers suffered significant injuries and emotional distress. The school went into lockdown following the stabbings. Optimism score should be 0 because there was no human life saved from within the plane itself, and there was collateral damage of human life outside the plane.</p>

          <p>An op-ed discusses the increasing accessibility of private equity (PE) to retail investors due to SEC regulatory changes. While PE offers the allure of diversification and higher returns, it poses significant risks for retail investors who may lack the financial sophistication to navigate its complexities. The author warns that retail investors are often targeted to fill capacity with less desirable opportunities compared to institutional players. Further, the opaque nature of private equity and limited liquidity can lead to severe consequences if investors need to liquidate during a downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

After numerous sightings, volunteers dedicated over 1,000 hours to the search and eventually lured Valerie into a crate using her owner's scent. She has been safely returned to her family.</p>
