            <p>Wera Hobhouse, a Liberal Democrat MP for Bath, was denied entry to Hong Kong, which she believes was an attempt to silence her due to her involvement with the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (Ipac), a group critical of Beijing's human rights record. Despite having visited Hong Kong regularly since 2019, she was detained at the airport, questioned for five hours, and then deported without a clear explanation. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has promised to raise the issue with authorities, while Lib Dem Leader Sir Ed Davey is calling for the Chinese ambassador to be summoned to address the situation. Hobhouse says she experienced huge amount of solidarity from 'very worried' MPs.</p>

            <p>In a recent interview, Dr. Peter Marks, the former head of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, criticized the HHS Secretary's handling of the measles outbreak and his views on vaccine safety and efficacy. Dr. Marks emphasized the safety and importance of the MMR vaccine, urging parents to vaccinate their children to prevent potentially fatal consequences. He also expressed frustration over what he perceives as the Secretary's undermining of science and spreading of misinformation regarding vaccines, which he believes endangers public health. Dr. Marks stated that his former colleagues cannot directly answer a question and endorse a vaccine, right now.</p>

            <p>Chinese officials are urging the US to completely eliminate its reciprocal tariffs as the trade war between the two countries continues. This week, Trump announced a 90-day pause for a host of global tariffs he had planned, but increased levies on Chinese imports to 145%. While acknowledging the US's exemption of some technological products as a "small step", China's commerce ministry reiterated its call for mutual respect and a return to dialogue.

Supply chain executives are reporting canceled freight orders and abandoned freight from China. Stephen Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said the sudden policy changes and high tariffs are disrupting supply chains at a level not seen since the pandemic.</p>
