          <p>Senior officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security convened conference calls with governors and law enforcement across the U.S. to address the threat environment following U.S. missile strikes in Iran. While there is no specific intelligence indicating a direct threat to the U.S. homeland, the FBI will enhance its posture by increasing personnel in offices and intensifying intelligence monitoring. Officials urged governors to be vigilant for increased cyber activity and potential risks to Jewish institutions or groups associated with Israel. The Secure Community Network (SCN) reported a surge in violent posts targeting the Jewish community on social media following the U.S. action, highlighting the elevated risk Jewish institutions face. Optimism in this scenario is diminished by the increase in potential threats to American citizens. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department initially posted condolences on social media for the "tragic" U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, but later amended and deleted the post. The original message stated the department was closely monitoring the situation with local, state, and federal partners. Stop Antisemitism criticized the initial post, asserting there were no victims in the successful targeting of Iran's nuclear sites. The U.S. military conducted strikes targeting nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan in Operation Midnight Hammer; the Trump administration has described the strikes as a success in degrading Tehran's nuclear weapon capabilities. The department's actions reflect the sensitivity and potential for misinterpretation surrounding the U.S. military operation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Judge Barbara Holmes stated the government failed to prove Abrego Garcia was a flight risk, but acknowledged he would likely be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody instead. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. The defense argues the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in Abrego Garcia's case; another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release. Despite the judge's ruling, Abrego Garcia's immediate future remains uncertain due to the likelihood of ICE intervention.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials provided details about the U.S. operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. Gen. Dan Caine stated the mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" on targets at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The operation included a complex maneuver with in-flight refuelings, fighter jet escorts, and the deployment of Tomahawk cruise missiles. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or people. The U.S. has warned Iran against retaliatory action, stating that forces remain on high alert and are prepared to respond to any attacks.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies, known for investing in high-risk environments, are facing escalating risks in their African ventures, particularly in conflict-ridden nations. These risks include geopolitical instability, political unrest, abrupt policy changes, and security threats. Chinese firms are paying a high price, evident in attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of workers, and hijackings of vessels. President Xi Jinping has called for severe punishment for those behind attacks on Chinese nationals, reflecting the severity of these threats. Despite these challenges, Chinese companies continue to pursue mineral and oil interests in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, and Sudan.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, President Trump addressed the issue of regime change in Iran, applying his "Make America Great Again" rhetoric to the Middle East. In a post on Truth Social, Trump questioned why there wouldn't be a regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." During his presidential campaign, Trump promised "no more wars," but recent global events have altered his views. He deemed the bombing of Iranian nuclear sites "a spectacular military success," claiming key nuclear enrichment facilities have been "completely and totally obliterated."</p>

The injured staff member was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries; police are investigating the motive behind the shooting, and there appears to be no connection between the man and the church.

Fu Cong urged the international community to uphold justice and work towards restoring peace and stability. While other Security Council members broadly supported ending the conflict, divisions emerged along geopolitical lines, with China and Russia defending Iran, and the U.S. and its allies defending Israel.</p>

China's decisions on leasing pandas are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks, and experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese leader to Japan. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between China and Japan, bringing economic benefits as tourist attractions. With tensions between China and the U.S., a new panda loan could serve to stabilize relations with Tokyo, though its diplomatic weight may not be as significant as in the past.</p>

Researchers emphasize the lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models as contributing factors.

To evaluate risks, practices like red teaming, where individuals test AI systems for potential harm, are recommended.

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Cooperation in Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests using specific phrases to encourage cooperation in children. Traditional parenting phrases that involve threats or harsh consequences often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the expert recommends using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries, fostering a sense of safety and involvement. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying "Because I said so," and focusing on problem-solving instead of blame; these shifts aim to create conditions where cooperation feels natural and reduce power struggles.</p>

          <h2>Is Surveillance Culture Contributing to Child Cyberstalking?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:55:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that children as young as 10 and 11 have been reported to police for suspected cyberstalking offences, raising concerns about the impact of surveillance culture. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips emphasizes the need to educate young people about healthy relationships in the digital age. Cyberstalking involves using digital tools to harass or spread false information, and charities note that constant online monitoring is becoming normalized from a young age. Charlotte Hooper, a victim of cyberstalking, believes the normalization of digital surveillance is fueling concerning behaviors; experts suggest clear communication about consent and digital safety are essential.</p>

NHS England is implementing a phased approach to reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. The medication, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, makes individuals feel fuller, thus reducing food intake; it is to be offered to people with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 if from a minority ethnic background) and specific health conditions. Some GP practices are warning ineligible patients against booking appointments to discuss the jabs, while pharmacy trade organizations express concern that demand will exceed supply.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling it a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the goal of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity. Trump warned Iran against retaliating, stating that any retaliation would be met with far greater force. Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 Spirit bombers were used in the strikes. The U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically to state that regime change efforts are not planned; the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency stated that there was no increase in off-site radiation levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the nation, describing the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites as a "spectacular military success" and warning of more attacks if Iran does not "make peace." The strikes targeted sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, which Trump claimed have been "completely and totally obliterated." He stated the objective was to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran. Iran's Atomic Energy Organization confirmed the strikes but said it would not stop Iran from advancing its nuclear program. The U.S. alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, and Netanyahu praised Trump for conducting the strikes; the situation remains tense, with potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a crucial global trade passage connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. In 2024, over a quarter of global maritime oil trade flowed through the Strait, making it a vital oil "chokepoint." Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that an Iranian effort to block the strait would be a "suicidal move" that would likely trigger backlash from powerful countries. The U.S. has long pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the UK government has made it clear that while it was informed in advance, it did not participate in the action. The UK has repeatedly pressed for "de-escalation," and questions have been raised internally about the legality of getting involved. The Prime Minister has spoken to President Trump in the aftermath of the attacks, but the binary decision of whether to authorize US warplanes to use the UK military base at Diego Garcia was not needed. Depending on Iran's response, the UK may face difficult trade-offs in its relationship with the US.</p>
