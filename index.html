            <p>Thousands of individuals participated in protests across the United States on Saturday, expressing opposition to recent actions by President Donald Trump's administration, coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the American Revolutionary War. Demonstrations took place in various locations, including outside the White House, Tesla dealerships, and city centers, with protesters voicing concerns over issues like government downsizing, the economy, human rights, and the deportation of immigrants. The protests, which were generally peaceful, featured signs referencing the Revolutionary War and calls for resistance to perceived tyranny. Polling data suggests a slight dip in Trump's approval rating, particularly concerning his handling of the economy.</p>

            <p>Lucy Edwards, a blind content creator and TikTok star, is undergoing IVF with pre-implantation genetic testing to screen out the Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) gene, which caused her blindness. The decision, made with her husband Ollie, involves creating and screening embryos outside the body, selecting only those unaffected by IP for implantation. This raises complex ethical questions about the value placed on lives that may differ from our own, similar to debates surrounding Down's syndrome screening. Lucy emphasizes that the decision is deeply personal and driven by a desire to minimize the likelihood of miscarriage and give her child the healthiest possible start.</p>

            <p>The death toll in attacks in Nigeria's central Benue state has risen to 56, with the governor blaming "suspected herdsmen." This is the latest in a series of intercommunal violence incidents in the Middle Belt region, with clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use becoming increasingly common. The attacks often have a religious dimension, with farmers often Christian and herders mostly Muslim Fulani. Climate change-worsened overgrazing, drought, and desertification drive herders south, resulting in land disputes and violence, especially in rural areas where law enforcement is lacking.</p>

            <p>Romany Gypsy women are sharing their experiences of hesitating to reveal their heritage due to negative stereotypes and discrimination. A new BBC documentary, 'Growing Up Gypsy,' follows three young Romany women navigating everyday life and highlights the pressure many feel to conceal their identity in professional and public spaces. Studies show widespread prejudice against the Gypsy, Roma, and Traveller (GRT) community, impacting employment opportunities and social interactions. Despite facing discrimination, many Romany Gypsies express pride in their heritage and hope for greater understanding and acceptance.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by the January wildfires are suing major California insurers, including State Farm, alleging antitrust and unfair competition violations. The lawsuits claim insurers colluded to force homeowners into the California FAIR Plan, which offers lower coverage limits at higher premiums. The FAIR Plan has been overwhelmed by policyholders due to insurers canceling coverage in fire-risk zones. The lawsuits seek damages and allege that the insurers engaged in cartel-like behavior to the detriment of homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A Spanish woman, Lina, was killed by her ex-partner after a police algorithm, VioGén, assessed her risk level as "medium," despite her reporting previous threats. This incident raises questions about the effectiveness of VioGén in protecting women from domestic violence. Critics suggest police are relying too heavily on the algorithm, while officials defend it as a valuable tool. An external audit revealed that numerous women murdered by their partners had previously been assessed as low or medium risk by VioGén.</p>

The loss highlighted the absence of Blake Treinen due to injury and the importance of bullpen depth.</p>

The terminated officials, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, had been placed on administrative leave earlier in the week. A third official, Colin Carroll, was also placed on leave as part of the probe. The officials expressed disappointment with the process, stating they were not informed of the specific allegations. The investigation is reportedly looking into multiple leaks to news outlets.</p>
