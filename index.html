          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests sparked by federal immigration enforcement operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the deployment aims to address "lawlessness" in California as demonstrations continue. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and warned that it would escalate tensions. The article highlights the escalating conflict between the federal government and California over immigration policies and enforcement. The deployment reflects the administration's hardline stance on immigration and its willingness to use federal resources to counter local resistance, potentially exacerbating divisions within the state. The context of the article is the escalating tensions between the federal government and California regarding immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>An advice columnist, Sigal Samuel, addresses a reader's dilemma about ethical non-monogamy in their marriage. The reader is not interested in exploring non-monogamy, while her husband is attracted to a colleague and hopes she will change her mind. Samuel advises the reader to clearly state her needs and boundaries, drawing on philosopher Erich Fromm's ideas about love and freedom. She suggests the couple work on strengthening their emotional connection and communication before considering opening up the relationship, and recommends the book "Polysecure" for guidance on building healthy non-monogamous relationships. The article is about the ethical considerations and practical steps in navigating the complexities of non-monogamy within a marriage. </p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was diverted to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at Naples Airport. Passengers were then transported by bus for approximately three hours to reach their final destination. The airline stated that the diversion was due to operational limitations and apologized for the disruption. Historical flight data indicates that American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route. </p>

          <p>This article explores the history of golf's presence in the White House, focusing on how different presidents have approached the game and its intersection with their duties. Donald Trump's active golfing and use of the course for business contrast with predecessors like William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, who preferred to separate official duties from leisure. The article also discusses how public perception of presidential golfing has evolved, from Teddy Roosevelt's concerns about appearing unserious to Dwight Eisenhower's frequent play and the criticisms George W. Bush faced during the Iraq War. The article provides insight into the personalities and leadership styles of various presidents through the lens of their golfing habits. </p>

          <p>Newt Gingrich's new book, "Trump's Triumph," is described as a flattering portrayal of Donald Trump, suggesting that Trump's reelection was essential for saving America. The article points out Gingrich's personal motivations, such as his wife's ambassadorship, and criticizes his praise of Elon Musk, who later became critical of Trump. The article also highlights Gingrich's past political clashes and unpaid campaign debts, painting a picture of a figure eager to align himself with power. The book appears to be a quick political tome, written without anticipating Musk's change of heart towards Trump. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and the industry faces a shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue, leading to buyouts and layoffs of experienced workers. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field with competitive salaries and on-the-job training. </p>

          <p>The author recounts how an article they wrote in 2014 about an American football team in Chongqing, China, was optioned by Hollywood, but ultimately a Chinese studio produced a film based on the same story. The article reflects on the evolving relationship between the United States and China over the past decade, from a period of relative openness to increasing cultural and political distance. The author acknowledges that both the Hollywood and Chinese versions of the story were shaped by their respective markets and political contexts. The piece explores how a story about transcending cultural boundaries through sports has become a symbol of the growing divide between China and the U.S. </p>

          <p>This article questions Barack Obama's decision to maintain a low profile during Donald Trump's second term, arguing that his absence is jarring given the desperation of his admirers and Trump's attacks on Obama's achievements. While Obama occasionally makes brief political statements and fundraises, he largely focuses on personal pursuits and cultural recommendations. Critics argue that Obama's detachment is a dereliction of the message he built his career on and that he should take on a more vocal role in opposing Trump's policies. Some suggest he could serve as an interim leader for the Democratic Party, which is struggling to find its next star. </p>

The article argues that this feud highlights the erosion of American democracy, where wealthy individuals can manipulate the system to their benefit.

The article contends that anti-Semitism, by making Jewish life less safe outside of Israel, ironically promotes Zionism.
