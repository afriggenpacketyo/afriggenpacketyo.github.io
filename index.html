          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave saw its stock increase by over 7% following the announcement of a planned $1.5 billion bond sale. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, is intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center project in Pennsylvania. Despite some investor concerns about its debt levels, the company has seen its share price more than triple since its Nasdaq debut in March. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have intensified their cross-border drone strikes, with both sides reporting record or near-record numbers of attacks ahead of potential ceasefire negotiations. Russia claimed to have downed 107 Ukrainian drones over seven regions, while Ukraine reported intercepting most of 426 Russian drones and 24 missiles in a single night. The attacks caused casualties and significant damage in Kyiv and other Ukrainian regions. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has called for increased drone production and long-range strike capabilities, even as diplomatic channels for peace talks are being explored.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have requested a federal judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody for 30 days. This pause would allow them to address efforts by the Department of Homeland Security to deport him again, despite his previous wrongful removal to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, who was brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges to which he has pleaded not guilty, was granted a release order by a magistrate. The Justice Department is appealing that order, creating a complex legal situation as his criminal and immigration cases proceed in separate courts.</p>

It also points to cultural and societal norms that have traditionally viewed football as a "man's game," as well as political and economic shifts post-communism that further marginalized women's sports.

          <h2>Zookeepers and Veterinarians Turn to Sunscreen to Protect Animals from Sun Damage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>From elephants with sensitive ears to light-colored pets, some animals are receiving a human solution for sun protection: sunscreen. While wild animals have evolved natural defenses, those in captivity or domesticated breeds can be vulnerable to sunburn and skin cancer. The article explores this unusual practice, noting that zoos apply sunscreen to pigs, okapis, and other creatures, while veterinarians often recommend it for light-colored dogs, cats, and horses. The challenge lies not only in choosing a safe product but also in convincing the animal to accept the application, often requiring extensive training and positive reinforcement.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that a mother who was found dead in her Nottingham home alongside her dependent disabled daughter had called 999 for an ambulance months earlier, but no one was dispatched. The bodies of Alphonsine Dijako Leuga, 47, and her 18-year-old daughter Loraine were discovered in May 2024, believed to have been there for weeks. During the 999 call on February 2, Alphonsine stated she was cold and couldn't move, but the call was mistakenly closed. The East Midlands Ambulance Service apologized for the "missed opportunity" and "errors" that led to the tragic failure to respond.</p>

          <p>In a significant display of international pressure on Israel, 25 countries have issued a joint statement declaring that the war in Gaza "must end now." The signatories, including Britain, France, Canada, and Japan, condemned the deep suffering of civilians, the "inhumane killing" of those seeking aid, and Israel's "unacceptable" denial of essential humanitarian assistance. The statement underscores Israel's growing isolation, calling for an immediate ceasefire and insisting that Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.

          <p>A Tennessee judge has ruled that the implanted heart-regulating device of death-row inmate Byron Black must be deactivated moments before his scheduled execution. The ruling addresses concerns from Black's attorneys that the device could repeatedly and painfully shock him as the lethal injection drug stops his heart. The order requires a medical professional to be on hand to turn off the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator just prior to the execution. This decision comes amid ongoing legal battles over Black's competency for execution, with his lawyers arguing he has an intellectual disability and suffers from dementia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With many high-rate certificates of deposit (CDs) from 2023-2024 now maturing, financial experts are cautioning savers against common missteps. One major error is allowing a CD to auto-renew without checking the new, often lower, interest rate. Experts also advise against chasing the highest available rate without considering if the term length aligns with one's financial goals and liquidity needs. Instead of letting funds roll over or moving them to a low-yield standard savings account, savers should use the maturity date as an opportunity to reassess their goals and shop around for better options, including high-yield savings accounts.

This approach aims to offer investors more than just price exposure, which is a current limitation of ether ETFs. The launch comes as ether gains prominence due to new U.S. crypto legislation and growing institutional interest in tokenization. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers from firms like Sophos have noted that the "tradecraft" and digital payloads used across multiple targets have been uniform, though they warn this could change as the exploit becomes more widely known. Data from internet search engine Shodan suggests over 8,000 servers globally could be vulnerable, including those at major industrial firms, banks, and government entities.

The gains by parties like Sanseito, which ran on an openly xenophobic platform, are attributed to voter dissatisfaction with declining real wages, inflation, and rising immigration.

This shift helps explain the resilience of U.S. consumer spending despite low growth in traditional cash balances. When these other accounts are included, total household cash reserves are found to be increasing, approaching historical trends. The study indicates that families across multiple income levels are participating in this trend, using these accounts to better manage their cash in a higher-interest-rate environment.
