          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was murdered last week, drew tens of thousands of mourners to State Farm Stadium in Arizona. The event featured speeches from high-profile figures including President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, was a highly influential and often controversial figure in American politics. Attendees described an upbeat atmosphere that began with Christian music, with many expressing a need for dialogue over violence in the wake of his death.</p>

          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory over Sam Houston State. Manning accounted for five touchdowns, throwing for 309 yards and three scores while also running for two more. After one rushing touchdown, he engaged in a verbal exchange with a defender, an act he later admitted his mother was upset about but attributed to built-up frustration. Teammates and coaches noted his restored confidence and swagger, a stark contrast to his performances in previous weeks.</p>

          <p>Leading Democrats have warned that President Trump's recent actions are pushing the United States toward a dictatorship. The criticism follows Trump's public call for the Justice Department to prosecute his political rivals and threats from the FCC, led by a Trump loyalist, to revoke ABC's broadcast licenses after a talk show host criticized the administration. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated that turning the DOJ into an instrument against political enemies is a hallmark of authoritarian rule, a sentiment echoed by Senator Chris Murphy and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a move the government claims is a "no-brainer for growth." The project will bring the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, aiming to increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport projects a significant boost to the local economy and job creation, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and carbon emissions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demonstrations took place across all 26 states of Brazil in protest of legislative measures that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies. The protests were sparked by a bill, fast-tracked by right-wing lawmakers, that could pardon those convicted for their roles in the January 2023 uprising and coup attempt. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to overturn the 2022 election. Prominent artists and cultural figures helped organize the rallies, emphasizing the need to protect the country's democracy from such political maneuvers.</p>

          <p>Iranian activist and engineer Sharifeh Mohammadi is facing execution after the country's Supreme Court upheld a death sentence against her for the third time. The 46-year-old was convicted of "armed rebellion against the state," a charge stemming from her work with a committee advocating for workers' rights, which the government deems an opposition group. Human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings as a politically motivated trial with serious procedural flaws, and international trade unions have joined calls for her immediate release and the overturning of the verdict.</p>

          <p>The mother of a freed British-Israeli hostage has strongly criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily was held captive by Hamas for 15 months, argued that the move effectively rewards the terrorist group while hostages remain in captivity and the conflict is ongoing. Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the decision as a way to reignite hope for a two-state solution, insisting it is not a reward for Hamas, which he stated can have no future role in government or security.</p>

          <p>According to sources, the Department of Justice under the Trump administration shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar."

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, stated that the U.S. job market has degraded in recent months. Speaking on "Face the Nation," the IBM vice chair pointed to a significant slowdown in job creation, from over 100,000 per month to less than 50,000. He attributed this trend to companies aggressively managing expenses by cutting labor costs, a shift from the post-COVID period of labor hoarding. Cohn's assessment aligns with the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates amid a cooling economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The new rules, issued by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, require journalists to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release, even if unclassified, or risk losing their credentials.

          <p>Nēv Schulman, the host of MTV's "Catfish: The TV Show," has become a licensed real estate agent and is applying key skills from his television work to his new venture. Schulman says the most important skill he learned is how to truly listen to people, ask the right questions, and help them discover what they really want, comparing the process to choosing a partner. He also notes that his persistence and experience with hitting dead ends while investigating online deceptions have prepared him for the challenges of securing appointments and deals for his clients.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has issued a new directive requiring journalists to agree not to disclose any "unauthorized information," even if it is unclassified, or they could lose their press credentials. The new restrictions also limit reporters' movements within the building, a move that Secretary of War Pete Hegseth defended by stating the press does not run the Pentagon. The policy has been heavily criticized by press freedom organizations and Democratic lawmakers, who call it a direct assault on independent journalism and government transparency.</p>

          <p>Nineteen people held at an ICE detention facility located within Louisiana's notorious Angola prison have been on a hunger strike for five days, according to advocacy groups. The protesters are demanding access to adequate medical care, prescription medications, and basic necessities like clean drinking water and toilet paper. The facility, known as Camp J, was reopened by the Trump administration for immigration detention, a move advocates say has subjected detainees to unsafe and degrading conditions, denying them access to required services like a law library and religious programming.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's efforts to consolidate authoritarian power are occurring against a backdrop of weakening public approval, creating a precarious political situation. The analysis suggests that rising grocery prices, stalled job growth, and unpopular policies have soured public opinion, even among some Republicans. This declining support increases the political risk for allies like Attorney General Pam Bondi, who must weigh the benefits of loyalty against the potential legal and career consequences if Trump's hold on power falters.</p>

          <p>The German government has approved an 8% cut to the budget of its Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, reducing it by approximately €910 million. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan expressed concern that Germany is investing far less in international cooperation than is needed, given the rise in global crises. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that the reduction in German emergency aid alone will result in over 4 million people worldwide losing food assistance.</p>

          <p>Passenger rail travel is currently booming in the United States, signaling a potential shift in transportation habits. Amtrak, the national railway corporation, has seen a significant increase in ridership and is capitalizing on the trend with a strong social media presence and the launch of new, European-style train sets. The introduction of the next-generation Acela service on the Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor is a key part of this modernization effort. This growing interest suggests an increasing public appetite for alternatives to driving and flying for intercity travel.</p>

          <p>Despite a renewed international push for a two-state solution, led by countries like France and Saudi Arabia, the prospect faces formidable challenges that could cause it to backfire. The primary obstacles are staunch opposition from both the Israeli government and the current U.S. administration, which has blocked Palestinian officials from attending the UN General Assembly. This article argues that the diplomatic pressure could provoke unilateral counter-actions from Israel, such as annexing parts of the West Bank, which would make a viable Palestinian state even more unattainable.</p>

          <p>In a milestone event for urban environmental restoration, hundreds of swimmers plunged into the Chicago River for the first officially sanctioned swim in almost a century. The event highlights the remarkable transformation of the waterway, which was once notoriously polluted with sewage and industrial waste. Decades of cleanup efforts, spurred by the Clean Water Act and local advocacy, have restored the river's health, allowing it to become a recreational hub. The swim symbolizes a renewed connection between Chicagoans and a natural resource that was long considered untouchable.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-setting rally could have more room to run. Optimism is fueled by easier financial conditions and the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence, which analysts argue is driving productivity and justifies higher valuations. While the S&P 500's valuation is high by historical standards, some argue the market's composition has changed. However, other experts caution that further rate cuts could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the biological aging process at a cellular level. The article explains that stress speeds up the shortening of telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, which is a key marker of aging. However, this damage is not irreversible. Epel recommends several daily practices to de-stress and promote cellular restoration, including eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, prioritizing deep rest, and incorporating more Omega-3s into one's diet.</p>

The party was instrumental in scrapping Labour's previous ID card plans when it entered a coalition government in 2010. However, with reports that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is planning a new digital ID scheme, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and the party should not have a "knee-jerk" opposition, citing a positive impression of Estonia's digital ID system.</p>
