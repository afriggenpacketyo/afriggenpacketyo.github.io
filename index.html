          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 12:18:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The health and beauty chain Bodycare is set to permanently close its remaining 56 stores, leading to the loss of 444 jobs. This decision comes after administrators failed to find a buyer for the business, which they deemed no longer viable due to stock shortages and high operational costs. Since the company collapsed earlier in September, over 1,000 employees have lost their jobs. Founded in 1970, the retailer was known for its warehouse-style stores packed with discounted goods. Analysts attribute its failure to an inability to adapt to an evolving market, increased competition, and rising costs.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, is in federal custody after allegedly firing multiple rounds at the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. The incident, which is being investigated as a drive-by shooting, caused property damage but resulted in no injuries. After an initial arrest by local police and subsequent release on bail, the suspect was rearrested by the FBI on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station. Officials, including the FBI Director and California's governor, condemned the act as an attack on democracy and journalism, while the motive remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>European stock markets closed lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling by 0.5%, largely driven by a significant downturn in the automotive sector. Luxury carmaker Porsche saw its shares slide by 7.2% after it cut its 2025 profitability forecast and announced delays for new electric models due to weak demand, which also negatively impacted its largest shareholder, Volkswagen. Investor sentiment was further dampened by the Trump administration's new policy raising H-1B visa application fees to $100,000, a move designed to protect American jobs. Meanwhile, a preliminary estimate showed a slight improvement in euro zone consumer confidence for September. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has declared that his party has a moral obligation to defeat Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. Speaking at his party's conference, Davey positioned the Lib Dems as the true alternative for voters disillusioned with both the Conservative and Labour parties, offering what he called "radical change in tune with British values." He contrasted this vision with Farage's, which he claimed would make the UK more like "Trump's America." Davey acknowledged his party's polling challenges but insisted they have momentum and must actively confront Reform on issues like immigration and the cost of living.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a strong case for aggressively lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. He argued that current policy is overly restrictive and risks harming the employment mandate, suggesting the federal funds rate should be nearly two percentage points lower. Miran cited disinflationary pressures from administration policies on immigration, deregulation, and tariffs as factors that support a significant rate cut. His position places him in dissent with the Federal Open Market Committee's more cautious consensus, as he was the sole member to vote for a half-point cut at the last meeting.

A senior official stated the deal will not involve the U.S. government taking an equity stake or a "golden share" that would grant it veto power.

A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent to appease Epstein amid legal threats and did not reflect her true feelings.

This shift provides significant savings for homebuyers, particularly those with large loans. For a $1 million mortgage, the current rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the average rates seen in January 2025. Over the entire 30-year term, this difference could save a homeowner more than $200,000 in total interest costs, highlighting the substantial financial impact of borrowing at a lower rate.

          <p>The organizers of the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire feared the event might be canceled due to a shortage of viable conkers. An unusually hot and dry summer caused horse chestnut trees to shed their nuts prematurely, before they could fully mature. However, after a public appeal for help, organizer Charles Whalley is now confident the event will proceed, having received offers of conker supplies from across the country. While this year's conkers will likely be smaller than average, preventative measures like freezing have been taken to preserve the available stock for the beloved annual contest.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration may announce a link between prenatal Tylenol use and autism, leading medical experts are emphasizing that scientific evidence does not support such a claim. Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, stated that rigorous research shows no causal link, a position supported by the FDA and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG warned that pregnant patients should not be frightened away from acetaminophen, as it is one of the few safe options for treating conditions like high fever, which can itself pose risks to fetal development. A major study of 2.5 million children found no association between acetaminophen use and autism risk.</p>

Gold prices often rise during periods of economic instability or geopolitical turmoil as investors seek to hedge against the erosion of fiat currency value. Other significant factors impacting its price include interest rates, currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar, and the purchasing or selling policies of central banks.

          <p>China may pursue land reclamation at the disputed Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea to strengthen its sovereignty and administrative control over the area, according to a government-linked analyst. Wu Shicun of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies stated that such a move would be a primary consideration for Beijing. He also suggested that China's recent declaration of a nature reserve on the shoal is a tactic to limit the presence of Philippine vessels.

At one point, they feared they would be executed. Their release was secured through "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," with assistance from the government of Qatar.

          <p>A murder trial has begun in France for Cédric Jubillar, who is accused of killing his wife Delphine nearly five years ago, despite her body never being found. The case has fascinated the French public due to its central mystery, with no body, blood, or confession linking the 38-year-old painter-decorator to the crime. Prosecutors will build a circumstantial case based on the couple's impending divorce, odd behavior from the husband on the night of the disappearance, and testimony from acquaintances who claim he confessed. The defense will argue that without direct evidence, there is nothing to prove he is guilty of what some have called a potential perfect crime.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's recent match against Arsenal saw manager Pep Guardiola employ a surprisingly defensive approach, a radical departure from his signature possession-based style. City registered just 34% possession, the lowest ever for a Guardiola-led team, and finished the game with numerous defensive players on the pitch. This tactical shift has raised questions about whether Guardiola is adapting to a more physical, cautious trend in top-level football or if he lacks trust in his current squad's ability to dominate possession against elite opponents. The move stands in contrast to league-leading Liverpool, which has found success with a more aggressive, attack-focused strategy.</p>
