          <p>A 20-year-old man has been found guilty of attacking two female police officers during a violent disturbance at Manchester Airport in July of the previous year. The altercation, which also involved an earlier assault on a member of the public, resulted in one officer suffering a broken nose. The court heard testimony describing the event as terrifying and the most violent experience the officer had ever faced. The jury did not reach a verdict on another assault charge involving the man's brother.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are employing a rarely used 1928 law, known as the "Rule of Five," to compel the Justice Department to release its complete files on Jeffrey Epstein. This law allows five members of a key oversight committee to request information from a federal agency without the chairman's approval. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated the move is a response to the Trump administration's failure to provide transparency on the matter. The request covers all DOJ and FBI materials related to the Epstein case, with protections for victim privacy.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old in Scotland, who idolized the Columbine school shooters, has been sentenced to six years in jail for plotting a mass shooting at his Edinburgh school. The court heard that the teenager, who held pro-Nazi views, had been radicalized online and had detailed his violent plans in a journal. Despite being referred to the UK's counter-terrorism program twice, he continued to develop his plot, which was uncovered after a social media photo caused alarm among parents and students.</p>

The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, left a note suggesting he believed he had CTE and blamed the National Football League, which has offices in the building. The attack, carried out with a high-powered rifle, has prompted renewed calls for stricter gun control measures from New York officials. The victims included an NYPD officer, a security guard, and employees of two major firms in the building.</p>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific, impacting Japan, Hawaii, and the U.S. West Coast. The powerful quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, prompted evacuation orders and tsunami advisories in multiple countries, including Peru and Mexico. While initial waves reached Hawaii and California without causing substantial damage, officials urged coastal residents to remain cautious. The event led to flight cancellations and highlighted the far-reaching effects of major seismic activity in the Pacific basin.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at a surprising 3% annual rate in the second quarter, reversing a contraction from the first three months of the year. This growth was largely driven by a significant drop in imports following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, which skewed the headline GDP figure. However, a key underlying measure of domestic demand from consumers and businesses showed its weakest growth since late 2022. This suggests that while the overall number appears strong, the economy's core momentum may be slowing down. (not investment advice)</p>

The discussion frames the tariff strategy as a political tool that ultimately undermines U.S. prosperity and global standing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR correspondent reflects on a recent visit to Khartoum, Sudan, a city devastated by over two years of civil war. Amid the tragic obliteration, the few remaining residents displayed an irrepressible and stubborn hospitality. Despite having lost homes, family, and possessions, survivors consistently welcomed the reporting team with traditional offerings of Sudanese coffee and tea. This ritual of kindness, offered by people who had endured immense suffering and were left with almost nothing, became a poignant and recurring symbol of human resilience in a war-torn landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, along with an unspecified "penalty," effective August 1. President Trump cited India's high tariffs and its significant purchases of Russian military equipment and energy as the primary reasons for the new measures. The move comes after months of trade negotiations failed to produce a deal. For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's markets, particularly its protected agriculture sector, while aiming to reduce a trade deficit that reached nearly $46 billion last year.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency reports a 26% increase in Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) infections in England last year, with young children being the most affected group.

STEC can cause severe symptoms, including a life-threatening kidney condition. Health officials are urging the public, especially parents of young children, to practice thorough handwashing to prevent the spread of the bacteria.</p>

While alcohol may temporarily lower blood pressure by acting as a vasodilator, this effect is short-lived and is followed by a rebound increase. Experts state that regular, even moderate, alcohol consumption is linked to a higher long-term risk of developing hypertension. They recommend healthier stress-relief alternatives such as exercise, creative hobbies, or spending time with loved ones to protect cardiovascular health.</p>
