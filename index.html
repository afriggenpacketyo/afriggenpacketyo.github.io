          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new joint-venture company. The new entity, valued at $14 billion, will be overseen by American investors including Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based MGX fund, with parent company ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake. This arrangement addresses national security concerns by placing the app's security and data under U.S. control, averting a potential ban that was mandated by Congress.</p>

          <p>Alexandra Grant, the longtime girlfriend of actor Keanu Reeves, has publicly clarified that the couple is not married, dispelling recent rumors. She posted a photo of them kissing on Instagram, explaining it was a moment of genuine happiness and not an engagement or wedding announcement. The speculation began after Grant was seen wearing a ring, and was further fueled by a media report of a private ceremony, which a representative for Reeves also confirmed was untrue.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has started a "phased restart" of its operations by bringing some of its IT systems back online following a major cyberattack in August. While production lines at its factories remain suspended, the company is now able to process payments to suppliers and manage vehicle sales, which is crucial for cash flow. The UK government is reportedly working on a support package for JLR's suppliers, many of whom face financial distress due to the prolonged shutdown.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook have urged the Supreme Court to deny President Trump's request to fire her, arguing it would "eviscerate the independence of the Federal Reserve." Trump seeks to remove Cook over unproven allegations of mortgage fraud that predate her time at the Fed, which her lawyers contend are a pretext following the president's criticism of the board's interest rate policies. The case centers on whether the president has the legal "for cause" authority to remove a Fed governor, a decision with significant implications for the central bank's autonomy.

Beneficiaries will now receive their funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card, a move the agency says will improve efficiency, enhance security, and reduce costs. While exceptions will be made for those with no other way to receive payments, advocates have raised concerns about the impact on "unbanked" individuals who rely on paper checks.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic reflects on the enduring cultural presence of poet Allen Ginsberg, describing him as a quintessential "American poet-buffoon." It explores archival pieces, including Ginsberg's 1966 essay advocating for marijuana and coverage of his influence on literary movements in Calcutta. The piece contrasts his explosive, counter-cultural work like "Howl" with the more formal poetry of his father, Louis Ginsberg, creating a portrait of a complex and influential figure who championed the dispossessed and pushed cultural boundaries.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has stopped providing certain cloud services to Unit 8200, a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, following an investigation into its activities. The decision was prompted by a report alleging the unit had developed a system using Microsoft's Azure platform to track Palestinians' phone calls. The company's president, Brad Smith, stated that a review found evidence supporting the report, leading to the disabling of the unit's cloud storage and AI subscriptions, a move that comes amid internal pressure from employees protesting the company's contracts with the Israeli military.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon stated he has not yet formed a strong opinion on President Trump's suggestion that public companies switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports. Speaking at a Georgetown University event, Solomon acknowledged arguments on both sides of the issue. He noted that less frequent reporting could encourage a longer-term business focus but would also reduce transparency for investors, a point he considered a valid counterargument. The debate has emerged as a topic in financial circles, with other leaders having previously criticized short-term pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, a United Nations political declaration will include a commitment to address dementia as part of a new plan to combat mental health challenges and non-communicable diseases. Advocacy groups have hailed this as a historic moment, particularly for lower-income countries where the condition is often overlooked. The inclusion in the U.N. framework elevates dementia to the level of other major global health priorities like cardiovascular disease and diabetes, which advocates hope will lead to better public health campaigns, care, and support for affected families worldwide.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Trump has shifted his rhetoric on the war in Ukraine, suggesting the country could win back all its territory, a statement that surprised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian officials offered mixed reactions; some see it as a positive signal that Trump recognizes Russia's weakness, while others are skeptical, believing it is a way for the U.S. to distance itself from the conflict. Political analysts suggest the change may stem from a realization that Russian President Putin is not a reliable partner for a peace deal, though they caution against excessive optimism.</p>
