          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before Powell's term concludes next year, a reversal from his recent increased criticism and hints at potential removal. Trump had been pressuring Powell to cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Following Trump's remarks, U.S. stock futures experienced a sharp increase across major indexes, reflecting investor confidence in the stability of the Federal Reserve leadership. The comments signal a shift in the administration's approach to monetary policy, potentially easing market anxieties about the Fed's independence. Optimism is cautiously returning to the market after the statement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing pressure from investors to reduce his involvement with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and refocus on the electric car maker, following disappointing first-quarter results. Investors expressed concern that Musk's work with DOGE, which includes significant federal job cuts, has alienated consumers and negatively impacted Tesla's stock price. Musk announced plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE starting in May, but will continue to spend one to two days a week on government issues throughout Trump's term. Analysts suggest that Musk's political activities have tarnished his brand and dampened demand for Tesla vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced he will reduce his involvement with Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from May, allocating more time to Tesla. This decision comes after Tesla reported a 71% drop in first-quarter profits, partly due to President Trump's tariffs. Musk's role at DOGE, aimed at slashing federal spending, has been divisive and prompted a backlash against Tesla. Tesla's value has plummeted since December, with its share price falling more than 50%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year despite the UK facing higher-than-expected inflation, projected to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%. The IMF also downgraded the UK's economic growth forecast for 2025 to 1.1%, citing the impact of US trade tariffs. However, the report suggests that the spike in inflation is temporary, allowing for rate cuts. Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to defend British interests and advocate for free and fair trade during meetings in Washington.</p>
