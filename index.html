          <p>The Princess of Wales, Catherine, has withdrawn from her planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. Kensington Palace confirmed that she would not be attending the races, where she was scheduled to appear in the carriage procession with her husband, Prince William. Catherine was last seen at the Order of the Garter service in Windsor, and she has recently increased her public appearances, including attending Trooping the Colour and visiting the V&A East Storehouse museum. The Princess revealed in January that she is in remission from cancer and is focused on staying cancer-free, though she noted she is "not out of the woods yet."</p>

She advocated for a democratic and secular republic in Iran, rejecting any form of dictatorship.

          <p>A woman from South Yorkshire, Yvonne Ford, died from rabies after being scratched by a stray puppy during a holiday in Morocco in February.

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) stated that there is no risk to the wider public, as rabies transmission between people is rare.

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a Tennessee law that bans certain gender-affirming care treatments for minors in a 6-3 decision. Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion, stating that the law does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment and leaves policy questions to elected representatives. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented, arguing that the court is abandoning transgender children and their families to political whims by retreating from meaningful judicial review. The ruling is likely to have a nationwide effect, as 25 states have similar laws.</p>

However, the four-week average of claims has risen to its highest point since August 2023, indicating a potential deceleration in the U.S. job market. While employers are still adding jobs, the pace has slowed compared to previous years, partly due to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and the impact of Trump's trade policies.

          <p>A pro-Israel hacking group, Gonjeshke Darande, has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on Iran's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Nobitex, resulting in the theft of over $90 million. The hackers drained funds from platform wallets and posted anti-government messages referencing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This attack follows escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, including recent missile exchanges. The same group also claimed credit for a separate cyberattack on Iran's state-owned Bank Sepah, further heightening concerns about cybersecurity in the region.</p>

          <p>The article explores the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, delving into the ethics, stigma, and history of gossip and who gets to participate. While studies show that men and women gossip at similar rates, women tend to gossip neutrally more often, giving them more practice in social conversation. The article suggests that men's perceived lack of skill in gossip stems from cultural constraints and a fear of appearing "messy" or stirring the pot. Ultimately, the piece considers whether improving men's gossiping skills could help address the male loneliness epidemic by fostering deeper connections and intimacy.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled against Texas and landowners challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store nuclear waste in the state. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for the 6-3 majority, stated that neither Texas nor the land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding and are therefore not entitled to judicial review. The ruling reverses a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, and the court ordered the lower court to deny or dismiss the petitions for review. The issue of nuclear waste storage has been politically complicated, with the Yucca Mountain project in Nevada facing significant pushback.</p>

Additionally, the Safe Borders Act weakens refugee protections, and there is increased spending on security infrastructure.
