        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway's parliamentary election is expected to result in a narrow victory for the incumbent Labour Party, according to recent opinion polls. The campaign focused heavily on domestic issues such as rising inflation and the quality of public services. However, international instability, including the war in Ukraine, has also been a significant factor, potentially leading voters to favor the stability of the current government. The final outcome remains tight, with the performance of smaller parties likely to be decisive when results are announced.</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's intention to resign, Japan's leadership race is intensifying, with former minister Sanae Takaichi emerging as a frontrunner. An opinion poll shows Takaichi with a slight lead, positioning her to potentially become the country's first female prime minister. The transition comes as Japan grapples with a cost of living crisis and the fallout from a new trade deal with the United States. Analysts note Takaichi's strong policy ideas, contrasting her with rival Shinjiro Koizumi, who is seen as a more conventional choice.</p>

While Ethiopia frames the project as a crucial step for regional development and energy access, downstream nations Egypt and Sudan express significant concerns. Both countries, heavily reliant on the Nile's waters, fear the dam will reduce their water supply and have unsuccessfully pushed for a legally binding agreement on its operation. The dispute highlights the growing regional tensions over increasingly scarce water resources.</p>

          <p>A former British Army Sergeant Major, Michael Webber, has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting 19-year-old Gunner Jaysley Beck, who took her own life in 2021. Beck had reported the assault, but an inquest found the Army's mishandling of her complaint contributed to her death. Superiors reportedly pressured her to drop the allegations and failed to report the incident to the police, initially treating it as minor misconduct. The soldier's family stated they believe she would still be alive if the chain of command had acted appropriately.</p>

          <p>Erin Patterson, 50, has been sentenced to life in prison in Australia for murdering three relatives by serving them a meal laced with toxic death cap mushrooms. She will be eligible for parole after 33 years. The victims were her former in-laws and an aunt-in-law, who died after eating a beef Wellington she prepared in 2023; an uncle-in-law survived but suffered severe illness. Patterson has maintained her innocence, claiming the poisoning was accidental, but the judge described her crimes as being in the "worst category" of offending.</p>

          <p>The board of English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur has announced that it is "not for sale," having rejected two preliminary expressions of interest. The statement follows the recent departure of long-serving executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential takeover. The club confirmed that its majority owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, unequivocally rejected the approaches and has no intention of selling its stake. Levy's tenure saw the club grow into a global brand but also faced criticism from fans.</p>

          <p>Germany's football manager, Julian Nagelsmann, faced criticism for his post-match comments following a 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier. Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's direct, long-ball style of play as "not brilliant to watch," which pundits and former players found disrespectful. Critics pointed out that Germany also frequently employed long balls during the match. The comments have added extra tension ahead of the reverse fixture in Belfast, where Nagelsmann is now expected to receive a hostile reception.</p>

The decline is attributed to a high statistical base from the previous year and the waning effects of front-loaded shipments aimed at beating U.S. tariffs.

It highlights a significant power imbalance, where trainees and junior barristers feel that reporting misconduct is "career suicide" due to fear of reprisal from senior figures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint China-US study has discovered that Mars has a solid inner core, a finding that challenges previous models of the planet's formation and thermal history. By analyzing seismic data from marsquakes recorded by NASA's InSight lander, scientists determined the solid core has a radius of about 600km. Previously, it was thought Mars had not cooled sufficiently to form a solid inner core. This discovery places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as the only bodies in the solar system confirmed to have this feature, offering new insights into planetary evolution.</p>
