          <p>Israel conducted airstrikes on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and research scientists, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who described the operation as a preemptive measure to counter Iran's threat. Iranian state television reported the death of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps chief Hossein Salami in the strikes, which the U.S. was not involved in. The Israeli military said the offensive was based on high-quality intelligence and aimed to strike Iran's nuclear program in response to ongoing aggression. The U.S. Embassy in Israel advised government employees to shelter in place, while the White House convened a Cabinet meeting to address the conflict.</p>

It is unclear if underground structures at the Natanz facility, which was partially destroyed in 2020, were hit in the strikes.

          <p>Dan Wang observes that China's infrastructure, from subway stations to high-speed rail, showcases an 'engineering state' with rapid development outpacing the United States. China has built dams, bridges, and high-rises on a massive scale, prioritizing electrical, nano, computer, solar, and space engineering as matters of national security. The country produces significantly more STEM graduates than the US, and most top officials are engineers, contrasting with the US's 'lawyerly state'.

The countersuit claims RIDOT knew about the report but did not disclose it in the 2021 bid, demanding judgment against RIDOT for damages.</p>

          <p>Research from Chinese and US archaeologists suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially earlier than previously believed. The study, published in PNAS, analyzed early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region and found evidence of pigs consuming humans' cooked food and waste. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The findings indicate that pig domestication occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient China.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem affirmed that the Trump administration will continue its crackdown on immigrants without legal status and on those protesting on their behalf in Los Angeles. Noem stated that immigration agents were preparing to round up "literally tens of thousands of targets" in Los Angeles. Senator Alex Padilla confronted Noem during her press conference and was subsequently detained. Large anti-Trump demonstrations are planned in Los Angeles and other cities, coinciding with Trump's military parade in Washington.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the assembly, focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party can retain its seats. Parties are actively using social media to appeal to voters, especially unaffiliated ones. Key issues include support for households facing rising costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and regional concerns.</p>

Executives emphasize that localizing production abroad is crucial for long-term sustainability, especially if tariffs increase further.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered the consolidation of the US government's wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings of potential chaos and increased fire risks. The order aims to centralize efforts currently split among multiple agencies, creating a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department. Critics argue that restructuring during fire season could be costly and disruptive. The order emphasizes quicker responses to wildfires but does not address climate change, which contributes to more destructive fires.</p>

One of the first patients to receive the treatment, Paul Silvester, described it as "life-changing." The drug is an advanced form of chemotherapy that increases the dose to the cancer while reducing side effects.</p>

Critics argue that Kennedy is undermining the scientific consensus on vaccination and eroding trust in immunization. The next ACIP meeting includes discussions on various vaccines, raising the possibility of altered guidelines.</p>
