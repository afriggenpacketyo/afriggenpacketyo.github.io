          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military bomber while approaching Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that air traffic control, which lacks radar, did not provide a warning about the military aircraft, which was in the area for a state fair flyover. The incident, captured on video by a passenger, prompted investigations by the FAA, the Air Force, and the airline to determine the cause of the communication failure. The flight, with 76 passengers and four crew, landed safely after the go-around.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued a warning about active cyberattacks exploiting a vulnerability in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, affecting businesses and governments worldwide. According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to gain full system access and execute malicious code. Security researchers noted the hack could compromise thousands of organizations, enabling data theft and the deployment of backdoors. Microsoft has released patches for the affected SharePoint versions and urged customers to apply them immediately to mitigate the significant security risk.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to delay his potential release from criminal custody for 30 days to address the threat of his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported in what was acknowledged as an administrative error, is currently facing human smuggling charges in Tennessee. His lawyers stated that the Department of Homeland Security intends to begin removal proceedings if he is released from criminal confinement. The requested pause would allow his legal team time to evaluate options to prevent his deportation while his separate civil case continues.</p>

          <p>Former Louisville police officer Brett Hankison has been sentenced to 33 months in federal prison for violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the deadly 2020 raid on her apartment. The judge rejected a Justice Department recommendation for a one-day sentence, calling it inappropriate and stating she was startled more people were not injured by his reckless gunfire. Hankison fired 10 shots into Taylor's covered window and a neighboring apartment, though none of his bullets struck anyone. He is the only officer charged in connection with the raid to be convicted and sentenced to prison.</p>

          <p>A two-person non-profit in Connecticut is helping to restore the Long Island Sound's ecosystem by returning used oyster shells to the water. The organization, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, collects discarded shells from over 50 local restaurants. After a year-long curing process to eliminate contaminants, the shells are placed back into the sound, where they provide an ideal surface for new oyster larvae to grow. These restored oyster beds are critical for filtering water, preventing erosion, and creating a habitat for hundreds of other marine species, reversing decades of overfishing.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Bill Cosby shared his memories of his late co-star Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who played his on-screen son Theo Huxtable in "The Cosby Show." Cosby remembered Warner as a highly professional and well-prepared actor with whom he maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after the show concluded. The role of Theo was loosely based on Cosby's own son, Ennis, who passed away in 1997. Warner, who died at 54 after drowning in Costa Rica, had a successful career beyond the sitcom, including winning a Grammy Award in 2015.</p>

          <p>Tesla may have its license to sell cars in California temporarily suspended due to a lawsuit from the state's DMV alleging false advertising.

The DMV is seeking a sales suspension of at least 30 days and financial restitution for customers.

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and raising the possibility of an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, driven by factors like atmospheric changes and the planet's liquid core, could eventually require the removal of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an event known as a "negative leap second." While climate change-induced ice melt is currently counteracting this effect by slowing rotation, experts warn that a negative leap second has never been tested and could pose risks to critical computer and satellite systems reliant on precise time.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the BBC explores the Trump administration's strategic use of the judicial system to implement its policy agenda, a shift from its previous position of being frequently challenged by courts. Recent Supreme Court rulings have expanded presidential immunity and limited the power of district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, emboldening the administration. This has led to what some former judges call an "unprecedented" attack on the judiciary's authority, with officials questioning judicial legitimacy. The article examines whether this dynamic will permanently reshape the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>The head of Sport England has formally expressed deep concern to the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, over the racist and sexist online abuse directed at England's women's football team. In a letter, the agency warned that this "toxic culture" threatens to undermine progress in encouraging female participation in sports. The issue was highlighted after Lionesses defender Jess Carter revealed she had been targeted with racist abuse during the recent tournament. Sport England is urging Ofcom to strengthen and enforce the new Online Safety Act to better tackle misogyny and racism online.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its deportation drive by targeting sanctuary cities, which it has labeled "sanctuaries for criminals." Border czar Tom Homan announced plans to "flood the zone" with ICE agents in cities like New York, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The intensified focus follows the shooting of an off-duty officer, allegedly by an undocumented person with a criminal record. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate, agents will make arrests in the community, potentially detaining other undocumented individuals present during the operations.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Presidential Pettiness Drives Trump's Policy Decisions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's governance is primarily driven by personal pettiness and vengefulness rather than a coherent policy ideology. The author contends that many of Trump's actions, from his obsession with Barack Obama to his flip-flopping stance on Ukraine, are emotional reactions to perceived slights or attempts to make him look weak. The piece suggests this culture of retribution has permeated the executive branch, leading to decisions like renaming military bases and harassing former officials, ultimately substituting small-minded grievances for substantive problem-solving.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will begin using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, following approval from the Pentagon. According to official correspondence, Camp Atterbury in Indiana and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey will be used to hold individuals who entered the country illegally. The plan also includes increasing the number of immigrants detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to expand detention capacity as it ramps up arrests of people in the country without legal status.</p>

          <p>The nomination of Emil Bove to the federal bench is highlighting a potential new direction for judicial appointments under the Trump administration. During his first term, President Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. Now, as the nominations process restarts, Bove's controversial candidacy is seen by some as representing a shift toward a judiciary more aligned with the MAGA movement's political ideology. This article explores how this new wave of appointments could further reshape the federal courts for years to come.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust headline economic figures, many citizens are experiencing a starkly different reality of financial strain and job insecurity. An accountant in Chengdu, for example, has not had a raise in five years and now faces the possibility of being laid off, making homeownership an unattainable dream. Financial experts note a significant gap between official data and the lived experiences of households and businesses. This disconnect raises questions about the true health of the Chinese economy and its outlook for the second half of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Trump's $10 billion libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch will be overseen by the same federal judge who presided over his previous lawsuit against former lawyer Michael Cohen. Judge Darrin Gayles was randomly assigned to the case, which concerns a Wall Street Journal article about Jeffrey Epstein. Trump previously dropped his suit against Cohen after Judge Gayles scheduled a deposition for the then-president. The assignment raises the possibility that Trump will again face a decision on whether to proceed with a deposition and answer questions under oath about his past relationship with Epstein.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations, while also introducing new deductions. To partially offset the $4.5 trillion in lost revenue, the legislation imposes stricter work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, which the CBO estimates will leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement and the southern border wall.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Harvard University and the Trump administration faced off in a Boston court over the decision to cut more than $2 billion in federal grants to the institution. The administration claims the cuts are necessary to combat antisemitism on campus, an argument the presiding judge appeared skeptical of, questioning how cutting medical research funding would achieve that goal. Harvard's lawyers argued the move was an attempt to control the university's inner workings and would harm vital research without evidence of impacting bias. The case is being closely watched and could ultimately reach the Supreme Court.</p>

A key issue is the current structure where players receive about 9.3% of league revenue, compared to the roughly 50-50 split in the NBA.
