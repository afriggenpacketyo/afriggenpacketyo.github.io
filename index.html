            <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly traveled to Russia, according to the Kremlin, with flight data appearing to confirm his arrival in St. Petersburg. The trip occurs shortly after a U.S.-Russian national, Ksenia Karelina, was exchanged for Arthur Petrov, who was accused of forming a global smuggling spy ring. The purpose of Witkoff's visit remains unclear, but it comes amid ongoing tensions and diplomatic efforts between the two countries. This visit will be closely watched for any potential implications on U.S.-Russia relations.</p>

            <p>The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) reports a concerning decline in starling populations visiting UK gardens, marking the lowest numbers since their survey began in 1979. Starlings, once common garden visitors, have experienced a sharp population decline since the 1960s. The RSPB urges the public to take small actions to support these threatened birds, such as avoiding pesticides, maintaining diverse lawn habitats, and installing nest boxes. The charity also emphasizes the need for government and business involvement in wider conservation efforts.</p>

            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, exceeding expectations due to a strong performance in the services sector. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) attributed the rise to manufacturing and production boosts. However, analysts warn that growth could be short-lived due to tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the US. The UK is subject to a 10% tariff on nearly all goods being brought into the US, which is expected to hit British exporters and affect economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.K. economy grew by a higher-than-expected 0.5% month-on-month in February, driven by a jump in services output. The Office for National Statistics said a 0.3% expansion in the services sector had driven the surprise jump in growth. However, the U.K. braces for the economic impact of new 10% tariffs on its exports to the United States. Analysts suggest the uncertainty created by the tariffs would likely override Friday's better-than-expected economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

Xi was speaking during his first meeting with a foreign leader since the tit-for-tat tariff clashes between Beijing and Washington started. He also appealed to the European Union to jointly resist unilateral bullying. After the series of back-and-forth tariff salvoes, Washington has imposed a 145 per cent tariff on Chinese imports this year.</p>

            <p>A new type of drug for one of the most common kinds of advanced breast cancer is now available on the NHS in England. Some 3,000 women a year could benefit from capivasertib after a clinical trial showed it can slow progression of the disease, and shrink tumors in a quarter of people. The drug has been given the green light for NHS funding by England's drug assessment body. In trials, in 708 women, when combined with hormone therapy, the drug doubled the time the cancer took to grow, from 3.6 months to 7.3 months.</p>

With steep tariffs, China's shipments to the U.S. will likely plunge by 80% over the next two years. (not investment advice)</p>

The identification of a male Denisovan jawbone aged 130,000–190,000 years from the seabed in the Penghu Channel marks the first direct proof of their presence in the region. The fossil, dubbed Penghu 1, challenges classical migration narratives and shows how these ancient cousins shaped humanity’s evolutionary story.</p>
