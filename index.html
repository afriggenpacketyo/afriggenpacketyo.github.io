          <p>A Chinese research team has successfully cultivated a human heart structure within a pig embryo, which reportedly beat independently for 21 days. The scientific breakthrough, announced at an international stem cell conference, involved reprogramming human stem cells to enhance their survival in the host embryo. This achievement follows the team's previous success in growing human kidneys in pigs for 28 days. The research represents a significant step forward in the field of organ generation and xenotransplantation, potentially addressing organ shortages for human patients in the future.</p>

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi warns that the Iranian government is intensifying its repression of citizens following its recent conflict with Israel. Speaking from Tehran, she states the regime is using the war's aftermath to justify a surge in executions and arrests, aiming to instill fear and suppress dissent. Mohammadi, who is currently defying an order to return to prison, highlights the worsening conditions for political prisoners, particularly those transferred from the damaged Evin Prison. She urges the international community to refocus its attention on the escalating human rights violations occurring within Iran.</p>

          <h2>India's Regulator Bars U.S. Trading Firm Jane Street and Impounds Over $566 Million</h2>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from the country's securities market due to alleged market manipulation. The regulator issued an interim order to impound approximately $566.3 million in what it claims are illegal gains. Jane Street is accused of using manipulative strategies to artificially influence the Nifty 50 index to profit from its options positions, continuing these practices even after receiving an explicit warning. This action reflects the Indian regulator's growing concerns over certain algorithmic trading practices that it believes disadvantage retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, identified himself as "Black or African American" and "Asian" on a 2009 Columbia University application, according to a report citing a leaked database. Mamdani, whose parents are of Indian descent and who was born in Uganda, stated he was trying to reflect his "complex background" rather than gain an admissions advantage under the since-overturned race-conscious policies. He now says he does not identify as Black and has emphasized his South Asian, Muslim, and African heritage during his campaign. The report raises questions about identity and past affirmative action practices.</p>

          <p>More than 175 Democratic members of Congress are filing a legal brief in support of an NAACP lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's efforts to overhaul the U.S. Department of Education. The lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, argue that the president lacks the constitutional authority to unilaterally abolish or significantly downsize a federal agency created by Congress. The suit was prompted by measures including workforce reductions and the pausing of billions in education funding. The Democrats contend that these actions violate the separation of powers and threaten access to education for students nationwide.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Fourth of July weekend, the Los Angeles County Public Health Department has issued warnings for eight local beaches due to high levels of bacteria in the ocean water. Officials are advising the public to avoid swimming, surfing, and other water activities at specific locations, including areas in Santa Monica, Malibu, and Catalina Island. The elevated bacteria levels are attributed to street runoff, which can cause illness or skin infections, particularly for children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. The warnings will remain in effect until subsequent tests show the water is safe.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Department of the Interior to develop a strategy for increasing entrance fees for foreign visitors at U.S. national parks. The order frames the move as an "America first" policy, aiming to generate over $90 million annually to fund park improvements while keeping prices lower for American citizens. The directive also calls for giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access systems like lotteries or permitting. This policy change is part of a broader administration effort that has included staffing cuts and budget reductions for the National Park Service.</p>

The individual was identified and secured in the central-west section of the Military Demarcation Line within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).

The incident occurs amidst heightened border tensions, although South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported no unusual military movements from the North in response.

Recycling and green waste collections have been suspended, and the city's recycling rate has plummeted.

          <p>Veteran groups and legal experts are warning that the Trump administration's deployment of active-duty troops to U.S. cities, such as Los Angeles, threatens democratic principles and erodes public trust.

Advocates for military families also highlight the strain these deployments place on service members, who are not trained for such missions, and their families. The deployment of Marines and National Guard troops in Los Angeles to support ICE operations has become a focal point of this debate.</p>

This trend contradicts administration claims of focusing primarily on violent criminals and reflects a broader push to increase arrests and deportations.

          <p>Microsoft has laid off 830 employees in its home state of Washington as part of a broader plan to eliminate 9,000 jobs company-wide. The cuts affected a wide range of departments, including game design, research, legal, hardware engineering, sales, and cloud solutions architecture. The layoffs are part of a corporate effort to reduce redundancy and refocus on strategic priorities, including new technologies. This move comes as the company continues to see its fastest growth in its Azure cloud services, while revenue from its Xbox division has lagged behind overall company performance.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has found that the Home Office does not know if foreign workers are leaving the country or staying illegally after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee report states the department has failed to analyze exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020. With over 1.18 million applications under this route, the committee criticized the Home Office for showing "little curiosity" about its operation and for being "slow and ineffective" in tackling worker exploitation. The findings raise significant questions about the government's ability to manage its immigration system effectively.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to miss approximately six weeks after being placed on the injured list with a bone bruise in his left knee. The injury occurred during a game when a runner's helmet collided with his knee during a slide into third base. While Muncy initially feared a more severe injury, an MRI revealed no structural damage, which he called the "best-case scenario." His absence creates a significant gap in the Dodgers' lineup, as he was a key offensive contributor, leading the team in average and RBIs in the month of June.</p>

Nonpartisan analysis predicts these changes could cause millions to lose benefits and will add over $3 trillion to the national deficit.

The report also examines mixed results in education, controversial U-turns in welfare reform, and ambitious but challenging plans for the NHS.
