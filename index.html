While winemakers are hesitant to speak out directly, representatives like FranÃ§ois Labet, president of the Burgundy Wine Board, acknowledge the significant impact on sales.

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a controversial decision during their match at Old Trafford. The dispute centers around a disallowed goal, with Villa captain John McGinn describing the call as "incredible". Match of the Day pundits also agreed that the referee made an error, blowing the whistle too early, which prevented VAR from intervening. The incident occurred when the goalkeeper never had full control of the ball, and Morgan Rogers had every right to get the ball. </p>

          <p>Five years after George Floydâ€™s murder sparked a significant social movement, a backlash has taken hold, with policies and discourse shifting towards "white grievance." The Justice Department has scaled back oversight of police forces accused of racial bias, and President Trump has championed policies that critics say undermine racial equity. While the Black Lives Matter movement's popularity has declined, some argue that change is never fully reversed and that Black activism remains crucial for democracy. Despite challenges, some initiatives, such as police reform and grassroots resistance to anti-D.E.I. efforts, persist. </p>

          <p>A new parenting style, "emotionally safe parenting," emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, focusing on building resilience, trust, and connection. This approach involves accepting emotions without dismissing them, responding without shaming, and viewing behavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents prioritize self-awareness and inner healing, creating an environment where children feel secure expressing their authentic selves. Practicing this involves doing inner work, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair after conflicts. </p>
