          <p>Austin Drummond, a 28-year-old man suspected of killing four family members, has been arrested in Jackson, Tennessee, concluding a weeklong manhunt. The victims were identified as Cortney Rose, Adrianna Williams, Braydon Williams, and James Matthew Wilson, who were related to the suspect's girlfriend. The investigation began after a baby, who is now safe, was found abandoned in a yard, leading authorities to discover the bodies. Drummond was found unarmed in a vacant building following multiple public sightings, and authorities are continuing their investigation into the motive for the killings.</p>

Despite the earnings miss, the company's revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed estimates, driven by strong performance in its Client and Gaming segments.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to launch a pilot program to cover expensive weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans and would be a major financial victory for pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. The plan is similar to a previous Biden administration proposal and is expected to start in 2026 for Medicaid and 2027 for Medicare. While the news is viewed as a positive development for the industry, details regarding pricing and patient eligibility parameters remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Shares of Snap Inc. dropped by 15% after the company reported second-quarter financial results that included a miss on its global average revenue per user (ARPU). While daily active users exceeded expectations, the lower-than-anticipated ARPU indicated a weakness in monetizing its user base, a metric where some competitors have succeeded. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weaker growth to a flawed advertising platform update, which has since been reverted. Despite the setback, Snap provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of Wall Street estimates, projecting future growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed that major financial institutions are discriminating against conservatives through "debanking," the practice of closing customer accounts. The comments follow reports that he plans to sign an executive order to combat this alleged bias, which some conservatives claim targets them for their political views. Banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have stated they do not close accounts for political reasons but welcome regulatory clarity on the issue. Experts note that while account closures can happen for various reasons, including suspected fraud, there is no systemic data proving politically motivated debanking.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a new task force to manage federal preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The president will personally chair the group, which is tasked with coordinating security, transportation, and visa processing for the international event. This move mirrors a similar task force established for the 2026 World Cup and underscores the administration's focus on overseeing major international events held in the U.S. The president stated he would authorize the use of the National Guard or military if necessary to ensure the games are safe.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico, the body responsible for managing the U.S. territory's finances. The dismissed members, largely appointed by Democratic presidents, were removed amid White House claims that the board has been run inefficiently. This action occurs as Puerto Rico continues to navigate its fiscal crisis and the complex debt restructuring of its power authority, PREPA. The board stated it would continue its work, while Puerto Rico's governor expressed a desire to work with the new members once they are appointed.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com shows that median home prices are declining in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops from their 2022 peaks, largely due to an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and limited inventory, with markets like Milwaukee seeing a 26% price increase since 2022. This regional divergence highlights a split in the national housing market, offering some relief to buyers in specific areas. (not investment advice)</p>

The president warned that if the city does not address the issue quickly, he will have no choice but to "federalize this City" to restore safety.

It recounts undisputed findings from the U.S. intelligence community and the Mueller report, which concluded that Russia systematically interfered in the 2016 election to benefit Trump. The piece contends that while some sensational rumors were unsubstantiated, the core of the issue—Russian meddling and the Trump campaign's willingness to engage—is real.

The report states that the owner, OceanGate, used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory loopholes to operate the vessel outside of established deep-sea safety protocols. Investigators found that the submersible's design was flawed and that the company continued operations despite previous incidents that likely compromised the hull's integrity.

However, political science experts note that the Texas Constitution provides only two clear methods for removal: expulsion by a two-thirds legislative vote or defeat at the ballot box, making the governor's path legally uncertain.</p>

With current rates, a high-yield savings account at 4.30% would narrowly outperform a 3-month CD at 4.25% over the term, earning just over a dollar more. However, the CD offers a guaranteed fixed rate, which is an advantage if interest rates fall as predicted, while the savings account rate is variable.

          <p>The Oval Invincibles started their title defense in The Hundred cricket tournament with a decisive six-wicket victory over the London Spirit at Lord's. The Spirit were bowled out for just 80 runs, the second-lowest score in the history of the men's competition. Invincibles' bowlers Rashid Khan and Sam Curran were instrumental, taking three wickets each, with Curran delivering a historically slow wicket-taking ball. Despite a challenging pitch, the Invincibles comfortably chased the small total with 31 balls remaining, marking a powerful start to their season.</p>

          <p>A dramatic political showdown is unfolding in Texas, where Democrats have fled the state to block a Republican-led vote on redrawing congressional districts. The proposed map could give Republicans up to five additional seats in the U.S. House, a significant margin that could determine control of Congress in the next midterm elections. This article explains that the move, encouraged by Donald Trump, has prompted Democratic governors in states like California and New York to threaten retaliatory gerrymandering.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion column argues that Kamala Harris, despite speculation about another presidential run, may not be the right candidate to solve the Democratic Party's current unpopularity. The author notes that the party's favorability is at a historic low, with discontent among both progressive and centrist wings. The piece suggests that Harris symbolizes this discontent, as her 2024 loss was due to an inability to appeal to a broader electorate beyond the party's base. The author concludes that nominating her again would be a mistake, as Democrats need a candidate who can flip Trump voters, not just energize the existing coalition.</p>

          <p>This article outlines three critical questions for homeowners considering borrowing a $100,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current economic climate. With impending Fed rate cuts, homeowners should assess if cuts are guaranteed and how they will concretely impact their variable-rate HELOC payments over time. The piece also advises borrowers to consider whether a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a more stable and predictable alternative, given that average rates for both products are currently similar.
