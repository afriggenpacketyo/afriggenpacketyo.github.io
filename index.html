          <p>Elon Musk has accused Apple of anticompetitive behavior, threatening an immediate antitrust lawsuit against the company. He alleges that Apple's App Store policies unfairly prevent his AI chatbot, Grok, from reaching the top ranking, favoring its partner OpenAI's ChatGPT. Musk publicly questioned Apple's refusal to feature X or Grok in its "Must-Have" section, despite their high rankings, suggesting a political motive. The threat adds to Apple's existing antitrust challenges, including a major lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem monopoly.</p>

          <p>A public school teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia, claims she repeatedly tried to alert school administrators about a social worker who allegedly arranged and paid for a student's abortion without parental consent. Zenaida Perez asserts she blew the whistle seven times since 2022, only to be ignored and face retaliation, while the school district maintains it only recently learned of the allegations. Documents and recordings reportedly support Perez's timeline, detailing her warnings to the principal and other officials about the incident involving a 17-year-old student. The case has ignited a significant controversy over parental rights and school policies in the district.</p>

The figures represent a significant increase compared to the same period in the previous year. While the government points to a new returns deal with France as a deterrent, opposition parties have criticized what they describe as a failure to secure the nation's borders.</p>

          <p>A recent law signed by President Trump is projected to remove 2.4 million people from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the legislation expands work requirements to new groups, including parents of older children and adults aged 55 to 64. The changes mandate at least 80 hours of work, volunteering, or job training per month to maintain benefits. Critics argue the policy will disproportionately harm low-income households, with projections showing their available resources decreasing while middle and high-income households see theirs increase.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the season later in the week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already been linked to flooding and at least eight fatalities. Early models project Erin could intensify into a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its formation marks an increase in activity during an Atlantic hurricane season that is predicted to be above-normal.</p>

          <p>A man known as Nicholas Rossi, who allegedly faked his own death to flee the U.S. and avoid sexual assault charges, confronted one of his accusers as his trial began in Utah. He was arrested in Scotland in 2021 after being recognized in a hospital and was extradited despite claiming to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight. Prosecutors allege Rossi sexually assaulted two women in 2008, and the first trial focuses on one of these cases. The alleged victim testified about their brief, controlling relationship, culminating in an encounter where he allegedly sexually assaulted her.</p>

          <p>An analytical article examines why the Trump administration has recently adopted a more lenient trade policy towards China, extending a tariff pause while imposing steep penalties on other nations like India. The shift is attributed to several factors, including a desire to avoid price hikes for U.S. consumers during the holiday season and to create space for broader trade negotiations. China's strategic leverage, particularly its dominance in rare earth minerals essential for U.S. industries, is seen as a key reason for its stronger negotiating position. The analysis suggests Trump is balancing multiple domestic and geopolitical challenges, leading to a temporary de-escalation with Beijing.</p>

          <p>A new UK law requiring age verification on adult websites and other major platforms has triggered a significant backlash. The Online Safety Act mandates that sites implement age checks to prevent children from accessing pornographic or harmful material, but this has led to complaints about privacy, as users must share personal data like IDs or credit card details. The measures have prompted a surge in VPN use in the UK and drawn criticism from U.S. politicians, who fear the law could restrict free expression and unfairly impact American tech companies. Meanwhile, other countries in Europe and Australia are adopting similar legislation.</p>

          <p>Newly released school records for the Uvalde gunman reveal a significant decline from a promising start in kindergarten to a troubled adolescence marked by academic and behavioral issues. Initially described as a "motivated thinker," by middle school Salvador Ramos faced suspensions for bullying and harassment, and he later withdrew from high school due to poor performance and attendance. These documents were released after a lengthy legal battle by media organizations. They provide a more detailed timeline of his downward spiral before he committed the mass murder at Robb Elementary School, killing 19 children and two teachers.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett was cited for driving 100 mph in a 60 mph zone, his eighth speeding violation since 2017. The incident occurred just three years after a serious crash in which Garrett flipped his Porsche while driving 20 mph over the speed limit, resulting in hospitalization for multiple injuries. This latest citation for excessive speeding raises further questions about the star player's off-field judgment and reckless driving habits. Garrett, the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, recently signed a major contract extension with the Browns, who have not yet commented on the incident.</p>

          <p>Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% jump in second-quarter revenue to $658.1 million in its first earnings report as a public company. The growth was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin. Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, the strong revenue performance caused shares to rise. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the company's success to growing interest from major financial institutions following the passage of supportive crypto legislation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Nowinski, who co-founded the world's largest brain bank for CTE research, explains how his team navigates sensitive cases, such as the recent shooting at the NFL's headquarters by a former player who asked for his brain to be studied. He argues that while the NFL has taken some steps to address the issue, the controversy has faded due to a fractured media landscape and the league's financial influence.

          <p>An opinion piece highlights a concerning trend in the U.S., with kindergarten vaccination rates declining for the fifth consecutive year as vaccine exemptions hit a record high. This decline coincides with the nation's largest measles outbreak in three decades, a crisis the author attributes to the anti-vaccine rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration. The article criticizes Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for dismantling vaccine advisory panels and cutting funding for mRNA research while retaining financial stakes in litigation against vaccine makers. These actions, coupled with broader science budget cuts, are said to be eroding public trust and endangering public health.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China, the global shipping industry continues to see significant shifts in trade routes. Analysts expect a full-year decline in container volumes on the transpacific lane as importers diversify their sourcing to avoid potential tariffs. Shipping giant Maersk reported a 35% year-on-year drop in its China-U.S. volumes for the second quarter. This decline in North American imports is being offset by strong growth in trade with Europe, Latin America, and Asia, indicating a lasting realignment of global supply chains driven by the ongoing trade tensions.

This intense competition is transforming the industry from a near-monopoly dominated by Meituan into a duopoly.
