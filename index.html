          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have resulted in a death toll exceeding 100 people, with many others still missing. The disaster, which struck over the July Fourth holiday, heavily impacted a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and staff were confirmed among the deceased. As search and rescue operations continue amidst forecasts of more rain, a political debate has emerged regarding whether federal budget cuts to the National Weather Service may have compromised the disaster response, a claim the White House has denied, calling the event an "act of God."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly begun phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. While an official list includes several airports like BWI and Philadelphia International, travelers at other major hubs like LAX and LaGuardia have also reported not needing to remove footwear. This change modifies a rule that has been in place nationwide since 2006, following the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. Passengers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt from this requirement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved an amendment to prevent landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." The new rule requires landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for renovations, closing a loophole previously exploited by some to displace tenants and increase rents. The city is also developing permanent regulations that will mandate landlords to cover relocation costs or provide comparable temporary housing for displaced renters. This move aims to provide stronger protections for tenants while establishing a clear process for legitimate renovations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from implementing a provision that would block Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The provision, part of a new law, targets organizations that provide abortion services, aiming to defund them for one year. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the measure unconstitutionally singles out their organization and would devastate access to non-abortion healthcare for millions of patients who rely on Medicaid. The court's 14-day order ensures funding continues while the legal challenge proceeds, with a hearing scheduled for later this month.</p>

An Alvarado police officer was shot in the neck but is expected to recover.

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% decrease in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of market expectations. The company attributes the decline to struggles in the high-demand artificial intelligence sector, where it has fallen behind competitors like SK Hynix in supplying high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to industry leader Nvidia. Analysts note that ongoing losses in its chip foundry business and the muted performance of its HBM division are key factors. The guidance suggests Samsung has yet to secure certification for its most advanced HBM chips from Nvidia, capping its near-term growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on order for 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has highlighted the vulnerability of traditional platforms like helicopters to modern air defenses and inexpensive drones. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in future-oriented capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The funds will likely be reallocated to programs for developing unmanned systems and one-way attack munitions, reflecting a significant shift in military procurement strategy.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas were fueled by extreme rainfall, with some areas receiving over 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend, according to the National Weather Service. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in only 45 minutes, overwhelming the flood-prone Texas Hill Country. The region's geography, characterized by hard-packed soil, allows rain to run off quickly rather than being absorbed, exacerbating the flooding. With more rain in the forecast, the hard-hit areas remain under a flood watch as they grapple with the disaster's aftermath.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has delayed the implementation of broad, higher tariffs on imports but has simultaneously issued new tariff plans for 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea. In letters sent to world leaders, the president renewed threats of a 25% tax on products from key Asian allies and outlined various rates for other nations, set to take effect August 1. The administration argues the tariffs protect American businesses, but economists warn they will raise consumer prices and reduce trade.

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade, despite the event being officially banned. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants who faced potential fines. The situation highlights the ongoing conflict between Hungary's right-wing national government, which has passed anti-LGBTQ+ laws, and the more liberal municipal leadership in the capital.</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 tech founders and professionals have signed an open letter demanding that venture capital firm Sequoia Capital denounce controversial comments made by one of its partners, Shaun Maguire. Maguire posted on social media that Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic mayoral candidate in New York City, "comes from a culture that lies about everything" and is advancing an "Islamist agenda." The letter calls Maguire's post an "inflammatory attack" and asks Sequoia to condemn the remarks, conduct an investigation, and implement a zero-tolerance policy on hate speech.

The report links the high demand for drugs to boredom and a lack of rehabilitative activities caused by overcrowding. The watchdog stated that the failure to control this issue hinders rehabilitation efforts and poses a significant threat to national security that requires high-level government attention.</p>

While the state may have more robust regulations restricting construction in high-risk floodways, many communities and vulnerable populations, such as the unhoused living along riverbeds, remain at risk.
