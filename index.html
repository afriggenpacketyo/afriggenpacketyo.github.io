          <h2>US Revokes Visas for South Sudanese Passport Holders</h2>

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas held by South Sudanese passport holders, citing the country's failure to accept the return of its citizens. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the decision was made because South Sudan's transitional government is "taking advantage of the United States." The US is also blocking new visa issuances to South Sudanese passport holders. This action comes amid concerns about the fragile political situation and escalating violence in South Sudan.</p>

          <p>Parts of the Midwest and South are preparing for additional flash flooding after being battered by severe storms and deadly tornadoes. Heavy rains have caused waterways to swell, leading to flash flood emergencies in multiple states. The extreme weather has resulted in at least 16 deaths from tornadoes and two from flooding, with numerous road closures and infrastructure damage. The National Weather Service has issued warnings about the potential for extensive flooding and more tornadoes, urging residents to take precautions.</p>

          <p>China's economic relationship with Africa is undergoing a transformation, marked by increasing trade and shifting investment strategies. China's trade with Africa saw a nearly 5% increase in 2024, driven by initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. Beijing is moving towards public-private partnerships and engaging financial institutions for project funding, rather than relying solely on government-to-government loans. Trade is also diversifying, with Africa exporting more non-resource goods to China, reflecting a more balanced economic partnership.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has placed an attorney on leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a case involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Attorney General Pam Bondi emphasized that DOJ lawyers are required to "zealously advocate" for the administration's interests. The DOJ also placed the deputy director of the Office of Immigration Litigation on administrative leave for "failure to supervise a subordinate." The government is appealing the judge's order to facilitate the man's return to the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports marks a significant departure from the US's long-standing support for globalization. These tariffs, designed to protect domestic jobs, could lead to a trade war and harm the US economy. The move is based on the idea that a trade deficit is equivalent to "cheating," a notion that contradicts established economic principles. The new trade policies could impact American companies, global consumers, and the overall global trading system, and the transition is expected to be messy.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming government consultation in England will address men's health, an area often overlooked despite men's higher likelihood of premature death compared to women. Men are more prone to unhealthy behaviors and face challenges in accessing healthcare services. Factors like machismo, deprivation, and employment conditions contribute to these disparities, with higher suicide rates and lower engagement in mental health services among men. Experts emphasize the need for tailored interventions and greater awareness of men's health needs.</p>

Louise Gleadell was wrongly informed that her cervical screening tests were negative in both 2008 and 2012. An internal review found the samples were inadequate to produce reliable results, but neither Gleadell nor her relatives were told about the "inadequate" samples while she was still alive.

          <p>Rachel Chinouriri, a new wave indie songwriter, has been building a career steadily over the past seven years, with recent milestones like playing London's O2 Arena and a Brit Awards nomination. After releasing her first single in 2018, she spent the next few years honing her sound and incorporating those sounds to her music, before her career took off. Chinouriri says there is a "privilege to having a slow-paced career", saying that she wouldn't have been ready for the massive success of the industry had she had a massive hit song when she was 21.</p>
