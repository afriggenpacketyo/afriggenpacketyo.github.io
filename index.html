          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East prompted extensive tsunami warnings across the Pacific, affecting regions from Hawaii to Japan and the US West Coast. While initial waves observed in Hawaii were relatively small, authorities emphasized that tsunami impacts can last for hours or even days, urging residents to remain on high alert and move to higher ground. The article detailed the measured wave heights in various locations and highlighted the preparedness efforts, including evacuations and the activation of emergency services. This event underscored the critical need for rapid response and public awareness regarding the complex nature of tsunami phenomena.</p>

          <p>The German government is set to approve its 2026 draft budget, allocating substantial investments of €126.7 billion and borrowing €174.3 billion. This strategy aims to stimulate economic growth, modernize infrastructure, and strengthen the military, anticipating a noticeable recovery in 2025 and 2026. However, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has cautioned that significant austerity measures will likely be necessary from 2027 onwards to address an anticipated funding gap of approximately €172 billion. This shift marks a departure from Germany's traditional fiscal restraint, signaling a proactive approach to economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS reported a significant doubling of its net profit in the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations, primarily fueled by strong performance in its investment bank and global wealth management divisions. Despite this, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted continued client caution amidst macroeconomic uncertainties and the impact of U.S. tariffs. The article highlights the bank's progress in integrating Credit Suisse, with one-third of client accounts migrated and substantial cost savings achieved. UBS is also navigating a dispute with Swiss authorities regarding proposed increases in capital requirements, which could impact its balance sheet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party has scheduled a significant annual conclave for October to deliberate the nation's 15th five-year plan, covering economic, political, and social objectives for 2026-2030. This crucial meeting, involving over 370 Central Committee members, comes amidst ongoing tensions with the United States. The plan's formulation, which began in May with public consultation, will be formally endorsed by a party plenary session before its final approval by the annual legislative session in March. This strategic blueprint will shape China's development trajectory for the coming half-decade.</p>

          <p>England's five-day doctor strike has concluded, yet the underlying dispute with the British Medical Association (BMA) remains unresolved. Doctors continue to demand further pay restoration, aiming for a 25% increase beyond the current 5.4% rise for 2025-26, a demand the government currently rejects. Attention is now shifting to non-pay issues, including exam fees, career progression, and job rotation frequency. Despite the acrimony, both sides indicate a willingness to resume negotiations, acknowledging the strain on doctors and the NHS, and the apparent shift in public opinion against the ongoing walkouts.</p>

          <p>A deadly shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building saw gunman Shane Tamura mistakenly target NFL headquarters, ultimately killing four people, including an NYPD officer. Mayor Eric Adams confirmed Tamura had a note referencing CTE and blaming the NFL. The 27-year-old legally acquired a revolver despite prior mental health incidents, prompting Mayor Adams to express frustration over lax gun laws. The NFL advised New York employees to work from home, offering increased security and grief counseling. Investigations are ongoing into Tamura's background and the weapons involved.</p>

          <p>The California coast is bracing for tsunami impacts following a major Russian earthquake, with varying wave heights predicted across the region. Far-northern California, particularly Crescent City, is under a tsunami warning, expecting waves up to 4.8 feet. The rest of the coast, including Southern California, is under an advisory, with anticipated waves generally less than one foot. Officials have urged people to stay away from beaches and harbors but have not issued widespread evacuations. The article details expected arrival times and recalls past tsunami events that caused significant damage to coastal infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is commencing a three-day investigative hearing into the midair collision near Washington, D.C., six months ago, which tragically killed all 67 occupants of an American Airlines regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter. This incident, the deadliest U.S. aviation accident since 2001, has reignited concerns about the congested airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Investigators are examining factors such as potential altimeter malfunctions in the helicopter, obscured radio transmissions, and the crew's use of night-vision goggles. The hearing aims to gather facts and propose recommendations to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <h2>Australia Extends Social Media Ban to YouTube for Users Under 16</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 23:49:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has expanded its landmark social media ban for children under 16 to include YouTube, reversing a prior exemption for the video-sharing platform. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the decision, citing concerns over harmful content reported by minors. The law, set to take effect in December 2025, will impose substantial fines on platforms that fail to enforce the age restrictions. YouTube, however, disputes its categorization as "social media" and intends to engage further with the Australian government regarding this new regulation, which aims to protect young people online.</p>
