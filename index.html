          <p>More than 2,500 migrants have crossed the English Channel since the UK and France implemented a new "one in, one out" returns agreement 11 days ago. The pilot scheme aims to return one migrant to France for every asylum seeker the UK accepts, but removals have not yet begun. This surge in crossings, including a sighting of a "mega dinghy" capable of holding over 100 people, puts pressure on the Labour government to fulfill its promise of stopping the small boat arrivals. Officials are investigating whether larger vessels represent a new tactic by smuggling gangs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A writer reflects on her evolving relationship with Renaissance art, transitioning from youthful indifference to a profound connection driven by life's traumas and joys. Initially dismissing the art form as unrelatable, experiences like a violent attack and later, motherhood, opened her up to the emotional depth in works by masters like Piero della Francesca and Raphael. The article suggests that personal growth and lived experience are key to unlocking the power of historical art, allowing one to connect with the universal human emotions depicted within it.</p>

          <p>Thousands of residents are fleeing Gaza City's Zeitoun neighbourhood following days of intense Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as a "catastrophic" situation. The Israeli military plans to displace a million people to southern camps and has resumed allowing tents into the territory for aid agencies. The ongoing conflict has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning of widespread malnutrition and famine. In Israel, a general strike is planned to protest the government's military strategy, which critics argue endangers the lives of hostages still held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>British fighter Lerone Murphy has emerged as a strong contender for the UFC featherweight title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319 in Chicago. Murphy, who accepted the fight on just three weeks' notice, used a spinning back elbow to end the bout and extend his undefeated career record to 17 wins. Following the victory, which earned him a $50,000 performance bonus, Murphy called for a championship fight against Alexander Volkanovski. The event's main card also saw Khamzat Chimaev win the middleweight title in a dominant performance.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has ordered an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike had already stranded over 100,000 travelers and caused widespread flight cancellations during the peak summer season. The government cited economic risks as the reason for its intervention, a move criticized by the union as a violation of their right to strike. Key disagreements over pay and unpaid work remain unresolved, with a third-party mediator now set to determine the new contract terms.</p>

          <p>A cold case detective details the undercover operation that successfully obtained the DNA of Bryan Patrick Miller, the man later convicted of the 1990s Phoenix "canal murders." Posing as a security consultant, the detective met Miller at a Chili's restaurant under the pretense of a job offer, allowing forensics to collect his DNA from a used water glass. Despite the detective's initial skepticism that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA was a perfect match to evidence from the crime scenes of victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," was subsequently arrested and sentenced to death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a previous ban, allowing tech companies Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China under a novel revenue-sharing agreement. The deal requires the companies to give 15% of their revenue from these sales to the U.S. government, a move President Trump personally negotiated. Trade experts and some lawmakers have raised concerns, suggesting this sets a "dangerous precedent" that could imply national security-based export controls are for sale. The legality of the arrangement, which critics liken to an export tax, is reportedly still being examined by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-standing traffic engineering guideline known as the "85th percentile rule" is facing increased scrutiny and modification across the United States. This rule suggests speed limits should be set based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel, effectively letting the fastest drivers determine the legal limit. Critics argue this creates a dangerous feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. In response to rising road fatalities, the Federal Highway Administration has clarified that other factors like road use and safety risks should be considered, prompting some states and cities to adopt new, safety-focused approaches.</p>

As the aircraft accelerates towards Mach 5, the wing pivots to become parallel with the fuselage, transforming the entire vehicle into an efficient "waverider" shape that minimizes drag at hypersonic velocities.</p>
