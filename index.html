The Tesla CEO, a major GOP donor who previously served in the Trump administration, described the legislation as a handout to outdated sectors at the expense of innovation. This public criticism adds pressure on Senate Republicans as they attempt to pass the bill, reopening a contentious rift between the billionaire and the president. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban areas often experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural locations due to a phenomenon known as the "urban heat island effect." Dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's energy, while a lack of vegetation and water reduces natural cooling processes. This effect, which can raise city temperatures by several degrees, makes urban populations particularly vulnerable to the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves driven by climate change.</p>
