Immigration officials revoked Khan Suri's visa, alleging his father-in-law was an advisor to Hamas officials and citing his social media posts supporting Palestine. The letter condemns the detention as a violation of academic freedom and due process, comparing it to similar cases under the Trump administration.

            <p>Pfizer has discontinued the development of its experimental daily weight loss pill, danuglipron, after a patient in a trial experienced a liver injury.

This setback adds to Pfizer's challenges in entering the competitive GLP-1 market dominated by injectable drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Despite this, Pfizer remains committed to developing other weight loss drugs, acknowledging the potential of the GLP-1 market.</p>

            <p>President Trump has implemented tariffs on goods from China and other countries, sparking a global trade war. These tariffs, which range from 10% to 145%, are intended to encourage US consumers to buy American-made goods and reduce the trade deficit. However, the tariffs are expected to raise prices for US consumers and have caused volatility in global stock markets. While some countries are seeking trade deals with the US, others are developing retaliatory measures. (not investment advice)</p>

The decline in exports suggests that Chinese buyers may have been stocking up on lower-end equipment before further restrictions take effect.

            <h2>Why Mothers Are So Tired: Exploring the Phenomenon of Mom Fatigue</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-14 08:00:00 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Mothers of young children report persistent exhaustion, even when getting adequate sleep, a phenomenon known as "Mom Fatigue." This fatigue is attributed to poor sleep quality, sleep debt, and the overwhelming mental load of childcare and household responsibilities. Mothers often shoulder a disproportionate amount of cognitive and physical labor, leaving them with little time for relaxation. Experts recommend that mothers prioritize "wakeful rest" and mentally zone out for a few minutes each day to combat this pervasive fatigue.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>With increasing demands on time, many Americans are scheduling social time weeks or months in advance. The need to pre-plan stems from busy work schedules, family obligations, and a desire for solo activities. While some may view scheduled friendships as impersonal, others see it as a necessary strategy for maintaining connections. Finding time for socializing requires prioritizing friendship and redefining what constitutes a hangout, incorporating less formal activities like errands or workouts into social time.</p>

            <p>Following the halting of U.S. foreign assistance, Zambia is facing a severe HIV drug shortage, leaving many without access to life-saving medication. Clinics have been forced to close, and patients are experiencing the resurgence of the virus. The sudden cuts in aid have left the Zambian healthcare system overwhelmed and have disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations, such as mothers, children, and truck drivers. The situation has brought back memories of the early days of the AIDS epidemic, with people dying due to lack of treatment.</p>

            <p>The Kremlin has criticized Friedrich Merz, Germany's incoming chancellor, for suggesting Germany might send Taurus long-range missiles to Ukraine. The Kremlin argues that Merz's tougher position would inevitably lead to further escalation of the conflict. Russia claims that European capitals are not inclined to seek peace talks, but rather to instigate the continuation of the war. Germany has been a significant military backer of Ukraine, but has not yet supplied Taurus missiles.</p>

            <p>A retrial has commenced in Sarah Palin's libel lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging defamation in a 2017 editorial. Palin claims the editorial falsely linked her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting, damaging her reputation. The Times acknowledges the inaccuracy but maintains it was an honest mistake that was quickly corrected. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals restored the case after finding flaws in the initial trial, including erroneous exclusion of evidence and inaccurate jury instructions.</p>

            <p>Loading the dishwasher is a common source of household conflict, reflecting differing values regarding efficiency, cleanliness, and domestic labor. Properly loading the dishwasher involves understanding its spray arms, avoiding overloading, and placing items securely. Rinsing dishes is no longer necessary due to modern detergents that work with a small amount of food residue. Dishwashers are a miracle of modern technology, saving time and water, but also alienating us from the labor of caring for those we love.</p>
