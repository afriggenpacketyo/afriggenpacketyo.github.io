          <p>A commentary in a Communist Party publication suggests digital currencies could be "militarized" to create a sanction-proof economy for China. The article highlights how cryptocurrencies offer fast, secure, and anonymous transactions, potentially reshaping the financial battlefield in geopolitical conflicts. It also notes that the 2025 US National Defence Authorisation Act includes a blockchain testing program, indicating that digital assets are becoming a significant strategic tool for financial defense globally, prompting concern and strategic evaluation from Beijing.</p>

Now a museum, it is known for numerous reports of paranormal activity and is currently undergoing renovations ahead of America's 250th independence celebration.</p>

          <p>The New York Times has identified Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Gilded Age Mellon family, as the anonymous donor who provided $130 million to pay U.S. military members during the government shutdown. President Trump had previously described the donor as a "patriot" and a friend. However, the donation amounts to only about $100 per service member and may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress.</p>

          <p>A four-year study in Southern California found that E. coli from contaminated meat was linked to 18% of urinary tract infections among a group of patients. Researchers suggest this could be a nationwide issue, reframing contaminated meat as a significant public health concern beyond just food poisoning. The study, which used genomic analysis to trace bacteria, found turkey and chicken to be the most common sources, with higher contamination rates observed in low-income areas.</p>
