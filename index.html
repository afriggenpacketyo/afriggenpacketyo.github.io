          <p>Action star Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson revealed that he drew upon his own childhood trauma to portray mixed martial arts fighter Mark Kerr in the new dramatic film "The Smashing Machine." In an interview, Johnson admitted he was initially scared to take on such a demanding role and shared his fears with co-star Emily Blunt and director Benny Safdie. He explained that this vulnerability was necessary to authentically capture the complex character of Kerr. Johnson also spoke about finding peace in his personal life, particularly through his passion for fishing at his private fishing hole.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 15:41:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive strategy in the team's 1-1 draw against Arsenal, a tactical gamble that nearly secured a victory. After taking an early lead, City shifted to a deep, compact formation, at times resembling a 5-5-0, and finished the match with a record-low 32.8% possession for a Guardiola-led side. The approach was attributed to player fatigue after a demanding week of matches. While the tactic successfully stifled Arsenal for most of the game, a late equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli salvaged a point for the home side, leaving Liverpool as the primary beneficiary in the title race.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have issued stark warnings that President Trump's recent actions are pushing the United States towards authoritarianism. These concerns follow Trump's public call for the Justice Department to prosecute political rivals and the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show by ABC after pressure from the FCC. Critics argue that using federal agencies to silence opponents and pursue enemies is characteristic of a dictatorship, not a democracy. The developments have intensified the national debate over the limits of presidential power and the protection of free speech under the current administration.</p>

          <h2>Gatwick Airport's Second Runway Expansion Approved by UK Government</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 15:11:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government says will stimulate economic growth. The privately-financed project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While supporters tout the creation of jobs and economic benefits, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups. Critics argue the expansion will worsen noise pollution and increase carbon emissions, contradicting the UK's climate commitments.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across all 26 states of Brazil against a proposed bill that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted of attempting a coup. The demonstrations, supported by prominent artists, follow a lower house vote to fast-track the controversial legislation. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his role in the January 2023 uprising and a plot to overturn the 2022 election results. The public outcry reflects a deep national division over accountability for the attacks on Brazil's democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Sharifeh Mohammadi, a 46-year-old Iranian engineer and labor rights activist, is facing execution after her death sentence for "armed rebellion against the state" was upheld for a third time. She has been imprisoned since December 2023 for her union-related activities, which the government deems an "opposition group." Human rights organizations and international trade unions have condemned the verdict, citing serious procedural flaws and calling it a politically motivated trial designed to suppress civil activism. The case highlights the Iranian regime's use of vaguely worded laws to impose harsh penalties on protesters and dissidents.</p>

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the move, stating it was meant to reignite hope for a two-state solution and was not a reward for terrorism.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be part of the investment group involved in the deal to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations.

The potential involvement of the Murdochs' Fox Corporation would add a major U.S. media player to the consortium, which also reportedly includes Oracle and Dell.

Team principal Andrea Stella defended Norris's race performance, stating he maximized the car's potential from his starting position, but acknowledged that the qualifying error was a missed opportunity for the British driver.</p>

          <p>According to sources, the Department of Justice shut down an investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," after he was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents. The sting operation was part of a broader public corruption probe, with agents posing as executives seeking government contracts. The investigation, which began under the previous administration, was reportedly closed in the early days of Trump's second term after internal debate over the viability of charges.

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, stated that the U.S. job market has been degrading over the past few months. Citing a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to under 50,000 per month, Cohn noted that companies are aggressively managing labor costs by reducing their workforce through natural attrition. He attributed this trend to a difficult business environment where rising input costs cannot be passed on to consumers. Cohn's assessment aligns with the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut interest rates amid signs of a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face added pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage Black due to the players being paid. For the first time, each American player will receive a $500,000 stipend, a controversial move in an event where European players traditionally compete for free. Donald theorized that if the highly-priced event sees the U.S. team underperforming, the New York gallery might turn on their own players. He emphasized that the European team's motivation comes from purpose and legacy, not monetary rewards.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has introduced new rules requiring journalists to agree not to disclose unauthorized information or risk losing their press credentials. These restrictions also limit reporters' movement within the building, a move justified by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth as necessary for security. Press freedom advocates and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the policy as a direct assault on independent journalism and an affront to the First Amendment. The new guidelines are seen as an attempt to control the flow of information and prevent leaks, further straining the relationship between the media and the military establishment.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that President Trump's efforts to consolidate authoritarian power are occurring alongside declining public support for his administration. Citing stalled job growth, rising grocery prices, and unpopular policies, the article argues that Trump is in a race against time to secure his position before potential electoral losses in 2026. This pressure is seen as the driving force behind his demands for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political opponents. The piece posits that collaborators may become hesitant to follow potentially illegal orders if they perceive the president's hold on power as weakening.</p>

          <p>The German government has approved an 8% cut to the budget of its Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, reducing it to just under €10 billion. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged that Germany is investing far less in international cooperation than is needed amid increasing global crises. Aid organizations have warned that the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that over four million people will lose food aid as a result. The move is part of a broader trend among some Western donor nations to reduce financial commitments to multilateral aid systems.</p>

          <p>Passenger rail travel is experiencing a significant resurgence in the United States, with Amtrak leading a notable increase in ridership. The national railway firm is modernizing its fleet, highlighted by the recent launch of the next-generation Acela trains for the Northeast Corridor, which connects Boston and Washington, D.C. This boom is driven by a combination of factors, including frustration with air travel, environmental concerns, and a growing appreciation for a more relaxed mode of transportation. The trend suggests a potential shift in American travel habits, moving closer to the rail-centric cultures of Europe and Asia.</p>

The Bruins' defense has struggled significantly this season, ranking among the worst in major college football, and the hiring of Coyle is a critical step in addressing these performance issues.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, some Wall Street strategists are optimistic that the stock market's record-breaking performance can continue. They argue that the modern S&P 500, heavily weighted with high-margin technology and AI-driven companies, justifies higher valuations compared to historical benchmarks. However, other experts express caution, warning that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than solid fundamentals. This could create a fragile market environment prone to sharp corrections if economic conditions shift unexpectedly. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. Epel explains that stress damages telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, causing them to shorten more quickly than they would naturally with age. This cellular damage can lead to a host of health problems and a faster rate of biological aging. To counteract these effects, she recommends simple daily practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest to help cells restore and repair themselves.</p>

The move comes as reports suggest Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is planning to introduce a digital ID scheme to tackle issues like illegal immigration.
