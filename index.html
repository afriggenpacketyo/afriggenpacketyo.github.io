          <p>Israel has instructed its military to cease offensive actions in Gaza, permitting only defensive measures, according to Israeli sources. This move follows a statement from Hamas expressing readiness to release all hostages as part of a U.S.-proposed ceasefire plan, although further negotiations are still required for a comprehensive agreement. The decision underscores a top priority for Israel to secure the hostages' return and will be executed in full coordination with the U.S. administration, with a negotiating team expected to be dispatched soon.</p>

          <p>A long-time Manchester United season ticket holder has seen his ticket price double after being relocated from his seat of over 40 years to make way for a corporate zone. The 81-year-old fan now pays £840 for a less desirable seat, a result of the club's efforts to increase revenue and cut significant financial losses under new minority ownership. This change reflects a broader sentiment among some supporters that the club is prioritizing business over its traditional fanbase, contributing to a sense of disillusionment during a period of poor on-pitch performance.</p>

The full-back, currently contracted to Harlequins, acknowledged the rumors and reports that many of her England teammates have already signed pre-contract agreements. Kildunne emphasized that while she is focused on her upcoming season with Harlequins, the emergence of new leagues and investment is a necessary direction for the sport's growth following the Red Roses' recent success.</p>

          <p>A study by Italian researchers suggests that Venice's iconic bronze Lion of St Mark may have originated in Tang dynasty China as a tomb guardian before being transported to Europe. The researchers base their theory on stylistic similarities to Chinese mythical beasts and lead isotope analysis, which indicates the copper matches ore from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The study also speculates that the statue could have been brought to Venice by the family of famed explorer Marco Polo, though some scholars in China have expressed skepticism about this proposed origin story.</p>

          <p>The film 'The Smashing Machine' chronicles the dramatic life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in the starring role. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores Kerr's rise to the top of the sport in the late 1990s and his subsequent battle with opioid addiction. Johnson, who has been a long-time admirer of Kerr's story, is producing the film, which has received critical acclaim and is seen as a second chance at recognition for the retired fighter, who is now sober and has been involved in the film's promotion.</p>

          <p>Residents of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a former industrial hub, are experiencing the severe impact of federal cuts to programs like Medicaid and Snap food assistance. The article profiles individuals who depend on this aid for survival, highlighting the fear and hardship caused by the new restrictions, such as work requirements for health insurance. Despite the negative effects, some residents, including those directly impacted, continue to support Donald Trump, believing in the need for a welfare system overhaul and drawn to his promise of change for the economically struggling region.</p>

Her election comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after a series of election losses. As leader of the party with a majority in the lower house, Takaichi's confirmation as prime minister is highly likely when parliament votes in mid-October.</p>

          <p>A new defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, which a Saudi official confirmed would "encompass all military means," is raising questions about a potential Pakistani nuclear guarantee for Riyadh. This development presents a strategic dilemma for China, which maintains strong ties with both nations and has a civilian nuclear partnership with Saudi Arabia. Analysts suggest Beijing will be cautious about this partnership expanding, as it seeks to avoid provoking the United States or being seen as an enabler of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Pragmatic Approach Drives Acceptance of Hamas Ceasefire Response</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump's decision to treat Hamas's conditional response to his 20-point peace plan as a full acceptance marks a pivotal moment in the two-year Gaza conflict. By immediately calling on Israel to halt its bombing, Trump has cornered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and prioritized the release of hostages over Hamas's complete disarmament. This pragmatic, deal-making approach is seen as uniquely Trumpian, driven by a desire to secure a foreign policy win, further his Abraham Accords, and respond to shifting public opinion and his own frustration with Netanyahu's actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Oxford estimates that changing global weather patterns caused 1,700 heat-related deaths in the Zurich, Switzerland area between 1969 and 2018. Researchers found that despite improved access to cooling technologies and healthcare, the rate of these deaths is increasing, highlighting the escalating human cost of climate change. The study emphasizes that the most effective long-term solution is a rapid reduction in emissions through a shift away from fossil fuels and animal agriculture.</p>

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs's sentence of over four years in prison for prostitution-related offenses, his lawyers have announced their intention to appeal the ruling. The defense team argues that the judge acted as a "13th juror" by unfairly considering conduct related to sex trafficking and racketeering charges for which Combs was acquitted by the jury. Lead attorney Teny Geragos and appellate lawyer Alexandra Shapiro maintain that while Combs accepts responsibility for past domestic violence, the sentence was improperly driven by crimes the jury rejected.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have stated that one of the two congregants killed during the terrorist attack on a synagogue may have been shot by police gunfire. Authorities confirmed that the attacker, who drove into pedestrians and used a knife, was not carrying a firearm, leading to the conclusion that an armed officer inadvertently shot the victim during the emergency response. The police chief described the death as a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of the necessary action taken to end the attack, and the police complaints watchdog has launched an investigation.</p>
