          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests, a move criticized by California Governor Newsom as inflammatory and unnecessary. The decision follows clashes between demonstrators and federal agents enforcing immigration actions, resulting in over 100 arrests. Defense Secretary Hegseth has threatened to mobilize U.S. Marines if violence escalates, further heightening tensions. Newsom asserts that local authorities can manage the situation and that federal intervention will erode public trust, while the White House remains firm in its stance. Optimism in the region is waning amidst the escalating rhetoric and potential for further conflict.</p>

          <p>Johnny 5, the youngest son of the late Jenni Rivera, has released his debut album titled "5 por 5," which features five songs spanning various genres, including corridos and experimental tracks blending banda sounds with alternative and rock elements. The album is a collaboration with producer Ulises Lozano, known as "El Licenciado" from the group Kinky, and includes a song called "72" dedicated to his mother, though he intends for it to resonate with any woman. Johnny 5 expresses that making music has been cathartic, helping him heal from past wounds, and he hopes his music can do the same for others, drawing inspiration from both old-school regional Mexican artists and English-language musicians like Michael Jackson and The Beatles. This release marks a significant achievement for Johnny, who lost both his parents at a young age, as he continues to honor his mother's legacy while forging his own path in the music industry.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the 2018 disappearance of Jermain Charlo, a Montana mother, remains active, with detectives pursuing leads and seeking answers. Charlo was last seen at a bar in Missoula, and conflicting accounts from her ex-boyfriend, Michael DeFrance, have raised suspicions, particularly regarding cellphone data placing Charlo's phone near DeFrance's residence after he claimed to have dropped her off elsewhere. Despite extensive searches and interviews, Charlo has not been found, and DeFrance has not been named a suspect, though he was arrested on gun possession charges unrelated to the disappearance; the conviction was later reversed. Charlo's family continues to advocate for justice and keep her memory alive, hoping for a breakthrough in the case.</p>

Biles accused Gaines of being "sick" and bullying transgender athletes, while Gaines defended her stance, asserting it's her job to advocate for women's sports and that women shouldn't be responsible for validating men's feelings. The exchange included personal jabs, with Biles referencing Gaines' loss to a trans swimmer and Gaines highlighting the physiological differences between men and women and pointing out the scrutiny Biles has faced for her muscular physique. Gaines further argued that it is unsafe to house trans people with a history of sexual assault in women's prisons or locker rooms.</p>

The company's Android smartphones and feature phones marketed from June onward will no longer include the Docomo emoji set, as Google's emoji have become more globally prevalent. The Docomo emoji were introduced in 1999 with the company's i-mode service, which is also set to be terminated in 2026. In 2016, NTT Docomo's set of 176 emoji was added to the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York, recognized for their role in reasserting the human element in electronic communication.</p>

          <p>Recent studies are questioning earlier findings that suggested the presence of biological activity on the distant planet K2-18b, a Hycean world thought to be covered in liquid water with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. While initial observations hinted at molecules like dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), which are largely associated with microbial organisms on Earth, new research indicates these compounds can also form without life. Multiple teams of astronomers have reassessed the models and data used in the original biosignature discovery, obtaining different results and highlighting the challenges of detecting specific gases in distant exoplanet atmospheres due to noise and uncertainty in the data. The lead author of the initial study maintains that additional research reinforces their previous finding, emphasizing the need for further observations and research to confirm the presence of a biosignature.</p>

Concerns have been raised about the negative impact of overwork on employee retention, wellbeing, and creativity.

The referendum aims to expedite citizenship for legal immigrants already employed in Italy and their children, but without citizenship, individuals face barriers to public sector jobs and other opportunities, and a low turnout is expected due to strategic opposition.</p>

          <p>According to the Washington Post, President Trump reportedly described Elon Musk as a "big-time drug addict" and expressed disapproval of a physical altercation between Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The incident allegedly occurred after a disagreement over Trump's choice for acting IRS commissioner, leading to insults and a physical shove from Musk, to which Bessent responded with blows. Trump reportedly felt the physical fight was "too much," and insiders say Musk has alienated key White House staff and quarreled with Cabinet members. The report suggests that disagreements over government spending and Musk's space-related goals contributed to the fallout between the two.</p>

Sovereignty, with 2-to-1 odds, secured the win by three lengths, becoming the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness, and then win the Belmont. The race, run at 1 1/4 miles instead of the usual 1 1/2 due to the temporary relocation to Saratoga, saw Journalism finish second again, solidifying a rivalry between the two horses. Jockey Junior Alvarado, also Sovereignty's rider at the Derby, celebrated his first Belmont Stakes victory, despite facing a fine and suspension for his use of the riding crop in the Derby.</p>

          <p>An ancient writing system from Zambia called Sona or Tusona, once primarily preserved by women, is experiencing a resurgence as part of efforts to reclaim cultural heritages almost erased by colonialism. Sona, used by the Chokwe, Luchazi, and Luvale people, involves geometric patterns made in sand, cloth, and on bodies, carrying mathematical principles, messages about nature, and instructions on community life. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is researching Sona and documenting other indigenous knowledge, aiming to challenge the misconception that African societies lacked their own knowledge systems. The project also highlights the significance of artifacts collected during the colonial era, now stored in museums worldwide, which offer insights into pre-colonial Zambian society.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to combatting drug-resistant superbug infections. The pills, packed with beneficial bacteria, aim to flush out superbugs from the gut and replace them with a healthy microbial balance, and early data suggests promising results in tackling infections resistant to antibiotics. The study, conducted on 41 patients, demonstrated that patients were willing to take the pills and that the donor bacteria persisted in the bowels for at least a month. Scientists believe the donated bacteria can compete with superbugs for resources, potentially eliminating them or reducing their levels to a manageable state, while also increasing the diversity of gut bacteria, which promotes colonisation resistance.</p>
