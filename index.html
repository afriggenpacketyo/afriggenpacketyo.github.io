          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a "$5,000 baby bonus" to encourage women to have more children in the US, prompting mixed reactions. Critics argue that the bonus fails to address key issues such as maternal health care deserts, high maternal mortality rates, and abortion bans. Others point to the high cost of raising a child as a significant barrier. Supporters argue the bonus aligns with the Republican Party's pro-family stance.</p>
