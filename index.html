            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration and accused of gang affiliation. Van Hollen emphasizes that his concern is upholding due process and the rule of law, not defending the individual. He expresses concern that denying Abrego Garcia's rights threatens the constitutional rights of all Americans. Van Hollen reports that Abrego Garcia was traumatized by his imprisonment but has been moved to a better facility, though he still lacks access to news or communication with the outside world.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project to secure trade deals with the U.S. and avoid tariffs. The $40 billion project aims to build a pipeline to export natural gas to Asia, with the Trump administration promoting it as a national priority. Taiwan's CPC Corp. has already signed a letter of intent to purchase gas, and other Asian countries have shown interest. The project is expected to begin commercial operations in 2031 and would provide a direct route for LNG exports to Asia, bypassing the Panama Canal.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry concluded that an "operational misunderstanding" resulted in the deaths of 14 emergency workers in Gaza. The IDF claims its troops believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces in a "hostile combat zone." The report cited poor night visibility as a factor and stated that six of the casualties were Hamas members, though evidence for this claim was not provided. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a refurbished tech marketplace, reports a tripling of sales following President Trump's tariff announcements, suggesting Americans may opt for used devices if tariffs raise prices on new electronics. Analysts agree that prolonged tariffs could cause a surge in used device sales. While most smartphones are made in China, where goods currently face a 145% tariff rate when imported to the US, there was a temporary exemption issued for those products on April 11. The long-term impact remains uncertain, but some believe consumers may eventually return to buying new tech when financially able.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to deport the men without due process, potentially to a dangerous prison in El Salvador. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely. The White House claims the men are "foreign terrorists." The ACLU had sued to block deportations, citing concerns about the men being accused of gang membership without proper legal proceedings.</p>

Van Hollen's office stated the trip was for oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs and to ensure due process for a constituent.

The author argues that no single indicator is a reliable predictor and that economists often disagree. Instead, the author suggests focusing on real-time data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and employment, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies. By analyzing their reports, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's current state and potential future direction. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Emma Beddington recounts a story about telling a weird lie on a first date 30 years ago. She talks about the prevalence of lies in dating, from catfishing to gaslighting, and the various reasons people lie, including insecurity and a desire to present a better version of themselves. She wonders if all dating lies are awful and suggests that some may be attempts at kindness or born of insecurity. The author concludes that some dating lies may merit a compassionate blind eye.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is set to present its proposed remedies in the Google antitrust case, potentially leading to a breakup of the tech giant. The DOJ accuses Google of illegally stifling competition by paying to be the default search engine. The government is calling for Google to stop these payments, spin off its Chrome web browser, and possibly sell its Android operating system. Google argues that the proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation. The outcome could significantly impact the regulation of digital markets and the environment for tech innovation.</p>

            <p>The article argues that China should use the renminbi as a strategic countermeasure in the trade war with the US. Instead of solely relying on reciprocal tariff increases, China should require bilateral trade to be settled in renminbi. This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. It would also encourage global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets.</p>
