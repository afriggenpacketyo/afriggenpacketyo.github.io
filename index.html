          <p>This opinion piece introduces the concept of a "Waymo Democrat," a political identity embracing technological advancement and innovation, particularly self-driving electric taxis. The author contrasts this vision with what they perceive as Donald Trump's backward-looking policies and criticizes the left for focusing too much on criticizing billionaires instead of solving for the future. The author suggests that the Waymo Democrats would focus on reinventing American industry. The piece advocates for a forward-thinking approach to American manufacturing and industry, leveraging technology for progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses concerns that the Trump administration is attempting to revise American history by altering content on government websites. Examples include removing references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument website and changing language about the Little Rock Nine. Historians argue that these changes are part of a broader effort to "restore truth and sanity" to American history, which is seen as a revisionist approach akin to the "Confederate Lost Cause" narrative after the Civil War. This effort raises concerns about the accuracy and inclusivity of historical narratives presented by the government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's call for automakers to move vehicle production to the U.S. faces significant hurdles, including the impending 25% auto parts tariff and the lengthy, costly process of relocating production lines. Building new assembly plants can take years due to permitting, construction, infrastructure development, and supply chain establishment. While automakers are aiming to increase U.S. production, localization of new models is a multi-year endeavor. Six automotive policy groups have joined forces to lobby against the upcoming tariffs on auto parts.</p>

          <p>The stock market's recent two-day rally is attributed to a short squeeze, where short sellers were forced to cover their losses by buying back borrowed stocks. Hedge fund short sellers had increased their bearish wagers after the market volatility triggered by President Trump's tariff rollout. The sudden rally forced these short sellers to rapidly buy back stocks to limit losses, creating an artificial buying force that propelled the market upward. The market appeared poised for a relief rally due to the number of hedge funds caught on the wrong side of their bets.</p>
