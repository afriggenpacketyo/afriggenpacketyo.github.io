            <p>Former Congresswoman Barbara Lee has won Oakland's mayoral election, succeeding a tumultuous period with four mayors in four months, including a recall and indictment of the previous officeholder. Lee's victory comes as Oakland faces significant challenges, including a large budget deficit, rising homelessness, and a recent crime surge, all issues that the city has struggled to address. Lee campaigned on a platform of addressing public safety, the fiscal crisis, and rooting out corruption, vowing to bring a "fresh perspective" to City Hall. She defeated Loren Taylor, who focused on public safety initiatives and budget stabilization, after ranked choice tallies determined the winner.</p>

            <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, cautioned against repeating the tariff mistakes of the Great Depression era amid escalating trade tensions. He cited the Smoot-Hawley Act as a cautionary tale, emphasizing that protectionist policies could worsen the situation. Xie called for joint efforts to grow the global economy rather than fighting over existing resources, advocating for addressing the root causes of economic issues rather than just the symptoms. He drew on ancient lore as a metaphor for the current trade dispute, highlighting the importance of addressing underlying causes.</p>

            <p>A new report indicates that over one million abortions were performed in the U.S. for the second consecutive year, with approximately 155,000 people crossing state lines to obtain the procedure. The Guttmacher Institute's data shows a geographical divide, with states like Illinois, North Carolina, Kansas, and New Mexico becoming major hubs for abortion access. This travel incurs significant costs for patients and support networks. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has dismantled the CDC team responsible for abortion surveillance reports, raising concerns about the ability to track public health outcomes related to abortion access.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has reached its lowest point amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. While his Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly pessimistic about the economy. Tariffs are a significant source of public discontent, with majorities believing they negatively impact American workers, inflation, and the overall economy. A majority of Americans believe a recession is imminent or already underway. The survey also indicates that Americans have become more negative about the stock market.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin announced a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine, citing "humanitarian" considerations. However, this move has been met with skepticism in Ukraine, given the ongoing conflict. Ukraine's President Zelensky stated that Russian forces were attempting to create the impression of a ceasefire while continuing isolated attacks. Russia's defense ministry claimed its troops adhered to the ceasefire and accused Ukraine of violations. The move is viewed by some as a PR effort to improve relations with the Trump White House, while others see it as a potential step towards ending the war.</p>

            <p>As anti-Trump protests continue in the U.S., the Czech Republic's experience offers a potential blueprint for turning mass dissent into electoral success. In 2018, a popular movement organized rallies against the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, who was labelled "the Czech Trump." Despite facing challenges, the protests ultimately contributed to Babiš's defeat in the 2021 elections. The Czech example highlights the importance of unity, strong messaging, and converting discontent into votes to challenge authoritarian leaders.</p>

            <p>China's domestically developed C909 passenger jet has expanded its regional presence, with VietJet becoming the third Southeast Asian carrier to operate the aircraft. The jets will operate on domestic routes in Vietnam, boosting the airline's capacity and supporting the growth of the country's air transport market. The expansion follows regulatory reforms in Vietnam allowing airlines to import aircraft certified by Brazil, Canada, Russia, Britain, and China. Three overseas carriers now operate 15 Southeast Asian routes with the C909, carrying over 250,000 passengers.</p>

            <p>Hungary under Viktor Orban offers a case study in dismantling democracy, with lessons for aspiring autocrats. Orban's government has taken control of the media, civil society, and universities, consolidating power in himself and his Fidesz party. The process involved weakening the courts, applying pressure on media companies, and appointing loyalists to key positions. Despite facing opposition, Orban has adapted his strategies to maintain control, targeting the last bastions of Western democracy in Hungary.</p>

            <p>China has taken a somewhat unusual step of criticizing Rwanda's role in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), urging Kigali to end its support for the M23 rebel group and withdraw its troops. This shift comes as China seeks to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries. While Beijing typically avoids taking sides in African conflicts, the situation in the DRC has prompted a more direct approach, reflecting China's growing economic and strategic interests in the region.</p>

            <p>DHL Express has temporarily suspended deliveries to the US worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of new tariffs. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to delays for shipments. The delivery giant said it will still deliver packages worth less than $800, which can be sent to the US with minimal checks. The White House is also set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms and low-cost retailers.</p>
