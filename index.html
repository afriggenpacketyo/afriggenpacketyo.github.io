          <p>Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, a Democrat and congressional candidate, is defending his actions to hinder federal immigration enforcement, including shutting down the city's license plate cameras to prevent data sharing with ICE. Biss stated he is working to protect residents from what he calls potential "attacks" by federal agents amid a new DHS operation in the area. He described his actions as upholding Evanston's sanctuary city laws and resisting what he terms the Trump administration's "authoritarianism." Critics, including the Republican National Committee, have accused Biss of improperly obstructing federal procedures.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby publicly predicted that struggling competitor Spirit Airlines is headed for bankruptcy, declaring that the ultra-discount airline business model is no longer viable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby stated that a business model predicated on low base fares and numerous extra fees alienates customers and is unsustainable. Spirit Airlines, which recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year, has been cutting destinations amid weak demand and high costs. Spirit responded on social media, suggesting Kirby's focus on them is evidence that their low-fare options remain popular.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, who is representing himself in the trial for the attempted assassination of former President Trump, had his opening statement forfeited by the judge. This occurred after he was repeatedly warned to stay on topic but instead made rambling remarks about Adolf Hitler, global conflicts, and other irrelevant subjects. Prosecutors used their opening statement to detail what they described as a "carefully crafted and deadly serious" plot, highlighting that Routh possessed military-grade rifles. The trial is expected to last two to three weeks and features testimony from Secret Service agents and civilian witnesses.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from former presidents Biden, Obama, and Bush. President Trump blamed "radical left" rhetoric for the killing and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. The event sparked a contentious moment on the House floor when a call for prayer was met with shouts about gun control, highlighting the nation's deep political divisions. Despite the partisan friction, leaders from both parties largely called for civility and an end to political violence.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a Hamas office in Doha, Qatar, has severely strained relations between the U.S. and its Gulf allies, undermining decades-old security agreements. The attack, which killed five Hamas members and a Qatari officer, has led Gulf leaders to question the value of the U.S. security umbrella, especially since the Hamas office was established in Doha at Washington's request. Qatari officials expressed outrage, calling the strike a violation of their sovereignty, and received solidarity from other Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

          <p>Stock prices for Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw significant increases following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a takeover offer for its rival. A potential deal would merge major media assets, including CNN, HBO, and the CBS network, further consolidating an industry already reshaped by the streaming era. The bid is being led by David Ellison, whose firm recently completed its own merger with Paramount. While no formal offer has been submitted, the market speculation alone was enough to boost Warner Bros. Discovery shares by 29% and Paramount Skydance by 16%.</p>

          <p>Nadine Menendez, wife of former Senator Bob Menendez, has been sentenced to 54 months in federal prison for her conviction in a major bribery case. She was found guilty of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, gold bars, and a luxury car in exchange for her husband's political influence. Her defense had requested a lighter sentence due to her ongoing cancer treatment, but the judge, while sentencing below the guidelines, noted she was a "central participant" in the scheme. At her sentencing, she expressed remorse and took accountability, stating, "I was wrong about my husband," who is currently serving his own 11-year sentence.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the immediate response from President Trump and other conservatives blaming the left for Charlie Kirk's killing is factually inaccurate and reckless. The piece contends that while political violence is a growing concern, data shows far-right extremists have been the most frequent perpetrators of domestic terrorism in recent decades. It highlights President Trump's own history of rhetoric that appears to endorse or excuse violence, contrasting it with Democrats' general condemnation of such acts. The article concludes that framing the issue as a solely left-wing problem creates a dangerous environment detached from reality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company engages in systemic discrimination against riders with disabilities in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The complaint claims that Uber drivers routinely refuse service to individuals who use service animals or stowable wheelchairs and sometimes impose improper fees or engage in demeaning behavior. The DOJ is seeking a jury trial, monetary damages, and a court order to compel Uber to modify its policies to ensure equal access for all riders. Uber has stated it disagrees with the allegations and maintains a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination.</p>

          <h2>Conviction of Jair Bolsonaro Marks a Pivotal Moment for Brazil's Young Democracy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis frames the conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro as a landmark event for Brazil, a nation with a history of military coups where plotters have often received amnesty. The trial, which was live-streamed, revealed significant evidence of a plot to undermine the election, including a drafted plan to assassinate political opponents. The verdict is seen by critics as a crucial precedent that efforts to subvert democracy will be punished, though it is likely to deepen the country's political polarization. While Bolsonaro faces a lengthy prison sentence, his political influence remains, and his allies may seek to grant him amnesty through Congress.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 16:12:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their decline, reaching their lowest levels in almost a year and potentially creating an opportunity for prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The average rate for a 30-year term is now 6.35%, a significant drop from over 7% earlier in the year. This decrease is largely attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential borrowers to weigh the risks of waiting for even lower rates against the possibility that the current favorable trend could reverse, as has happened in the past.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American infrastructure projects funded by Tokyo until Japan's initial $550 billion investment is recouped. This investment is part of a new trade deal where Japan agreed to fund U.S.-selected projects in exchange for a lower baseline tariff rate of 15%. After the initial investment is paid back, the profit split will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. Lutnick highlighted that the deal would help prop up domestic manufacturing for critical goods like antibiotics and nuclear power.</p>

          <p>Undefeated boxer Terence Crawford is moving up two weight classes to challenge Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez in a highly anticipated match in Las Vegas. The article profiles Crawford's journey from a difficult upbringing in Omaha, Nebraska, including surviving a gunshot to the head, to becoming one of boxing's most skilled technicians. A win against the larger and more famous Álvarez would place Crawford, already an undisputed champion in two weight classes, among the sport's all-time greats. The fight is also notable for being streamed on Netflix, bypassing the traditional pay-per-view model for a bout of this magnitude.</p>

          <p>Oracle's shares fell by 6% after a record-setting rally, driven by concerns that its projected growth is overwhelmingly dependent on a single client, OpenAI. The stock had surged after the company announced massive new contracts and a forecast for fourteen-fold growth in cloud infrastructure by 2030. However, enthusiasm cooled after a report revealed that a $300 billion, five-year deal with OpenAI accounts for a vast majority of this projected new business. This heavy reliance on one customer has tempered investor optimism about the sustainability and diversity of Oracle's growth prospects.</p>

The probe will also examine how the companies monetize user engagement and handle personal data. This action reflects growing concern among regulators about the societal impact and safety of rapidly advancing AI technologies, especially for vulnerable users.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over whether school reading lists should be updated to include more contemporary and diverse authors, rather than focusing heavily on classics like Goethe. Critics point out that required reading lists are dominated by white male authors, failing to reflect the multicultural reality of modern Germany, where over 25% of the population has an immigrant background. Students have expressed a desire for literature that is more relevant to their own lives and experiences. While some educators are making efforts to modernize curriculums, others argue for the importance of classics in understanding history.</p>
