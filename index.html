          <p>Devastating flash floods have struck Texas's Hill Country, resulting in a "mass casualty event" with at least 24 confirmed fatalities and dozens of people, including summer campers, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching communities by surprise. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, mobilizing extensive state resources for a massive search and rescue operation involving hundreds of personnel, helicopters, and drones. Officials are urging the public to stay away from the area as rescue efforts continue amid concerns of further severe weather.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is expected to miss about six weeks with a bone bruise in his knee. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed, giving the team confidence that Muncy will return with ample time before the playoffs. General manager Brandon Gomes stated the team will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to fill the role in the interim. Muncy was in the midst of a major offensive resurgence, but the team feels it can weather his absence without making a panic trade.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaways, Queens, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. City officials used drone technology to monitor the sharks' movements and ensure public safety, reopening the beaches after about an hour. The incidents highlight a recent trend of increased shark activity along New York's coastline. Governor Kathy Hochul had previously reassured the public that authorities were enhancing shark surveillance measures at state park beaches on Long Island to protect beachgoers during the holiday weekend.</p>

The government's growth guide focuses on improving production through digitalization and automation, as well as enhancing working conditions to attract skilled personnel.

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law that permits towing companies to sell towed vehicles after only 15 days is facing criticism for being predatory and disproportionately affecting working-class communities. Residents in Waterbury report that one company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has aggressively targeted apartment complexes, towing hundreds of cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. Critics argue that the short timeframe and associated fees make it nearly impossible for many owners to retrieve their vehicles, leading to the loss of essential transportation. The company owner defends the practice as enforcing the rules of private properties.</p>

Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts note this provides some relief by lowering overall taxable income but is not a direct repeal of the tax on benefits. The deduction, which expires in 2028, will primarily benefit higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax will see no change.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport eight migrants with criminal records from a U.S. naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The court clarified that its previous stay on a lower court's injunction means the administration can proceed with its "third country" removal policy without providing the migrants a chance to contest their deportation. The case has been contentious, with Justice Sotomayor dissenting, expressing concern that the men could face torture or death in South Sudan, a country plagued by civil war.

          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals undertake an epic annual migration in Antarctica, gorging on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface before sinking hundreds of meters to hibernate, where they burn their fat stores. This process sequesters an amount of carbon equivalent to the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater contribution than previously understood. The findings highlight the critical importance of this overlooked animal in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has revealed evidence of a criminal gang systematically exploiting weaknesses in the UK's probate system to steal millions of pounds from the estates of deceased individuals. The fraudsters monitor a public list of unclaimed estates, then produce fake wills naming themselves as the sole heir, often undervaluing the estate to evade inheritance tax. The report highlights several cases where legitimate heirs were dispossessed, but police and probate services failed to investigate. The ease of online probate applications and a lack of scrutiny are blamed for enabling the complex fraud.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally responded to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, with a statement describing its response as "positive." A senior Palestinian official familiar with the talks clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day truce and a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but a final agreement remains contingent on these negotiations.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly passed budget bill that significantly increases funding for them. Many attendees expressed that they were forgoing traditional holiday celebrations to voice their dissent, with some dressing in costumes like a shackled Lady Liberty to highlight their message. The protest, which remained peaceful, moved from City Hall to the Federal Building, where demonstrators chanted against deportations. Participants, including teachers and local activists, cited fear and disruption within their communities as the motivation for their protest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed a sweeping tax and spending bill into law, securing a major legislative achievement for his administration that fulfills long-standing conservative goals. The law permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts while instituting significant funding increases for immigration enforcement and deep cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. While Republicans champion the law as a catalyst for economic growth, Democrats and immigrant rights advocates have condemned it, warning it will harm vulnerable families and give the administration a "blank check" to terrorize communities. The bill passed on narrow, party-line votes in Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany began its Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, it was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Gwinn, who has a history of two ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, casting doubt on her future participation in the tournament. The team's performance was solid but not flawless, highlighting areas for improvement as they prepare to face tougher opponents in their group.</p>

          <p>A new executive order signed by President Trump will implement significant changes at U.S. national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international visitors and giving U.S. residents preferential treatment in lotteries or permit systems. The order states that revenue from the increased foreign tourist fees will be used for park infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the directive revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in the management and storytelling within public lands, aligning with the administration's broader move to end government DEI programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's efforts to position itself as the leader of the Global South through alliances like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) are often complicated by the group's consensus-based rules and the presence of India. As another major contender for influence, India can effectively block initiatives it opposes. This dynamic was evident at a recent SCO defense ministers' meeting, where India's objections over language related to terrorism prevented the adoption of a joint statement. This highlights the underlying tensions and strategic competition between the two Asian giants within these multilateral forums.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease outlines five "toxic" food categories he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and bacon because of sodium and nitrates. He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and using an air fryer for a healthy crunch.</p>
