            <p>Rhian Mannings and Andrea Evans forged an enduring friendship from the depths of tragedy after Andrea, a nurse, cared for Rhian's one-year-old son George as he succumbed to pneumonia in 2012. The article explores the profound emotional impact the death of a child has on both parents and healthcare professionals. Following George's death, Rhian's husband Paul tragically took his own life five days later, compounding her grief. This led Rhian to establish a charity, 2Wish, offering support to families experiencing sudden child loss, while Andrea advocates for mental health support for professionals facing similar emotional tolls.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent report suggests that the increasing demand for data centers driven by AI could lead to higher utility bills for consumers in the U.S. and U.K. The Harvard Electricity Law Initiative identifies special contracts between utilities and data center companies as a potential mechanism for shifting costs. In the U.K., proposed electricity market reforms, such as zonal pricing, could disproportionately benefit data centers while raising wholesale prices for most consumers. Experts advocate for regulatory oversight and energy grid reform to ensure fair pricing and prevent overbuilt infrastructure, emphasizing the need for data centers to pay for the costs they impose on the grid.

            <p>Conservationists are sounding the alarm as wildfires across the UK, exacerbated by dry conditions, are pushing endangered wildlife closer to extinction. Rare birds like hen harriers and mammals like water voles are particularly vulnerable, with habitats and food sources destroyed. The National Trust reports significant damage to breeding grounds and newly planted trees, while the Woodland Trust highlights the loss of irreplaceable temperate rainforest. Experts are calling for increased oversight of controlled burns, better monitoring of wildfire impacts, and government funding for peat bog restoration to mitigate the devastating effects on the UK's already depleted natural environment.</p>

            <p>President Trump's refusal to comply with court orders to facilitate the return of a deported Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, has raised concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. Legal experts and scholars are questioning whether the U.S. system of governance is at risk if the president disregards court rulings. While some believe the administration's actions represent a tipping point, others argue that legal nuances and the judiciary's tools for enforcement could prevent a complete breakdown.
