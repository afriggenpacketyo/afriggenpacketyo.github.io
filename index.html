          <p>Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, is advocating for nationwide regulations on advertising and exclusion lists within the rapidly expanding US gambling industry. He likens the current environment to a "highway without speed limits," emphasizing the need for regulators to ensure responsible practices and protect citizens from potential harm. Maynard stresses the importance of balancing the economic benefits of legal betting with the social impact of gambling's rise, including concerns about underage gambling and the need for transparency from operators. He believes that artificial intelligence could be used to promote healthy betting behaviors, and he pushes back against the industry's use of the unregulated market as a deterrent to proposed regulations. </p>

The FBI informed them about the attack due to their visible Jewish identity, emphasizing the potential danger they faced. Soliman, an illegal Egyptian immigrant, admitted to planning the attack for over a year, expressing a desire to harm "Zionist people."</p>

          <p>David French analyzes Justice Jackson's role in shaping the discussion around diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) by focusing on the balance between individual rights and group considerations. The Supreme Court's unanimous decision in *Ames v. Ohio*, authored by Justice Jackson, underscores the importance of treating individuals as individuals rather than solely as members of a group. The case involved a heterosexual woman who alleged discrimination based on sexual orientation, highlighting the complexities of DEI and the need for institutions to avoid malicious discrimination. Justice Jackson's opinion emphasizes the necessity of ceasing discriminatory practices while prompting reflection on the extent to which institutions should actively assist targeted groups to increase diversity. </p>

          <p>In Vietnam, the term "Cali" has become a derogatory label used by nationalists to criticize those perceived as opposing state policy or aligning with American influence. The term, referring to the Vietnamese diaspora in California who still fly the flag of South Vietnam, symbolizes American imperialism for many in Vietnam. This sentiment has grown stronger in recent years, with examples such as attacks on a U.S.-backed university and online harassment of celebrities associated with anti-communist activities. The Vietnamese government's control over media and online content contributes to this nationalistic environment, making it challenging for dissenting views to be expressed without facing ostracism.</p>

While some see this introspection as necessary for future success, others criticize it as excessive self-pity that distracts from the need for strong opposition to the current administration. The article explores whether the Democratic Party's ideals are truly unappealing to voters or if external factors, such as right-wing influence, are to blame.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged the West to strengthen Ukraine's air defense capabilities, emphasizing the need for concrete signals and assistance. He framed Russia's expanding attacks as proof that President Vladimir Putin is not genuine in his willingness to negotiate a peace deal. Zelenskyy called for increased pressure on Russia to force a realistic outcome in negotiations, highlighting the importance of sanctions on Russian oil and those who trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector to fund research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package includes up to ¬£500 million for regions across the UK, with local leaders deciding how the money is spent. The government believes this investment will create jobs and boost security, but research backers warn that more needs to be done to secure the UK's reputation for science. The chancellor has warned that her Spending Review will reflect a squeeze on government funding.</p>
