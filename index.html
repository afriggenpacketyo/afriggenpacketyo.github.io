          <p>Catherine Connolly, an independent backed by left-wing parties, has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland after securing a landslide victory with 63% of first preference votes. Connolly pledged to be an inclusive president, advocating for peace, neutrality, and addressing climate change, in her acceptance speech delivered in both Irish and English. Humphreys, Connolly's rival, conceded defeat and wished her well, acknowledging Connolly's role as president for all citizens. Connolly will succeed Michael D Higgins, who served the maximum two terms, and Taoiseach Micheál Martin praised Connolly's election, highlighting the clear mandate given by the people.

          <p>President Trump, en route to the ASEAN summit, expressed his openness to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, potentially marking their first encounter since 2019. Trump emphasized his positive relationship with Kim and indicated willingness to engage in dialogue. However, Kim has stated he would only meet if Washington recognizes North Korea as a nuclear state, a demand Trump addressed by acknowledging North Korea's nuclear capabilities. Seoul's reunification minister suggested a "considerable" chance of a Trump-Kim meeting, setting the stage for potential diplomatic developments in Asia.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: European Sexual Assault Statistics Misleading</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An online graphic claiming the UK has the highest rate of sexual assault in Europe is misleading due to variations in legal definitions and reporting practices. The article explains that the UK's higher rate reflects its broader definition of sexual assault and its reporting practices, where a case is counted upon filing a police report. Criminologists suggest victim surveys as a more accurate measure, noting that crime statistics only capture reported cases. The article also refutes claims linking immigration to sexual assault rates, highlighting that the UK and the Netherlands have similar shares of foreign-born residents but vastly different reported sexual assault rates.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which proposes redrawing congressional district lines, is being framed as a way to oppose Donald Trump and counter Republican gerrymandering efforts. Democrats are using anti-Trump sentiment to garner support for the measure, which would allow them to create five additional safe seats. While some voters have reservations about abandoning non-partisan district maps, polls suggest Proposition 50 is likely to pass due to strong opposition to Trump.
