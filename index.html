          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James, expanding its investigation into her office's handling of civil cases against former President Trump and the National Rifle Association. According to a source, the probe, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, is examining whether James violated the civil rights of the defendants. James's office and her attorney have condemned the investigation as a "blatant and desperate example" of political retribution and a "weaponization of the justice system" by the Trump administration. This development follows earlier reports of a separate FBI criminal fraud probe into James.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, citing concerns over his alleged investments in Chinese companies linked to the country's military. The call is highly unusual and has created a clash between the White House and the tech giant, which receives substantial US government funding to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Intel's board has defended Tan, stating his commitment to US national security, while some analysts suggest the pressure may be a tactic related to other disputes over Intel's investment strategies. The controversy has caused a dip in Intel's stock price and adds to the challenges facing the company.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy has been found guilty of murdering fellow student Harvey Willgoose, also 15, at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. The verdict came after a month-long trial where the jury heard the defendant stabbed Willgoose in the heart with a hunting knife during a lunch break, following a social media dispute. The defendant admitted to manslaughter but denied murder, claiming he "snapped" due to bullying and feared others carried knives. The prosecution argued he acted deliberately to appear "hard." The victim's family expressed relief at the verdict and called for action against knife crime.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is significantly boosting the digital advertising revenues for tech giants like Meta and Alphabet, which both reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg credited AI with improving the efficiency of its ad systems, leading to a 22% sales increase. While Reddit also showed strong growth, smaller platforms like Snap and Pinterest delivered lukewarm results, struggling with issues such as botched ad platform updates and advertiser pullback. This trend highlights a growing divergence where large companies effectively leverage massive AI investments to dominate the market, leaving less room for error for their smaller rivals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, pausing construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center in South Florida. The order responds to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the project violates environmental laws by threatening sensitive wetlands and protected species. While the order halts activities like paving and fencing, it does not affect current or incoming detainees. This is one of two legal challenges against the facility, with another lawsuit from civil rights groups alleging constitutional violations set for a later hearing.</p>

In a letter to employees, Tan defended his record, asserting he has always operated with the highest ethical standards and has the full support of Intel's board. He also expressed his support for Trump's agenda of advancing U.S. national and economic security, aiming to de-escalate the high-profile conflict.</p>

The bank aims to challenge peers in managing money for wealthy clients and institutions, seeing it as a key area for future growth. This move is intended to create more stable, fee-based revenue streams to counterbalance the cyclical nature of its traditional dealmaking business. Marc Nachmann, the global head of AWM, explained the strategy involves increasing advisor headcount, expanding internationally, and growing its lending services for ultra-high-net-worth clients to gain market share in a fragmented sector.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Trump administration has proposed revoking a 2009 "endangerment finding," which serves as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. If passed, this would repeal emissions standards for cars and trucks, easing the pressure on automakers to produce electric vehicles (EVs). Experts suggest this would give manufacturers more flexibility to align their production with consumer demand, which has recently seen a slight slowdown in EV adoption. While the move could shift long-term strategies, automakers' decisions will still be driven by global competition and existing investments in EV technology.</p>

These sales of homegrown talent are recorded as "pure profit" in accounting, providing significant financial flexibility to fund new signings.

The 2-1 decision by the D.C.

Analysts suggest that a more supportive regulatory environment and the absence of major crypto industry "blowups" are also contributing to this shift.

          <p>The Trump administration intends to end "Solar for All," a $7 billion federal program designed to help over 900,000 low-income households access affordable solar energy. The Environmental Protection Agency claims the program was repealed by a recent spending bill, a conclusion that grantees are prepared to challenge in court. The program funded rooftop and community solar projects, aiming to reduce utility bills and pollution for disadvantaged communities. Critics of the move, including Democratic Governor Jared Polis of Colorado, argue that eliminating the program will strip cost-saving solutions from hardworking families and hinder progress on renewable energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of archaeologists from East Carolina University believes they may have found the wreck of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded and sank during an attack on a North Carolina port in 1748. The discovery was made at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site, where researchers found four shipwrecks in total. Wood samples from one wreck suggest it was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon from La Fortuna was previously recovered. The remains are being carefully recovered for conservation and further study to confirm the ship's identity and shed light on colonial maritime history.</p>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, forensic scientists have successfully identified three more victims using advanced DNA testing techniques. The New York City chief medical examiner's office named two of the individuals as Barbara Keating, 72, and Ryan Fitzgerald, 26, while the third victim's identity was withheld at her family's request. This development brings the total number of identified victims to 1,653 out of the 2,753 who died at the World Trade Center. Officials credited enhancements in DNA extraction from bone fragments and sustained outreach to families for the breakthrough, reaffirming their commitment to identifying all the victims.</p>

Altman believes that as long as the models continue to improve on their current trajectory, it is rational to operate without focusing on profitability.

          <p>The music industry is remembering the lives and legacies of two influential figures, Sly Stone and Brian Wilson, who both passed away this week at the age of 82. Sly Stone, frontman of the pioneering funk and soul group Sly and the Family Stone, was celebrated for his revolutionary sound and for leading one of the first major racially integrated, co-ed bands. Brian Wilson was the creative genius behind The Beach Boys, crafting a unique sound that defined an era of American pop culture with songs about surf, sun, and cars. Both artists left an indelible mark on music history through their distinct and groundbreaking contributions.</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will halt the export of any military equipment to Israel that could be used in its operations in the Gaza Strip. The decision, announced by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is a direct response to Israel's expanded military action and reflects Germany's growing concern over the humanitarian crisis and civilian suffering in Gaza. This move is a significant step for Germany, which is historically one of Israel's closest allies and its second-largest arms supplier. The suspension does not necessarily affect exports for systems unrelated to the Gaza offensive, such as naval or missile defense equipment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed a seven-day surge of federal law enforcement in Washington D.C. to crack down on violent crime, an operation that began Thursday night. The move follows an injury to a known administration figure during an attempted carjacking and the president's threat to "federalize" the city. The White House stated the operation will focus on high-traffic tourist areas and involves multiple federal agencies, including the U.S. Park Police and ICE, working with local police. This action comes despite city data showing that violent crime in D.C. hit a 30-year low in 2024 and has continued to decline in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, under Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, is reportedly avoiding public discussion of President Trump's ambitious "Golden Dome" missile defense plan. At a major space and missile defense symposium, officials were barred from speaking publicly about the project, instead holding a closed-door meeting. The article suggests this secrecy may be because the concept is still ill-defined, with critics noting that basing it on Israel's Iron Dome reveals a misunderstanding of the technology required for a continental defense system against intercontinental ballistic missiles. The initiative, a successor to Reagan's "Star Wars," faces questions about its feasibility, cost, and potential to destabilize nuclear deterrence.</p>

This sale represents a strategic retrenchment for Allen, whose company had rapidly expanded in recent years with the goal of becoming the largest independent TV operator but accumulated significant debt.

Key resources like the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool have been taken down.

          <p>A High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, has ruled that the remains of former Zambian President Edgar Lungu must be returned to Zambia for a state funeral. The ruling came after a dispute between Lungu's family, who wished for him to be buried in South Africa, and the Zambian government, which insisted on repatriating his body. The court determined that a state's right to honor a former leader with a state funeral outweighs the personal wishes of the family. The conflict is rooted in political tensions between Lungu and his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema, whom Lungu's family did not want near the funeral.</p>
