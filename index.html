          <h2>UK Economic Output Unexpectedly Declines by 0.1% in May</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 02:48:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of decline and defying analyst predictions of slight growth. This setback for the government's economic agenda was primarily driven by a drop in manufacturing output and weak retail sales figures, according to the Office for National Statistics. Despite the monthly downturn, the economy showed a modest 0.5% growth over the three-month period ending in May, though business groups noted ongoing pressures across various sectors. The data highlights persistent challenges for the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 35% tariff on all goods imported from Canada, effective August 1. In a public letter, the administration cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. as a primary justification, while also mentioning trade deficits and other barriers. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney responded by reaffirming his government's commitment to defending Canadian businesses and collaborating on the fentanyl issue. The move escalates trade tensions as the two nations approach a revised deadline for negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

West Midlands Police stated that extensive search efforts were made by emergency services before the discovery was made in Powell's Pool. The death is not being treated as suspicious, and the boy's family is receiving support from authorities during this tragic time.

          <p>The European Union is bracing for further trade conflict with the United States following President Trump's announcement of a 35% tariff on Canadian goods. The administration has indicated that a similar letter outlining new tariffs for the EU is forthcoming, disrupting ongoing negotiations aimed at averting such measures by an August 1 deadline. This development has caused concern in European markets, with stock futures dipping in response to the heightened uncertainty. The EU currently faces significant US tariffs on various exports and has stated it will implement countermeasures if a deal is not reached.</p>

However, Perth and Kinross Council denied the request, stating the proposed changes would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character.

The administration also announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods, linking it to the political trial of its former president.

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player via social media. While the player was not officially named, reports identify him as American NBL star Montrezl Harrell of the Adelaide 36ers. The arrest is being hailed by Basketball Australia as a 'landmark moment' in the fight against online abuse targeting athletes. The man was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass, or offend and is scheduled to appear in court in August. The incident has reinforced the league's zero-tolerance stance on racism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to begin a significant reduction of its domestic workforce, with plans to cut staff by about 15% through layoffs and voluntary departures. The move is part of a sweeping reorganization by the Trump administration aimed at streamlining what officials describe as a 'bloated bureaucracy' and focusing resources on core diplomatic priorities. The cuts, affecting roughly 1,800 U.S.-based positions, are designed to consolidate functions and eliminate redundant offices. Critics and employee associations have expressed alarm, arguing the move could weaken American diplomacy and demoralize the workforce.</p>

          <p>A report from the National Audit Office (NAO), the UK's public spending watchdog, has found that Britain's F-35 stealth jet program is undermined by delays, infrastructure gaps, and personnel shortages. The NAO stated there has been a 'disappointing return' on the £11 billion spent so far, with the fleet's full mission capability falling far short of targets. Key weapons integrations have been delayed until the 2030s, and the watchdog's cost estimate for expanding the fleet is over three times the Ministry of Defence's forecast. The MoD responded that the program remains within budget.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has reported that there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe war crimes and crimes against humanity are currently being committed in Sudan's Darfur region. An ICC probe uncovered disturbing findings, including targeted sexual violence against women and girls of specific ethnicities, as part of an 'inescapable pattern of offending.' The investigation was launched after the civil war between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces erupted in 2023, leading to devastating civilian suffering. Conditions continue to worsen, with aid blockades, targeted attacks, and an escalating famine gripping the region.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Brant Frost IV, a prominent Georgia Republican, operated a massive Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint states his firm, First Liberty Building and Loan, lied to investors about making high-interest loans and instead used new funds to pay earlier investors. Frost is alleged to have personally taken over $19 million from the scheme for personal expenses, including jewelry and political contributions, even as the business was collapsing.</p>

          <p>Economists are closely watching for China's upcoming first-half economic data to assess whether more fiscal stimulus is required to counteract external pressures and domestic weakness. While growth is expected to meet the official 5% target, concerns remain that the headline figure may hide underlying issues in demand and employment. With rising trade uncertainty, particularly from potential U.S. tariffs, many analysts are calling for more forceful and proactive government support to ensure the economy remains on track. The data will be critical in determining the next phase of Beijing's economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a boom in the adoption of electric-powered heavy trucks, which is significantly reducing the nation's diesel consumption and overall oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and a rapid expansion of charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This shift, combined with the rise of LNG-powered trucks, has led analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts. The trend is accelerating predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak, with some now expecting it to happen this year. (not investment advice)</p>

This comes in response to a New York Times report, citing Israeli officials, which suggests that a portion of Iran's enriched uranium survived the B-2 bomber attack on underground sites. President Trump and his administration have consistently maintained that the raid was a decisive success that neutralized Iran's nuclear program. In this article, the administration reiterates its position and criticizes what it calls 'fake news' for casting doubt on the operation's outcome.</p>

This decision pauses one of the administration's priority immigration policies and challenges its constitutionality under the 14th Amendment.
