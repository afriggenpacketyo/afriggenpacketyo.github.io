          <p>The 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin concluded, highlighting Beijing's ambition to reshape the global order amidst U.S. trade policies and tariffs. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a "more just and balanced international governance framework," criticizing "Cold War mentality and bullying." Key takeaways included a significant thawing of India-China relations, a symbolic gathering of Xi, Putin, and Modi, and commitments to bolster artificial intelligence cooperation, including a roadmap for joint development. Furthermore, member states explored establishing an SCO development bank to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar, underscoring China's push for alternative global financial structures.

          <p>A group of 11 former Premier League footballers, including Danny Murphy and Rod Wallace, allege they lost tens of millions of pounds due to unsuitable investment advice from Kingsbridge Asset Management. These athletes, part of the V11 campaign, invested in film financing and property schemes, which later left many facing bankruptcy, home loss, and substantial tax bills. The advisers deny misconduct, citing HMRC policy shifts and the 2008 property crash as causes. The article underscores the "financial abuse" faced by young, inexperienced players who trusted their advisers as friends. The V11 group now seeks to change laws to protect victims of such financial crimes from severe tax charges, emphasizing the emotional and financial toll on their lives.</p>

          <p>British pubs, integral to the nation's culture and economy, are facing a severe crisis, with projections indicating 378 closures in 2025, resulting in over 5,600 direct job losses. This challenging environment stems from a confluence of reduced consumer spending and soaring operational costs, including hikes in minimum wage, National Insurance contributions, and business rates. Publicans are increasingly compelled to raise prices, pushing the average pint of beer above £5. The article underscores the significant economic contribution of the pub sector, which supports £30 billion and one million jobs. Industry bodies are urging the government to implement urgent measures like cutting business rates and VAT to safeguard this vital industry.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has initiated a direct campaign to warn approximately 130,000 international students and their families against overstaying visas and making unsubstantiated asylum claims. This measure addresses an "alarming" rise in individuals entering legally on student visas who then seek asylum as their permits expire. Messages explicitly state that those without legal right to remain will be removed, and meritless asylum claims will be refused. While acknowledging legitimate cases, the government aims to curb the use of the asylum system as a means to extend stays. This article highlights the government's intensified efforts to manage immigration and reduce the number of asylum applications from visa holders.</p>

          <p>Utah faces a severe shortage of affordable starter homes, with median prices exceeding half a million dollars, pushing homeownership out of reach for many young families. Governor Spencer Cox initiated a goal to construct 35,000 lower-cost homes within five years, yet only about 5,100 have been built or started. While state lawmakers have provided incentives like low-interest construction loans, housing experts contend that more fundamental changes, particularly to restrictive zoning laws, are essential for significant progress. This article showcases a developer in Plain City who successfully built starter homes under $400,000 by leveraging state assistance and smaller plots.

The judge cited legal protections under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which mandates that migrant children not from Mexico must have access to an immigration judge and apply for legal protections before deportation. Attorneys argued that the government's "repatriation" plan circumvented these rights, potentially exposing children to abuse or persecution.

This declaration follows a U.S. appeals court ruling that found his administration exceeded its authority by imposing levies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs are provisionally maintained until October 14 to allow for a Supreme Court appeal.
