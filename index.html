        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly revised his guidance on cryptocurrency investments, now suggesting that portfolios could allocate between 10% and 40% to the asset class. This marks a substantial increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage, reflecting his view that crypto has evolved into a mainstream asset. Edelman attributes this shift to the resolution of earlier uncertainties regarding regulation and adoption, as well as the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-bond model due to increased human longevity. He argues that crypto's lack of correlation with other assets makes it a valuable tool for portfolio diversification and achieving higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly terminated all trade discussions with Canada in response to Ottawa's implementation of a new digital services tax targeting major technology companies. President Trump characterized the tax as a "blatant attack" on the U.S. and announced that retaliatory tariffs against Canada would be detailed within a week. The move jeopardizes a trade relationship valued at over $762 billion annually and caused a negative reaction in the stock market. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed disappointment, noting the administration had hoped Canada would pause the tax, which applies retroactively, as a gesture of goodwill.</p>

          <p>Despite concessions from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, significant discontent remains among Labour backbenchers regarding the government's proposed welfare reforms. After a revolt from his own MPs, Starmer agreed that stricter benefit criteria would only apply to new claimants, but many feel this does not fix a "broken bill." Critics, including Work and Pensions Select Committee Chair Debbie Abrahams, argue the changes are insufficient to protect future claimants and are still planning to oppose the measures. The episode has left many MPs feeling ignored by party leadership, fueling concerns about a pattern of cost-cutting to meet fiscal targets at the expense of vulnerable people.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat impacts large parts of the U.S., medical experts are warning about its significant effects on brain function and mental health. High temperatures can lead to increased irritability, anxiety, and impaired cognitive abilities such as memory, attention, and reaction time. Dr. Jace Reed of Cedars-Sinai notes that severe confusion can be an early sign of heat stroke, a serious medical emergency. Experts also highlight that heat can worsen existing psychiatric conditions and interfere with certain medications, making it harder for the body to regulate its temperature. They recommend staying hydrated, avoiding peak heat, and using cooling methods to protect cognitive health.</p>

          <p>President Trump celebrated a Supreme Court decision that curtails the power of lower federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against his executive policies, specifically his order to end birthright citizenship. The 6-3 ruling does not address the constitutionality of the order itself, which remains subject to ongoing legal challenges that will be heard in the next term. However, the administration praised the decision for reining in what it called "radical left judges" who overstepped their authority. Democratic leaders condemned the ruling, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling it a "terrifying step toward authoritarianism" that weakens the judiciary's ability to check executive power.</p>

The investigation is part of a broader national effort by the administration to scrutinize and scale back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at prominent universities.

Los Angeles Fire Department's interim chief, Ronnie Villanueva, urged residents to prepare their homes by clearing flammable materials and to have evacuation plans ready for the return of Santa Ana winds.

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law requiring age verification for pornographic websites, a decision that significantly alters the legal landscape for regulating sexual content online. In the majority opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas shifted the legal test for such laws from "strict scrutiny" to the less rigid "intermediate scrutiny," giving states more leeway to restrict access to pornography to shield minors. The ruling dismisses privacy concerns raised by plaintiffs, who argued that requiring ID verification would deter adults from viewing legal content. This change reverses decades of precedent and may lead to more government regulation of online sexual speech, creating new legal battles for courts to navigate.</p>

The market's recovery has been further supported by a strong performance in technology stocks and recent positive trade developments, including a reported agreement with China.

After losing a Supreme Court case to prevent his return from El Salvador, the administration is now threatening to deport him again to a third country to prevent his court-ordered release pending trial. The case has exposed the administration's willingness to protect convicted felons from deportation in exchange for testimony against Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal record.

          <p>Following a week of perceived victories, including a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting judicial oversight, President Trump held a press conference exuding a sense of invincibility. The article provides a political analysis of this moment, framing the court's decision as another step in removing checks on executive power in an administration that has already marginalized other democratic institutions. The commentary notes that with a court containing three of his appointees, Trump appears emboldened to pursue his agenda with impunity. The piece portrays a president who feels untouchable, basking in his recent successes both domestically and in foreign policy while dismissing criticism and goading the media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Pew Charitable Trusts reveals a significant gap in retirement preparedness, with approximately 56 million private-sector workers in the U.S. lacking access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. This barrier makes it difficult for about half of the workforce to build sufficient savings for their later years. The research underscores a growing divide between retirement "haves" and "have-nots," as employees without access to plans like a 401(k) are 15 times less likely to save. Experts call the situation a crisis, emphasizing that it highlights systemic inequality rather than a lack of personal responsibility, and places greater strain on the Social Security system.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is disrupting the job market for entry-level tech positions, leading to a reevaluation of the once-guaranteed career path for computer-science majors. As AI becomes more capable of writing code, some tech executives report needing fewer junior engineers, a trend that may be contributing to an unusually high unemployment rate for young college graduates. This shift is causing some students to reconsider their majors and prompting universities to adapt their curricula. Experts suggest that in an era of rapid technological change, students may benefit more from developing durable, human-centric skills rather than focusing solely on pre-professional training that could become obsolete.</p>

While many of the company's products, like Uncrustables, are already free from these additives, the change will affect items such as sugar-free jams and some Hostess brand snacks. Smucker's decision follows similar pledges from other major food corporations, including Nestle and Kraft Heinz, amid increasing federal scrutiny of artificial food dyes and their potential health risks.</p>

          <p>This summer's movie offerings include two major studio releases that provide large-scale entertainment. The film "F1" stars Brad Pitt as a veteran race car driver, delivering spectacular racing sequences alongside a solid, if sometimes clichÃ©, dramatic storyline that explores the broader racing industry. In the sci-fi horror sequel "M3gan 2.0," the titular AI doll returns in a bigger, more comedic follow-up that pits her against a new android threat. While the sequel leans more into humor and action than horror, it is praised as an entertaining and visually improved film that cleverly comments on the anxieties surrounding artificial intelligence.</p>

In a rare move, Justice Sotomayor read her dissent from the bench in a case limiting judicial power, warning that "no right is safe" under the new legal regime. Justice Jackson described the same ruling as an "existential threat to the rule of law." These powerful dissents argue that the conservative majority is expanding executive power, undermining the rule of law, and creating impossible burdens for citizens and public institutions, reflecting a sharply divided and contentious court.</p>

          <p>California legislators have voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and industry workers who have been lobbying for support as productions are increasingly lured to other states with more generous incentives. This expansion aims to revitalize the local industry, which has faced challenges from the pandemic, labor strikes, and out-of-state competition. A related bill is also advancing that would broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the potential tax offset for productions filming within the state.</p>

          <p>The recent 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran, which saw direct U.S. military involvement, offers insight into President Trump's second-term foreign policy approach. While he authorized bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, his quick pivot to a ceasefire suggests a continued aversion to prolonged, regime-change wars. The analysis posits that Trump views military force not as a tool for ideological transformation but as a means to gain leverage in negotiations with existing world leaders. His actionsâ€”supporting Israel's attack, then pressuring both sides to de-escalateâ€”indicate a transactional and often unpredictable strategy aimed at securing deals while avoiding costly, open-ended entanglements.</p>

Initially canceled after one season in 2005, it was revived for a second season in 2014 and has since garnered a dedicated cult following. Kudrow's portrayal of Cherish has earned her two Emmy nominations, and the series is celebrated for its sharp, satirical take on Hollywood and reality television.</p>

The original executive order from April is not flexible unless formally changed, creating uncertainty for global markets that were previously destabilized by the tariff announcements.

          <p>Police in Huntington Park, California, have arrested a man suspected of posing as a federal immigration agent. The suspect's vehicle was found equipped with police lights and radios, and officers discovered a list of U.S. Customs and Border Protection radio codes inside, along with an unlicensed handgun. The arrest comes amid heightened community concern over the tactics of federal immigration agents, who have been seen conducting enforcement actions in plain clothes and masks. Local officials have expressed worries that such practices could enable criminals to impersonate law enforcement and have called for greater accountability from federal agencies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump affirmed that he would "absolutely" consider ordering military strikes on Iran again if intelligence indicated the country was advancing its uranium enrichment capabilities. Speaking at a White House press briefing, Trump reiterated his claim that recent U.S. and Israeli bombings had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites, a statement Iran's foreign minister has partially confirmed by admitting to "excessive and serious" damage. Trump also asserted on social media that he knew the location of Iran's Supreme Leader during the conflict and had personally prevented him from being targeted, underscoring a volatile and confrontational posture despite a recent ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Relatives of the 67 people killed in the January collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter are urging Congress to increase funding for modernizing the nation's air traffic control system. While a pending domestic policy bill allocates $12.5 billion for upgrades, advocates and industry experts say this is only a fraction of the more than $31 billion needed for a complete overhaul. The families are also calling for an independent safety review of the crowded airspace around Washington, D.C., where the crash occurred. They stress that while they are grieving, they feel compelled to advocate for safer skies.</p>
