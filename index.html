          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 17:06:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's shares experienced a significant 27% spike in after-hours trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business. Despite narrowly missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates, the company reported a massive increase in its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue. This growth is largely attributed to the artificial intelligence boom, with Oracle securing several multi-billion dollar cloud contracts, including one with OpenAI, signaling strong investor confidence in its future performance.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to expedite a hearing on the legality of its widespread tariffs. The case, which will be heard in November, challenges lower court rulings that found President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing the duties under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The administration argued for the accelerated timeline by warning that a delayed negative ruling could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion in collected tariffs, creating significant financial risk.</p>

          <p>Key inflation data to be released this week is anticipated to show that consumer and producer prices accelerated in August. Economists predict a monthly increase of 0.3%, pushing the annual headline consumer price index to 2.9%. However, this rise is not expected to prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, as the core inflation reading is predicted to remain stable and the price hikes are largely attributed to tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader services.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly engaged with William Parker, a researcher on the fringes of academia who posits that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use in children is a primary cause of autism. This theory lacks support from the mainstream scientific community, which largely attributes the rise in autism rates to changes in diagnostic criteria and genetic factors. Parker's claims have been consistently rejected by academic journals, but he has recently had multiple conversations with Kennedy and NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, two of the five Supreme Court justices have voted to find him guilty on all charges related to plotting a coup after his 2022 election loss. A conviction requires a majority vote, meaning one more guilty verdict will seal his fate, potentially leading to a prison sentence of over 40 years. The first justice to vote, Alexandre de Moraes, presented evidence of a detailed plot and accused Bolsonaro of leading a "criminal organisation" that sought to undermine democracy.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul condemned an ICE raid at a candy factory as "cruel" and contrary to the state's values, highlighting that families were being separated. The operation resulted in the arrest of 57 undocumented immigrants, some of whom had prior criminal convictions or pending charges for offenses like child endangerment and DUI. A Homeland Security spokesperson defended the action, stating that such worksite enforcement operations are essential for targeting illegal employment networks and protecting public safety.</p>

Protesters are channeling deep-seated frustration over alleged corruption and nepotism among the political elite, demanding systemic change beyond the now-repealed social media ban.</p>

Conversely, residents in states with lower average incomes, like Mississippi and West Virginia, are expected to see the smallest reductions.

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation, which includes restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, facilitated by Egypt, comes after Iran suspended all cooperation with the UN watchdog following a war with Israel in June. This development is a crucial step toward restoring transparency and verification of Iran's nuclear program at a time of heightened international tensions and the reimposition of sanctions by European powers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Manchester City's Erling Haaland suggests his phenomenal goalscoring record is due more to his ability to create high-quality chances than to his clinical finishing. While an excellent scorer, data shows that his primary advantage comes from his unique combination of speed, strength, and intelligent movement, which allows him to get into optimal scoring positions more frequently than other elite strikers. This physical and tactical superiority in generating opportunities, rather than an outlier conversion rate, is identified as the key to his incredible goal tallies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeremy Siegel, a finance professor at the Wharton School, has stated that Bitcoin could become a serious competitor to the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency. He argues that the existing global financial system is too slow and expensive for international transfers, creating an opening for a decentralized, borderless alternative like Bitcoin. While he dismissed the threat from currency systems proposed by blocs like BRICS, Siegel believes cryptocurrency represents a more credible long-term challenge to the dollar's supremacy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals who experience an unexpected job loss, credit card companies are unlikely to completely waive payments. However, many issuers offer temporary assistance through hardship programs that can provide relief. These programs, which are not automatic and require proactive communication from the cardholder, may include options like temporarily pausing payments, reducing the minimum payment amount, or lowering the interest rate for a set period. It is important for borrowers to understand the terms, as interest often continues to accrue during these periods.</p>

The company's statement acknowledged that customers did not feel the modern designs reflected the brand's beloved "Old Country Store" and vintage Americana aesthetic, prompting a return to its traditional look and feel.</p>

He instead recommended Robert Plant for the former. Despite never achieving the same level of commercial fame as his peers, Reid was a highly respected artist who toured with the Rolling Stones and Cream and remained a cult favorite.</p>
