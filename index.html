          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, as a goodwill gesture to facilitate ceasefire negotiations and the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. The decision precedes President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Alexander, captured during the October 7th attack, is believed to be the last living US citizen hostage in Gaza. Israeli officials acknowledged being informed of Hamas's intention, emphasizing their commitment to achieving all war objectives through ongoing negotiations, even amidst continued military operations. The Families and Missing Families Forum expressed hope that this release marks the beginning of a comprehensive agreement to free all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Millions of Filipinos are voting in midterm elections seen as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, whose political feud has escalated. The elections will decide over 18,000 positions, including key Senate seats crucial for a potential impeachment trial against Duterte. Marcos is vying to advance his political and economic agenda, while Duterte faces charges of corruption and an assassination plot, further straining their once-allied relationship. Security has been tightened across the Philippines due to the history of violence during elections, with police and military personnel deployed to protect polling stations and ensure a peaceful process.</p>

          <p>For the last 30 years, the UK has consistently experienced higher immigration than emigration, marking a significant demographic shift. Despite various government efforts to curb net migration, numbers have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit ended freedom of movement with EU member states, giving the UK full control over immigration policies. Recent data indicates a potential fall in migration for 2024, however, the article highlights the challenge of translating rhetoric into tangible policy changes amid fluctuating immigration figures.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The measure, intended to redirect funds to federally qualified health centers, has raised concerns among GOP lawmakers representing districts Trump lost in 2024. These representatives argue that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. With a slim majority in the House, Republicans can afford little dissent, highlighting the potential for a rebellion over this controversial provision within the broader budget reconciliation process.</p>

The visit aims to deepen friendship between Taiwan and Britain, and Tsai will meet with British politicians. Despite lacking official diplomatic ties, Taiwan views Britain as a vital democratic partner, with increasing economic and political exchanges between the two sides.</p>

The talks, the first since President Trump imposed steep tariffs, have raised hopes for tariff reductions and a more stable global economy.

          <p>President Trump's plan to accept a luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One is facing criticism, with questions raised about ethical implications. The potential gift has been described as the most expensive ever received by the American government. Critics, including Laura Loomer, a far-right ally of Trump, and the Democratic National Committee, are condemning the move, citing concerns about Qatar's alleged support for groups hostile to the U.S. and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese authorities have faced criticism for removing the “Han” category from demographic groups listed on an official information page, a move seen as an effort to distance the island from mainland China. The change, made on the Executive Yuan's website, categorizes Han Chinese, the majority population on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as "other population." This decision has been criticized by the KMT, the main opposition party, who see it as a denial of history. The change comes as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party intensifies efforts to promote Taiwan’s indigenous identity.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal, a "most favored nation" pricing model, is likely to face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. In his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a version of this idea for Medicare, but it was blocked by a federal court. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>
