        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Congressional Budget Office analysis indicates that Republican's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' could disproportionately affect low-income children and families. The bill, intended to extend the 2017 Trump tax cuts, proposes changes to social safety net programs, including Medicaid and SNAP, potentially reducing healthcare, food benefits, and financial assistance. Proposed changes include work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP, which some experts argue could create administrative hurdles for families. The bill would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by roughly $800 billion over the next decade, and could eliminate or substantially reduce food assistance for more than 2 million children.</p>

          <p>President Trump did not initially acknowledge Juneteenth, the federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S., until posting on social media late in the day to complain about "too many non-working holidays." Despite previous statements recognizing the significance of Juneteenth, Trump remained silent on the issue for most of the day. Later, he criticized the cost of keeping businesses closed on holidays. The omission contrasts with past commemorations and deviates from earlier White House guidance.</p>

          <p>The UK government is arranging charter flights to repatriate British nationals from Israel once Israeli airspace re-opens, according to Foreign Secretary David Lammy. This decision follows the closure of Israeli airspace due to ongoing conflict with Iran. British nationals wishing to return home are advised to register with the Foreign Office. The UK has also temporarily withdrawn families of staff at the UK embassy in Tel Aviv and the British consulate in Jerusalem as a precautionary measure.</p>

These chemicals, known as PFAs, are used in various products and can accumulate in bodies, leading to health issues. The Royal Society of Chemistry has mapped levels of these chemicals in Britain's drinking waters and is advocating for stronger regulations. The most likely sources are industrial sites, landfill sites, and areas where firefighting foam is used.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell more than 3% as President Trump held off on helping Israel to destroy OPEC member Iran's nuclear program. Trump said he would make his decision on striking Iran within the next two weeks, but wanted to provide space for potential negotiations to take place. Despite Trump's decision, Israel is escalating its attacks on Iran after eight days of conflict, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordering intensified strikes on strategic and government targets (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Expert Doubts Effectiveness of Bombing Iran's Underground Nuclear Plant</h2>

          <p>A national security expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The expert noted that the exact nature of the concrete and metal protecting the site isn't fully known, and even the use of the untested weapon would not guarantee success. While attacking Iran's nuclear enrichment program would cripple its nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it. The expert also stated that continued military strikes would not be a good option for Israel or the U.S. if the goal is an Iran without nuclear weapons.</p>
