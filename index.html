The resolution, introduced by State Senator Brian Birdwell, aims to clarify existing constitutional prohibitions on non-citizen voting.

The industry has benefited from the adaptability of existing whiskey and shochu distillation equipment, and the quick monetization from production to sales.</p>

          <p>For the first time in 34 years, Japan has lost its status as the world's top creditor, now surpassed by Germany, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets reaching a record high, the weaker yen boosted the value of its foreign-currency assets, which were not enough to offset Germany's large current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased to 533.05 trillion yen, but Germany's totaled 569.65 trillion yen. Japan remains the second-largest holder of net external assets, followed by China, while the United States has a net external liability.</p>

Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will now primarily target younger students, requiring employers to fully fund postgraduate apprenticeships for older individuals. This initiative aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing to retrain, using increased charges on employers recruiting from outside the UK.

          <p>Severe thunderstorms caused widespread flight delays and power outages across the Southeast and central United States during the Memorial Day weekend. Over 5,000 flights were delayed, primarily affecting airports in Texas and Colorado, with Dallas Fort Worth International Airport experiencing over 1,000 delays. The storms brought damaging winds, heavy rains, and the potential for tornadoes, leading to power outages in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Despite the weather disruptions, AAA forecast a record 45.1 million Americans would travel at least 50 miles from home during the holiday period.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada, marking the King's first visit since his coronation, at a time when President Trump has threatened the countryâ€™s sovereignty. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to the King to open Canadaâ€™s Parliament is seen as a symbolic move to emphasize Canada's distinct heritage from the United States. The visit includes ceremonial events and meetings with Canadian leaders, reinforcing Canada's independent identity. The King's actions are interpreted as a subtle rebuke to Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state.</p>

A new aid system supported by Israel and the United States is set to begin operations, despite rejection from U.N. agencies and aid groups, raising questions about humanitarian principles and control of assistance.</p>

The captain of the coastguard ship faces charges including causing a shipwreck and failure to provide assistance, while other officials are charged with exposing others to danger. Survivors have expressed a sense of vindication but remain skeptical of the Greek legal system.</p>
