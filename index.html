          <p>OpenAI is backing a new large-scale AI data center in Norway, a project that marks its first major infrastructure investment of this kind in Europe. The facility, developed in a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norway's Aker, will be powered entirely by renewable energy. It aims to house 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026, significantly boosting the continent's computing capacity. This initiative aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data and AI workloads to be processed locally to enhance security and economic growth.</p>

          <p>A major Russian missile and drone attack has struck multiple districts in Kyiv, killing at least six people, including a six-year-old boy, and injuring over 50. Ukrainian officials report that a residential apartment building was hit, with an entire section destroyed, and rescuers are searching for survivors in the rubble. The attack, involving over 300 drones and missiles, occurred despite recent diplomatic pressure and threats of further sanctions from the United States. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a "demonstrative murder" and emphasized the need for strength to achieve peace.</p>

          <p>A technical failure in the UK's air traffic control (ATC) system operated by NATS caused widespread disruption, grounding flights and leading to over 150 cancellations. Although the radar-related issue was resolved within an hour by switching to a backup system, the knock-on effects are expected to last for days during the peak summer travel season. This incident has drawn sharp criticism from airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet, especially as it follows a similar major outage in 2023. The UK's Transport Secretary is meeting with the NATS chief executive to demand an explanation and prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>China's cyberspace regulator has summoned Nvidia to address national security concerns regarding its H20 artificial intelligence chips, which are designed specifically for the Chinese market. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) is investigating potential security vulnerabilities, including alleged "tracking and positioning" and "remote shutdown" capabilities. This scrutiny follows a push from U.S. lawmakers to mandate tracking features in advanced chips to prevent their misuse. The development adds another layer of geopolitical complexity for Nvidia as it navigates between U.S. export controls and the demands of the lucrative Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The French government has strongly condemned comments made by Spain's transport minister, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers removed from a flight as "Israeli kids." The joint statement from French ministers called the remark unacceptable and discriminatory, suggesting it wrongly justified the group's treatment. The incident involved 44 teenagers being deplaned from a Vueling flight in Valencia, with the airline citing safety risks from alleged misbehavior. The teens' summer camp organizer denies these claims and intends to file a complaint for discrimination and violence.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian argues that the recent trade deal between the European Union and the United States represents a significant moment of capitulation for the bloc, likening it to Britain's Suez crisis. The author contends that the EU made all major concessions, agreeing to a 15% tariff on most of its goods while eliminating its own tariffs on U.S. products. This one-sided agreement, which also includes commitments to U.S. investments and energy purchases, is seen as a sign of Europe's diminished economic and geopolitical power relative to the U.S., undermining the original vision of the EU as a co-equal global power.</p>

China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac, is marketing the C919 as a more readily available and cost-effective option.

While the policy enjoys broad public support, critics like Professor Marilyn Campbell argue there is no proven causal link between social media use and poor mental health. They suggest the ban is an overly simplistic solution to a complex problem, potentially overlooking other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety. The article also notes that social media can provide vital support for marginalized youth and that a ban may not be the most effective way to prepare young people for a technologically saturated world.</p>

          <p>India's reluctance to rush into a trade deal with the U.S. ahead of the recent tariff deadline is largely rooted in its commitment to protecting its agricultural sector. Despite facing new 25% duties, New Delhi has resisted U.S. demands for greater market access for agricultural products to shield its large population of local farmers, a crucial voting bloc. Analysts suggest that India's strategy is bolstered by its relatively low export dependence on the U.S. and its pursuit of a "multi-alignment" strategy, actively negotiating trade deals with other partners like the UK and the EU to diversify its economic relationships.

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered how organized crime gangs are taking over high street shops across Britain to sell illegal tobacco and vapes, often using forced labor and illegal workers. In Newport, South Wales, 19 shops have been shut down in nine months, yet the problem persists as criminals simply reopen or move to new locations. Residents report feeling terrified by associated criminality, including open drug dealing and intimidation. Trading Standards officers describe an "endless battle," hampered by limited legal powers to permanently close the illicit businesses.</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that the company's massive investments in AI are paying off, and he plans to increase spending further. The strong performance and optimistic revenue forecast suggest Meta's strategy to integrate AI into its core products is yielding substantial returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders in Texas are fiercely opposing a new congressional map proposed by state Republicans, calling it a "grossly unfair" and "deeply undemocratic" plan. The draft map, supported by President Trump, would redraw districts to favor the GOP in five seats currently held by Democrats, which critics argue is achieved by intentionally diluting the voting power of Black and Latino communities. Democrats warn this move constitutes a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act and could set off a retaliatory wave of partisan gerrymandering in other states across the country.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and missing analyst expectations. The slowdown is attributed to a combination of factors, including extreme weather like heatwaves and torrential rains, a traditional off-season, and ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for new orders and employment also remained in contraction territory, signaling persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services, also declined, pointing to a broader economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

Shi Mingde, China's former ambassador to Germany, stated that while the EU aims to "de-risk" from China, its economic and security reliance on the United States is even stronger and has been reinforced by the new agreement. His comments reflect Beijing's perspective that Europe's de-risking policy is a flawed attempt to contain China's growth while overlooking its own dependencies elsewhere.</p>
