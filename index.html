          <p>An initial intelligence assessment revealed that recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only delayed Tehran's nuclear program by a few months.  The assessment, from the Defense Intelligence Agency, noted that the strikes sealed entrances to enrichment facilities, but some enriched uranium was moved beforehand.  Repair time for electrical and water supplies will determine the program's resumption timeline, ranging from months to under a year. The White House strongly contested the assessment's findings.</p>

          <p>The UK government's handling of compensation for victims of the Post Office scandal is facing criticism.  The Public Accounts Committee found that many wrongly accused sub-postmasters have not received fair and timely redress. The government's approach of avoiding further contact to prevent harassment is criticized for causing further delays.
