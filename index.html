          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper commented on the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, suggesting that while a few reductions are manageable, further easing could push the economy into a "danger territory." He expressed concern that lowering rates too aggressively while inflation remains a concern could reignite price pressures and create asset bubbles in the market. Tepper noted that while he is not betting against stocks due to the Fed's current easing stance, he finds current market valuations to be uncomfortably high and believes nothing is cheap anymore.

          <p>Representative Ilhan Omar narrowly avoided a censure vote in the House after four Republicans joined Democrats to table the resolution brought by Representative Nancy Mace. Following the vote, Omar suggested Mace is experiencing a "mental breakdown" and needs help "before she hurts herself or one of us," claims which Mace vehemently denied. The censure resolution accused Omar of smearing the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk and inciting political violence. The exchange highlights the deeply acrimonious and personal nature of current political discourse within the U.S. Congress.</p>

          <p>During a joint news conference on his state visit to the UK, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer could deploy the military to stop illegal migration across the English Channel. Trump stated he told the prime minister he would "stop it" regardless of the means used, warning that unchecked immigration "destroys countries from within." In response, Starmer emphasized that his government is taking the issue seriously, pointing to recent migrant return deals with other nations, including a new one-in, one-out agreement with France, as part of a multi-faceted approach to the problem.</p>

The company is investing $26 billion to expand its American operations, aiming to have over 80% of its U.S. vehicles produced locally by 2030.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed to stop the expulsion of over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend. Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, found no evidence that the children's parents had requested their return, citing a Guatemalan government report that contradicted the administration's claims. The decision reaffirms legal protections for unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. without legal permission.</p>

          <p>This article explores the philosophy of 17th-century thinker Baruch Spinoza as a tool for managing emotional responses to public criticism and online attacks. Despite facing widespread condemnation for his ideas, Spinoza advocated for using rational understanding, or metacognition, to gain power over one's emotions rather than being controlled by them. By observing feelings from a distance, one can move from a reactive state governed by the brain's limbic system to a more considered one in the prefrontal cortex. The article suggests practical steps like pausing before reacting and journaling to achieve this emotional equanimity in the face of modern-day censure.</p>

Rather than calling for unity, President Trump and his allies have exclusively blamed "left-wing violence" for the tragedy and promised to dismantle organizations they deem extremist. This approach redefines legitimate activities like protest, journalism, and political satire as subversive threats. The author suggests this is a long-held goal of the party's illiberal wing, now being put into action to delegitimize all political opposition.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Kevin Durant is currently unable to access his Coinbase account, which holds a significant amount of bitcoin he began purchasing in 2016. According to his agent, Rich Kleiman, they have been unable to track down the password for several years, a situation he joked has "only benefited" them as the cryptocurrency's value has soared. Durant started investing in bitcoin when it was trading for under $1,000; it is now valued at nearly $116,000. Kleiman confirmed they are working directly with Coinbase's support team to resolve the user-error issue and recover access to the account.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The storm is currently tracking northwest with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. Forecasters predict Gabrielle will remain over open waters for the next several days, though it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. While its path is projected to stay north of the Caribbean islands, the system may bring some impacts to Bermuda by early next week.</p>

          <p>Egypt's interior ministry has announced that a 3,000-year-old gold bracelet that recently disappeared from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo was stolen by a restoration specialist and subsequently melted down. The artifact, which dates to the reign of King Amenemope, was allegedly taken from a safe by the employee, who then sold it through a chain of accomplices. Four individuals have been arrested and confessed to their roles in the theft and destruction of the priceless artifact. The loss of the historic piece comes just weeks before the opening of the new Grand Egyptian Museum in Giza.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a homeowner with a $500,000 mortgage, this new rate results in a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,040. This represents a savings of about $300 per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the beginning of the year. The lower borrowing costs provide significant relief for new homebuyers and create opportunities for existing homeowners to save money through refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have located the brain's internal "mileage clock" by studying the brain activity of running rats. They discovered that specific cells in a region associated with navigation and memory fire in a regular pattern, ticking with every few steps the animal takes, effectively measuring distance traveled. When the environment was altered, this firing pattern became erratic, and the rats' ability to estimate distance was impaired. A follow-up experiment with human volunteers suggested that the human brain utilizes the same mechanism for spatial navigation and distance estimation.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C.'s top elected officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, pushed back against President Trump's declaration of a public safety emergency and the resulting federal law enforcement surge in the city. During a House Oversight Committee hearing, the leaders argued that the unilateral federal action undermines public trust and local autonomy, calling it a "manufactured crime crisis." They contended that while crime rates are at 30-year lows, the city needs long-term federal support for its police force and judicial system, not armed National Guard patrols untrained in local policing.</p>

          <p>José Mourinho's appointment as manager of Benfica, 25 years after his brief first stint, is being met with both excitement and apprehension in Portugal. While revered for his past successes, his recent career has been marked by a more conflict-driven style, and his last league title was a decade ago. The timing of the appointment is also politically charged, as it comes just before the club's presidential elections, leading some to view it as a risky maneuver by the incumbent president, Rui Costa. The article suggests that failure to win the league title with Benfica's current squad would be considered a significant failure for the veteran coach.</p>

          <p>New research projects a grim future for global health due to wildfire smoke, with one study estimating it could cause up to 1.4 million deaths annually by the end of the century if carbon emissions are not reduced. Another study focusing on the U.S. predicts that over 70,000 people will die each year from wildfire smoke by 2050. Scientists warn that fine particulate matter from burning forests is significantly more toxic than other forms of air pollution and can cause severe respiratory and heart problems. The climate crisis is identified as the primary driver behind the trend of larger and more intense fires.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased. With average rates now around 8.05%, the monthly payment on a new $100,000 HELOC with a 15-year term would be approximately $959. This is a noticeable decrease from last September when rates were closer to 9%. Because HELOCs have variable rates, these costs can change over time, but the current environment provides a less expensive opportunity for homeowners to tap into their record-high levels of home equity.

          <p>American soybean farmers are expressing desperation for a trade deal with China, as U.S. tariffs and Chinese retaliatory duties have priced their products out of a crucial market. According to a South Dakota farmer, producers are "walking a tightrope" between supporting the Trump administration's goals and suffering severe financial losses. No Chinese orders for U.S. soybeans have been placed this season, as China's overall tariff rate on the commodity reached 34% in August. The lack of a trade resolution is causing significant pain in the agricultural sector, which had previously been a strong base of support for the president.</p>

          <p>The U.S. car market is becoming increasingly dependent on wealthy consumers, as automakers focus on producing high-end vehicles while affordable options disappear. As of August, the share of new cars sold for over $50,000 has nearly doubled since 2019, while the number of models priced below $30,000 has shrunk. This trend is driven by affluent buyers who have benefited from rising asset values, while lower- and middle-income individuals are priced out of the market. Economists warn that this growing reliance on a small segment of high-income consumers poses a significant risk to the broader economy should that bubble burst.</p>
