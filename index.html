          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 18:42:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After two decades of disuse, NASA scientists have successfully revived roll thrusters on the Voyager 1 spacecraft. These thrusters, dormant since 2004, are crucial for maintaining Voyager's antenna alignment with Earth, enabling continued communication. The reactivation addresses concerns about the primary thrusters potentially failing due to residue buildup, which scientists estimate could happen as early as Fall 2025. This achievement ensures the continuation of Voyager 1's mission exploring interstellar space, nearly 15 billion miles from Earth, while a key antenna used for communicating with the probe undergoes necessary upgrades until February 2026.</p>

          <p>Jussie Smollett, the former "Empire" actor, has settled a lawsuit with the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to a local charity, Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts. The settlement resolves the city's claim for reimbursement of over $130,000 spent investigating Smollett's alleged hate crime, which police determined to be a hoax. While Smollett maintains the attack was real and had filed a countersuit, the city believes the settlement provides a fair resolution, allowing all parties to move forward from the six-year-old case. The Illinois Supreme Court had previously overturned Smollett's conviction on double jeopardy grounds.</p>

          <p>Following the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum, concerns are being raised about the adequacy of security measures at the event. While private security officers were present, neither on-duty nor off-duty Metropolitan Police Department officers were there. Former Homeland Security official John Cohen emphasized the need for heightened security at faith-based community facilities, given the current threat environment. The investigation is ongoing, with authorities reviewing writings attributed to the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, who allegedly yelled, "Free, free Palestine" during his arrest.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have passed a domestic policy bill that includes a provision to limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding officials from consequences for violating court orders. This move comes amid Republican efforts to curb the power of federal courts to issue injunctions against President Trump's executive actions. The provision would block federal judges from enforcing contempt citations if they had not previously ordered a bond, a measure Republicans claim is intended to discourage frivolous lawsuits. The bill's retroactive application raises concerns about its impact on ongoing cases involving Trump administration officials and deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's private dinner with top holders of his cryptocurrency tokens at his Virginia golf course has drawn criticism and protests, with demonstrators decrying it as a "Grift Gala." Democrats have denounced the event as an act of corruption, highlighting that many attendees have a stake in how cryptocurrencies are regulated in the United States. Crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who faces fraud charges, was among those attending, having invested heavily in Trump family crypto ventures.

The administration aims to cut "frivolous expenditures" and has already killed a lease for a new headquarters and canceled contracts with major news services.

Government experts emphasized that Covid-19 still causes a significant number of deaths, with hospitalization rates highest among people older than 65 and children younger than six months old.</p>
