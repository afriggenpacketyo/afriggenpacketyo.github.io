          <h2>UK Experiences Third Major Heatwave of the Year with Temperatures Expected to Reach 34C</h2>

          <p>The UK is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures predicted to peak at 34°C on Saturday, particularly in the Midlands and south Wales. Amber heat health alerts are active for several regions, and millions face hosepipe bans due to record-level demand for drinking water amid the prolonged warm, dry weather. The heat has also impacted events like Wimbledon, where play was paused for spectators needing medical attention, and raised concerns about wildfire and drowning risks. The heatwave is expected to subside by Monday as cooler air and rain move in.</p>

          <p>The Welsh national rugby team has ended a significant 18-match losing streak by defeating Japan 31-22 in Kobe, securing their first international win in 644 days. The victory, achieved in challenging hot and humid conditions, saw Wales build an early lead before withstanding a strong second-half comeback from Japan. Key performances from Kieran Hardy and Cai Edwards, who scored a late try to seal the win, provided a much-needed morale boost for the team. This was the final match under interim coach Matt Sherratt before a new permanent head coach is appointed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's far-right National Rally party is cautiously managing its relationship with the Trump administration, balancing ideological alignment with potential political risks. While sharing nationalistic views, the party is wary of Trump's unpopularity among many French voters and the negative economic impact of potential US tariffs on its core electorate. Party leader Marine Le Pen and president Jordan Bardella have maintained some distance from Trump's MAGA movement to preserve the party's 'normalized' image as it aims for the 2027 presidency. This delicate approach reflects the party's strategy to maximize its voter base by appealing to moderate voters.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old British tourist, Riccardo Boni, tragically died during a family vacation in Montalto di Castro, Italy, after a deep sand tunnel he was digging collapsed and buried him. The incident occurred while his father was nearby, and the teen was not discovered until his family realized he was missing. Despite frantic efforts by his family and beachgoers to dig him out, and the quick arrival of first responders, he could not be revived. Local authorities have opened an investigation into the fatal accident, which has been described as a highly unusual and devastating event.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to introduce a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. The suggestion, aimed at improving integration and educational outcomes, has drawn sharp criticism from educators and student bodies who argue it would be discriminatory and stigmatizing. Proponents believe mixed classrooms lead to better results, but critics, including the German Teachers' Association, contend the core issue is a lack of German language skills, not immigrant background. The debate highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which has shown declining performance in international studies.</p>

          <h2>Voice-Over Artists' Lawsuit Against AI Firm Lovo for Alleged Voice Theft to Proceed</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices without permission to create and sell AI-generated voice clones after hiring them for what they were told was internal or academic work. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract and deceptive practices will proceed. The case is a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over intellectual property.</p>

          <h2>Cockpit Audio from Crashed Air India Flight Reveals Mystery Over Engine Fuel Cut-Off</h2>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people has revealed a baffling detail from the cockpit voice recorder. Seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the 'cut-off' position, causing a total loss of engine power. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. Investigators are trying to determine how the safety-locked switches were activated, a move that is almost impossible to do accidentally, as they seek to understand this catastrophic accident.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have confirmed the arrest of about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two cannabis farm sites in Southern California.

          <p>Chinese power bank manufacturers are facing intense scrutiny following several incidents where defective units caught fire on commercial flights. In response, China's Civil Aviation Administration has banned passengers from carrying power banks that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This emergency rule, implemented on June 28, has caused confusion and led to large numbers of portable batteries being abandoned at airports. The situation highlights significant safety concerns with the ubiquitous devices and has prompted a broader regulatory review of power bank products and batteries.</p>

          <h2>Northern Arizona Resident Dies from Pneumonic Plague, Health Officials Confirm</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 22:28:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, a rare but serious bacterial infection. This marks the first recorded death from this form of plague in the county since 2007. Pneumonic plague is the most deadly form and can spread between people, though the disease is treatable with modern antibiotics if caught early. The bacteria is naturally present in rodent populations in the western U.S. and can be transmitted to humans through flea bites or contact with infected animals. Further details about the victim were not released.</p>
