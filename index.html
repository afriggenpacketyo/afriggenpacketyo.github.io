          <h2>Musk to Scale Back Government Role Amid Tesla Profit Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 05:04:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has committed to reducing his involvement in the US government, specifically within the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge), following a substantial decrease in Tesla's profits and sales. This decision comes after criticism that his governmental role was diverting his attention from Tesla. Despite stepping back, Musk intends to remain involved with the Trump administration to some extent, deeming the work "critical." Tesla's recent financial report revealed a 20% drop in car sales and a 70% profit decline, attributed to boycotts and trade tariffs, though shares saw a slight increase in after-hours trading.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced a significant increase after activist investor Elliott Management revealed a stake exceeding 5% in the company. Elliott's involvement has fueled speculation that BP might shift away from its green strategy and refocus on its core oil and gas businesses. Subsequently, BP announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027, marking a shift from its earlier commitment to cut emissions. This strategic change followed a drop in fourth-quarter profits and pressure from investors concerned about revenue and climate goals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's review of US-funded international organizations, including the IMF and World Bank, has sparked uncertainty about the future of US support for these institutions. Project 2025 proposes a US withdrawal, labeling them "expensive middlemen," raising concerns about their ability to address global crises. A US exit could lead to a liquidity crisis and a shift in global influence towards China, which has been expanding its financial influence through institutions like the New Development Bank.

The IMF has downgraded the UK's economic growth forecast to 1.1% for 2025, citing tariffs, rising borrowing costs, and inflation.

          <p>Coral reefs worldwide are experiencing the most severe bleaching event on record, with 84% of them affected due to rising ocean temperatures from climate change. This crisis surpasses the 2014-17 event, threatening coral health and biodiversity. Scientists emphasize that addressing climate change by reducing fossil fuel emissions is crucial to protect coral reefs. The bleaching, described as a "silent snowfall," is driven by warming waters that cause corals to expel essential algae, increasing their risk of disease and starvation.</p>

          <p>The number of births in the US increased by 1% in 2024, totaling roughly 3.6 million, according to CDC data, ending a long-term decline since 2008. This rise is primarily attributed to Hispanic and Asian women, with their birth rates increasing by 4% and 5%, respectively. However, challenges such as economic uncertainty, housing costs, and childcare expenses continue to affect US families. The report does not address the impact of abortion bans or potential policy changes aimed at encouraging higher birth rates.</p>

          <p>Numerous international students in the US, who had their legal status revoked by the Trump administration, are achieving court victories. Federal judges are issuing orders to temporarily restore students' status, challenged on the grounds that the government lacked legal basis for the revocations. The students faced potential deportation and academic disruption, prompting legal action and concerns about their future in the US. The crackdown has affected over a thousand students, causing mental and financial distress.</p>
