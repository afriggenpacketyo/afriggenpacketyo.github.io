          <p>The Supreme Court will hear a significant case next term concerning Louisiana's congressional map. The case will determine whether the creation of a second majority-Black district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, violating the 14th or 15th Amendments. This legal battle stems from redistricting efforts following the 2020 Census and balances compliance with the Voting Rights Act against the Equal Protection Clause. The outcome could have major implications for future redistricting efforts nationwide and the balance of power in the House.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests a connection between decadal solar cycle activities and the pattern of summer precipitation in China. Researchers attribute the recent trend of "south drought and north flooding" to what they term the "solar precipitation regime." The study, published in the Journal of Climate, identifies the influence of the sun's magnetic cycle on the positioning of the monsoon rain belt. These findings could be crucial for improving climate predictions and managing flood seasons in the region.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump, just one day after Trump publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies lower drug prices. The president sent letters to 17 drug companies, including Pfizer, urging them to match the lower prices paid in other countries. This event highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that price controls could stifle innovation. Bourla has previously engaged with Trump, notably during the "Operation Warp Speed" initiative for COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

          <p>An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) analysis indicates that rolling back Biden-era greenhouse gas emission standards could lead to higher gasoline prices and job losses. The report, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), projects that disincentivizing electric and fuel-efficient vehicles would increase demand for gasoline, thereby raising its cost for all consumers. The analysis also predicts a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035 under the proposed deregulation, contrasting with the administration's claims of creating consumer savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has reiterated his criticism of memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), labeling them as "digital slop" with no intrinsic value. His comments came during a debate with Jesse Pollak, the lead developer for Coinbase's Base network, regarding the nature of "contentcoins." Yakovenko argued that, similar to memecoins, these tokens offer little more than speculative value, as holders have no claim to any revenue generated from the associated content. This is despite the fact that such tokens have driven significant activity and revenue on the Solana blockchain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order to increase tariffs on imports is expected to raise consumer prices and create prolonged uncertainty for businesses, according to trade experts. The new duties, which set a baseline tariff of at least 15% for most countries, could cost the average American household over $2,000 annually. Economists warn that products like cars, clothing, and household appliances will likely become more expensive as companies pass on the increased costs. While the administration argues the policy will revive U.S. manufacturing, businesses are concerned about supply-chain disruptions and dwindling profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

Key takeaways from the hearing include evidence of significant discrepancies in the helicopter's altitude readings, the pilots' missed communications, and the FAA's failure to act on prior warnings about the helicopter route's proximity to commercial flight paths. The FAA also acknowledged that air traffic control failed to warn the airliner about the helicopter's presence.</p>

          <h2>Sixteen States Sue Trump Administration Over Pressure Campaign Against Youth Gender-Affirming Care</h2>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to minors. The lawsuit argues the administration is intimidating providers with threats of criminal prosecution and demands for patient data, creating a de facto national ban without legal authority. This legal action comes as several prominent children's hospitals have recently closed their gender clinics due to the federal pressure. The White House maintains the president has the authority to stop what it terms "mutilation and chemical castration of children."</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed a pedestrian and severely injured another while the vehicle's Autopilot software was engaged. The plaintiffs successfully argued that the driver-assistance system should have braked or alerted the driver, who admitted to being distracted by his phone. The verdict, a first of its kind to go to a jury, resulted in Tesla being ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages, a decision the company has vowed to appeal. This case marks a significant setback for Tesla and its promotion of self-driving technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that narrows the path for millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance. The court did not uphold a finding that hidden commission payments to dealers were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment leaves open the possibility for claims based on "unfair" relationships, particularly where large, undisclosed commissions were paid. The decision is a mixed result for consumers, scaling back the potential compensation liability for lenders from an estimated £30 billion to a lower range of £5-13 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary article argues that President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner is the latest move in a long-standing "war with numbers." The author posits that the administration seeks to replace objective, if sometimes unfavorable, data with a reality based on "vibes and feelings." By attacking the integrity of non-partisan institutions like the BLS, the administration risks creating a fog of misinformation where no one can accurately assess the state of the economy or other critical metrics. The piece concludes that this approach will ultimately leave everyone "bumping around helplessly in the dark."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves to strengthen their roster before the MLB trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relief pitchers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and outfielder Alex Call. While not the top-tier names some fans hoped for, the team believes these additions will raise the overall quality and depth of the club for the final stretch of the season. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever, while Call provides a versatile right-handed bat for the outfield. The front office is also counting on improved performance from its existing star players to make a deep playoff run.</p>

          <p>A psychotherapist who is herself a survivor of a religious cult explains how to recognize the warning signs of coercive groups. Gillie Jenkinson, featured in a BBC documentary, highlights tactics like "love bombing," where new members are showered with affection to gain control, and promising simple answers to life's complex problems. Other red flags include the use of insider language, an "us-versus-them" mentality, and creating a high barrier to exit, making members fear losing their identity or community if they leave. The article stresses the need for more specialized support for those who manage to escape such controlling environments.</p>

          <p>TikTok owner ByteDance disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. The data was shared by CEO Liang Rubo to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. With about half of its 120,000 employees having been with the company for over three years, the figures suggest ByteDance is a relatively stable employer within China's tech industry. The sector is famously known for its demanding "996" work culture, which ByteDance officially abandoned in 2021.</p>
