          <p>President Trump met with Senate Finance Committee Republicans at the White House to bolster support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which includes extending the 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on military and border security. The bill could add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Several Republican senators have expressed doubts about the bill, including Ron Johnson, who is pushing for deeper cuts. Trump's meeting aimed to sway senators with concerns, while Elon Musk criticized the bill as a "disgusting abomination," potentially providing political cover for some Republicans. Optimism is tempered by the bill's uncertain future and internal GOP divisions.</p>

          <p>CrowdStrike's shares fell after the cybersecurity company issued lower-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter, partially due to the ongoing impact of a widespread IT outage from the previous July.

Despite the weak guidance, CrowdStrike exceeded earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter and announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan. The company expects a $10 million to $15 million revenue impact through the end of the fiscal year related to the outage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A nearly 200-year-old condom is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam as part of an exhibition on 19th-century prostitution and sexuality. The condom, dating back to 1830, is believed to be made of a sheep's appendix and features an explicit print. Museum curator Joyce Zelen stated that the condom is in "mint condition" and is thought to have been a "luxury souvenir" from a brothel in France. The museum notes that the item embodies both the lighter and darker sides of sexual health during an era fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

          <p>Scammers stole Â£47 million from the online accounts of 100,000 people after posing as taxpayers, HMRC has revealed. The tax authority is contacting affected individuals to confirm their accounts are secure and that no money was lost. The scammers used phishing attacks to obtain customer details and attempt fraudulent rebate claims. HMRC confirmed a criminal investigation is underway with arrests made last year, emphasizing that this was not a cyber or hacking attack on their systems.</p>

          <p>Eight Mile Style, Eminemâ€™s publishing company, is suing Meta for alleged copyright infringement, accusing the tech giant of storing, reproducing, and distributing Eminemâ€™s music without proper licensing. The lawsuit seeks at least $109 million in damages and a court order to halt the alleged infringement. Meta claims to have licenses with thousands of partners globally but Eight Mile Style alleges that Meta executives have actively encouraged copyright infringement to attract more users and increase advertising revenue. The company removed some of the songs but other versions remain.</p>
