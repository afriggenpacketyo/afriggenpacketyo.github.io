          <p>A 45-year-old man with an extensive criminal history is facing federal charges after an armed carjacking rampage in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two 25-year-old women and seriously injured a six-year-old child. Prosecutors allege the suspect stole a vehicle at gunpoint, fled from police, and caused a fatal crash by running a red light at high speed. The incident has been condemned by law enforcement officials as a senseless act of violence committed by a repeat offender. The suspect faces a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison if convicted on the federal charges.</p>

          <p>Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general during the first Trump administration, has publicly called for President Trump to fire Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Adams argues that Kennedy's policies, particularly those limiting vaccine access and shaking up the leadership at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are dangerous and put the nation's health at risk. His comments follow a contentious Senate hearing where Kennedy's actions were criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans. Adams co-authored an opinion piece with other former surgeons general expressing grave concerns over the recent turbulence at the CDC.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he may send military troops to Chicago to conduct a large-scale immigration and crime crackdown, similar to recent deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. His statements, including a post on Truth Social, have drawn sharp criticism from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have accused the president of authoritarianism and threatened legal action. This development follows a federal court ruling that the administration's use of the military for domestic law enforcement in Los Angeles was illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act. Federal personnel have reportedly begun arriving at a naval station near the city.</p>

The primary threats from the storms, which are developing along a cold front, include damaging wind gusts, large hail, and localized flash flooding in urban areas.

          <p>The recent Reform UK party conference in Birmingham showcased the party's significant growth and increasing professionalization, drawing comparisons to major party gatherings. The event, much larger than the previous year's, retained an insurgent energy while adopting the conventions of established political parties, such as corporate sponsorship and a large venue. Leader Nigel Farage's speech emphasized the need for discipline and grassroots organization, reflecting a focused ambition to win the next general election. The article suggests the party is successfully scaling up its operations while attracting a diverse base of new members, many of whom are disaffected former Conservative voters.</p>

However, these gains were soon erased by concerns that the slowing labor market could indicate a broader economic downturn.

          <p>A dermatologist emphasizes that applying sunscreen should be as routine as brushing one's teeth, yet many Americans neglect this daily habit. Key advice includes ensuring application on often-missed areas like eyelids, ears, and lips, which are highly susceptible to sun damage. While SPF 30 is recommended, higher SPFs can compensate for the fact that most people do not apply a sufficient amount. Sun protection is a year-round necessity, not just for summer, as cumulative damage can lead to skin conditions later in life. Consistent daily use is the most effective way to protect the skin.</p>

          <p>The Chicago area is preparing for an expanded U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation, with local officials anticipating the arrival of up to 300 agents. The planned enforcement has prompted the postponement of the city's Mexican Independence Day festival due to safety concerns within the community. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker have voiced strong opposition to the increased federal presence, stating they do not want "militarized immigration enforcement." A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson countered that the operation targets "the worst of the worst" criminals who they claim are protected by sanctuary city policies.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old surfer was killed in a shark attack off a popular beach in northern Sydney, Australia. The man was surfing with friends when he was mauled by what authorities believe was a large shark, resulting in the loss of multiple limbs. Other surfers pulled him to shore, but he could not be resuscitated due to significant blood loss. This marks the first fatal shark attack in Sydney since 2022, and local beaches have been closed for at least 24 hours while authorities patrol the area. Fatal shark attacks remain rare globally, with only seven recorded worldwide in 2024.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, an event that participants described as a celebration of a newfound acceptance within the Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the group, delivering a homily that emphasized restoring dignity to marginalized people, for which he received a standing ovation. Many pilgrims credit the late Pope Francis for the significant shift in tone, citing his message of welcome and his departure from the more condemnatory stances of his predecessors. This event stands in stark contrast to the experience of LGBTQ+ pilgrims during the last Holy Year 25 years ago, who reported being detained.</p>

          <p>As more states and school districts implement bans on cellphones in classrooms, many are turning to a solution from the company Yondr: a locked magnetic pouch. Students are required to place their phones in the pouch upon entering school, which they carry with them but can only unlock at designated magnetic stations. The system is now in use for at least 2.5 million students across the U.S. While educators report a positive change in student engagement and a reduction in distractions, the implementation has been met with mixed reactions from students and debates over the cost, which can be up to $30 per student.</p>

          <p>American farmers in the Midwest are divided over the Trump administration's prolonged trade dispute with China, which has led to a significant drop in agricultural exports as Beijing seeks alternative suppliers like Brazil. Some farmers remain hopeful that the president's strategy will ultimately result in better trade deals and open new markets for their products. However, others are increasingly concerned that the damage is permanent and that no new markets can fully replace the massive demand from China. This uncertainty creates a significant economic challenge for a region heavily dependent on agricultural trade.</p>

          <p>Gulf states like the UAE and Saudi Arabia are experiencing increased social friction as their governments implement economic reforms aimed at reducing reliance on oil and public sector jobs. Policies known as "Emiratization" and "Saudization" mandate that private companies hire a certain percentage of local citizens, pushing them into competition with a large foreign workforce. This shift is altering the traditional social contract where the state was the primary employer, leading to resentment as locals and migrants are now viewed as labor market rivals.

          <p>Germany is facing a looming crisis with its pension system, which was established in 1955 based on a "generational contract" where the working population finances retirees. Due to a declining birthrate since the 1970s and an aging population, the ratio of workers to pensioners has dropped dramatically, making the system increasingly unsustainable. With the baby boomer generation set to retire soon, economists warn of rising tax rates and distribution conflicts. The government is considering various proposals, including a controversial "Boomer Soli" tax on wealthier pensioners, as it looks to other European countries like Austria and the Netherlands for more stable models.</p>

By building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones, they have found tens of thousands of living genetic matches.

When pressed on the timeline for passing such complex laws, Farage stated his government would act as quickly as possible.
