        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American fund managers are actively lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," expressing concerns that this provision could trigger a rapid outflow of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests that foreign investors, seeking to avoid the tax, might quickly withdraw from U.S. equities, potentially depressing U.S. equity markets and harming both companies and investors. Foreign investors hold significant assets in U.S. markets, including stocks, government bonds, and credit, so this is something to keep an eye on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the United States risks undermining its status as a global hub for talent due to increasing crackdowns on academia and restrictions on international students. The opinion piece highlights the significant contributions of immigrants to U.S. tech companies and the broader economy, noting that a large percentage of tech workers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born. Restricting international students could diminish the talent pool for U.S. graduate programs, particularly in STEM fields, as many STEM PhDs are conferred on international students. Some students are now considering academic opportunities abroad, which could lead to a brain drain from the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's aircraft carriers Liaoning and Shandong have been conducting exercises in the western Pacific Ocean beyond the second island chain, marking an unprecedented display of naval power. The Japanese defence ministry reported that the Shandong strike group was observed conducting take-off and landing operations southwest of Iwo Jima, while the Liaoning group was located southwest of Minamitori Island. The Liaoning group notably traveled further east than Guam, representing the first time a Chinese navy carrier has reached beyond the second island chain.

          <p>Following a protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena, disorder broke out, resulting in property damage and police intervention. Jim Allister, a local MP, condemned the violence as "unwanted and unwarranted," noting that the demonstration's context was tied to "significant demographic change in the area" due to "unfettered immigration." Two teenage boys appeared in court, accused of the sexual assault of a teenage girl, speaking through an interpreter in Romanian to confirm their identities, while their solicitor stated they would deny the charges. Hundreds participated in a peaceful march before the violence escalated later in the day.</p>

Dobrindt said the government would allocate "substantial financial resources" to strengthen the defense mechanisms of Germany's security agencies.

          <p>China's recent export restrictions on rare earth minerals are impacting the automotive and robotics industries, with analysts warning that Western defense giants will also feel the strain. The restrictions, imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, require firms to apply for licenses for the export of rare earths and magnets, which are crucial for advanced defense technologies. William Bain of the British Chambers of Commerce noted that minerals like samarium, essential for F-35 fighter jet construction, are affected, potentially impacting U.S. national security. This situation underscores the strategic challenge posed by China's dominance in the critical minerals supply chain.</p>

          <p>Official figures suggest that UK companies are holding back on hiring or not replacing departing workers, leading to a decline in job vacancies. The number of available jobs fell by 63,000 between March and May, while the unemployment rate increased. Feedback from a vacancies survey indicates that some firms may be hesitant to recruit new workers or replace those who leave. The rise in average wages slowed, but remains above the rate of inflation, indicating some continued pressure on businesses.</p>

Belgian investigators have uncovered numerous similar consignment switches involving significant quantities of ketamine. The challenge for law enforcement is compounded by ketamine's legitimate use as an anaesthetic in hospitals and veterinary clinics.</p>
