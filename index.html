          <h2>Trump Reinstates Columbus Day Amidst Indigenous Peoples Day Recognition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 18:12:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared his intention to reinstate Columbus Day, reversing the trend of recognizing Indigenous Peoples Day alongside it. He accused Democrats of diminishing Christopher Columbus's legacy and emphasized his commitment to restoring traditional American icons. Trump's stance contrasts with President Biden's proclamation in 2021, which celebrated Indigenous peoples' contributions and acknowledged historical injustices. The move reflects a broader debate over how to commemorate Columbus's legacy in light of its impact on indigenous populations. This decision highlights the ongoing tension between honoring historical figures and acknowledging the complex history of colonialism and its effects on Native American communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is under fire for allegedly deporting a two-year-old US citizen to Honduras along with her mother, raising concerns about due process and the separation of families. A federal judge expressed strong suspicion that the government deported a US citizen without meaningful process. Separately, a Cuban-born woman, mother to a one-year-old with seizures, was deported to Cuba, leaving her daughter behind. These cases highlight the administration's aggressive immigration policies and the potential for violations of due process and human rights. The ACLU and other groups have condemned these actions as abuses of power and violations of Ice's own directives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes the US-China trade war is far from its conclusion. He argues that the Trump administration views the international trading system as unfair to the US, leading to the implementation of tariffs to force change. Kennedy suggests the administration aims to negotiate reciprocal tariffs on a country-by-country basis. The situation remains fluid, with potential for further escalation or negotiation depending on future developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Border czar Tom Homan defended the Trump administration's deportation policies after reports surfaced of U.S. citizen children being removed to Honduras with their deported mothers.

The tensions stem from Trump's criticism of South Africa's expropriation law and his offer of refugee status to Afrikaners.
