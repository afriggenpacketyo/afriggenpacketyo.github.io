          <p>President Trump's willingness to accept a Boeing 747-8 from the royal family of Qatar as a temporary Air Force One replacement has drawn criticism. The plan involves the Defense Department accepting the aircraft, with ownership transferring to the Trump presidential library after his term. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and Trump allies, raise ethical and legal concerns, viewing the gift as potentially corrupt and unconstitutional. Qatari officials state that the matter is still under review, while the White House insists any gift would comply with applicable laws.</p>

The group includes families with children and were greeted by U.S. officials.

          <p>A U.K. court sentenced six Bulgarians to prison for belonging to a Russian espionage cell, uncovering fake passports, hidden cameras, and plots of abductions and "honeytraps". The cell, directed by alleged Russian agent Jan Marsalek, operated across borders, targeting individuals and places of interest to the Russian state. The spies were motivated by money, with sums of up to 1 million euros discussed, demonstrating the value of their covert activities to Russia. The case exposed the inner workings of a Russian operational spy cell and its sinister activities.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is calling on cities and counties to clear and ban homeless encampments "without delay". He is providing a new model ordinance and $3.3 billion in funding to increase housing and drug treatment programs. Newsom emphasized the need for action and humanity, citing public safety risks and unsanitary conditions associated with encampments. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling allowing cities to criminalize sleeping outside when shelter is unavailable, intensifying efforts to address homelessness.</p>
