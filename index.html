          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian commercial port near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least 18 fatalities and 800 injuries, causing extensive damage to buildings and vehicles within a 50km radius. Videos show a fire intensifying before the blast, prompting widespread panic and injuries, with debris scattered across highways. Initial reports suggest the explosion stemmed from improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, potentially involving sodium perchlorate rocket fuel. Schools and offices in the region were closed as officials investigated the incident, highlighting concerns over chemical storage safety at the port. Optimism score: 25</p>
