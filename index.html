          <p>London-based fintech company Checkout.com has initiated a share buyback program for its employees, setting a new internal valuation of $12 billion. This figure represents a significant decrease from its $40 billion valuation during a 2022 funding round, although it is slightly up from a previously reported internal markdown. The move provides liquidity for staff, a common practice for startups remaining private longer. Despite the valuation change, the company reports strong performance, projecting over 30% core net revenue growth and $300 billion in annual e-commerce payment volume.</p>

The measures include a 100% tariff on branded pharmaceuticals, a 50% levy on kitchen and bathroom cabinets, and a 25% tax on heavy-duty trucks. President Trump stated the goal is to protect American manufacturers from what he described as a "flooding" of products from foreign countries. The pharmaceutical tariff includes an exemption for companies that are actively building manufacturing facilities within the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysis from shipping consultancy Sea Intelligence indicates that carriers are already reducing the use of Chinese-built vessels on transpacific routes to North America. This preemptive shift comes in anticipation of a new US port service fee targeting such ships. The data shows a noticeable downward trend in the deployment of these vessels on both the Asia-North America west and east coast trade lanes. In response, major carriers like Cosco Shipping Lines have affirmed their commitment to maintaining stable service to the US market despite the potential operational challenges.

The storm, the world's most powerful this year, caused severe damage to undersea cables, leading to outages and isolating residents. The typhoon brought record-breaking wind gusts and torrential rain, prompting the evacuation of over one million people in the province.

          <p>Several European Union member states are set to hold initial talks on a proposal to establish a comprehensive anti-drone defense system, referred to as a "drone wall." The discussion, prompted by recent Russian air incursions, will involve about 10 countries, primarily along the EU's eastern border, as well as Denmark. Ukraine, which has gained significant experience in countering Russian drone attacks, will also participate in the video conference. The initiative follows a call from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for enhanced drone defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Cities across the world, including New York, London, and Toronto, are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, a phenomenon experts are calling "Ratmageddon." Research suggests that rising global temperatures, particularly warmer winters, are a major contributing factor, allowing rats to breed more successfully year-round. Urban rodentologists also point to increased food waste from fast food and inconsistent rubbish collection as key drivers of the infestation. This public health challenge is proving difficult to manage, as rats are developing immunity to common poisons, forcing cities to rethink their mitigation strategies.</p>

Managing the famously boisterous New York crowd will also be crucial for the European visitors, who aim to win on US soil for the first time since 2012.

In contrast, the article argues that the US system, which relies on market forces and a fractured budgeting process, struggles to implement coherent, forward-looking economic policy.

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly Eaton and Palisades wildfires in January has identified significant weaknesses that led to delayed evacuation warnings. The report cites a lack of resources, including critical staffing shortages in the sheriff's department and emergency management office, as a primary issue. Additionally, outdated policies for issuing alerts, unreliable cellular connectivity, and fragmented communication systems hampered the ability of first responders to coordinate effectively. While praising the heroic actions of individuals, the report calls for clearer policies, better training, and integrated technology to improve future responses.</p>

The policy is expected to impact major truck exporters to the US, including Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Germany. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, a key figure in the Trump administration's health department, has clarified that pregnant women should take Tylenol if a doctor advises it, especially for high fevers that can pose health risks. His comments follow a controversial announcement from the FDA and President Trump linking acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, to a possible risk of autism. Medical experts have pushed back, stating there is no established causal link and that acetaminophen remains the safest option for pain and fever during pregnancy. Oz emphasized that the concern is over casual, unadvised use for minor aches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment against former FBI Director James Comey includes two criminal counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. The first charge relates to his 2020 testimony where he denied authorizing an FBI staffer to be an anonymous source for media reports, a statement prosecutors allege he knew was false. The second count accuses him of impeding the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation by making these false statements. Notably, the grand jury reviewed three potential charges but declined to indict on a third count of making false statements.</p>

          <p>China has launched an international operations center in Shanghai dedicated to advancing the cross-border use of its central bank digital currency, the e-CNY. The People's Bank of China aims to provide an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system by improving the efficiency of international transactions with the digital yuan. The initiative includes three new platforms: one for cross-border digital payments, a blockchain service platform for on-chain transactions, and a digital asset platform to help existing financial infrastructure integrate with blockchain technology. This marks a significant step in China's efforts to internationalize its currency.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the transfer of individuals whose federal death sentences were previously commuted to life without parole by former President Joe Biden. The inmates are being moved to ADX Florence in Colorado, a supermax prison known for its extremely harsh conditions of isolation. The move is seen by critics as a vindictive and political act, part of the Trump administration's effort to take a harder line on crime after being unable to overturn the commutations. Civil liberties groups have previously filed lawsuits challenging such transfers as unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks defeated the Arizona Cardinals 23-20 in a dramatic finish on Thursday night. Kicker Jason Myers converted a 52-yard field goal as time expired to clinch the win, making amends for a missed attempt just minutes earlier. The Seahawks had built a 14-point lead in the fourth quarter, but a late surge from Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray, including a game-tying touchdown pass with 33 seconds left, set up the tense finale.

          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, coming just days after President Trump publicly called for his prosecution, is intensifying concerns about the weaponization of the Department of Justice. Critics argue the move represents a collapse of the traditional firewall between the White House and federal law enforcement, fulfilling the president's promise of retribution against his political rivals. While prosecutors assert they have a solid case, legal experts note the action is unprecedented. The case is poised to resurrect controversies from the Trump-Russia investigation, regardless of the trial's outcome.</p>

In a letter, they urged the camp to halt all reopening plans and instead focus on finding their daughter and accounting for the safety failures that led to the tragedy.
