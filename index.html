          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement by mid-June, despite ongoing disagreements. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, expressed optimism after talks with U.S. officials, noting "further progress" was made. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, including a 14% country-specific tariff and a 25% tariff on automobiles. Japan has proposed joint efforts to strengthen supply chains, expand U.S. farm product imports, and simplify requirements for foreign-made cars, aiming for a deal that benefits both nations. The leaders of both countries plan to discuss the issue at the upcoming Group of Seven summit in Canada.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is seeking to reform Japan's rice policy in response to rising rice prices and an upcoming national election. With rice prices having doubled, Ishiba aims to overhaul the production adjustment system to counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. The government has already started releasing reserve rice to retailers to lower prices, and Ishiba has expressed a desire to boost rice exports to prevent overproduction. Some experts caution against using rice policy as a political tool, warning of potential market turmoil, while others support the move as a way to address public concerns and maintain farmer motivation. The government's stockpile of rice is around 1 million tons, with 312,000 tons released since March.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have faced increasing protests during raids across the country, leading to tense confrontations. In San Diego, protesters surrounded ICE agents conducting a raid on an Italian restaurant, prompting the use of flash-bangs. ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons defended the use of masks by agents, citing online threats against their families. Civil rights groups argue that bystanders have the right to observe and protest, while Homeland Security officials warn against obstructing operations.

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly suggested creating a new political party in the United States, potentially escalating his feud with President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it was time to create a party that represents the "80% in the middle." He later endorsed the name "America Party," reminiscent of his America PAC, which supported Trump in 2024. The idea follows a public spat between Musk and Trump over policy and financial support, with Musk criticizing Trump's domestic policy bill and Trump threatening to cut subsidies to Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's public feud with President Trump.

          <p>The UK government is struggling to reduce the amount of foreign aid spent on hotel bills for asylum seekers, with the Home Office planning to spend £2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year. Foreign aid is intended for poverty alleviation, but international rules allow some of it to be spent on asylum seekers' accommodation during their first year. Critics argue that this diversion of funds is unsustainable and comes at the expense of vital development and humanitarian programs. The Home Office aims to reduce costs by speeding up asylum decisions and introducing tighter financial eligibility checks.</p>
