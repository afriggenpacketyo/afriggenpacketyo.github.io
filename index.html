          <p>Australians are voting in a national election where President Trump's policies are a significant factor. The center-right coalition's support has declined since Trump took office, while the Labor Party has gained ground, even as leader Anthony Albanese refrains from direct criticism of Trump. The U.S.'s trade relationship with Australia and the AUKUS security pact also play a role, with concerns about Trump's tariffs and China's influence impacting voters' decisions. The level of distrust in the U.S. among Australians has reached a new high, influencing the election dynamics.</p>

          <p>A new report estimates that President Trump's crypto investments have significantly increased his family's wealth, now representing a large portion of his net worth. This rise is attributed to the release of meme coins and a stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto exchange linked to the Trump family. The SEC has reportedly paused investigations into crypto companies since Trump's inauguration, raising ethical concerns about profiting from public office. The president aims to make the U.S. the 'crypto capital of the world,' promoting digital currency through executive orders and pardons. (not investment advice)</p>
