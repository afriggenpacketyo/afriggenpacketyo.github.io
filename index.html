          <p>The Trump White House, through economic adviser Kevin Hassett, has called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to take a leave of absence. This comes as Cook plans to file a lawsuit challenging her removal by President Trump, who cited allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook's attorney asserts that Trump's attempt to fire her lacks factual or legal basis, and the Fed confirmed she would challenge the action in court. The dispute over the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth for the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5% and comparable sales down 11%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% growth in its teen-focused Hollister brand, leading to a 7% increase in total sales. The retailer exceeded Wall Street's expectations for revenue and earnings, subsequently raising its full-year revenue outlook to 5% to 7% growth. Despite tariff costs and a weaker profit outlook for the current quarter, Abercrombie remains confident in its growth trajectory, leveraging new categories and partnerships like the NFL.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national in U.S. immigration custody, has formally requested an immigration judge to reopen his proceedings and is seeking asylum. A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order until at least early October, preventing his removal to Uganda and ensuring he remains in detention near his legal counsel. Abrego Garcia was initially deported to El Salvador in March despite legal protections, then returned to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. His legal team argues that his return makes him eligible to apply for asylum within one year of his last entry into the U.S.</p>

          <p>China significantly increased its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) funding in the first half of 2025, with investments and construction contracts totaling $124 billion, surpassing the entire previous year's sum. This surge marks a strategic shift, as funding in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East has decreased. Kazakhstan emerged as the primary recipient, securing $23 billion, including a major $12 billion aluminum complex project. This move is attributed to China's internal economic pressures and evolving global trade dynamics, highlighting a renewed emphasis on Central Asian partnerships within the BRI framework.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is soon expected to rule on Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with a significant portion going to Apple. While this ruling could impact Google's search traffic and revenue predictability, some analysts believe it might ultimately benefit the company by freeing it from costly deals and allowing greater investment in AI. Google's dominance in search remains strong, even in markets where default choices were mandated, suggesting its core appeal persists. The Justice Department is also pushing for restrictions on AI distribution deals and data-sharing mandates, aiming to foster competition and innovation in the evolving tech landscape.

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued an official apology to over 4,500 Inuit women in Greenland who were subjected to a forced contraception campaign from the 1960s to 1992. This systematic discrimination involved coercing approximately half of Greenland's 9,000 Inuit women, many of them teenagers, into having intrauterine devices (IUDs) inserted without their consent, leading to sterility and various health issues. The apology acknowledges this "dark chapter" and extends to other failures of discrimination against Greenlanders. The apology comes as about 150 women are suing Denmark for compensation, ahead of an expected report on the mistreatment.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Novartis has warned that NHS patients in the UK could miss out on innovative new treatments due to escalating costs and a breakdown in drug pricing negotiations. Novartis's UK boss stated that the country is "largely uninvestable" for major new investments, citing an outdated assessment method for drug value and a "clawback tax" rate significantly higher than in other European nations. The firm claims it has already been unable to launch several medicines in the UK available elsewhere. The government, however, insists it made a "generous and unprecedented offer" to the industry, while the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry calls for changes to uncompetitive rebates and assessment methods.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Department of Transportation will reclaim management of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, aiming to "make this city safe and beautiful" and reinvest station income into capital improvements. The move coincides with the Trump administration's anti-crime crackdown in Washington, which has seen a significant federal presence, including the National Guard, at the transit hub. Although the DOT has owned Union Station since the 1980s, control had been reduced through various agreements. The department expects to finalize renegotiations with the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation and Amtrak to resume full control by September.</p>

          <p>The Chinese animated fantasy film "Ne Zha II" has become the highest-grossing film of 2025 and the highest-grossing animated and non-English-language film ever, earning over $2 billion worldwide. Despite its immense global success, particularly in China, an English-dubbed version recently flopped at the U.S. box office, though a subtitled version had previously earned over $20 million. The film's popularity stems from its epic scope, eye-popping visuals, and universal coming-of-age themes, blending Chinese aesthetics with diverse animation influences. It builds on the success of its predecessor, showcasing a vibrant and action-packed narrative rooted in Chinese mythology.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their typical annual gas and electricity bills rise by £35 starting October 1, as energy regulator Ofgem announced a 2% increase in the price cap. This adjustment means a typical household will pay £1,755 per year, attributed to increased costs for government support schemes like the Warm Home Discount and expenses related to maintaining a stable electricity supply. Campaigners warn of another winter of high energy bills, while Ofgem suggests consumers consider fixed-price deals, with some currently offering rates around 15-17% cheaper than the new variable cap.</p>

          <p>Canadian author Miriam Toews' new memoir, "A Truce That Is Not Peace," delves into the profound question of why she writes, confronting decades of grief and guilt stemming from the suicides of her father and sister. Drawing inspiration from Christian Wiman's essay "The Limit," Toews explores how writing serves not as a means to resolve tragedy, but as a way to live with the unspeakable. The memoir, structured discursively, weaves together fragments of memory, nightmares, and decades-old letters to her sister, revealing how her urge to write, initially seen as opposite to their silence, ultimately became her means of survival and connection.</p>

The article also highlights available financial support, such as the £150 Warm Home Discount for those on means-tested benefits, and various hardship grants from suppliers. Finally, it suggests practical energy-saving measures around the home, like turning down boiler flow rates, using energy-efficient appliances, and reducing tumble dryer use.</p>
