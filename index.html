        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article chronicles the rapid rise of Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, from a young activist to a key ally within Donald Trump's MAGA movement. Kirk's organization focused on engaging young conservatives on college campuses and leveraging social media, significantly contributing to Trump's 2024 election victory. He cultivated a close personal friendship with the Trump family, becoming a White House adviser and influencing government appointments. Despite his hard-right views and controversial statements, Kirk demonstrated unwavering loyalty to Trump's agenda, cementing his role as a prominent figure in conservative politics. His unexpected death profoundly impacted the White House, with President Trump ordering flags flown at half-staff in his honor, acknowledging his significant influence and integral role in the movement.</p>

          <p>Opendoor's new board chair, Keith Rabois, declared the online real estate platform "bloated" and announced plans to cut 85% of its 1,400-person workforce, aiming for a staff of no more than 200. Rabois criticized the company's remote work culture and its embrace of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, vowing to return to in-person work and "fix all that." This drastic restructuring follows investor pressure and the recent resignation of the previous CEO, as the company seeks to address significant cash burn and improve its financial performance. The announcement initially boosted shares, though they later slid.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar faced severe backlash from conservatives on social media for her remarks about Charlie Kirk following his assassination. During a Zeteo Town Hall, Omar expressed condolences to Kirk's family but then criticized his past statements on gun violence, racial issues, and the January 6 Capitol riot, leading to calls for her resignation and deportation. She later clarified that while she vehemently disagreed with Kirk's rhetoric, she condemned violence. The incident highlights the deep partisan divisions and the sensitivity surrounding public commentary after a high-profile political death.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Clive Lewis openly questioned Sir Keir Starmer's leadership, stating he "doesn't seem up to the job," as controversy intensifies over Peter Mandelson's appointment and subsequent sacking. Mandelson was fired from an ambassador role due to newly revealed information about his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, despite his friendship being previously known. This incident, coupled with other internal party frustrations, has created a "very dangerous atmosphere" among Labour MPs, raising concerns about the party's direction and stability. The situation has prompted calls for significant changes within the party leadership.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro emphasized that the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's killing is "not a moment for partisanship" or division, urging leaders to condemn all political violence. Shapiro, who himself was targeted in an attempted arson at his mansion, criticized President Trump for blaming the "radical left." He called on leaders to speak and act with moral clarity, using "words of healing" instead of vengeance. Shapiro praised Utah Governor Spencer Cox for his efforts to unite Americans, highlighting the importance of civility and ethics in a politically charged environment.</p>

          <p>The family of Steve Biko, the iconic South African anti-apartheid activist, expressed confidence that a new inquest into his 1977 death will finally lead to prosecutions. Biko died from a brain injury while in police detention, with authorities initially claiming he hit his head. Post-apartheid, former officers admitted to assaulting him, but no one was prosecuted. His son, Nkosinathi Biko, emphasized the country's need to address its violent past for true democracy. The inquest, reopening 48 years after his death, seeks accountability for apartheid-era crimes, with two linked individuals in their 80s still alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the 1985 congressional hearing where Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) advocated for warning labels on music with explicit lyrics, facing opposition from musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister. Gore argued for "truth in packaging" to aid parental guidance, while Snider defended artistic freedom and parental responsibility. The PMRC's efforts, despite claims of censorship, led to the industry adopting "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers. These labels, though voluntary, influenced retail decisions and ironically boosted sales for some artists, highlighting the enduring debate over content regulation and youth protection.</p>

Routh, representing himself, veered into irrelevant topics like human evolution and Adolf Hitler, prompting Judge Aileen Cannon to reprimand him for making a "mockery of the court." Prosecutors allege Routh meticulously planned the attack due to political grievances, presenting evidence including a military-grade weapon, burner phones, and a handwritten note. A Secret Service agent testified Routh aimed a rifle at him, leading to shots fired. The trial continues with Routh's brief cross-examinations.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk's assassination has sparked a complex reaction on the right, with some mourning him as a "martyr" and calling for vengeance against his perceived enemies. Influential figures, including President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, have contributed to this narrative, linking his death to a "spiritual battle" and "radical left" rhetoric. Experts express concern that this religious glorification could amplify political violence and extremism, especially given Kirk's own divisive rhetoric against minorities and progressives.

          <p>A South African court rejected a bid by Thabo Bester, dubbed the "Facebook Sexual Assailant," to block a Netflix documentary about his escape from prison. Bester gained notoriety for faking his own death in his cell, only for DNA tests to reveal the charred remains belonged to someone else. He and his partner were later arrested in Tanzania. Bester, sentenced to life in 2012 for luring victims on Facebook, then sexually assaulting and robbing them, argued the documentary was defamatory and violated his fair trial rights.
