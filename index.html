          <h2>Trump Administration Anticipates UK Trade Deal Announcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 23:03:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated a potential trade deal announcement with a "big, and highly respected, country" to occur in the Oval Office. This news follows Trump's prior imposition of tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most countries and higher reciprocal rates, which were later suspended for 90 days, though the UK was still impacted by tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. The announcement has led to a rise in the value of the British pound against the US dollar, signaling potential economic impacts and shifts in international trade relations. The administration has engaged in meetings with trading partners, and this deal could mark the beginning of a series of trade agreements.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a pause on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that the ruling could cost the company "substantial sums". The court had found Apple in contempt for violating an earlier order regarding its App Store policies, specifically related to commissions on in-app purchases made through external web links. Apple claims the required changes will negatively impact its business and reduce consumer choice, while Epic Games argues the ruling forces Apple to compete. The judge in the case also made a criminal referral, accusing Apple of misleading the court.</p>

          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, believed to be a potential cause of the Eaton fire, has been dismantled and removed for testing. The tower, which has been idle for over 50 years, is suspected of becoming reenergized through induction, potentially sparking the fire. The dismantled tower will be examined and tested by fire investigators and experts to determine its role in the incident. The removal and testing are part of an ongoing investigation into the cause of the deadly fire, which has led to lawsuits against the utility company.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests the United States is at an inflection point, with President Trump's policies accelerating the unraveling of the Western world order. The piece draws parallels to historical empires undone by their leaders' hubris, short-sightedness, or divisiveness, citing Diocletian's reforms in the Roman Empire as an example. Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, and undermining of democratic norms are seen as contributing to a loss of faith in the Western project and potentially leading to irreversible decline.</p>

Rollins insisted that key positions were not accepted in the second round of resignations, though some employees dispute this claim.
