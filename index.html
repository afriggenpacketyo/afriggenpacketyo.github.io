          <p>Following the Colorado Buffaloes' victory over No. 22 Iowa State, fans stormed the field in celebration, prompting a potential fine from the Big 12 Conference. Coach Deion Sanders expressed his bewilderment at the $50,000 penalty, stating he loves seeing the students' excitement and questioning the rationale behind fining such a celebration. This incident follows a previous $50,000 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct and a $25,000 fine last season for a similar field storming, highlighting the conference's strict policies on post-game conduct.</p>

          <p>The office of Madagascar's president has announced that an illegal and forceful attempt to seize power is in progress, following weeks of escalating protests. An army unit, CAPSAT, which was instrumental in President Andry Rajoelina's 2009 rise to power, has claimed control over the military command. This development comes after widespread demonstrations against corruption, high unemployment, and the cost-of-living crisis, marking the most significant challenge to Rajoelina's government since his 2023 re-election.</p>

          <p>During a rare press conference in Delhi, the Taliban’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was questioned by female journalists about his government's ban on education and work for women and girls in Afghanistan. Muttaqi claimed the restrictions are a temporary postponement until a new order is issued by the supreme leader, and not a permanent ban based on religious law. This comes as Afghanistan remains the only country in the world where the government systematically denies women these fundamental rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece posits that the appointment of conservative commentator Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is the result of a decades-long conservative strategy to reshape American media. The article traces this effort back to the 1971 Powell memo, which urged corporations to actively influence news coverage to be more pro-business. The author argues that this move is not an isolated event but part of a larger plan to transform journalism from a watchdog into an advocate for corporate and political power.</p>

          <p>The UK's education secretary has stated that national security adviser Jonathan Powell played no role in the evidence decisions that led to the collapse of a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charges, claiming the government failed to provide necessary evidence that China was a national security threat at the time. This has led to accusations from Conservatives that the decision was politically motivated to foster closer relations with Beijing.</p>

The author suggests that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, but encourages a more active approach than simply making offsetting donations for Potter-related purchases. The column advocates for engaging with the material critically, discussing its flaws within a community, and using the experience to foster broader conversations about social justice.</p>

          <p>Scottish First Minister John Swinney has asserted that a majority victory for the SNP in the next Holyrood election should pave the way for a new independence referendum. He cites the precedent set in 2011, when an SNP majority led to the 2014 vote, as a substantial factor in the legal and political argument for Scotland's right to self-determination. This stance puts his party on a collision course with the UK Labour government, which has stated it does not support another referendum.</p>
