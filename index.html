          <p>The Israeli military has recovered the bodies of two hostages from Gaza, one of whom has been identified as Ilan Weiss. Weiss was confirmed to have been killed during the initial Hamas-led attacks on October 7, 2023. His wife and daughter were also kidnapped but were released during a ceasefire in November 2023. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum expressed gratitude to the security forces while emphasizing the deep grief and the partial comfort the recovery brings to the family after a long period of uncertainty. The identity of the second body recovered has not yet been determined by officials.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has submitted a second criminal referral to the Department of Justice concerning Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. This new referral alleges that Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage applications and government ethics filings related to a condominium in Massachusetts. The action comes as Cook is suing President Donald Trump to prevent her removal from the Fed's board, a move Trump initiated based on Pulte's first criminal referral. These developments intensify the conflict between the Trump administration and the Federal Reserve over its leadership and policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. This policy change means that up to four million packages daily will now be subject to tariffs, creating significant challenges for small and medium-sized businesses reliant on international e-commerce. Customs experts warn of increased costs, logistical complexities, and potential shipping delays as global postal services, including those in the UK and Germany, have already suspended U.S.-bound shipments to adapt to the new requirements. The move is expected to generate over $71 billion in new costs for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has dismissed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from office, ruling that she violated ethical standards in a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen. In the call, she referred to Hun Sen as "uncle" and criticized the Thai army, actions the court deemed undermined national interests during a period of border tension. This decision marks a significant blow to the influential Shinawatra political dynasty, making Paetongtarn the third family member to have their premiership cut short. Parliament will now select a new leader, introducing a period of political uncertainty for the country.</p>

          <p>The U.K. government has announced that no official Israeli government delegation will be invited to the Defence Security and Equipment International (DSEI) exhibition in London. The decision was made in response to what a U.K. spokesperson called Israel's "wrong" decision to escalate its military operations in Gaza. Israel's defence ministry condemned the move as discriminatory and politically motivated, confirming it would withdraw its national pavilion from the event. While government officials are barred, individual Israeli defense firms will still be permitted to attend and exhibit at the major trade show.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city's future remains precarious despite the construction of a $14.4 billion levee system. While the upgraded defenses have successfully protected the city from subsequent storms like Hurricane Ida, they face growing challenges from climate change and political neglect. The region is experiencing rapid sea-level rise and land subsidence, which erodes the effectiveness of the levees faster than projected. Furthermore, federal and state funding cuts under the Trump administration and Louisiana's Republican governor threaten the essential maintenance and inspection required to keep the system resilient.</p>

The move from the U.S. escalates President Trump's "maximum pressure" campaign against Maduro, whom Washington accuses of leading a cocaine trafficking cartel.

Previously, parents had to pay up to £200 for the vaccine privately. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications and reduce the economic impact of the illness, which costs the UK an estimated £24 million annually in lost productivity from parents taking time off work.</p>

His lawyers argue the lawsuit is a waste of resources, claiming there was no investor harm, no ongoing violation, and that the late filing was corrected immediately.

Brokers report that as families expand and heirs become geographically scattered or disagree on the property's future, many are choosing to sell these vast estates. This trend is fueled by high demand from wealthy buyers, partly inspired by the "Yellowstone" effect, who seek privacy and a connection to nature. While selling can be an emotional decision for families, it presents a rare opportunity for new owners to acquire unique, historic properties.</p>

          <h2>Report Indicates Higher-Income Households Are More Likely to Return Retail Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Bank of America Institute reveals that shoppers with higher incomes return a larger percentage of their retail purchases compared to other income groups. In 2025, high-income households had a refund rate of 5.3%, while lower-income households had a rate of 3.7%. The report suggests wealthier consumers are more likely to engage in "bracketing"—buying multiple versions of an item with the intent to return most of them—because they are less constrained by cash flow. This trend contributes to the high cost of returns for retailers, who are increasingly tightening their policies in response.</p>

Kotau is a founder of the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation (BSSF), which supports athletes who oppose leader Alexander Lukashenko. He was last heard from on August 21, and his colleagues fear he may have been abducted by the Belarusian KGB, which has a history of targeting activists abroad. Kotau was recently sentenced in absentia to 12 years in prison by the Belarusian regime on charges of conspiring to seize power.</p>

          <p>The U.K. Home Office has instructed its contractor, Mitie, to withdraw job advertisements for tutors to teach skills like balloon-craft and cake decorating to migrants at an immigration removal center. The move followed criticism from the Conservative opposition, who called the roles an inappropriate use of taxpayer money. Home Office minister Seema Malhotra stated the roles were not considered necessary and went beyond statutory requirements for detainee welfare. However, the asylum seekers' rights charity Detention Action argued that such activities are a duty of care to support the mental health of individuals detained for long periods.</p>

          <p>Germany's unemployment level has risen above three million people for the first time since 2015, according to the Federal Employment Agency. The unemployment rate increased to 6.4% in August, a development attributed to a typical summer slowdown in hiring and the lingering effects of prolonged economic weakness. While officials note some fragile signs of stabilization, the rising joblessness adds pressure on the government to counteract the economic slump. Employers' associations have called the figure "a disgrace" and urged the government to implement significant reforms to stimulate the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors claim that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is inspiring others to commit violence. In a court filing, they argued that Mangione poses an ongoing danger by cultivating supporters online and seeking to normalize violence as a means to achieve political objectives. As evidence, they cited the recent deadly shooting at the NFL headquarters, where the gunman left a note with grievances similar in tone to Mangione's anti-insurance industry manifesto. This argument was presented as part of the government's case to seek the death penalty for what they term an "act of political violence."</p>

          <p>Denmark has drastically cut its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, citing weaker expectations for its pharmaceutical sector, particularly giant Novo Nordisk. The company, known for its blockbuster weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is facing increased competition and slowing U.S. exports. After years of pharma-driven expansion, this slowdown is projected to significantly reduce Denmark's export growth. The economy ministry also noted that the threat of U.S. tariffs and statistical revisions showing weaker past performance contributed to the downward adjustment of the GDP forecast.

          <p>The Trump administration's recent takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department is viewed by some analysts as a step toward centralizing law enforcement power with potentially troubling long-term implications. This move, combined with a new executive order to create deployable federal public safety units and a shift in the FBI's mission toward violent crime, suggests an effort to create a national police force. Critics express concern that such units could be staffed with individuals loyal to Donald Trump personally rather than the rule of law, which could pose a significant threat during future national crises or contested elections.</p>

After the sentencing of killer Bryan Kohberger, the city of Moscow released some records with bodies blurred, but images of blood and sounds of distress were still present.

          <p>Parasocial relationships describe the one-sided connections people form with public figures like celebrities, influencers, and podcasters, where the fan feels a sense of intimacy that is not reciprocated. While these one-sided bonds have existed for centuries, modern media and stan culture have intensified them, blurring the lines between public personas and private individuals. This dynamic can lead to toxic fan behavior, including harassment and a sense of entitlement over a celebrity's life. The article explains that these relationships are with a constructed "star text" or persona, not the actual person, a distinction crucial for responsible fandom.</p>
