          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party's leadership regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he wants to focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC Chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision to step down. The move follows the party's decision to redo the vice chair elections, although this was not directly related to Hogg's plans to support primary challenges against sitting Democrats. The article emphasizes that Hogg maintains respect for his fellow officers, despite their disagreements, as he continues to focus on building the strongest party possible. The situation underscores internal tensions within the DNC regarding the role of progressive activists and their approach to electoral strategy. </p>

          <p>Survivors and family members of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting victims were invited to tour the building in Orlando for a final viewing before its demolition. The visits, coinciding with the shooting's nine-year mark, were conducted in small groups over four days. Christine Leionen, who lost her son in the shooting, described her visit as a way to connect with his final moments. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer reflected on the events of that night, noting the impact on the community as the city plans to build a permanent memorial on the site, but some survivors and families still seek answers regarding prevention and investigation of the shooting. The event was a somber reminder of the tragedy and a step towards healing and remembrance. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wolf packs are growing in California, leading to increased conflicts with cattle ranchers, particularly along the California-Oregon border. Ranchers like Jim and Mary Rickert report significant losses of cattle due to confirmed and suspected wolf attacks. While wolves are protected under state and federal law, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife is helping ranchers by providing wolf-tracking maps and exploring deterrent methods. The state has spent millions compensating ranchers for losses, but funding for deterrents has been exhausted, creating financial strain for ranchers and raising questions about the long-term sustainability of wolf conservation efforts. The situation highlights the challenges of balancing wildlife protection with the economic interests of ranchers. </p>

          <p>Scientists in mainland China have created an ultra-detailed electronic warfare simulation covering Taiwan and its surrounding waters. The simulation, developed by a team led by Professor Shao Shihai from the University of Electronic Science and Technology, models intricate landforms with nanosecond-level precision. This allows for a highly realistic war game scenario, testing how electromagnetic signals could navigate the complex terrain of Taiwan. The researchers claim that this method significantly improves computational speed while maintaining precision, fulfilling the requirements for channel modeling in large-scale battlefield environments. This development underscores the increasing sophistication of military simulations and electronic warfare capabilities in the region. </p>

          <p>Tiger Woods, despite being sidelined with an Achilles injury, shared insights on what golfers can expect at Oakmont Country Club for the U.S. Open. Woods, who finished tied for second at Oakmont in 2007, emphasized the importance of confidence and strong ball-striking, noting that the course favors longer hitters due to its challenging complexes. He highlighted the thickness of the rough and the treacherous greens, stressing the need for accuracy and strategic shot placement. Woods believes that golfers who can hit the ball long and straight, like Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau, will have an advantage, as he underscores the unforgiving nature of Oakmont and the premium it places on precise execution. </p>

Public health advocates have expressed concern, suggesting that Kennedy's selections may undermine vaccine policy, with some appointees having previously criticized COVID-19 policies and vaccines. The new panel will participate in the upcoming Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting in late June, as this move has sparked debate over the direction of vaccine policy and the influence of differing perspectives on public health decisions. </p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor's Spending Review is dominating newspaper headlines, with varied reactions. Some papers warn of tax increases to fund the NHS, while others criticize the review as a "reckless splurge." The NHS and defense are seen as "big winners," but police and other departments may face challenges. The review is viewed as a rejection of austerity, but economists caution about tighter times ahead. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Teoscar Hernández hit a crucial three-run home run in the sixth inning, lifting the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory over the Padres. Hernández had been struggling at the plate recently, but his decisive hit broke open the tie game and secured a series win for the Dodgers. Ben Casparius delivered a solid four-inning start, and Michael Conforto added an opposite-field homer to tie the game earlier. The win gives the Dodgers a two-game lead in the division, but the Padres mounted a comeback effort, which was ultimately thwarted by strong relief pitching. </p>
