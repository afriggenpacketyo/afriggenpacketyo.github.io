            <p>A preliminary 5.2-magnitude earthquake struck near San Diego, with the epicenter located south of Julian, San Diego County. The quake was felt across Southern California and into Mexico, with seismologist Dr. Lucy Jones linking it to the Elsinore Fault. While initial reports indicated no immediate injuries or damage, at least seven aftershocks followed the main quake. Authorities, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, are coordinating with local entities to monitor the situation and assess potential impacts.</p>

Residents have reported an increase in rats and other vermin, and military planners have been called in to help deal with the situation. The council has come under fire for sending out leaflets about changes to recycling in the middle of the strike.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that the chances of a U.S. recession have increased due to Donald Trump's tariffs, posing "material risks" to U.S. and global growth. The growing uncertainty over the fallout of U.S. tariffs could spell trouble for companies and consumers and wreak havoc on the economy. Despite a temporary roll-back by Trump, markets will continue to be volatile given that “how policy will evolve is still unknown”. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Donald Trump suggested the US could deport "homegrown criminals" to jails in El Salvador, saying the US attorney general is "studying the laws right now". The Trump administration has sent hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to CECOT, a maximum security prison in El Salvador, since March. The law from 1798 has been invoked just three times before, in wartime. It allows the president to detain and deport immigrants living in the US legally if they are from countries seen as "enemies" of the government.</p>

I’m not going to do it.” The comments came a day after the Trump administration claimed it is not legally obligated to secure the return of the Abrego García, despite the US supreme court ruling that the administration should “facilitate” bringing him back.</p>
