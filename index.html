          <p>Rudy Giuliani, the 81-year-old former mayor of New York City, was hospitalized with serious injuries, including a fractured thoracic vertebrae, after a car accident. The incident occurred in New Hampshire after Giuliani had stopped to assist a woman who reported being a victim of domestic violence. According to his spokesperson, his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed, but the crash was not a targeted attack. Giuliani is reportedly in good spirits and recovering from his injuries.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the death of Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, in an aerial attack on a residential building in Gaza City. While Hamas has not yet confirmed his death, Israel's Defence Minister praised the operation as a "flawless execution." The strike, which also resulted in civilian casualties according to local reports, targeted a building in the al-Rimal neighborhood. Obeida was a highly visible figure in Hamas's propaganda efforts and one of its few remaining senior military members from before the October 7th attacks.</p>

          <p>At least two individuals were arrested during a protest in Epping, Essex, concerning the housing of asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel. Tensions have been high in the area following a recent sexual assault charge against an asylum seeker staying at the hotel, who has denied the allegations. Essex Police had implemented a dispersal order and placed restrictions on the demonstration to prevent disorder. The protest involved around 200 people and saw clashes with officers, including one woman being detained after unfurling a flag at the council building.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton has been issued a five-place grid penalty for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, his first home race as a Ferrari driver. The penalty was imposed because he failed to slow sufficiently under double yellow flags before the Dutch Grand Prix. This setback adds to a challenging weekend for Ferrari, which saw both Hamilton and his teammate Charles Leclerc crash out of the race in separate incidents. The stewards noted that Hamilton did attempt to slow down, which reduced the penalty from a standard 10-place drop.</p>

Star player Will Jacks was instrumental in the victory, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls, the highest individual score in a men's Hundred final. Despite a late effort from the Rockets' Marcus Stoinis, the Invincibles' total of 168-5 proved insurmountable. The decisive moment came from leg-spinner Nathan Sowter, who took three quick wickets to dismantle the Rockets' chase.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has ordered an emergency stop to the Trump administration's plan to deport almost 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a late-night request, arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of their due process rights to seek asylum. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan issued the 14-day halt after a hearing where she noted conflicting narratives from the government and the children's lawyers. The government had claimed the children were being reunited with family, a point disputed by the advocates.</p>

The court ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the levies. The administration plans to appeal the decision, which, if upheld, would significantly curtail a central component of its economic agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has declared his intention to issue an executive order requiring identification for all voters in U.S. elections, a move that would likely face immediate and significant legal challenges. The U.S. Constitution primarily grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections. This push for a federal voter ID mandate stems from Trump's unsubstantiated claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Critics argue such laws disproportionately affect minority, low-income, and elderly voters and note that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in the United States.</p>

          <p>Bishop Montgomery, a Catholic high school in Torrance, California, has fired its football coach and co-athletic director, Ed Hodgkiss, amid a growing sports scandal. The move follows a decision by the CIF Southern Section to declare five transfer students ineligible due to rule violations, including providing false information. The school was also forced to forfeit a game against a top-ranked opponent due to a lack of players. This article suggests the Archdiocese of Los Angeles failed to learn from a similar past scandal at another school, allowing the situation to develop despite warning signs.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 similar frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's capabilities in the North Atlantic. The agreement represents a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the first fatal case of whooping cough this year, involving a baby whose mother was not vaccinated against the illness during pregnancy. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for providing passive immunity to infants in their first weeks of life, before they can receive their own jabs. The tragic death highlights growing concerns about declining vaccine uptake in the UK for various childhood diseases. Of the 33 infant deaths from whooping cough since 2013, 27 were born to mothers who had not been vaccinated.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels have raided the Sanaa offices of the UN's World Food Programme and UNICEF, detaining at least one employee and losing contact with several others. The raids occurred as the Houthis tightened security in the capital following an Israeli strike that killed their prime minister and several other cabinet members. The UN condemned the arbitrary detention of its humanitarian staff. This action is the latest in a series of crackdowns by the Houthis on international aid organizations operating in the territories they control in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore is pushing back against President Donald Trump's recent criticisms of Baltimore, where the president threatened to send in the National Guard to address crime. Moore stated that while he has "no interest in fighting with the president," he will fight for his communities and touted recent progress in reducing crime in the city. The feud escalated after Trump called Baltimore a "hellhole," prompting Moore to invite the president on a public safety walk, an offer Trump rebuked. Moore characterized the president's threats as cynical and unhelpful to ongoing local efforts.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, European Union foreign ministers discussed a range of new strategies to bolster support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas floated were imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and exploring ways to use frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Another proposal involved inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production on EU soil, creating a "safe haven" for its defense industry. The discussions also touched on potentially shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian territory once a ceasefire is achieved.</p>

          <p>The article suggests that Donald Trump is turning his attention toward America's public universities, potentially signaling a new front in the nation's culture wars. Using the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as a backdrop, the piece notes the campus's recent history of student protests over the war in Gaza. This focus on higher education follows a pattern of conservative criticism aimed at universities for perceived liberal bias and campus activism. The brief article hints at a developing theme of increased political scrutiny and potential policy changes affecting these institutions under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto has announced that political parties have agreed to reduce some state-funded perks for politicians in an effort to quell nationwide anti-government protests. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers. In addition to reining in allowances, the president said a moratorium on overseas trips would be imposed. The unrest, driven by a range of economic and social grievances, represents the first significant challenge to President Prabowo's leadership since he took office.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital underwater ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past decade, a team of divers led by The Bay Foundation has smashed nearly 6 million purple sea urchins, whose populations had exploded and decimated the kelp forests. This effort has cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the fast-growing giant kelp to return rapidly. The restored "forgotten forest" now provides critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and helps protect the coastline.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to resume admitting vulnerable Afghans who were previously promised entry, many of whom are currently stranded in Pakistan and living in constant fear of deportation. After the Taliban takeover, thousands fled to Pakistan, where they have been waiting for German visas, but a pause in the program left them in limbo. With Pakistan planning to resume deportations, the situation has become critical for these families, who face persecution or death if sent back to Afghanistan. Following legal pressure, the German government is now restarting the security and screening process to allow entry.</p>
