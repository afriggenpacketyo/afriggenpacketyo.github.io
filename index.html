          <p>President Trump has appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as interim US attorney for Washington DC, following the withdrawal of his initial nominee due to Republican opposition in the Senate. Pirro, a long-time Trump ally, previously served as a Republican district attorney in Westchester, New York, and has been a vocal defender of Trump on Fox News. The appointment has raised legal questions, as it appears Trump is attempting to bypass Senate confirmation by relying on an aggressive interpretation of his appointment powers. Pirro replaces Ed Martin, who will now serve as director of the "weaponization working group.</p>

The directive also gives those who have not yet openly identified as transgender 30 days to remove themselves, with the Department of Defense planning to review medical records to identify additional individuals.

The article explores the legal requirements for the position and highlights concerns from medical ethicists about appointing someone who promotes unproven health interventions.

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes after President Trump referred to India as the "tariff king" and imposed tariffs on Indian exports. Experts believe that a trade deal with the U.S. is crucial for India's economic growth, but concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing. Some analysts argue that certain sectors, such as steel and pharmaceuticals, may not be significantly affected by the removal of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary, 'Pavements,' explores the legacy of the 90s indie-rock band Pavement through a mix of tour footage, staged events, and fictional elements. The film combines a 2022 reunion tour with an international exhibition of band memorabilia, an off-Broadway musical, and a faux-Hollywood biopic. Perry's approach aims to capture the band's unique essence, which is described as 'Slanted and Enchanted.' The film also touches upon Pavement's cultural impact, with a soundtrack that would seem to defy their essential earnestness.</p>
