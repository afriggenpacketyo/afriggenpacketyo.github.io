          <p>A vehicle rammed into a crowd of people waiting to enter a nightclub on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, injuring thirty people, with at least seven reported in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday when a Nissan Versa also struck a taco truck and a valet stand where people were gathered. Police have launched a large-scale investigation into the event, which also involved one victim being discovered with a gunshot wound, though the circumstances remain unclear. Emergency services, aided by people from inside the club, responded to the chaotic scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is under yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, bringing a threat of flash floods, power cuts, and travel disruption across all four nations. An earlier, more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, though some areas saw significant rainfall. The risk is heightened because the ground, parched from a recent heatwave, is less able to absorb water. Authorities have issued several localized flood alerts as unsettled weather is expected to continue into the next week.</p>

          <p>Kayem Foods is recalling more than 24,000 pounds of its ready-to-eat chicken sausage products after receiving consumer complaints about white plastic pieces found in the food. The nationwide recall affects 11-ounce packages of "al fresco CHICKEN SAUSAGE SWEET APPLE with Vermont made syrup" produced on June 28. While there have been no reports of injuries, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service advises consumers to either throw the products away or return them to the place of purchase for a refund.</p>

          <p>Spanish football club Barcelona has reportedly opened talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player is said to prefer. The proposed deal would initially be a loan with an option to buy, providing a new opportunity for Rashford, who has been training separately from the United squad. For Manchester United, the transfer would offer significant financial relief by removing his substantial salary from the wage bill, freeing up funds for new signings under head coach Ruben Amorim.</p>

The operation targeted Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities, particularly at the heavily fortified Fordo site where uranium has been enriched to near weapons-grade levels. Experts discuss the potential for hazardous material leakage, but note that the risk of a Chernobyl-style disaster is low since no active nuclear reactors were hit in the attacks.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has facilitated a "leapfrog development" in China's relationship with African nations. Chinese officials report that since FOCAC's inception in 2000, trade has surged nearly 30-fold and Chinese investment has grown almost 100-fold. This deepening economic engagement has been accompanied by a significant expansion of security cooperation, with China now training thousands of African military officers annually and becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a proposal for city-owned, low-price grocery stores in New York City, arguing that it is undermined by other progressive policies favored by its proponents. The author highlights that goals such as a $30 minimum wage, expanded worker benefits, and ethically-driven food procurement would substantially increase operating costs. This creates a fundamental conflict between the stated aim of offering the cheapest possible groceries and upholding other social and economic values, a trade-off the proposal fails to resolve.</p>

The "GENIUS Act," signed into law by President Trump, creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins. While supporters celebrate the law as a crucial step for financial innovation and American leadership in the sector, critics argue the rules are too weak, overly influenced by industry lobbying, and fail to adequately protect consumers from potential risks.

          <p>Following a week of intense sectarian violence that has reportedly killed hundreds, the Syrian presidency has announced an "immediate ceasefire" in the southern city of Suweida. The chaotic gun battles between local Bedouin tribesmen and the Druze community prompted the deployment of Syrian security forces and drew military intervention from neighboring Israel. While the ceasefire aims to halt the bloodshed, its effectiveness on the ground remains uncertain amid unverified reports that fighting has not stopped.</p>

Critics contend these policies are fueling public distrust in vaccines during a period of rising measles cases and are damaging the nation's premier health research agencies.</p>
