          <p>Jim Cramer identifies a significant risk to the stock market rally: the surge in secondary offerings from speculative, unprofitable companies. This trend, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble, floods the market with new supply, potentially hurting overall prices. While U.S.-China trade tensions are a factor, the proliferation of stock from "Denizens of Sherwood Forest" – high-flying, cash-burning companies – is seen as a more immediate danger. Investors are advised to be cautious as earnings season begins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Penn State has fired head football coach James Franklin following a "disastrous collapse" that ended their national title hopes. The decision came after a home loss to Northwestern, leaving the preseason No. 2 team at 3-3. Franklin, who led the Nittany Lions for 11 seasons, had a contract through 2031, resulting in a nearly $50 million buyout. Athletic director Pat Kraft expressed gratitude but stated the change was necessary for achieving Big Ten and national championships.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance claimed "a lot of waste and fraud" exists within Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are central to the ongoing government shutdown.

Vance accused Democrats of "hostage-taking," while House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the Republican stance partisan.</p>
