          <p>Thousands of demonstrators gathered in central London to protest President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom. Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, a group of over 50 unions and charities, the march featured various groups advocating against racism and for climate action. Participants expressed strong opposition to the president's politics, carrying signs with slogans like "no to racism" and "no to Trump." The Metropolitan Police estimated up to 5,000 attendees, and over 1,600 officers were deployed to manage the event, which included speeches from public figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce commented that the controversial "tush push" play will be under intense scrutiny from NFL referees going forward due to widespread criticism. Speaking on his podcast, Kelce warned that officials will be actively looking for any reason to penalize the play, such as offensive linemen lining up in the neutral zone or false starting. He defended his former teammates, stating that any early movement is an attempt to perfectly time the snap, not a deliberate effort to gain an unfair advantage. The play remains a major topic of debate among fans and analysts.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Secretary Bessent Reportedly Made Mortgage Claims Similar to Those Used Against Fed's Cook</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report has revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once signed mortgage documents declaring two separate properties in New York and Massachusetts as his "principal residence" on the same day in 2007. This situation draws parallels to the allegations of mortgage fraud President Trump has leveled against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, whom he has attempted to fire. While Bessent had previously stated that such allegations against a Fed official should be examined, his own documents show similar language. Mortgage experts noted there was no sign of wrongdoing in either case, as lenders were likely aware of the properties' actual statuses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the UK has become a showcase of "fashion diplomacy," with the sartorial choices of the First Lady and the Royal Family drawing significant attention. Melania Trump's attire, including a wide-brimmed purple hat and a classic Burberry trench coat, was seen as a nod to both her support for her husband and respect for British design. Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla also wore outfits by British designers, with color choices that appeared coordinated to reflect the US flag. These carefully selected ensembles are viewed by experts as powerful tools for sending diplomatic messages during high-stakes international events.</p>

          <p>Florida is scheduled to execute David Pittman, 63, for the 1990 murders of his estranged wife's parents and sister, a crime which also involved setting their house on fire. This event would mark the state's 12th execution in 2025, a record number under Governor Ron DeSantis, who has signed more death warrants this year than any of his predecessors. Pittman's final appeals, which focused on claims of intellectual disability at the time of the crime, were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.

          <p>Former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee that she was fired by President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for "holding the line on scientific integrity." Monarez claimed her ousting was a direct result of her refusal to preemptively accept recommendations from a vaccine advisory panel and fire career officials, as she alleged Kennedy had demanded. Kennedy has disputed this account, stating Monarez was fired partly because she admitted to being untrustworthy. The hearing highlighted intense political friction over vaccine policy and the independence of public health agencies.</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are struggling with payments that exceed their income. This article outlines several strategies for managing overwhelming debt beyond simple budgeting. Options include debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate, and debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies to reduce rates and fees. For more severe situations, debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, while bankruptcy can offer a complete financial reset as a last resort.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, setting the new target range between 4% and 4.25%. This marks the first rate reduction since December 2024 and comes as a response to a slowing labor market and concerns about weakening economic growth. Fed officials also projected two additional cuts in 2025, signaling a strategic shift to support employment amid what they now see as rising downside risks. The decision aims to encourage consumer spending and business investment while continuing to manage inflation, which remains above the central bank's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers found that patients who took a 500 mg supplement twice daily saw a significant risk reduction, particularly for squamous cell carcinoma. The most substantial benefit was observed in individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis.

          <p>The average cost of homeowners insurance in the U.S. has increased by nearly 70% over the past five years, with single-family homeowners now paying an average of $2,370 annually.

Additionally, surging home values and the rising cost of building materials have made it more expensive for insurers to cover potential claims.

          <p>San Francisco Supervisor Joel Engardio has been recalled from office following his vote to permanently close a two-mile stretch of the Great Highway to create a car-free park named Sunset Dunes. While the measure passed citywide, it was unpopular in his district, where residents raised concerns about traffic and quality of life. Engardio is the fifth elected official in the city to be ousted in a recall vote in the last four years, reflecting a volatile political climate. In a statement conceding the result, Engardio stood by his decision, predicting the park would soon be seen as an invaluable city asset.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump was honored with a state banquet at Windsor Castle, a key diplomatic event during his visit to the UK. The guest list was notably heavy on political figures and technology executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, but lacked major entertainment celebrities. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales. The elaborate event in St George's Hall is a traditional part of a state visit, designed to strengthen diplomatic ties through high-level hospitality, complete with royal toasts, fanfares, and fine dining.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is moving through Congress with the aim of protecting seniors and other vulnerable adults from financial abuse. The legislation would allow financial institutions, such as mutual fund companies, to delay transactions if they suspect a client is being exploited. The proposal, which has versions in both the House and Senate, also requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to report to Congress on further ways to prevent such abuse. Elder financial fraud is a significant issue, with older adults losing an estimated $28.3 billion annually to these schemes.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to an issue with door trim. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a potential road hazard for other drivers. The issue is attributed to a vehicle assembly problem rather than a parts defect. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free, and Chrysler has stated it is unaware of any accidents or injuries related to the flaw.</p>

Israel describes the area as Hamas's "last stronghold," but the operation has drawn sharp condemnation from international aid agencies, who warn of the unconscionable humanitarian situation.

          <p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Director-General of the World Trade Organization, offered a surprisingly optimistic perspective on the global trade disruptions caused by President Trump's unilateral tariffs. Speaking at a WTO forum, she framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of "reglobalisation." While acknowledging the system has been heavily disrupted, she pushed back against claims that the WTO is irrelevant, stating that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. She expressed excitement about the potential for the trade system to evolve and adapt.</p>

          <p>A new report from Yale University researchers reveals that Russia is operating an extensive network of re-education sites for Ukrainian children, which includes military training for those as young as eight. The study identified 210 locations across Russia and occupied Ukraine where children are stripped of their cultural identity and taught Russian patriotic narratives. At 19% of these sites, investigators found evidence of combat skills training, including grenade throwing and drone manufacturing. The findings suggest a systematic effort to militarize Ukrainian youth, adding a disturbing dimension to the ongoing war and accusations of war crimes.</p>

          <p>With Bitcoin's value nearly doubling over the past year, more Americans are considering adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts. While some financial experts view crypto as a high-risk, volatile asset that is inappropriate for long-term savings, others are warming to it as a potential high-reward investment. Proponents suggest that for younger investors with a high risk tolerance, a small, carefully considered allocation of 5% to 15% could be beneficial. They stress the importance of thorough research and a clear investment thesis, warning that no one should invest more than they can afford to lose entirely. (not investment advice)</p>

The exchange highlights the intense pressure on budget airlines, which are struggling with higher costs, increased competition from major carriers' basic economy fares, and the recent bankruptcy of Spirit Airlines.

The lawsuit claims this violates federal law by using race as an eligibility criterion.
