        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, former executives of OneTaste, a sexual wellness company promoting "orgasmic meditation," were convicted of forced labor conspiracy. Prosecutors successfully argued that they manipulated young women into performing degrading sex acts for the company's benefit, targeting individuals with prior trauma. The executives coerced employees into long hours with little pay, intimidating them into financial ruin to pay for expensive courses. The company, now rebranded as The Institute of OM Foundation, continues to operate despite the conviction, with Daedone still featured on its website. The guilty verdicts have brought closure to the witnesses who testified at trial. The article provides context for the company's history, including its rise to prominence following a New York Times profile and subsequent allegations of abuse. The case highlights the exploitation of vulnerable individuals under the guise of sexual empowerment.</p>

          <p>All 12 members of the Fulbright scholarship board resigned in protest, alleging the Trump administration interfered with the selection of award recipients. The board members stated the administration denied awards to a substantial number of already-selected individuals and initiated an unauthorized review process for 1,200 approved foreign award recipients. They argued these actions undermine the program's merit-based selection process and its insulation from political influence. The State Department countered that the resigning members were partisan appointees attempting to undermine President Trump's executive orders.
