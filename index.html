          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, held at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, was expected to draw over 100,000 attendees. President Donald Trump, who called Kirk a "great man," was scheduled to speak, along with other prominent figures like Donald Trump Jr. and Tucker Carlson. The event was designated with a top-level security rating by the Department of Homeland Security, equivalent to that of the Super Bowl. Attendees were encouraged to wear patriotic colors to honor Kirk's memory and influence, particularly among young conservatives.</p>

The White House has stated that the new TikTok board will have a majority of American members and that the U.S. will control the app's algorithm, addressing key national security concerns.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron condemned public comments made by U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner, who accused the French government of not doing enough to combat antisemitism. Macron labeled the ambassador's statements, which linked France's foreign policy on Israel to Jewish safety, as an "unacceptable" breach of diplomatic protocol. The dispute highlights growing tensions between the two allies, particularly as France, alongside other Western nations, prepares to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations, a move the Trump administration opposes.</p>

          <p>The Great Britain and Northern Ireland athletics team concluded the World Championships in Tokyo without securing a single gold medal for the first time in 22 years. The team's total of five medals marks their lowest return since 2005 and placed them 21st in the overall medal table. Injuries to key athletes and the failure of any relay teams to medal contributed to the lackluster performance. Officials and coaches are now set to conduct a thorough review to understand the missed opportunities and prepare for future competitions, including the 2027 World Championships in Beijing.</p>

          <p>Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy asserted that the U.S. is in a perilous moment, accusing President Donald Trump of using the full authority of the federal government to punish his political opponents. Murphy cited the use of the FCC and the Department of Justice as examples of efforts to silence critics, comparing these actions to tactics used in repressive, authoritarian countries. He called on Republicans to challenge the president's actions, which he argues represent a fundamental threat to the American value of free speech and the right to protest.</p>

          <p>In an interview, former National Economic Council director Gary Cohn provided his analysis of the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut. He explained that while the move was expected, it primarily affects overnight bank lending rates and does not directly lower borrowing costs for consumers on items like mortgages or auto loans. Cohn also noted that the Fed's action acknowledges a cooling labor market, where job creation has slowed as companies manage expenses by reducing their workforce through natural attrition.

          <p>In an effort to protect marine wildlife, the Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on plastic flying rings at its local beaches. The decision follows growing concern over the severe and often fatal injuries these toys cause to seals, which can get the rings stuck around their necks. The council's action aligns with a national campaign supported by the UK Seal Alliance and follows similar moves by other coastal councils and major retailers to remove the hazardous items from sale and use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child development researcher who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, raising children with exceptional social skills goes beyond teaching manners. The foundation is built through nine key practices modeled at home, including talking openly about feelings to build emotional vocabulary and validating a child's emotions to build their confidence. Other crucial behaviors involve modeling empathy in daily life, allowing children to solve minor conflicts independently, and treating mistakes as valuable learning opportunities rather than failures.</p>

Analysts interpret this move as a strategic effort by Riyadh to diversify its alliances and reduce its sole reliance on the United States as its primary security guarantor in the Gulf region. The agreement comes at a time of increased geopolitical tension involving the U.S. and China, and it reflects a broader trend of Gulf Arab states reassessing their foreign policy and security arrangements.</p>

          <p>While the recent recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, and Australia is a significant diplomatic step, it raises the critical question of who would lead such a state. Palestinian politics are deeply fractured, with the West Bank governed by the Palestinian Authority under Mahmoud Abbas and the Gaza Strip historically controlled by Hamas. With no elections held since 2006, there is no unified, democratically legitimized leadership, posing a formidable obstacle to establishing a functioning and viable government for a newly recognized state.</p>

          <p>A recent scientific study has overturned the long-held belief about the origin of Stonehenge's Altar Stone. By creating a chemical fingerprint from mineral grains within the six-ton sandstone block, researchers from Curtin University found that its composition matches rocks from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland. This contradicts the prevailing theory that the stone was sourced from Wales, like many of the other smaller bluestones. The discovery raises new questions about the advanced transportation methods and long-distance trade networks of Neolithic Britain.</p>

          <p>This article explores how authoritarian and fascist regimes historically, such as Nazi Germany, have relied on promoting traditional domestic roles for women to maintain social stability and advance state ideology. It draws a parallel to the modern digital "womanosphere," where conservative influencers promote homemaking and traditional femininity, often framing it as an empowering choice while aligning with a political agenda that curtails women's rights. The analysis argues that these movements romanticize female subservience to conceal a reliance on women's unpaid labor to compensate for state failures.</p>
