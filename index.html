          <h2>Tariff Simulator Predicts US Imports from China Could Drop by Nearly Half a Trillion Dollars by 2027</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 14:31:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new tariff simulator forecasts that U.S. imports from China could decline by as much as $485 billion by 2027 due to the ongoing trade war. The analysis, based on current tariff rates, also predicts significant export drops for other nations linked to China's supply chain, like Vietnam and South Korea. Conversely, the model suggests the U.S. will increase imports from partners like Canada and Mexico, reconfiguring global trade relationships. The report highlights the economic uncertainty and shifts in manufacturing and exports caused by the persistent tariff disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from six United Nations agencies indicates that over 2.3 billion people worldwide experience moderate to severe food insecurity, with 673.2 million being undernourished. While global hunger levels have slowly decreased since 2022, the affordability of healthy food has worsened, driven by rising food prices, the economic effects of the pandemic, and conflict. The analysis highlights stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the most severely affected region, where one in five people is undernourished. The report also notes that women disproportionately suffer from food insecurity compared to men across the globe.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to child sexual abuse material, which had over 120,000 members. Dubbed "Operation Grayskull," the investigation led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals, including a key administrator labeled one of the world's most significant purveyors of such content. The sophisticated network utilized encryption to trade millions of horrific files depicting the sexual assault and abuse of children. Officials are hailing the operation as one of the most successful takedowns of its kind, effectively dismantling the infrastructure of these abusive online communities.</p>

          <p>Adam Coy, a former Columbus police officer, has been sentenced to a mandatory 15 years to life in prison for the murder of Andre Hill in December 2020. Hill, a 47-year-old Black man, was unarmed and holding a cellphone when Coy shot him four times in a garage. Despite Coy's claim of self-defense, prosecutors argued Hill was not a threat and body camera footage showed a significant delay before aid was rendered. The case, which resulted in a $10 million settlement for Hill's family, occurred during a period of national reckoning over police violence.</p>

          <p>The European Union has finalized a trade deal with the United States, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU exports and committing to significant investment in the US. While EU leaders presented the agreement as a way to restore stability and avoid a harsher trade war, it has drawn sharp criticism from within the bloc. Leaders from France and Hungary have condemned the deal as a "submission" and economically damaging, noting the tariff is a steep increase from pre-Trump levels. The agreement averts steeper tariffs but highlights internal EU divisions and the challenges of negotiating with the current US administration.</p>

The bank, which is preparing to charge fees for this data access, also claims that transactions involving these intermediaries are linked to a higher rate of fraud claims.

The appeal is centered on the argument that a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida should have protected Maxwell from federal charges in New York. Her lawyers contend that the government has an obligation to honor the terms of the agreement, which they claim was not geographically limited and applied to any co-conspirators.

          <p>The 2025 trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States were marked by months of uncertainty and dramatic shifts. The talks began after President Trump imposed sweeping steel and auto tariffs, prompting the EU to prepare retaliatory measures. Throughout the spring and summer, Trump threatened escalating tariff rates, at one point suggesting a 50% levy, before ultimately agreeing to a deal with a 15% baseline tariff. This timeline traces the key moments, from the initial tariff announcements and EU countermeasures to the last-minute delays and the final, contentious agreement reached in late July.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis explores the differences between the new US-EU trade deal and the one previously struck with the United Kingdom. The EU faces a 15% baseline tariff on most goods sold to the US, which is higher than the 10% tariff the UK faces, potentially giving UK firms a competitive price advantage. However, the comparison is complex due to specific quotas and unresolved details, such as those concerning car and steel exports. For example, the UK's lower auto tariff only applies to a limited number of vehicles. The article concludes that while the UK appears to have a more advantageous deal, the final economic impact remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
