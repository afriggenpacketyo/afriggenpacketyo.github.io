          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed shock and frustration regarding a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, a group recently involved in disruptive activities, including an incident at RAF Brize Norton. While acknowledging the right to protest, Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized that actions supporting Palestine Action exceed the bounds of legitimate protest, describing the group as an "organised extremist criminal group." Due to legal limitations before the group is officially proscribed, the Met cannot prevent the protest but has imposed conditions to prevent disorder and serious disruption, with breaches of the law to be dealt with robustly. Palestine Action confirmed the protest location was moved to Trafalgar Square due to the imposed restrictions.</p>

          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack in the Kyiv region resulted in at least seven deaths and several injuries, with six fatalities occurring in a high-rise building in the capital. The Ukrainian air force reported that 352 Russian drones and 16 missiles targeted Ukrainian territory, primarily in the Kyiv area, marking an intensification of Russian air attacks in recent weeks. President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet with PM Keir Starmer in London to discuss UK military support for Ukraine, while Ukrainian commander-in-chief Oleksandr Syrsky vowed to step up Ukrainian strikes on Russia. Diplomatic efforts to end the three-year war have stalled, with no new talks scheduled after limited prisoner exchanges.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump hinted at potential regime change in Iran, raising concerns about further escalation. Israel reported additional strikes on Iranian missile, satellite, and radar sites, as well as airports, while Iran launched missiles at Israel, causing disruptions to electricity supply. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi urged a return to negotiations, emphasizing the need for IAEA inspectors to access Iran's nuclear sites to account for uranium stockpiles, particularly the 400kg enriched to 60%. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the U.S. would be prepared to meet and discuss the issue diplomatically if Iran agreed to abandon its enrichment work.</p>

          <p>While installing pipes in Lima, Peru, utility workers discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child, marking the latest in a series of pre-Hispanic tomb discoveries in the capital. The mummy, believed to be a boy between 10 and 15 years old, was found in a sitting position with arms and legs bent, wrapped in a shroud containing calabash gourds. The burial and associated ceramic objects, including plates and jugs decorated with geometric figures and fishermen, are attributed to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which inhabited the Lima area between the 11th and 15th centuries. Utility companies in Peru are required to hire archaeologists during excavation work due to the high probability of encountering heritage sites.</p>

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, with a central component being lower energy costs for businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for over 7,000 manufacturing firms, while about 500 of the most energy-intensive firms will have their network charges cut by up to 90% from 2026. The plan also includes measures to expedite grid connections for new factories, upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending, focusing on eight specific sectors. Acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticized the plans, saying the UK needed "a serious approach to energy policy" that "tackles the root cause of our high energy prices".</p>

Grossi stressed that IAEA inspectors require access to Iran's nuclear sites to assess the situation and damage resulting from recent Israeli and U.S. attacks, noting that the underground damage at Fordo is difficult to assess. He indicated that the explosive payload used and the vibration-sensitive nature of centrifuges suggest significant damage is expected to have occurred.

Wolf, who won gold in the men's 100-kilogram judo event at the 2021 Olympics and finished seventh at the Paris Games, is scheduled to make his debut at Tokyo Dome in January. A longtime fan of professional wrestling, Wolf decided to make the switch after last summer's Olympics, citing his desire to challenge himself on a new stage.

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethics of enforcing academic rules against AI-generated writing, as students increasingly view it as a legitimate tool. The dilemma highlights a conflict between the traditional, transformative purpose of humanities education and the modern, product-based vision, which AI exposes as a sham. The author argues that the real value of humanities lies in character cultivation, particularly practical wisdom (phronesis), which involves making sound judgments in complex situations. Rather than strictly banning AI, the author suggests allowing its use but requiring students to reflect on how it alters their thinking and learning, thus reintroducing cognitive friction and fostering critical reasoning skills.</p>

Durant, despite being 36, remains a top scorer, averaging 26.6 points per game with a 52.7% shooting percentage. The Rockets have also reportedly extended head coach Ime Udoka following their second-place finish in the Western Conference, signaling a busy offseason for the team.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions, there is speculation that Iran might retaliate for U.S. strikes by closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil shipping channel. Blocking the strait, through which about 20% of global oil and gas flows, would have severe economic consequences, disrupting international trade and increasing oil prices. Experts suggest Iran could use mines and attacks on foreign vessels to block the strait, though the U.S. and its allies could likely re-establish maritime traffic. While Iran has repeatedly threatened to close the strait, it has never followed through, and analysts suggest doing so would harm Iran's own economy and alienate key trading partners like China.</p>

Furthermore, the bill proposes a $3,500 fee for sponsoring unaccompanied migrant children and allocates significant funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for detention and border security.

          <p>The October 7 massacre ordered by Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, did not lead to the destruction of Israel, but rather to the dismantling of its enemies, with Hamas largely destroyed and its leaders dead. Sinwar's miscalculation, based on an underestimation of Israelis' desire to live in their homeland, has resulted in the comprehensive weakening of Hezbollah and the control of Iranian skies by the Israeli Air Force. The demolition of this axis occurred because Israel reconstituted its fighting and intelligence capabilities, and because Sinwar and his allies fundamentally misunderstood their enemy. Trump's radical intervention in the Middle East may turn out to be catastrophic, but could also be remembered as the president who averted a second Holocaust.</p>

          <p>A 2004 law, the Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation Act, has led to a surge in the number of pancreata collected for research due to a provision counting pancreata used for islet cell research toward organ procurement organizations' (OPOs) certification. This has incentivized OPOs to collect more pancreata for research, improving their grades from federal regulators and avoiding decertification. While the law aimed to expand access to islet cell transplants, the surge in research pancreata has not translated to more transplants, with many pancreata ending up in biobanks or freezers. The Senate Finance Committee has investigated the issue, finding that OPOs often do not track the actual use of the pancreata.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, there is debate over whether regime change is the solution to ending Iran's nuclear program. The author argues that nationalism, not theocracy, is the primary driving force in Iranian politics, and a new government, even if democratic, would likely prioritize Iran's survival and potentially surpass the current regime's belligerence. The attacks have likely convinced more Iranians that nuclear restraint is national suicide, and the intervention has reduced the distance between the Iranian state and society. The author suggests that the attacks may guarantee that Iran will be a nuclear weapons state in the next 5 to 10 years, particularly if the regime changes.</p>

While Iran's parliament has approved the closure, the decision rests with the national security council, raising concerns about higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. A closure would likely provoke hostilities and target Iran's oil production and export infrastructure, with China, a major oil customer, unlikely to welcome disruptions to shipping routes.
