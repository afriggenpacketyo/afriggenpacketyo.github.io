          <p>Amid escalating conflict, U.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg has arrived in Kyiv for a week of critical discussions focused on defense, sanctions against Moscow, and enhanced cooperation. His visit underscores a significant policy development, as President Trump has committed to sending desperately needed Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine, with funding from NATO and the EU. This renewed support, framed by the principle of "peace through strength," marks a notable change in the U.S. approach after previous talks stalled and some arms deliveries were paused, aiming to bolster Ukraine's capabilities against intensifying Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>London Southend Airport has canceled all flights and will remain closed until further notice after a plane crashed upon landing, which witnesses described as a massive "fireball." The 12-meter aircraft, operated by Dutch company Zeusch Aviation, was reportedly on fire before it impacted the ground. Emergency services are on the scene, and authorities have begun an investigation into the incident with the Air Accident Investigation Branch. The number of casualties has not yet been confirmed, and the transport secretary is receiving regular updates on the tragic event.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice President JD Vance engaged in a public dispute over the Trump administration's immigration policies this weekend. The exchange began after Newsom criticized Vance on social media during the Vice President's family vacation to Disneyland, highlighting the separation of migrant families due to mass deportation efforts. The political tension is amplified by recent ICE raids on California farms that resulted in one death and the detention of hundreds, sparking protests and a federal investigation into child labor violations at one of the sites.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market continues to weaken. With rates currently at 4.25%, Bailey stated his belief that the path for rates is downward, citing signs that the economy is growing below its potential and creating "slack." This potential monetary easing comes as the UK economy contracted in May, job vacancies have fallen to their lowest level since 2021, and businesses express concern about a potential recession.

          <p>Singapore's economy successfully averted a technical recession by posting 1.4% growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with year-over-year GDP growth accelerating to 4.3%. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry issued a warning about significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, citing a lack of clarity over U.S. tariff policies and ongoing global trade volatility.

          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing analyst expectations and bolstered by a temporary tariff truce with the United States that slowed the decline in shipments to America. The growth was also driven by strong demand from Southeast Asian and European markets, while imports saw their first increase of the year. Notably, exports of rare earths surged by 60% to a record high, and steel exports also jumped, despite widespread trade protections, helping to offset weaker domestic demand and support China's overall economic performance.

          <p>President Donald Trump marked the one-year anniversary of the failed assassination attempt on his life by attending the FIFA Club World Cup final between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain in New Jersey. In a statement, he said he believes God saved him for the purpose of restoring the Republic. The high-profile international sporting event also served as an informal venue for diplomacy, with a U.S. envoy confirming plans to meet with Qatari officials, who are mediating Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations, during the match.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Uncovers Dubious and Potentially Illegal Sales Tactics at UK Estate Agencies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 01:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An undercover investigation by BBC Panorama has exposed questionable sales tactics at two of the UK's largest estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. At Connells, an agent was found to be favoring a buyer who agreed to use in-house mortgage services over a cash buyer who might have offered more, a practice known as "conditional selling." The investigation also found that Purplebricks allegedly overvalued properties to secure listings and then incentivized staff to persuade sellers to reduce prices, raising concerns about unethical practices that harm consumers in the property market.</p>

          <p>A woman has been arrested at Gatwick Airport for trafficking after arriving from Nigeria with a baby she falsely claimed was her own. A Family Court investigation revealed a "fundamental lie," including forged documents and a staged birth scene, after DNA tests proved she had no genetic link to the child. The case has exposed a disturbing trend of babies being unlawfully brought to the UK, with experts linking it to illegal "baby factories" in West Africa where young girls are sometimes kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and forced to give birth.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation. This move, which is not a full acquisition of the company, represents the latest escalation in the fierce AI "talent war" among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. The deal allows Google to absorb world-class talent in "agentic coding" to advance its Gemini AI models, while Windsurf remains an independent entity free to license its popular technology to others.</p>

          <p>The European Union is caught in a difficult position as it faces escalating trade conflicts with the world's two largest economies. EU trade ministers are set to formulate a response to President Trump's recent announcement of a potential 30% tariff on all EU-made goods, with France urging a strong retaliatory stance. This pressure from the U.S. comes as EU leaders also prepare for a challenging summit in Beijing, leaving the bloc navigating a precarious path between two superpowers who are increasingly turning up the economic pressure.

          <p>At least 30 people have been killed and around 100 injured in violent sectarian clashes between Bedouin Sunni tribes and fighters from the Druze religious minority in the southern Syrian city of Sweida. The violence highlights the country's extreme fragility following the collapse of the Assad regime in December. Syria's new Islamic-led government is struggling to establish control, and the interior ministry has announced its forces will intervene directly to de-escalate the conflict as spiritual and local leaders call for calm and self-restraint.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers used their first two picks in the Major League Baseball draft, 40th and 41st overall, to select a pair of teammates from the University of Arkansas. The team chose left-handed pitcher Zach Root, noted for his versatile pitch mix and a 3.62 ERA, and contact-hitting outfielder Charles Davalan, who hit .346 with more walks than strikeouts. Both players were key contributors to an Arkansas team that reached the College World Series and are now set to continue as teammates in the Dodgers' minor league system.</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, the French woman who became a national symbol of courage, has been awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest civilian decoration. Pelicot gained international recognition for her powerful public testimony against her ex-husband, who for over a decade drugged and sexually assaulted her and invited dozens of other men to do the same. Her bravery in insisting on a public trial, which resulted in the conviction of 51 men, shocked the nation and was instrumental in pushing for legal reforms that now include a lack of consent in France's definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara right-handed pitcher Tyler Bremner with the number two overall pick in the MLB draft. The choice aligns with the team's strategy of drafting college players who can be fast-tracked to the major leagues. The selection is particularly poignant for Bremner, who lost his mother to cancer in June and spoke about how pitching for something bigger than himself helped him perform on the field during her illness. The Angels scouting director praised Bremner's resilience and potential, highlighting his powerful fastball and changeup.</p>
