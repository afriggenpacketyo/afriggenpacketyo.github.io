          <p>The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. This significant deal consolidates major media assets, including the CBS broadcast network, Paramount Pictures, and the Nickelodeon channel. As part of the approval, Skydance has committed to ensuring a diversity of viewpoints in its programming to address concerns about media bias. An independent third party will be hired to evaluate complaints and report directly to the new company's president.</p>

          <p>A car fire in an Arlington, Virginia, parking lot escalated into a dramatic explosion, which was captured on video. The Arlington Fire & EMS department identified the event as a Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion (BLEVE) caused by the vehicle's fuel tank rupturing. The blast damaged at least three other cars, but fortunately, no injuries to the public or firefighters were reported. Officials have deemed the incident non-suspicious and are currently investigating the specific cause of the initial fire.</p>

          <p>Kristin Cabot, the chief people officer at the tech firm Astronomer, has resigned from her position. Her departure follows the resignation of the company's CEO, Andy Byron, just a week prior. The resignations occurred after a video clip from a Coldplay concert went viral, appearing to show the two executives in an intimate embrace on the venue's large screen before they quickly hid from the camera. The company initiated an investigation after the clip gained widespread attention on social media, leading to both their exits.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is set to test a new lineup of ten beverages in hundreds of its U.S. locations, aiming to attract younger consumers with bold and flavorful drink options. The new menu is inspired by learnings from the company's short-lived beverage-focused spinoff, CosMc's, which was discontinued earlier this year. Instead of separate stores, the drinks will be integrated into the main McDonald's menu, starting in restaurants across Wisconsin and Colorado. This move is part of a broader strategy to boost sales and capitalize on the growing demand for specialty drinks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has withdrawn the nomination of Alina Habba to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, a procedural move that allows her to continue serving in the role in an acting capacity. The decision came after a federal district court in New Jersey attempted to replace her with her deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, as Habba's initial interim term was expiring. By pulling the Senate nomination, the administration circumvents a federal law that would have prevented her from serving as an acting officer while being a formal nominee, escalating a conflict between the executive branch and the judiciary.</p>

The case, which centered on whether the woman consented to sexual acts with multiple players in a hotel room, has drawn significant public attention in Canada.

The 60-millimeter crystal is designed to convert laser beams into mid- to far-infrared frequencies, which are more effective for long-distance transmission through the atmosphere. This breakthrough could enable the creation of ground-based laser systems capable of targeting satellites. The material can also withstand significantly higher power levels than existing military-grade crystals, overcoming a major technical hurdle in laser weapon development.</p>

          <p>One year after a widely mocked and awkward appearance, UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster presented a poised and confident image at the Big Ten media days. He addressed his previous performance with humor while outlining a vision for his program, which showed significant improvement in the latter half of last season. Foster has since overhauled his coaching staff and boosted recruiting, notably landing quarterback Nico Iamaleava from the transfer portal. While acknowledging the team must earn respect, he conveyed a strong sense of readiness and optimism for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize the state of Palestine, with the formal declaration to be made at the UN General Assembly in September. Macron framed the decision as part of France's commitment to a just and lasting peace, emphasizing the urgent need for a ceasefire and humanitarian aid in Gaza. The move makes France one of the most powerful European nations to grant recognition. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned the decision, stating that it "rewards terror" and undermines Israel's security.</p>

          <p>USC head football coach Lincoln Riley stated emphatically that he "absolutely" wants to continue the university's historic football rivalry against Notre Dame. However, he confirmed that negotiations are complicated by uncertainty surrounding the future format of the College Football Playoff. Riley supports a Big Ten proposal for four automatic qualifiers, which he believes would help preserve significant nonconference games like the one against Notre Dame. He stressed that while he values the tradition, his primary loyalty is to USC's best interests as scheduling and playoff structures evolve.</p>

          <p>In a rare and extraordinary visit to the Federal Reserve, President Trump publicly clashed with Fed Chair Jerome Powell over the cost of the central bank's building renovations. During a press availability, Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately disputed on camera. The tense exchange highlights the president's ongoing pressure campaign against the Fed and its independent control over interest rates. Despite the confrontation, Trump later appeared to back away from recent threats to fire Powell, calling such a move unlikely.</p>

          <p>California's State Water Resources Control Board is moving forward with a controversial plan, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, that offers water agencies more flexibility in meeting environmental standards for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. The proposal allows agencies to choose between traditional, strict river flow regulations or an alternative path involving negotiated "voluntary agreements" that combine reduced flow commitments with funding for habitat restoration. While supporters claim this collaborative approach can improve the ecosystem with less water supply impact, environmental groups argue it will harm endangered fish species and weaken crucial protections.</p>

          <p>A review of Tesla's finances reveals the company's decision to sell 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 was poorly timed, costing it billions in potential profits. The electric vehicle maker sold the assets when the cryptocurrency's value was near its low, missing a subsequent massive rebound. Had Tesla retained its full investment, its holdings would be worth approximately $5 billion today, instead of the current $1.24 billion. This analysis comes as the company faces struggles in its core auto business, where the extra cash from a well-timed sale could have been beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for cities to clear homeless encampments and compel individuals into mental health or addiction treatment. The order signals a major policy shift, prioritizing funding for programs that require sobriety and for cities that enforce camping bans, while moving away from the "Housing First" model. The directive also seeks to limit "harm reduction" programs. While the White House says the goal is to restore public order, critics argue the measures are punitive and will worsen the crisis without addressing its root causes.</p>
