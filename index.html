          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve claims that it misled customers into signing up for its Prime membership and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The agreement includes a $1 billion civil penalty, one of the largest in FTC history, and allocates $1.5 billion for customer refunds. As part of the settlement, Amazon, which did not admit wrongdoing, is required to make its enrollment and cancellation procedures more transparent and straightforward for consumers. This resolution concludes a significant legal battle that began in 2023, allowing the company to move past this regulatory challenge.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft has agreed to sell an 8% minority stake in the NFL franchise in a deal that establishes the team's valuation at $9 billion. The buyers are investment firm Sixth Street Partners and billionaire Dean Metropoulos, who will acquire approximately 3% and 5% respectively. This transaction, which is still pending approval from the NFL's finance committee, keeps the sale proceeds on the team's balance sheet and does not include the Kraft family's MLS team, the New England Revolution. The sale reflects the soaring valuations of major sports franchises across the league.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has altered his public stance on the war in Ukraine, suggesting the nation could win and reclaim all its territory, a statement that has drawn varied responses from Ukrainian leaders. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed positive surprise, viewing it as a signal of continued American support. However, other Ukrainian politicians remain skeptical, with some interpreting Trump's words as a move to distance the U.S. from the conflict by shifting responsibility to European allies. Analysts suggest the change may be a result of diplomatic efforts or Trump's realization that his previous approach was ineffective.</p>

          <p>A branch of the National Archives improperly released the largely unredacted military file of Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat in the New Jersey governor's race, to a political opponent's ally. The disclosed documents contained sensitive personal information, including her Social Security number and home addresses, in a significant breach of privacy laws. The National Personnel Records Center admitted a technician failed to follow standard procedures and has since apologized to the congresswoman and initiated an internal review. The incident has drawn sharp criticism and calls for an investigation into the politicization of veteran records.</p>

He also recounted painful childhood memories, including an instance of his father's infidelity that led to his mother's emotional collapse.

          <p>The FBI has revealed that the suspect in the shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, which killed one detainee and critically injured two others, engaged in extensive pre-attack planning. Authorities found notes at the home of the 29-year-old suspect, Joshua Jahn, indicating his intent was to "maximize lethality against ICE personnel" and that he did not intend to harm detainees. The evidence shows Jahn researched ballistics, tracked ICE agent presence, and used a ladder to position himself on a rooftop for the attack. The incident highlights a disturbing trend of increasing political violence in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has decreased, making it a more affordable option for homeowners. For a $75,000 loan, the monthly payment on a 10-year term is now approximately $923, while a 15-year term costs around $726. These figures are lower than they were earlier in the year and last fall, reflecting the more favorable borrowing environment. Homeowners are advised to carefully calculate their potential costs and compare them with other options like HELOCs to determine the best fit for their financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump publicly urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to stop purchasing oil from Russia, framing it as a crucial step amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. The discussion occurred as Turkey continues to seek a deal to purchase advanced F-35 fighter jets from the United States, a sale previously blocked after Turkey acquired a Russian air defense system. Trump expressed optimism that a resolution on the F-35s and related sanctions could be reached soon, but linked progress to Turkey's cooperation on broader geopolitical issues, including cutting off Moscow's energy revenue.</p>

Researchers found she possessed rare genetic variants that protected against many age-related disorders and maintained excellent health without cancer, cardiovascular disease, or dementia. Her lifestyle habits, including not smoking or drinking and consuming a diet rich in fish, olive oil, and three plain yogurts daily, are also credited.

The defendant states have cited privacy concerns, arguing that releasing sensitive data like birth dates and partial Social Security numbers without proper legal justification could compromise voter security.

The author contends that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, which some scholars label a genocide, warrants a similar moral stance from the sport's governing body. The argument also points to alleged violations of FIFA statutes, such as Israeli clubs playing in West Bank settlements and the killing of nearly 800 Palestinian athletes. The article calls on FIFA to apply its stated human rights principles consistently and not engage in selective ethics.</p>

          <p>A satirical statue depicting Donald Trump and the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein holding hands was removed from the National Mall in Washington D.C., just one day after it was erected by an anonymous artist group. The artists stated the piece was created to "honor the one and only true friend Donald Trump seems to have." Although the group had a permit, the National Park Service removed the statue, claiming it was non-compliant. The incident reflects ongoing public fascination and anger regarding the former president's past association with Epstein and the handling of related investigative files.</p>

This perspective aligns with a growing trend among business leaders who believe that as AI automates more tasks, uniquely human skills like creativity, critical thinking, and empathy will become even more valuable in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Pediatricians and infectious disease specialists are refuting medical advice given by President Trump, who suggested parents should wait until a child is 12 years old to receive the hepatitis B vaccine. Doctors stress that this guidance is dangerous, as infants are at the highest risk of developing chronic, life-threatening liver disease if infected. They emphasize that the virus can be transmitted from mother to child at birth or through contact with infected bodily fluids on surfaces, not just sexually. Universal vaccination of newborns since 1991 has successfully reduced infection rates among young people by 99%.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs have asked a federal judge to either vacate his recent prostitution convictions or grant him a new trial. The defense argues that his conviction under the 1910 Mann Act, a law designed to combat human trafficking, was an unprecedented misuse of the statute and that he had no commercial motive. Combs, who was convicted in July on two counts of arranging interstate travel for prostitution but acquitted of more severe charges, is scheduled for sentencing on October 3.

The cost-cutting measures are aimed at revitalizing the company's slowing business under the leadership of CEO Brian Niccol. The company stated the closures will target locations that are not financially viable or do not fit its desired store environment. This restructuring is expected to cost $1 billion, which includes employee separation benefits and costs associated with exiting leases, as Starbucks aims to build a more resilient and profitable operation.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates remaining stubbornly high despite recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, many Americans are considering debt relief options. Financial experts note that unlike mortgages, credit card APRs are less likely to decrease, making it difficult for borrowers to make progress on their balances. This article explores various strategies, such as debt consolidation loans, balance transfers, and formal debt management plans through counseling agencies. For those facing severe financial strain, more drastic measures like debt settlement or bankruptcy may be necessary to regain financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

This division is evident in the differing reactions to an FCC official's comments about late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. While some Republicans embrace a "tit-for-tat" approach, others warn it sets a dangerous precedent. The article suggests that if Republicans are serious about protecting speech, they could pass legislation to eliminate certain FCC content rules, prevent government "jawboning," and strengthen legal protections against frivolous lawsuits.</p>

          <p>Researchers claim that a million-year-old human skull discovered in China, named Yunxian 2, could push back the emergence of our species, Homo sapiens, by at least half a million years. The new analysis suggests the skull belongs not to Homo erectus, as previously thought, but to an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. If correct, this implies that early versions of all three large-brained human species co-existed much earlier than the current scientific consensus holds. However, other experts urge caution, stating the conclusions are plausible but require more evidence.</p>

Burnham has been critical of the current Labour government's direction and claims he has been contacted by MPs urging him to stand. However, a BBC survey of Labour MPs revealed that most are against such a move, with some calling it self-indulgent and urging him to focus on his mayoral duties.
