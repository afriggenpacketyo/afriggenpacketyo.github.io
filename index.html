        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service regarding an Instagram post featuring seashells arranged to spell '86 47,' which some interpreted as a threat against President Trump. The post, which Comey later deleted, sparked outrage among Trump administration officials who called for an investigation and even imprisonment for Comey. Comey maintained that he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post to avoid any misunderstanding. The Secret Service interview took place in Washington, with Comey voluntarily consenting to the questioning, underscoring the ongoing contentious relationship between Trump and the former FBI director, especially given Trump's comments on Fox News about the post.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is reviewing a case concerning the Trump administration's attempt to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation under the Alien Enemies Act, signaling skepticism about due process protections. Meanwhile, a New Jersey Transit strike disrupted commutes, and House Republicans blocked their party's major domestic policy bill due to conservative demands for deeper budget cuts. This legislative gridlock underscores the challenges Speaker Mike Johnson faces in balancing conservative and moderate factions within his narrow majority. The Department of Homeland Security is also reportedly considering a reality TV show where immigrants compete for American citizenship, adding another layer to the complex immigration landscape.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, significantly reducing visibility and disrupting travel, leading to ground stops at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued only its second-ever dust storm warning for the Chicago office, with this being the first time the warning included the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, which forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony. While skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas, the event highlighted the unusual weather patterns affecting the region.</p>

In St. Louis, at least five people died, and authorities searched for those trapped or hurt after buildings were damaged and power outages affected thousands of homes. Weather forecasters warned that severe storms with hail and even hurricane-force winds also could hobble parts of Appalachia and the Midwest.</p>

          <p>Cassandra Ventura, Sean 'Diddy' Combs's ex-girlfriend, testified for four days in his federal sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution trial, detailing years of abuse and coerced sexual encounters. Ventura described 'freak-offs,' where she was allegedly forced to engage in sex acts with male escorts while Combs watched and recorded, leading to feelings of worthlessness and trauma. Prosecutors aim to demonstrate that Combs ran a criminal enterprise using his network of associates to cover up his alleged crimes, while Combs's legal team concedes abuse but denies sex trafficking. The government is trying to build up their racketeering argument - the allegation that Mr Combs used his loyal network of associates to run a criminal enterprise and cover up his alleged crimes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of the Middle East was marked by honor and respect, with standing ovations, investment pledges, and awards, contrasting with the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and ethical questions. He announced over $2 trillion in economic investments between the United States and Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, all major purchasers of American military equipment. The trip included campaign-style rallies at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, where he falsely claimed to have won the 2020 election. Gulf leaders praised Trump's shift away from judgment and confrontation towards peace and profit, while Democrats and Republicans approved of his decision to lift sanctions on Syria.</p>

          <p>Ammunition companies in Gorazde, Bosnia, face potential ruin due to President Trump's tariffs on goods exported to the United States, their largest market. Ginex, a local company making ignition devices, has stalled expansion plans, and Shooters World, an American company, canceled shipments from Ginex due to tariff concerns. Gorazde's mayor fears the United States has abandoned free trade as a path to peace, while Bosnia's trade minister, a Serb nationalist, shows no interest in saving the Muslim-town-based gun companies from the tariffs.

          <p>The case of a Wisconsin judge charged with helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities mirrors a similar case in Massachusetts, raising questions about federal overreach. In the Massachusetts case, Judge Shelley Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape ICE. While the charges against Joseph were later dropped, the case sparked debate over the balance between state judges' autonomy and federal immigration enforcement. Jessica Vaughan with the Center for Immigration Studies sees the Joseph and Dugan cases as two really shocking expressions of obstruction of legitimate immigration enforcement.</p>

Over time, the children gradually began to heal, engaging in team sports and forming bonds with the staff, eventually reintegrating into society.

          <p>Audio recordings from President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur have been released, revealing instances where Biden struggled to recall key dates and details, including the year his son Beau died. The audio, obtained by Axios, provides context to Hur's report describing Biden as an 'elderly man with a poor memory.' Republicans are seizing on the audio as evidence of Biden's declining cognitive abilities, while Democrats are downplaying the significance, noting that transcripts of the interview were previously released. The emergence of the recording comes amid renewed scrutiny of Biden's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts in a Republican bill to fund President Trump's agenda are causing concern among Americans who rely on the program for health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cuts could increase the number of uninsured by at least 8.6 million by 2034. Individuals like Rosa Andresen, who cares for her disabled daughter, fear the cuts will reduce their access to health care, while others worry about work requirements jeopardizing their recovery from substance use disorder. A growing number of House GOP members are expressing grievances, some because they don't believe the bill does enough to protect vulnerable Americans and others because it does not include some of the most drastic cuts that Republican hardliners were pushing for.</p>

She testified that she was coerced into the sessions, which involved male escorts, because Mr Combs had threatened her with violence.
