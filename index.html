          <h2>Sullivan Sees 'Sliver of Hope' in Trump-Zelenskyy Meeting Regarding Ukraine</h2>

          <p>Former Biden National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan expressed cautious optimism after the meeting between President Trump and President Zelenskyy, noting it as the 'first sliver of hope' regarding the administration's approach to the Ukraine war. Sullivan highlighted Trump's past actions, such as giving Putin recognition of Crimea, as concerning, but acknowledged Zelenskyy's positive comments about the recent meeting. He hopes Trump is recognizing Putin's manipulation and will not pressure Ukraine into unfavorable concessions. Sullivan also criticized the Trump administration's first 100 days, citing damage to America's credibility and the rise of China. Optimism score should be relatively low given the context of the ongoing war and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A senior ANC party leader in South Africa defended the country's sovereignty amidst growing tensions with the U.S. over race relations and land laws. The tension stems from Trump's executive order addressing the expropriation law and offering Afrikaners refugee status, which President Ramaphosa says ensures 'public access to land in an equitable and just manner'. The ANC leader criticized South African citizens calling for Trump to 'punish' the country. Tensions have also played out on Elon Musk's X page, where he described his country's ownership laws as "racist". The situation highlights ongoing debates about land ownership and racial equality in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed President Trump's trade negotiation tactics, referring to them as 'strategic uncertainty.' While defending the approach, Bessent stated he was unsure if Trump had spoken directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Bessent also addressed investor confidence in the U.S. economy, dismissing recent market fluctuations as potentially just 'market noise' and asserting the fundamentals for a strong economy remain in place.</p>

          <p>Republicans in North Carolina have been engaged in a lengthy legal battle to overturn a state Supreme Court election result, focusing on a small fraction of ballots.

          <p>President Trump's meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has provided a small boost to Ukrainian morale. Trump's questioning of Putin's continued attacks while the U.S. attempts to broker peace has been interpreted as a sign he may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace agreement. This shift in tone follows a deadly Russian missile attack on Kyiv, prompting Trump to publicly urge Putin to stop. The article suggests that this meeting could represent a turning point in U.S.-Ukraine relations and the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump has taken swift action to dismantle Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs across the federal government, issuing executive orders to eliminate DEI offices and rescind Biden-era policies. These actions include ending race and sex-based preferences in hiring and rescinding policies prioritizing DEI hiring at the FAA. The administration argues these initiatives are discriminatory and undermine merit-based hiring practices. This shift has also influenced the private sector, with several major companies scaling back or canceling their DEI programs.</p>

The incident raises concerns about the port's functionality, which handles nearly 80% of Iran's imports, and potential food shortages. The government has declared a national day of mourning, but public discontent is growing amidst the blame game.</p>

However, Bessent cautioned that a comprehensive trade deal could take months, as US retailers warn of potential price hikes and empty shelves due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Common Wealth thinktank, titled Star Wars, warns of a powerful coalition of private corporations, billionaires, and 'neoliberal' thinktanks working to extend earthly ownership structures to space. The report argues that this trend, fueled by loopholes in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, could lead to the privatization and exploitation of space resources. It calls for democratic and ethical stewardship of space, rather than corporate extraction. The report raises concerns about the potential militarization of space and the lack of a clear global authority over space resource governance.</p>
