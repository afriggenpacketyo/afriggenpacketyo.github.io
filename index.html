        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed a symbolic executive order, the 'Protecting Chicago Initiative,' to safeguard residents' rights amidst concerns of federal agents being deployed for immigration enforcement. The order aims to prevent Chicago police collaboration with federal actions, bar agents from concealing their identities, and require clear identification. Johnson accused the Trump administration of overstepping constitutional bounds, while the White House criticized the mayor for focusing on 'publicity stunts' instead of addressing crime. The order underscores the city's intent to pursue legal avenues if federal actions violate residents' rights.</p>

          <p>Iowa's head coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a significant milestone, tying Ohio State's Woody Hayes as the Big Ten’s all-time winningest coach with his 205th victory at the program. The Hawkeyes defeated Albany 34-7, with Xavier Williams rushing for 122 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his debut, contributed a passing and a rushing touchdown despite a slow start. Ferentz, now in his 27th season, humbly downplayed the personal achievement, emphasizing the team's win.</p>

          <p>This article details the chilling 2012 murder-for-hire plot involving millionaire Dino Guglielmelli, who attempted to have his model wife, Monica Olsen, killed. Driven by a bitter divorce and the prospect of losing assets, Guglielmelli solicited Rick Fuhrmann, a business associate, to carry out the crime. Fuhrmann, however, exposed the plot to authorities and cooperated in a sting operation, recording Guglielmelli discussing the murder and an $80,000 payment. Monica Olsen was saved, and Dino Guglielmelli eventually pleaded guilty to attempted murder in the second degree, serving over six years in prison.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents an opinion piece by Michael Daly, a '48 Hours' consultant, questioning the sole blame placed on Alix Tichelman for Google executive Forrest Hayes' heroin overdose death. Daly argues that while Tichelman was legally responsible for prostitution and not seeking help, Hayes also contributed to the situation by patronizing a prostitute and requesting the injection.

          <p>President Donald Trump declared on Truth Social his intention to issue an executive order mandating voter identification for every vote, with "NO EXCEPTIONS!" He also advocated for eliminating mail-in voting, except for the severely ill and military personnel abroad. Trump has consistently made unsubstantiated claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election and non-citizen voting. This move follows previous pledges to end voting machines and mail-in ballots, though the constitutional authority for such federal intervention in state-administered elections remains unclear.</p>

The Forestry Research team has successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England, but climate change poses an increasing threat as warmer, wetter winters and drier summers stress trees, making them more susceptible.

Expressing outrage, he vowed the contractor would "never" work at the White House again and stated he would replace the stone at the contractor's expense. The incident underscores Trump's personal involvement in the garden's aesthetics and his zero-tolerance for perceived flaws.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Exploitation in Unregulated US Body Parts Trade</h2>

          <p>This article exposes the legal but largely unregulated trade of human body parts in the US, where private 'body brokers' acquire, dissect, and sell limbs for profit, often to medical research. The story of Harold Dillard, whose family intended his body for medical science but later found his head elsewhere, highlights the industry's potential for exploitation and disrespect. Unlike the UK, US laws allow charging 'reasonable amounts' for processing body parts, leading to a flourishing, largely unmonitored market. Critics call for stricter regulation, while advocates emphasize the crucial role of body donation in medical advancements and education.</p>

          <h2>First Week of School Attendance Critical for Preventing Persistent Absence in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 19:09:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government figures in England suggest that pupils who missed school during the first week back in September 2024 were significantly more likely to become 'persistently absent' throughout the year. Over half of partially absent students in week one later missed at least 10% of school, compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term to improve children's life chances. While attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains a greater challenge than pre-Covid levels, prompting calls for more support beyond school gates.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst plans to announce she will not seek reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official. Ernst, who was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran, won her second term in 2020. Her decision opens up a competitive Senate race, with Representative Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) already eyeing the seat. Ernst has held leadership positions and advocated for federal budget cuts, but also faced scrutiny over her vote for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth despite her record as a military sexual assault prevention advocate.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling it an "invasion" and accusing President Trump of having ulterior motives beyond crime reduction. Pritzker stated there has been no communication from the federal government regarding such a deployment, which would echo similar actions in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. He suggested Trump's actions might be aimed at influencing future elections and called it an "attack on the American people." The White House, however, criticized Pritzker for deflecting from Chicago's crime crisis.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesia's Prabowo Subianto is poised to present a new, pragmatic roadmap for global diplomacy, emphasizing cooperation over confrontation. In a world grappling with a dysfunctional international system, Indonesia's extensive relationships and position as an economic powerhouse, unaligned with any single ideological camp, offer a unique perspective. The article argues that Prabowo's philosophy of 'constructive pragmatism' could serve as a corrective model for a global community increasingly paralyzed by competing national agendas and vetoes within institutions like the United Nations. The world, it contends, needs a practical call to action.</p>

          <p>Costco is set to enforce a new policy on September 1, granting Executive Membership holders an exclusive shopping hour before general admission. This perk, which previously had a grace period, will now restrict entry to non-Executive members before 10 a.m. on weekdays and 9:30 a.m. on Saturdays. The company defends the controversial move as a reward for its most loyal members, who pay a higher annual fee. This change follows other recent shifts, including the transition from Pepsi to exclusively Coca-Cola products in Costco food courts, which has also divided shoppers.</p>

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China's President Xi Jinping are seeking to mend their strained relationship at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, driven partly by the impact of US tariffs. With both nations facing economic pressures from Washington, a potential reset in ties is on the horizon, despite long-standing border disputes and mistrust. Experts suggest a stronger China-India relationship could reshape global trade flows and reduce dependence on the United States. While significant changes may take time, Modi's visit aims to repair animosity and signal India's strategic options beyond Western alliances.</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's ambitious adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a decades-long dream for the acclaimed director. Funded by Netflix, the film stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature, with del Toro emphasizing a focus on the creature's 'newborn' beauty rather than a mere accident victim. The movie is divided into three parts, offering perspectives from both Frankenstein and his creation, exploring themes of humanity and imperfection. Early reviews are mixed but largely positive, praising its epic scale, artistry, and emotional depth, while some note its length.</p>

          <p>The US Open has been marked by numerous player outbursts and confrontations, leading to questions about the underlying causes of such heightened emotions. This article analyzes that the late stage of a grueling season, coupled with the intense atmosphere of New York City and its passionate crowds, contributes significantly to player stress and tension. While some players like Naomi Osaka suggest New York itself can be a factor, others, like Coco Gauff, note that many of the involved players have a history of volatility. The tournament's status as the last Grand Slam of the year also intensifies the pressure to perform.</p>

          <p>Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology on Instagram for telling opponent Taylor Townsend she had "no education" during their US Open second-round match. The incident stemmed from Ostapenko's belief that Townsend failed to apologize for a net cord, escalating into a heated exchange at the net. While Townsend, who is Black, did not perceive racial overtones, former world number one Naomi Osaka stated such a comment is deeply offensive to Black tennis players. Ostapenko clarified that English is not her native language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, expressing regret for offending people beyond the court.</p>
