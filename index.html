          <p>Two Israeli embassy staff members, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were fatally shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, was taken into custody and reportedly shouted "free, free Palestine" following the shooting, leading officials to investigate the incident as a potential act of targeted violence fueled by antisemitism. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar condemned the attack as a result of incitement since the October 7th massacre, while President Trump expressed condolences and denounced antisemitism. The victims were attending an event hosted by the American Jewish Committee, and the incident occurred near the FBI field office in D.C., prompting a multi-agency investigation. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plan to install a missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," to protect the U.S. from aerial and space threats is facing scrutiny. The system, estimated to cost $175 billion, is modeled after Israel's Iron Dome but aims to defend against intercontinental missiles. Critics cite concerns about the exorbitant costs and unrealistic timeframe, while China has accused Trump of undermining global stability. The project builds on Reagan-era plans for a space-based missile defense shield. </p>

          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing figures have raised concerns about potential tax increases in the autumn. Borrowing reached £20.2bn in April, exceeding the previous year's figures and putting Chancellor Rachel Reeves' spending and borrowing rules at risk. Experts suggest that weaker economic growth and increased spending pressures could necessitate tax hikes. The situation follows Reeves' previous introduction of £40bn in tax increases in October 2024. </p>

          <p>A last-minute injunction by a High Court judge has temporarily halted the government from finalizing talks on the Chagos Islands deal. Two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, filed a case against the Foreign Office, preventing the UK from handing the islands to Mauritius. The proposed agreement would allow the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, while Chagossians would still be prevented from returning. The legal action underscores the ongoing dispute over the islands' sovereignty and the rights of the Chagossian people. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is exploring the possibility of reusing soil removed from areas surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant at the prime minister's office and other government facilities in Tokyo. This initiative aims to establish a precedent for soil recycling outside of Fukushima Prefecture, as previous plans in Tokyo and nearby areas faced local opposition. The soil, deemed safe by the Environment Ministry, would be used for flowerbeds and other landscaping purposes. This effort is part of Japan's broader strategy to reduce the total amount of contaminated soil requiring disposal following the 2011 nuclear disaster. </p>

          <p>Paul Elie's new book, “The Last Supper,” captures a pivotal moment in 20th-century social history, examining the clash of religion, art, and sexuality in the 1980s. Elie's work is a group portrait of artists and their fellow travelers who participated during a bloody crossroads in American life, when Ronald Reagan’s ascension to the White House in 1980 collapsed the walls between church and state, sparking a counterrevolution across the arts. The book explores how artists like Andy Warhol, Sinéad O’Connor, Bob Dylan, and Martin Scorsese grappled with crypto-religion, creating thought-provoking art that questioned belief. Elie's brilliant book is a bracing reminder of art’s far-reaching power in matters of the heart and soul. </p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election will determine who will navigate the country through President Trump's tariffs. U.S. and South Korean trade officials are negotiating a deal by July 8, when Trump's "liberation day" tariffs expire. The candidates have different views on balancing relations with the U.S. against those with regional neighbors such as Russia or China. Lee Jae-myung has criticized overly submissive attitudes, while Kim Moon-soo has said he would immediately set up a U.S.-South Korea summit to ink a deal before July 8. </p>

Adams Kellum denied the allegations and defended her management decisions. The allegations surface amid broader scrutiny of LAHSA's financial oversight and Adams Kellum's upcoming resignation. </p>

          <p>A Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating is a symptom of habitual deficit financing, not the problem itself. The national debt is increasing, and interest payments are rising. The tax plan makes temporary the pro-growth provisions of the 2017 tax cuts, while rendering permanent policies catering to favored industries and constituencies. The administration claims growth will be enormous once it deregulates and sells off assets, but these distinct policies take a long time to bear fruit. </p>

The films are not intended as commercials for AI but rather as explorations of its potential benefits and dilemmas. This effort comes as public perception of AI remains mixed, and tech companies seek to highlight its positive applications. </p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring a novel method to track the world's biodiversity by extracting DNA from the air. Researchers are using air-sampling stations to capture environmental DNA (eDNA), which contains genetic material from various organisms. This approach allows them to monitor the presence and distribution of species across large areas, providing valuable data for conservation efforts. The technique has the potential to revolutionize biodiversity monitoring by offering a standardized, scalable, and cost-effective system. </p>
