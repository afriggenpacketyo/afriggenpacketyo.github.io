            <p>Cambridge's women's rowing team triumphed over Oxford in the annual Boat Race following an unusual restart. The race was initially halted in the second minute due to Oxford drifting into Cambridge's lane, causing a clash of oars. While Oxford avoided disqualification, they were penalized, giving Cambridge a significant head start. Cambridge capitalized on this advantage, ultimately securing their eighth consecutive win and bringing their total victories to 49 in the event's 79th year.</p>

            <p>Albert Saniger, former CEO of fintech startup nate, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding investors by falsely claiming the company's e-commerce app was powered by AI.

The company raised over $40 million based on the promise of AI-driven automation. The indictment claims that investors suffered near-total losses following the company's collapse in 2023.</p>

            <p>A dispute has arisen between a property developer and a local businessman regarding the ownership of a small, two-brick-high wall bordering a new housing estate. Lioncourt Homes seeks to demolish the wall to create an emergency access route, claiming it is necessary for planning permission. However, Roger White asserts that the wall sits on land he inherited and that the developers did not attempt to purchase the land before construction. White feels he is being bullied by the developers, who have sent him a cease-and-desist letter.</p>

The trend reflects a broader cultural embrace of female friendship as a commercial enterprise and the increasing parasocial role of podcasts in listeners' lives.

            <p>President Trump's tariff policies are expected to disproportionately affect low-income Americans by raising prices on everyday goods. Tariffs act as a consumption tax, placing a greater burden on those with limited disposable income. The tariffs also increase the risk of a recession, which would further harm low-income families through job losses and reduced economic opportunities. While some argue that tariffs benefit small businesses, the overall impact on the poor is negative. </p>

            <p>Richard Partington argues that while Trump's tariff policies are misguided, they stem from real issues of economic disappointment and inequality caused by globalization. The article suggests that addressing these issues requires international collaboration and a shift away from the Washington Consensus. While stopping Trump's bullying is crucial, it shouldn't involve restoring the pre-tariff world exactly as it was. The focus should be on tackling the shortcomings of globalization and creating a more equitable economic system.</p>

Concerns are rising regarding the supply of raw materials needed to keep the furnaces running. The government took control after the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, intended to close the furnaces despite financial support offers. The government is now seeking a buyer for British Steel, but the takeover is expected to cost taxpayers significantly. </p>
