          <p>Lost items in Japan are finding their way back to their owners faster thanks to the integration of artificial intelligence in lost-and-found services. A "lost-and-found platform" developed by Find Inc. is now used by approximately 30 organizations, including transportation services and police departments, at around 2,300 locations. The system uses AI to categorize and catalog lost items based on photos taken by staff, enabling owners to inquire through messaging apps by providing descriptions or similar-looking images. This has significantly improved the efficiency and return rate of lost possessions, with one railway operator seeing an increase from less than 10% to 30% after adopting the system.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military reported that North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern waters. The missiles, launched from near Monsanto, flew approximately 800 kilometers before landing in the sea. South Korea, the United States, and Japan are coordinating to analyze the launches, which are a violation of UN Security Council resolutions banning North Korea's ballistic missile program. There is speculation that the launches were a test of missiles intended for export, possibly to Russia for use in the conflict against Ukraine, as some experts have long warned about North Korea testing weapons for export.</p>

          <p>Tarek Bazrouk, a 20-year-old New York man, has been charged with federal hate crimes for allegedly assaulting Jewish protesters at three separate demonstrations in Manhattan.

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce his first trade agreement since implementing tariffs that previously unsettled markets. The announcement, teased on social media, will involve a "BIG, AND HIGHLY RESPECTED, COUNTRY," with representatives present at the Oval Office. Since April 2, Trump's administration has engaged in trade talks with several countries following the imposition of a 10% tariff on all imported goods and "reciprocal tariffs." While the tariffs were paused for 90 days, except for China, economists have cautioned about potential shortages and increased consumer prices.</p>

The Rafale is a twin-engine fighter jet manufactured by Dassault Aviation, while the MIG-29 is a Soviet-designed fighter, and the Su-30 is a Russian-developed fighter jet.

          <p>A family-run catalytic converter theft ring in Sacramento, operated by Tou Sue Vang, his brother Andrew, and their mother, Monica Moua, made over $38 million by buying stolen converters and selling them to a New Jersey buyer. Tou Sue Vang was sentenced to 12 years in prison, while his brother and mother await sentencing. Catalytic converter theft has become prevalent due to the ease of stealing the parts and the high value of the precious metals they contain. Vang used the illicit proceeds to purchase a $1.235-million home and multiple vehicles, all of which he has forfeited.</p>

          <p>Three college presidents apologized for not acting more aggressively to curb antisemitism on their campuses during a House committee hearing, amid Republican threats to withhold federal funding. The hearing, focused on schools beyond the Ivy League, echoed previous sessions that led to resignations from the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard. Republican lawmakers accused universities of tolerating antisemitism, while Democratic lawmakers accused Republicans of using it as a political weapon. The hearing looked back to events from a year ago, when campuses were dealing with protest encampments and mass arrests.</p>

          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, suspected of igniting the Eaton fire, was dismantled and removed for testing. The tower, known as M16T1 or Tower 208, has been idle for over 50 years but somehow became reenergized on the day the fire started. Testing will be conducted to determine if the reenergization of the line, through a rare phenomenon known as induction, sparked the fire. The tower will be examined by fire investigators, Southern California Edison officials, and experts hired by plaintiffs suing the utility company.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the Trump administration's policies are undermining the Western world order and accelerating a decline, echoing mistakes made by past leaders that led to the fall of empires. The author points to Trump's tariffs, attacks on NATO allies, embrace of nationalism, and undermining of democratic norms as factors contributing to a loss of faith in the Western project. The article draws parallels to historical examples, such as Diocletian's reforms in the Roman Empire, to illustrate how short-sightedness and divisiveness can lead to irreversible decline.</p>

Rollins acknowledged that mistakes may have been made but insisted that key positions were not accepted in the second round of the program, though this claim is disputed by some employees.</p>
