          <p>A group of British parents, who believe social media played a role in their children's deaths, traveled to New York City to protest alongside American and Canadian families, demanding better online safety protections for children. Their visit coincides with Ofcom's announcement of legally requiring websites to block children's access to harmful content in the UK from July. The parents shared their stories of loss and advocated for legislation granting access to children's social media accounts after their death, seeking to understand the circumstances surrounding their children's tragedies and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.</p>

          <p>U.S. spirit exports hit a record $2.4 billion in 2024, largely due to tariff concerns and ongoing global trade disputes, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Exports to the EU surged by 39% as companies rushed to export before a potential 50% tariff on American whiskey imports could be reinstated in 2025. While the threat of tariffs has somewhat subsided due to ongoing trade negotiations, the uncertainty caused by trade disputes continues to impact sales growth for many U.S. distillers.</p>
