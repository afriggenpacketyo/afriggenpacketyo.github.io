          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced sanctions against five US-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipping giant Hanwha Ocean. Beijing accused the firm of collaborating with Washington on maritime sector curbs against China. Concurrently, China launched an investigation into the impact of the US Section 301 probe on its shipping and shipbuilding industries, vowing countermeasures based on findings. This move escalates trade tensions, reflecting China's assertive response to perceived US pressure.</p>

Governor Mike Kehoe denied clemency, citing zero tolerance for violence against law enforcement. Shockley's attorneys argue that crucial DNA evidence remains untested and could exonerate him, while also claiming his First Amendment rights were violated regarding a spiritual adviser. Prosecutors presented a circumstantial case, but authorities assert new DNA testing wouldn't undermine the conviction.</p>

Blue Jays manager John Schneider remains optimistic despite the deficit, emphasizing the need for damage control and increased offense.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, highlighting the impact of their substantial payroll. Despite stranding 11 runners and a confusing double-play that cost a run, the Dodgers prevailed due to key contributions from high-value players. Freddie Freeman hit a $162-million solo home run, and Blake Snell, a $182-million pitcher, delivered eight scoreless innings. The article suggests that while small-market teams may rely on collective effort, the Dodgers' individual star power ultimately made the difference.</p>

          <p>Blake Snell delivered a masterful performance, pitching eight scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in NLCS Game 1. His excellence was crucial after a chaotic fourth inning saw the Dodgers fail to score with bases loaded due to a rare double-play at the center-field wall. Freddie Freeman's sixth-inning home run provided the go-ahead run. Snell's dominant outing ultimately ensured the Dodgers overcame early adversity and took a 1-0 series lead.</p>

          <p>Amazon has fired Ahmed Shahrour, a Palestinian software engineer, after he was suspended for protesting the company's $1.2 billion "Project Nimbus" contract with the Israeli government and military. Amazon cited violations of company conduct policies, including misusing resources for non-work-related messages about the Israel-Palestine conflict. Shahrour called his termination "a blatant act of retaliation designed to silence dissent from Palestinian voices." This incident reflects broader tensions in the tech industry regarding corporate ties to the Israeli military, with similar actions reported at Microsoft and Google.</p>
