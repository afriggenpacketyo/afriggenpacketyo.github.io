          <p>Authorities in southwestern Montana are searching for a man suspected of killing four people in a shooting at The Owl Bar in Anaconda. The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown, fled the scene and is considered armed and dangerous. While his vehicle was located, the suspect remains at large, prompting law enforcement to concentrate their search along a highway west of the city. Residents in the area have been urged to remain indoors and on high alert as the search continues.</p>

          <p>Amid a scorching summer and widespread wildfires across Greece and other European destinations, travel experts are offering advice to concerned holidaymakers. While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel safe, those wishing to cancel may face challenges with insurance claims unless they have specific natural catastrophe coverage. Experts recommend that travelers with standard insurance should be covered for cancellations or curtailments if official advice changes to "do not travel." For those without insurance, contacting airlines and hotels directly is the best course of action, as bespoke solutions may be available.</p>

          <p>A new trend of extreme bedtime beauty rituals, popularized on social media, is facing scrutiny from medical experts and critics. Kim Kardashian's Skims brand has capitalized on this with a "face shapewear" mask, which sold out quickly despite doubts about its effectiveness. Aesthetic doctors state that while such products might offer temporary de-puffing, they provide no lasting contouring benefits and could potentially cause skin irritation. Critics also argue that these trends promote harmful beauty ideals and prey on insecurities, especially among younger consumers.</p>

          <p>In response to widespread dating fatigue, new apps are emerging that aim to change the online dating experience by reducing or eliminating the pre-date messaging phase. One such app, Breeze, arranges in-person dates for matched users with minimal prior conversation, a model designed to move connections offline more quickly. This shift comes as major platforms like Tinder and Hinge also introduce new features to keep users engaged amid declining usage numbers. The trend reflects a growing desire among some daters for more direct, human interactions and less time spent on algorithm-driven small talk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's General Administration of Customs has tightened import rules for durians from Vietnam after detecting harmful levels of cadmium and alkaline yellow. The new measures require enhanced pre-export safety checks and "batch by batch" testing upon arrival, with any non-compliant shipments being returned or destroyed. This move has led to a significant drop in trade, with fresh durian shipments from Vietnam to China falling by approximately 45% in value during the first half of 2025. Exporters whose products fail the tests will face suspension from the Chinese market.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Recent EU-US Trade Deal Is a Capitulation That Should Be Rejected</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the recent trade deal negotiated between the EU and the US under the Trump administration is a significant misstep for Europe. The authors contend the agreement is economically one-sided, damaging the EU's international credibility and setting a dangerous precedent by rewarding coercive tactics.

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed a 22-year-old woman and seriously injured her boyfriend, ordering the company to pay $243 million in damages. The plaintiffs' attorneys successfully argued that Tesla's Autopilot technology was a contributing factor because the system failed to prevent the collision when the driver became distracted. The court determined the Autopilot system should have disengaged or alerted the driver, who was looking for his phone at the time of the incident. Tesla has called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal, maintaining that the driver is solely responsible.</p>

Understanding this link is crucial for climate prediction, as the position of the monsoon rain belt heavily influences the distribution of droughts and floods across the country during the summer season.

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, was unable to secure an automatic qualifying spot for the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team after a difficult final round at the Junior PGA Championship. After shooting two consecutive rounds of 66 to enter the final day tied for second, he posted a 74, dropping him into a tie for ninth place. The top two finishers, Lunden Esterline and Giuseppe Puebla, earned the automatic bids for the prestigious junior event. Woods' performance was strong for most of the week but faded at the crucial moment.</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, calling on the board to seize control and cut interest rates. In a series of social media posts, Trump labeled Powell a "stubborn MORON" and blamed the central bank's policies for a lackluster jobs report. This breaks with the long-standing tradition of respecting the Fed's political independence to make objective economic decisions. The attacks come as the administration's aggressive tariff policies face scrutiny and create economic uncertainty, putting pressure on the central bank to adjust its monetary policy.

          <p>La Bodega, a small clinic in Buffalo, New York, is achieving remarkable success in combating Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. By providing faster, more accessible care in a stigma-free environment, the clinic has cured approximately 98% of its more than 7,000 patients, many of whom are treated in a single visit. This model stands in contrast to the slow national progress in treating the disease, despite the availability of curative drugs for over a decade. The clinic's success is now influencing policymakers to consider a national plan to eliminate Hepatitis C.</p>

          <p>ESPN is reportedly finalizing a deal to acquire several NFL media properties, including the popular RedZone channel and the NFL Network. In exchange for these assets, the NFL will receive an equity stake in ESPN that could potentially be worth billions of dollars. The agreement, which has been in negotiation for years, would also grant ESPN access to more regular-season games and the league's fantasy football operations. This strategic partnership would significantly deepen the relationship between the two sports giants and comes as ESPN prepares to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he has ordered nuclear-capable submarines to be repositioned in response to "highly provocative statements" from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev. Medvedev had suggested Russia would be ready for a nuclear strike and warned that Trump's ultimatums regarding the war in Ukraine were a "step towards war." Trump responded on social media that he hoped his move would prevent unintended consequences from such "foolish and inflammatory" words. The action represents a significant rhetorical escalation with Moscow, though some analysts note the U.S. already has submarines capable of striking Russia.</p>

          <p>The ubiquitous sound of FPV drones on the frontlines in Ukraine is causing a new and specific form of psychological trauma, which some psychiatrists are calling "droneophobia." Soldiers returning from combat report acute stress and panic triggered by everyday mechanical whirring sounds like lawnmowers or air conditioners, which remind them of being hunted. This constant auditory threat extends far behind the front lines, as Russia also uses these drones to terrorize civilians in nearby cities. The psychological impact is profound, changing how veterans and civilians perceive their surroundings and turning ordinary sounds into sources of fear.</p>

          <p>After a five-year diplomatic freeze following a deadly border clash, India and China are showing signs of normalizing relations. Recent moves include India resuming the issuance of visas to Chinese citizens and China allowing Indian pilgrims to return to Tibet, with direct flights also expected to resume soon. While global trade wars and shifting alliances may be pushing the two Asian giants closer, significant obstacles remain. The primary issue is their unresolved and heavily disputed Himalayan border, a deep-seated source of mistrust that experts say must be addressed for any meaningful progress.</p>

Decades of Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank, which is illegal under international law, have created facts that actively prevent a two-state solution. While Palestinian diplomats view the recognition as a serious commitment, some residents living under occupation feel it is "too late," as Israel continues to expand settlements and does not comply with international resolutions.</p>

In a lengthy post, he expressed frustration with the team's negotiation tactics, claiming they have not engaged with his agent and have spread negative narratives about him to the media.

The scheme, which generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually, boomed during the pandemic with the rise of remote work.

          <p>A group of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging it is waging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues that the administration is creating a de facto national ban through intimidation, including issuing subpoenas and threatening criminal prosecution, despite no federal law prohibiting the care. This legal action follows the closure of several prominent gender-affirming care clinics in response to federal pressure, forcing families to travel farther for what major medical associations consider lifesaving treatment.</p>
