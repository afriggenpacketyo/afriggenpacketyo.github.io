            <p>Oscar Piastri clinched the win at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after Max Verstappen received a penalty for cutting the chicane on the first corner. Piastri managed his lead effectively after the penalty was served, with Verstappen maintaining second place. Charles Leclerc secured a podium finish after a strong first stint, overtaking George Russell. Lando Norris also drove a strong race, finishing fourth after McLaren's strategic tire choice allowed him to lead for a few laps. The race began with a safety car incident due to a collision between Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly, but no further interruptions occurred. </p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry attributed the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza to an "operational misunderstanding" and breaches of orders. The IDF initially claimed the convoy approached suspiciously without lights, but video evidence showed otherwise. The deputy commander involved was dismissed for providing an inaccurate report. The report claimed six of the casualties were Hamas members, but provided no evidence. The incident occurred in a hostile combat zone with poor visibility, leading the commander to perceive an immediate threat.</p>
