          <p>AI scientist De Kai advocates for a shift in perspective regarding artificial intelligence, framing it as an "AI climate change challenge" rather than a US-China competition. In his new book, De Kai argues that AI systems should be "parented" like children, emphasizing the importance of conscientious human behavior around these learning systems. He suggests that since AI learns by absorbing online content, humans need to be mindful of the examples they set. De Kai's approach underscores the ethical responsibility of shaping AI development through positive influence and guidance.</p>

The retrieval was based on information from the hostage task force and military intelligence, with Israel attributing the abduction and death to the Mujahideen Brigades. The recovery comes amidst ongoing military operations in Gaza, where hospital officials reported numerous deaths from recent strikes, as the conflict continues to impact both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Italy is holding a referendum on whether to halve the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, a move that has polarized the country. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni opposes the referendum, calling the current citizenship law "excellent" and "very open." The referendum aims to speed up the process for legal immigrants already employed in Italy, potentially affecting up to 1.4 million people, including their children. Supporters argue that the reform would change the perception of long-term foreign residents, while opponents express concerns about national identity and the integration of migrants.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to launch a registration system to encourage people to maintain connections with rural areas facing depopulation, with a goal of attracting over 10 million users in the next decade. This initiative, spearheaded by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seeks to reverse the trend of over-concentration in major cities like Tokyo. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, with the government also promoting multi-residency to facilitate the movement of city dwellers to rural areas. Despite these efforts, migration to the Tokyo metropolitan area has accelerated, raising questions about the plan's potential impact.</p>

The Women's History Museum of Zambia is working to revive this cultural heritage, which was nearly erased by colonialism.

EU transport ministers proposed that passengers should be guaranteed one free personal item measuring up to 40x30x15cm. The European Consumer Organisation believes the proposals do not go far enough, and legitimise "charging for reasonably sized hand luggage". Consumer experts suggest that a universal approach to hand luggage dimensions would simplify the process for passengers and reduce disputes at airports.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to combat superbug infections. These pills aim to replace drug-resistant bacteria in the gut with a mix of healthy gut bacteria, offering a new approach to tackling antibiotic-resistant infections. Early data suggests that the pills can flush out superbugs from the bowel and improve the diversity of gut bacteria. The trial has shown promising signals that poo pills could help tackle the rising scourge of superbugs, potentially reducing them to a level that doesn't cause problems.</p>

          <p>Families of Ukrainian civilians held captive in Russian prisons are increasingly worried that they will be forgotten in peace negotiations. With nearly 16,000 Ukrainian civilians estimated to be in Russian captivity, there is no recognized mechanism for their return, unlike prisoners of war. Ukrainian officials acknowledge the lack of legal basis or effective approaches to bring civilian detainees home. The situation leaves families fearing that their loved ones will be lost in the pursuit of a ceasefire.</p>
