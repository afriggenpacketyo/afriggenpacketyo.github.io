          <p>Ofcom has finalized new regulations designed to protect children online, requiring platforms to implement age checks, filter harmful content, and establish streamlined reporting systems by July 25th. Dame Melanie Dawes, Ofcom boss, views this as a 'gamechanger,' emphasizing that companies must prioritize children's safety to serve the British public, while critics express concerns about the restrictions' ambition. These regulations, subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act, mandate platforms to designate a 'named person accountable for children's safety' and conduct annual risk assessments, with potential fines or site bans for non-compliance.</p>

          <p>A massive Russian strike on Kyiv has resulted in at least eight deaths and over 70 injuries, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to cut short his trip to South Africa and return home. The attack occurred amidst stalled peace negotiations, with President Trump criticizing Zelenskyy for resisting territorial concessions. Zelenskyy reaffirmed that recognizing occupied territory as Russian is a red line, while Ukrainian officials emphasized that Russia's actions demonstrate a lack of respect for peace efforts and necessitate strength and pressure to halt aggression.</p>

          <p>According to Joshua Meltzer, a trade policy expert at the Brookings Institution, unpredictable US trade policies may prompt countries to strengthen their ties with China as a hedge against instability. Meltzer suggests that many countries need to signal engagement with China to create options and avoid over-reliance on the US, particularly under the Trump administration. The ultimate impact will depend on whether the Trump administration stabilizes its trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>DigiKey, a major tech company in Thief River Falls, Minnesota, faces challenges from tariffs impacting its global operations, with rising costs and changing regulations causing anxiety. The company, which ships electronic parts worldwide, relies on imports from China, making it vulnerable to tariff increases. DigiKey is adapting by utilizing a foreign trade zone and adjusting its website to show nontariffed options, but the uncertainty and complexity of the situation are straining resources and impacting customer relations.</p>

          <p>Indonesia plans to increase imports from the United States to narrow its trade surplus, according to Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. This decision follows recent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indonesian exports, prompting the country to explore importing more agricultural products, such as wheat, soybeans, and corn, as well as oil and gas, to improve trade balance. Indrawati noted that trade with the U.S. accounts for less than 2% of Indonesia's GDP, but the impact of tariffs could prompt diversification of exports from the U.S.</p>
