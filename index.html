          <p>Former UK Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg has described Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's relationship with US President Donald Trump as "cringey" and "embarrassing." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg argued that Starmer's "endless knee-bending" reflects a miscalculation that the UK can avoid choosing between the US and the EU. He urged the prime minister to more assertively "speak up" for British values and criticized the government for not challenging the Trump administration on issues like its stance on NATO.</p>

          <p>British MP Zarah Sultana has announced she is seeking to "reconcile and move forward" with former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn following a public dispute over their new left-wing political party. Sultana stated she would no longer pursue legal action after alleging she was sidelined in a "sexist boys' club" atmosphere within the party's leadership. The conflict emerged over the unauthorized launch of a membership system, highlighting deep divisions and organizational struggles within the fledgling political movement. Both parties reportedly wish for the party's inaugural conference to proceed as planned.</p>

          <p>Apple has introduced a significant architectural change with its new A19 Pro chip, integrating neural accelerators into each GPU core to enhance on-device AI processing. This move, featured in the new iPhone Air, gives Apple control over all core chips in its phones, including its first custom wireless chip (N1) and a new modem (C1X). Company executives state this vertical integration allows for greater efficiency, responsiveness, and privacy by keeping more AI workloads on the device rather than in the cloud. The new design aims to make the iPhone the premier platform for developers running AI applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to expedite investigations into his political rivals, including former FBI Director James Comey and Senator Adam Schiff. In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration that "nothing is being done," a move that critics argue undermines the traditional independence of the Justice Department. This call for action follows the recent departure of a federal prosecutor who reportedly found insufficient evidence to charge New York Attorney General Letitia James, another of Trump's targets.</p>

          <p>The Taliban has rejected President Trump's demand for the United States to retake control of Bagram Air Base, a facility U.S. forces vacated during the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump had claimed discussions were underway and threatened "BAD THINGS" if the base was not returned. A Taliban spokesman dismissed the assertions, urging the U.S. to adhere to the Doha Agreement, which prohibits threats against Afghanistan's territorial integrity. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions and the complex relationship between the U.S. and the current Afghan government.</p>

          <p>A security camera at a high school in Summersville, West Virginia, captured the startling moment the school principal, James Marsh, discovered a black bear inside a locked dumpster. As Marsh went to unlock the bin, the bear's snout emerged from under the lid, causing him to quickly retreat while the bear climbed out and ran off. The incident serves as a public safety reminder about securing food and trash to prevent attracting wildlife into urban areas, as shrinking habitats can lead to more frequent and potentially dangerous human-animal encounters.</p>

          <p>With a September 30 funding deadline approaching, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer is urging President Donald Trump to negotiate with Democrats to prevent a government shutdown. The call for a bipartisan deal comes after the Senate rejected separate funding proposals from both parties last week. Democrats are insisting that any funding bill must include an extension of enhanced tax credits for the Affordable Care Act, a key sticking point in the stalemate.

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to salvage a 1-1 draw against Manchester City in a crucial Premier League match. Manchester City had taken an early lead through Erling Haaland and adopted an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half to protect their advantage. City manager Pep Guardiola's tactical gamble almost succeeded, but Martinelli's late goal denied them the victory.

Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for trying to overturn the 2022 election results. Prominent artists and musicians, including Caetano Veloso, helped organize the protests to oppose what they see as an effort to shield politicians from justice.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the decision, insisting it is not a reward for Hamas but a necessary step to revive the hope for a two-state solution.

Speaking on "Face the Nation," Cohn pointed to a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 per month. He attributed this to companies cutting labor costs to protect margins amid rising input costs, moving from "hoarding labor" post-COVID to aggressively managing expenses. The comments come after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate, citing a cooling labor market. (not investment advice)</p>
