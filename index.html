          <h2>Senator Rand Paul Details Secret Service Failures in Lead-Up to Trump Assassination Attempt</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a transcript from "Face the Nation," Senator Rand Paul discusses his committee's report on the assassination attempt against Donald Trump, detailing a "cascade of errors" by the Secret Service. Paul asserts that former Director Kimberly Cheatle was untruthful to Congress about resource denials, claiming multiple requests for assets like counter-snipers were denied prior to the Butler, Pennsylvania rally. He describes a culture of cover-up within the agency, where no one took responsibility for security lapses, such as the shooter's position on a roof, and no one was fired despite critical failures. Paul also briefly touches on a proposed $9 billion spending cut, stating that while he prefers a different method, he must vote for any reduction in the face of a massive deficit.</p>

          <h2>European Union Postpones Retaliatory Tariffs on US Goods Amid Ongoing Trade Negotiations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has once again delayed the implementation of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, extending a suspension until early August. The countermeasures were originally planned in response to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and would have affected €21 billion worth of American goods. This decision follows a letter from President Trump threatening to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports if a negotiated solution is not reached by August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue preparing its countermeasures to be fully ready if talks fail.

          <p>A 12-meter aircraft has crashed and caught fire at London Southend Airport, prompting a large-scale emergency service response and the cancellation of all flights. Essex Police, along with multiple fire and ambulance crews, are at the scene of the incident, which occurred shortly before 4:00 PM BST. Authorities have established a perimeter and are urging the public to avoid the area while the response continues over the next several hours. The East of England Ambulance Service dispatched a hazardous area response team and other resources to the site. The circumstances of the crash and information on potential casualties have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to discuss a plan for selling U.S. weapons to NATO allies, which would then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military support for Ukraine by moving equipment from closer European countries, with allies purchasing replacements from the U.S. The meeting comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to enact severe sanctions against Russia's economy and its international supporters. The proposed legislation would grant the President authority to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries aiding Russia's war effort, providing what Senator Lindsey Graham calls a "sledgehammer" to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza has resulted in the deaths of ten people, including six children, according to emergency service officials. Eyewitnesses reported a drone fired a missile at a crowd waiting for water at a tanker in the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The Israeli military acknowledged the strike, stating a "technical error" caused a munition to miss its intended target, an Islamic Jihad militant, and expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians. This event occurs amidst escalating aerial attacks and reports from the International Committee of the Red Cross of overwhelming mass casualty incidents at its field hospitals.</p>

The director of the prison administration described the escape as an "extremely rare event" resulting from an "accumulation of errors" and "serious malfunctions." The incident has drawn further attention to conditions at the prison, which is reportedly operating at nearly double its intended capacity.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Harmful Conspiracy Theory Blaming Texas Floods on Cloud Seeding</h2>

          <p>A persistent and damaging conspiracy theory claiming that cloud seeding, a weather modification technique, caused the deadly floods in Texas is being actively debunked by experts. Despite the scientific consensus that current cloud seeding technology cannot generate such catastrophic rainfall, the false narrative is being amplified by some politicians and online voices. This misinformation is not only factually incorrect but also erodes public trust in science and distracts from the real, complex causes of natural disasters. Experts emphasize that attributing the tragedy to a baseless conspiracy is harmful to the communities affected by the devastating floods.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers, with details to be revealed later in the week. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, the pledge comes amid reports of a potential £700 million subsidy package. The government also announced funding to improve charging infrastructure, including £25 million for "cross-pavement gullies" to help those without driveways. The move aims to boost EV sales, which remain below mandated targets as the country approaches its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense has announced the capture of the village of Myrne in Ukraine's Donetsk region, marking another incremental gain in its intensified offensive. The capture is part of a broader push by Moscow's forces, who claim to be advancing "deep into the enemy's defense." This development comes as Ukraine continues to face massive Russian drone attacks across the country. In a separate event, Ukraine's security service reported that it had "eliminated" two individuals believed to be Russian agents responsible for the recent assassination of a Ukrainian intelligence officer in Kyiv, highlighting the ongoing covert conflict alongside the conventional war.</p>

          <p>Nebraska Representative Don Bacon, one of the few remaining moderate Republicans in the House, has announced he will not run for reelection in 2026. Bacon, who represents a swing district that voted for Kamala Harris, cited the exhaustion from constant political battles and increasing threats from both the far-left and "dark MAGA" supporters. He described himself as being on "E" after the last election and lamented the current state of the GOP, where any disagreement with Donald Trump is seen as treason. Bacon expressed a desire to restore normalcy and plans to "fight for the soul of the party" from outside of Congress.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is set to begin reducing monthly benefits for recipients who have outstanding overpayment debts. Starting in late July 2025, the agency will withhold up to 50% of a person's payment until the accidentally overpaid amount is fully recovered. This new policy follows an effort to reclaim billions in overpayments, which affected approximately two million people in the 2023 fiscal year. The SSA has provided options for recipients to arrange repayment plans or apply for a waiver if they cannot afford to repay and the overpayment was not their fault. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has dropped all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of a major COVID-19 vaccine fraud scheme. Moore was indicted in 2023 for allegedly destroying thousands of government-provided vaccines, administering saline shots to children instead, and selling fraudulent vaccination cards. In her announcement, Bondi stated that Moore "gave his patients a choice" and did not deserve to face prison time. The decision was praised by figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene and reflects the Trump administration's skeptical stance on vaccine mandates and regulations.</p>

          <p>To better project China's soft power and explain its practices to the world, Chinese think tanks must become more "self-centred" and develop an indigenous knowledge system, according to prominent policy adviser Zheng Yongnian. He argues that many Chinese universities remain stuck in Western academic frameworks, whereas think tanks should focus on empirical research grounded in China's unique practical experience. Zheng believes that by moving away from Western models and building a system based on its own policy formation and implementation, China can more effectively analyze its own development. This approach, he contends, is essential for accurately explaining China's present and predicting its future.</p>

This marks the first time since the rivalry of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal that the same two men will compete in both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same year. Just five weeks ago, Alcaraz defeated Sinner in a grueling five-set epic at Roland-Garros, extending his winning streak against the Italian to five matches. Alcaraz, the two-time defending Wimbledon champion, is undefeated in Grand Slam finals, while Sinner is seeking his first title at the All England Club.</p>

Pelicot stated her goal was to inspire other survivors and to make "shame swap sides" from the victim to the perpetrator.
