          <p>An Altoona, Iowa warehouse is providing temporary relief to importers from tariff volatility through bonded warehousing, which allows companies to hold imported goods without immediate payment of customs duties. This strategy is gaining popularity as companies, especially those importing from China, seek to manage funds more effectively amid fluctuating trade policies. Bonded warehouses, overseen by the U.S. Port Authority, offer cost certainty and improved cash flow by deferring tariff payments until goods leave the warehouse. Iowa's economy, being a production state, is significantly impacted by tariff policies, making bonded warehouses a valuable tool for local businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NPR interview with Evan Osnos, author of "The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich," explores the lifestyle and mindset of the ultra-wealthy in America. Osnos discusses the ambivalence Americans have towards money, the extravagance of gigayachts (luxury boats the length of a football field), and the rise of doomsday preppers in Silicon Valley. He highlights the growing disparity between the ultra-rich and the rest of the country, suggesting that the pursuit of extreme wealth reflects a culture of excess and insatiable desire.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, according to reports. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, prompting search and rescue operations. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched approximately 30 missiles, and investigations are underway regarding why alert sirens did not activate in Haifa. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the increasing trend of self-managed medication abortion, where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision, and the changing views of medical professionals on its safety and efficacy. The FDA's loosening of restrictions on mifepristone during the pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have accelerated the adoption of this method. Studies show that self-managed abortion is safe and effective, leading organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to support it. The trend is spreading through informal networks, but faces political challenges and potential restrictions.</p>
