        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the Global Business Travel Association reveals a significant drop in optimism within the global business travel sector, with positive sentiment falling from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025. The survey, which included over 900 business travel professionals, indicates that tariffs and tightened border policies are major factors contributing to this decline. Approximately 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, and a third are considering changing policies regarding travel to or from the United States. Despite these concerns, global airfares have seen a slight decrease, suggesting potential opportunities for regions outside the U.S. to benefit from the shift in travel patterns. Optimism is tempered by uncertainty in the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

In the final showdown, Zaki correctly spelled "Ã©claircissement" to win the bee. The competition, held just outside Washington, D.C., began with 243 young spellers who qualified through local and regional bees.

          <p>Kell Morris, an Alaska man, survived after being pinned face down in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife, Jo Roop, a retired Alaska State Trooper, kept his head above water while awaiting rescue. A sled dog tourism company provided helicopter assistance, enabling rescuers to reach the remote location. It took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder, and Morris was airlifted to a hospital, where he spent two nights for observation. Morris attributes his survival to luck and his wife's quick thinking, and he plans to stick to established trails in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ability to impose tariffs unilaterally is under threat after a US Court of International Trade ruling challenged his authority. The ruling, which has been temporarily stayed by a federal appeals court, argues that Trump exceeded his emergency powers. The administration argues that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. Trump has used tariffs as an economic weapon, but the court challenge could limit his power, forcing him to seek Congressional approval for future tariffs, which would eliminate the element of surprise.</p>

She contends that Britain cannot afford their economic visions and needs leaders who approach economics seriously. Badenoch's remarks follow Labour's consideration of removing the two-child benefit cap and Farage's support for more generous tax breaks for married people.</p>

          <p>The coastal rail line connecting Orange and San Diego counties is expected to resume service on June 7 after nearly six weeks of reinforcement work to address landslides and coastal erosion. Crews placed 5,900 tons of large boulders along the rail and will place up to 240,000 cubic yards of sand between Mariposa and North beaches. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) is also preparing to construct a 1,400-foot-long catchment beside the rail. The OCTA acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs, noting that the rail line has operated largely uninterrupted for more than 125 years.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled the world's first AI nuke inspector, a technology disclosed in a peer-reviewed paper by researchers with the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE). The project, built on a protocol jointly proposed by Chinese and American scientists, aims to bolster Beijingâ€™s stance in international disarmament talks. However, the project faced hurdles, including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and convincing military leaders that the system would not leak tech secrets. Only the first step, training and testing the AI, has been cleared so far due to the classified nature of nuclear warhead designs.</p>

The White House is pushing ICE to carry out a minimum of 3,000 arrests per day, an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement.
