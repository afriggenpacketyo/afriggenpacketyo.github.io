        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to U.S. Steel's Irvin Works in Pennsylvania, stating the move would further secure the steel industry. He believes the increased tariffs will prevent foreign steel companies from circumventing trade barriers, aiming to bolster the domestic steel market. Trump also addressed the proposed merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, describing it as a "partnership" where Nippon would invest $14 billion while U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh. The details of the deal's structure remain unclear despite Trump's announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Al-Awda hospital, the last functioning medical facility in the North Gaza governorate, has been evacuated after an order from the Israeli military, according to the hospital's director, Dr. Mohammed Salha.

The evacuation occurred after hours of negotiation, with patients being carried over 300 meters to waiting ambulances because of destroyed roads. The World Health Organization has expressed concern over the closure, stating that it leaves the region without any functioning hospitals, further endangering civilians and healthcare workers.</p>

          <p>Gerry Adams, former Sinn FÃ©in leader, was awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a story alleging he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a former British agent. The court found that the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith, and Adams stated that the case was about holding the BBC accountable. The Donaldson family has called for a public inquiry into the murder, while the BBC expressed disappointment with the verdict, arguing it could hinder freedom of expression. The legal bill for the case is estimated to be between â‚¬3-5 million.</p>

          <p>Following a federal court ruling against President Trump's use of emergency powers to enact broad tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative trade policy tools. While an appeals court temporarily reinstated the tariffs, the legal uncertainty has prompted consideration of options like Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 and 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, and Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930. These options have limitations compared to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), potentially slowing down the timeline for imposing tariffs and requiring more targeted application. The White House maintains its commitment to addressing trade deficits and advancing trade policies beneficial to Americans. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit claims that the order illegally interferes with PBS's editorial independence and the autonomy of its member stations.

          <p>A wildfire ignited in the Covington Flats area of Joshua Tree National Park, burning 165 acres in a region considered a crucial "climate refugia" for the species. The area's slightly higher elevation provides cooler temperatures and more rainfall, making it vital for the long-term survival of Joshua trees, which are not adapted to wildfire. Officials are concerned about the potential damage to the trees, as climate models predict significant habitat loss for Joshua trees by the end of the century.

          <p>A recent New York Times opinion piece explores a potential link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing rates of childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that redefining harm, abuse, and trauma to include emotional and relational struggles has led to nearly impossible standards for parenting. This cultural shift, where adult children are more likely to cut off contact with parents and expect them to be accountable for their mental health, may contribute to a fear of parenthood. The author proposes that the dread of parenthood stems from holding their own parents to unreachable standards.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge indicated that price growth slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, potentially reflecting an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic analyzes President Trump's trade policy, coining the term "TACO trade" to describe investors' recognition that Trump often "chickens out" on imposing tariffs. Markets tend to dip when Trump announces new tariffs, but investors have learned to buy the dip, anticipating that he will lower or delay the measures. The article suggests that Wall Street has finally caught on to Trump's pattern of nearly always folding, despite his initial commitment to tariffs. The author warns that this arbitrage could lose its power if Trump feels shamed into following through on economically harmful tariffs.</p>

          <p>Amy Jones achieved her first international century in 12 years, marking a significant milestone in her career during a match against the West Indies. This achievement came in England's first one-day international under the new leadership of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards. Jones expressed relief and pride in reaching this milestone, especially after being promoted back up the order by Edwards. The simplicity of Edwards' approach helped take the pressure off, contributing to Jones' success.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel are awaiting a response from Hamas to a 60-day ceasefire proposal for Gaza, according to the White House. Israel has signed off on the proposal, which includes the release of hostages by Hamas and Palestinian prisoners by Israel. The proposal also outlines the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and the cessation of Israeli offensive military activities. A senior Hamas official stated that the proposal fails to meet their demands, but the leadership is studying the response.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article argues that denying visas to Chinese students could backfire on America. While protecting borders from espionage is essential, denying visas to students pursuing STEM degrees simply because they are Chinese could be detrimental. The article suggests that restricting access to education for Chinese students may harm America's own scientific and technological advancement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Sen. Joni Ernst defended proposed Medicaid cuts at a town hall, responding to concerns that the cuts would cause people to die by saying, "Well, we all are going to die." Audience members expressed concerns that the proposed cuts under Trump's "big, beautiful bill" would threaten the lives of individuals who lose access to healthcare or food benefits. Ernst argued that the bill aims to protect those who are eligible for Medicaid while removing those who have other options for benefits.</p>
