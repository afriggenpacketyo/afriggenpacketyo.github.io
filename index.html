            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, acting on an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals under the wartime law, potentially sending individuals to dangerous prisons in El Salvador. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, and the administration is expected to quickly seek to lift the order. The ACLU cited concerns about the detainees being accused of ties to the Tren de Aragua gang, highlighting the risk of irreparable harm due to brutal conditions in Salvadoran prisons.</p>

            <p>This Fox News opinion piece argues that President Trump employs misdirection, a technique learned in Las Vegas, to distract from his true political aims. The author suggests that Trump uses tariff announcements to divert attention from broader industrial plans and tax discussions. He also posits that Trump's focus on global instability is not about winning a Nobel Prize, but about restoring American energy dominance.

The ministry vowed to retaliate against the measures, which it claims harm Chinese companies and disrupt global supply chains. The US port fees, finalized by the Trump administration, impose charges on Chinese-owned, operated, or built vessels docking in the United States.

            <p>This Atlantic article discusses the phenomenon of 'hobby inflation,' where the cost of recreational activities is increasing, making them less accessible. The author argues that this trend has social ramifications beyond economics, as hobbies create communities and opportunities for people from different backgrounds to connect. The rising cost of hobbies could lead to shrinking social circles and increased isolation. The article suggests that a society where communal leisure is unattainable may become lonelier and less tolerant of difference.</p>

            <p>An NPR opinion piece reflects on how a Chicago Bulls hat, once a symbol of global popularity and American energy, became associated with gang membership in a deportation case. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man, was wrongly deported based on his wearing a Bulls cap, which police interpreted as a sign of MS-13 affiliation. The author reflects on the change of a symbol of unity to a symbol of division and the impact on individuals' lives.</p>
