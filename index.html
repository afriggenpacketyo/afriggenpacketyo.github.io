          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave," likens the process of selecting a new Pope to the dynamics of the TV show "The Traitors."

Harris also argues that the UK political parties should consider adopting similar methods to select their leaders. Harris also notes the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope is strange.</p>
