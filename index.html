          <p>Global defense company stocks saw significant gains following a statement from U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting Ukraine could win back all its territory from Russia. This marks a notable change from his previous stance, where he hinted at Ukraine ceding land for peace. Trump's comments, posted on his Truth Social platform, referred to Russia as a "paper tiger" facing economic trouble, which encouraged investor confidence in European and Asian defense firms. The article notes this rhetorical shift is seen by industry experts as an encouraging sign for Europe, reaffirming the sector's warnings about continued Russian aggression.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly altered his position on the war in Ukraine, stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with European and NATO support. This declaration, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, contrasts sharply with his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to concede territory for peace. Trump cited Russia's economic difficulties as a key factor, calling the nation a "paper tiger." The shift was welcomed by Zelenskyy, while NATO allies also reacted to Trump's separate call to shoot down Russian jets violating their airspace.</p>

Known for her roles in iconic films like Federico Fellini's "8 1/2" and "The Pink Panther," her career spanned six decades. Born in Tunisia, she rose to fame after winning a beauty contest, which led her to the Venice film festival and the start of her acting career.

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to his show on Tuesday, addressing the controversy over his comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk without offering a direct apology. He expressed that it was never his intention to make light of the murder but also made it clear he would not be silenced by critics, particularly Donald Trump. Kimmel framed the issue as a defense of free speech against government threats, stating that such pressure is "anti-American." The article analyzes his monologue as a defiant stance that has hardened his resolve, escalating his public conflict with the president and his administration.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Premier Expresses Desire for Improved Trade Relations with Canada</h2>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has voiced hopes for a more stable and healthy partnership with Canada during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in New York. The discussion, held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, focused on urging Ottawa to adopt a "correct" perception of China to improve bilateral ties. Relations between the two nations have been strained, particularly after Canada imposed tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum last year.

          <p>A number of influential podcasters and online personalities, who appeal to a young, male audience and previously supported Donald Trump, are now showing signs of disillusionment six months into his second term. The article examines the shifting stances of major figures like Joe Rogan, Theo Von, and Andrew Schulz, who have become more critical of the administration's policies and lack of transparency. While some hosts remain loyal, this fragmentation within the "manosphere" could present a challenge for Trump's political movement. The analysis suggests that the disappointment among these key influencers may reflect broader changes among the unconventional coalition of voters that helped elect him.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to television is being analyzed as a significant, albeit partial, victory for celebrity-led resistance against the Trump administration's pressure. While Disney reinstated his show after a suspension, nearly a quarter of ABC affiliates, owned by Sinclair and Nexstar, continue to boycott it. The article argues that the pushback against Kimmel's suspension was driven primarily by individual actors, comedians, and influencers rather than established institutions. This grassroots effort successfully pressured a major corporation, but the ongoing affiliate boycott demonstrates the limits of such resistance, raising questions about its replicability and long-term impact on free speech.</p>

Sanders argues that this concentration of wealth and power is causing economic collapse for ordinary people, who face unaffordable healthcare, housing, and education. He concludes by invoking Justice Louis Brandeis, warning that the nation cannot have both a functioning democracy and such extreme wealth in the hands of a few. (not investment advice)</p>

An earlier renegotiation could add billions to the league's revenue, which would in turn boost team valuations and the player salary cap.

They point to the significant broadening of the diagnostic criteria for autism over the decades, which now encompasses a much wider spectrum of behaviors. Additionally, increased screening recommendations and better identification in previously underserved communities have contributed to the higher prevalence, rather than a new environmental "epidemic" as suggested by Kennedy.</p>

Hastings' lawsuit alleged that Inglewood police detectives fabricated evidence and ignored witness accounts that pointed to the actual killer. The settlement is reported to be the largest for a wrongful conviction in California's history.</p>

          <p>The UK's home secretary has launched an urgent review into the use of taxis to transport asylum seekers after a BBC investigation revealed the practice was costing taxpayers hundreds of pounds per trip. The report found that asylum seekers are often transported long distances by taxi for appointments, with one journey cited costing £600. Under the current system, taxis are booked automatically for necessary travel, such as to a doctor's office, without public transport being offered as an alternative. The investigation has prompted criticism from opposition parties and government ministers, who questioned the efficiency and expense of the system amid strained public services.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bangkok are working to manage a large sinkhole that opened up on a major road, collapsing 50 meters into the ground. The incident occurred in a residential area near several hospitals and a police station, leading to the cordoning off of the site and the evacuation of nearby residents and workers. Officials believe heavy rain may have eroded a large underground water pipe, with soil from a nearby subway construction project possibly contributing to the collapse. While no injuries were reported, the sinkhole was observed to be slowly growing, and it has disrupted utilities in the surrounding area.</p>

          <p>A TikTok ad for Au Vodka featuring former "Love Island" contestant Lucinda Strafford has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for inappropriately targeting an audience under 18. The video showed Strafford promoting the alcoholic beverage, and the ASA ruled that insufficient care was taken to prevent it from reaching minors, given the show's popularity with young people. The regulator noted that under UK rules, alcohol ads must not be directed at people under 18, and those featured in them must be, or appear to be, over 25.

          <p>UK energy regulator Ofgem has announced that all suppliers in England, Scotland, and Wales must offer customers a tariff with a low standing charge by the end of January. This move responds to complaints from low-energy users who are burdened by the fixed daily fee, which covers connection and network costs. However, the change is unlikely to reduce overall bills, as the new tariffs will feature higher rates for each unit of energy consumed. Consumer advocates have expressed disappointment, stating the plan does not address the core issue of high energy costs and simply shifts expenses from one part of the bill to another.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the impact of Super Typhoon Ragasa, scientists are highlighting the connection between climate change and the increasing intensity of such storms. Experts explain that warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for typhoons, allowing them to intensify more rapidly and grow larger. The article notes that average temperatures in the Pacific Ocean have risen significantly over the last century. This added energy also causes storms to stall along coastlines more frequently, leading to catastrophic amounts of rainfall in concentrated areas. This trend suggests that powerful storms like Ragasa are becoming more common as a direct result of global warming.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa has struck Hong Kong and southern China with destructive force, causing major flooding and damage after leaving 14 people dead in Taiwan. The storm, one of the most powerful globally this year, brought hurricane-force winds and a massive storm surge that inundated coastal areas of Hong Kong. In Taiwan, the typhoon's heavy rains caused a dam to breach, resulting in the fatalities. As the storm moved toward mainland China's Guangdong Province, authorities evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from low-lying areas to prepare for its impact, which set local wind speed records.</p>

The APPG aims to address challenges faced by creators, such as access to funding and navigating regulations.

The policy has made it easier for international visitors to enter the country, boosting the cities' roles as global hubs. In contrast, Hong Kong's ranking fell from fourth to seventh, partly because the assessment excluded tourist data from mainland China and was affected by global trade disruptions.</p>

          <p>The article delves into the history of spices, tracing their journey from ancient, highly valued commodities to modern-day seasonal flavors. For centuries, spices like cinnamon, pepper, and cloves were exotic and expensive, driving global exploration and the creation of vast trading empires like the Dutch East India Company. They were not just used for flavoring food but also as markers of wealth, religious symbols, and medicinal treatments in medieval Europe. The word "spicy" itself evolved from its literal meaning to describe anything provocative or interesting around the 19th century. This history provides a rich context for the spices we now enjoy.</p>

          <p>New York City voters are considering a proposal to move municipal elections, including the mayoral race, from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years to coincide with federal and state contests. This is part of a national trend aimed at combating chronically low voter turnout in local elections. Proponents argue that consolidating elections increases participation, particularly among younger and minority voters, and reduces costs for election administration. While some local officials worry about their races being overshadowed, data from other cities that have made the switch shows a significant increase in the number of ballots cast in local races.</p>
