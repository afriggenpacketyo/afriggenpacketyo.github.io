          <p>HBO has confirmed that "And Just Like That...", the reboot of "Sex and the City," will end after its upcoming third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated that the final episode felt like a natural conclusion to the series, which has faced declining viewership and criticism over its attempts at diversification and perceived plot inconsistencies. The show followed the original characters in their 50s, and despite fan desire for it to continue, King has ruled out the possibility of further spin-offs, bringing the franchise's narrative to a close.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, following a jobs report that showed weaker-than-expected growth and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump accused the agency of political manipulation without evidence, a move that has sparked alarm on Wall Street and among economists about potential interference with the integrity of crucial economic data. The dismissal coincided with a global stock market downturn attributed to the administration's new tariff policies, amplifying concerns about economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled a major case for its next term to determine if Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The case asks the justices to decide whether the new map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments, a question that could significantly impact future redistricting efforts and the application of the Voting Rights Act. The outcome of this case, which has been in legal battles for years, will likely influence the balance of power in the House of Representatives for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Researchers have published a study suggesting a connection between the sun's magnetic cycle and long-term summer precipitation patterns in China. The paper, featured in the Journal of Climate, posits that the "solar precipitation regime" influences the "south drought and north flooding" phenomenon observed over decadal timescales. This finding could be crucial for improving climate predictions during flood seasons, as the position of the monsoon rain belt heavily dictates the distribution of droughts and floods across the country.</p>

The situation highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that price caps could stifle innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

A specific area known as "ray bay" is a hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant.

          <p>The United Kingdom's plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state has been framed as a way to revitalize the two-state solution, but it has received a mixed reception. While Palestinian diplomats see it as a significant step toward justice and a rejection of decades of "lip service," many Palestinians on the ground are skeptical it will change the reality of Israeli occupation and settlement expansion. Israeli officials, meanwhile, have condemned the move, viewing it as a reward for terrorism and an illegitimate attempt to impose a solution, vowing it will not bring peace.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys superstar Micah Parsons has requested a trade, stating on social media, "I no longer want to play for the Dallas Cowboys." The two-time All-Pro pass rusher, who has been holding out of on-field activities, is seeking a long-term contract extension and expressed frustration with the team's negotiation tactics and what he described as a lack of communication. Parsons claims the team has not had a single conversation with his agent about a new contract, leading to his decision to formally submit a trade request to the organization.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector has provided a rare, detailed account of how the regime sends thousands of IT workers abroad to fraudulently obtain remote work with Western companies. The worker, using the pseudonym Jin-su, explained how he used fake identities to earn thousands of dollars a month, with 85% of the income sent back to fund the North Korean government. This scheme, which the UN estimates generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually, exploits the remote work boom and involves a complex network to secure jobs and launder money.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Trump administration, alleging an "unconstitutional pressure campaign" to stop hospitals from providing gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The lawsuit argues the administration is creating an atmosphere of fear by threatening criminal prosecution and demanding patient data, effectively attempting a de facto national ban without legal authority. This legal action comes as several prominent children's hospitals have already shut down their gender-affirming care clinics due to the federal pressure, even in states where the care remains legal.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury has found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 crash that killed a pedestrian and severely injured another while the vehicle's Autopilot software was engaged. The company was ordered to pay up to $243 million in damages after plaintiffs successfully argued the driver-assistance software should have alerted the driver and applied the brakes. Tesla, which maintained the driver was solely at fault, called the verdict "wrong" and plans to appeal. This case marks a significant legal setback for the company regarding the capabilities and safety of its self-driving technology.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has issued a ruling that closes off a major avenue for millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance involving hidden commissions. The court did not uphold a previous finding that these commission payments were inherently unlawful. However, the judgment did leave open the possibility for claims in cases where large, unfair commissions were involved. While one claimant was awarded a small sum, the decision significantly reduces the potential multi-billion-pound liability that lenders were facing.</p>

          <p>This commentary article frames President Trump's firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner as part of a long-standing war against objective data that contradicts his preferred narrative. The author argues that by dismissing the head of a non-partisan agency over unflattering job numbers, the administration seeks to replace factual analysis with "vibes" and political loyalty. This move threatens to undermine the integrity of economic data, which is crucial for markets and policymakers, potentially leaving everyone to operate in a fog of misinformation.

Gillie Jenkinson, who appears in a BBC documentary, explains that cults often use tactics like "love bombing," controlling behavior, and selling a deceptive narrative to isolate and exploit followers. She notes that cults are not always religious and can be found online, making them easier to encounter. Key red flags include an "us-versus-them" mentality, a high barrier to exit, and discouraging critical thinking.</p>

The disclosure, led by CEO Liang Rubo, aimed to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. These figures suggest that ByteDance is a relatively attractive employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture. The company abandoned the infamous "996" work schedule in late 2021 for a more standard five-day work week.</p>
