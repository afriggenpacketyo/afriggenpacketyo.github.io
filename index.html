          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has officially formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will intensify, possibly reaching low-grade hurricane status over the weekend. However, the system is expected to track north of the Caribbean and remain over open waters for several days, posing no immediate threat to any land areas. Officials note that while the season was predicted to be busy, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The suspect accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk was reportedly fearful of being shot by law enforcement and negotiated a peaceful surrender with the help of his family. According to the Washington County Sheriff, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson did not want a SWAT team raiding his parents' home and agreed to turn himself in under relaxed conditions. A retired detective who knew the family facilitated the surrender, bringing the suspect to the sheriff's office, where he was met by plainclothes detectives. Authorities have since charged Robinson with aggravated murder and intend to seek the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Christian minister Edward Barham has come forward as the man who was told he was 'not welcome' by Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud during a contentious city council meeting. The viral exchange occurred as Barham objected to the city honoring a controversial news publisher, whom he accused of inciting violence. In an interview, Barham stated he would not respond with hate and emphasized his commitment to free speech and public ministry. He also highlighted past positive interactions with the city, including permission for a Christian call to prayer, but noted a pattern of dismissing Christian perspectives.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' off the air indefinitely after the host made controversial comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel suggested the accused shooter was part of the MAGA movement, which prompted significant backlash. The decision followed a warning from the FCC chairman about potential action against ABC's broadcast license and a move by Nexstar Media Group, a major station owner, to preemptively drop the show from its affiliates. A source indicated that Kimmel is not fired but that Disney plans to discuss his future on-air statements.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol Through Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol content in figs and plum-like fruits that are staples of the chimpanzee diet, finding it to be around 0.3% by weight. While this low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits eaten by wild chimps.</p>

          <p>As the October 1st government shutdown deadline approaches, Congressional Democrats have released a counteroffer to the Republican funding plan. The Democratic proposal would fund the government until October 31 and includes a permanent extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, a key sticking point with the GOP. Meanwhile, House Republicans are moving forward with their own bill to keep the government open until November 21, which also includes funds for lawmaker security. With a narrow House majority and a 60-vote threshold in the Senate, bipartisan negotiation will be necessary to avert a shutdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to increase its contract with the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to nearly $5 million for its work on a major homelessness case. The decision came despite previous criticism over the firm's high invoices, including one for $1.8 million for just two weeks of work. The firm was hired to defend the city against accusations that it had failed to comply with a settlement agreement to create more shelter beds. While some council members voted against the increase, citing insufficient cost reductions, the City Attorney's office praised the firm's legal representation.</p>

          <p>David Pittman, a 63-year-old man convicted of the 1990 triple murder of his estranged wife's parents and sister, has been executed by lethal injection in Florida. This marks a record 12th execution in the state for 2025, with Governor Ron DeSantis having signed more death warrants this year than any of his predecessors. In his final words, Pittman maintained his innocence, stating he was being 'murdered by the state of Florida.' His final appeals, which focused on claims of intellectual disability, were rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Following his team's dramatic 3-2 Champions League loss to Liverpool, Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone said he regrets his part in a heated confrontation with home supporters. The incident occurred after Virgil van Dijk scored a late winner, with Simeone claiming his reaction was provoked by 'insults for the whole game.' He had to be separated from fans by stewards and was ultimately sent off by the referee. While acknowledging his reaction was not justifiable, he called on Liverpool to address the behavior of its fans.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is actively reviewing dozens of social media posts, apparently from service members, that mock or praise the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has publicly condemned such commentary as 'completely unacceptable.' At least one Marine and several Army officers have already been suspended from their duties pending investigations. While civilian employees have broad free speech protections, uniformed personnel operate under the stricter Uniform Code of Military Justice, which prohibits conduct that discredits the armed forces.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested following what the FBI is calling a 'targeted attack' on its Pittsburgh Field office.

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated that he has 'no relationship' with U.S. President Donald Trump, signaling a breakdown in communication between the leaders of the two largest economies in the Americas. Lula criticized recent U.S. tariffs on Brazilian goods as 'eminently political,' arguing that American consumers would ultimately pay the price. He claimed that members of the Trump administration 'do not want to talk' and that he learned of the tariffs through the media rather than through official diplomatic channels.</p>

          <p>Birdie G's, a highly praised Santa Monica restaurant known for its inventive take on Midwestern and Jewish cuisine, will permanently close at the end of the year.

He cited a drastic drop in business following the January Palisades fire as the 'nail in the coffin.' The restaurant, which opened in 2019 and was named to multiple best-of lists, will offer special menus and welcome back alumni chefs during its final months.</p>

          <p>This article provides deeper context on Nexstar Media Group's decision to preempt 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!,' connecting the move to the company's pending $6.2 billion merger with Tegna, which requires FCC approval.

The situation highlights the pressure major media companies face from the Trump administration, which has previously used regulatory leverage in disputes with networks like ABC and CBS, resulting in multi-million dollar settlements.</p>

          <p>With public trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention eroding under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F.

These groups base their recommendations on independent reviews of scientific evidence.

The alliance's guidelines urge vaccination for specific at-risk groups, directly contrasting with recent federal guidance that removed recommendations for pregnant people and children to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
