          <p>African leaders at the UN General Assembly are pushing for a more equitable global order, seeking a stronger voice in governance, enhanced peace and security, and resources for sustainable development. They renewed demands for permanent representation on the UN Security Council, arguing its current structure is outdated and unjust. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa highlighted the veto power's paralysis of global peace efforts and also advocated for the recognition of a Palestinian state, drawing parallels to Africa's colonial history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order labeling Antifa a "domestic terrorist organization," directing federal agencies to investigate and dismantle its operations. This move follows his blame of "radical left wing political violence" after a conservative activist's killing, though no evidence links the shooter to Antifa. Experts argue Trump lacks authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations, citing First Amendment concerns and the decentralized nature of Antifa as a movement rather than a formal entity. The action is expected to face significant legal hurdles.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee advised caution regarding aggressive interest rate cuts, despite voting for a recent reduction, citing concerns about slower growth and a weaker labor market. He emphasized that further moves depend on economic progress and the need to manage inflation, which has remained above the 2% target for over four years. Goolsbee believes rates can gradually decrease if stagflationary pressures subside, with the FOMC's "dot plot" indicating potential for more cuts this year and beyond, aiming for a neutral rate around 3.1%.
