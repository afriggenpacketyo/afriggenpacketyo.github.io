          <p>Fairhope, Alabama, a city founded on utopian ideals, is now embroiled in a culture war centered around its public library. The conflict arose when some parents raised concerns about books with sexual content or L.G.B.T.Q. themes in the teen section, leading to heated debates and challenges to various titles. The Alabama Public Library Service board even paused funding to the library after criticism regarding certain books, prompting a crowdfunding campaign to offset the loss. The article delves into the city's history, the perspectives of residents on both sides of the issue, and the broader implications for intellectual freedom and parental rights.</p>

          <p>California's high-speed rail project, approved by voters in 2008, faces significant delays and cost overruns, raising questions about the state's ability to undertake large-scale infrastructure projects. The article follows eminent-domain lawyer Mark Wasser as he visits construction sites and clients whose properties have been acquired for the rail line. Wasser disputes claims that eminent domain is the primary cause of the project's delays, instead pointing to design changes, environmental regulations, and funding issues. The project's scope has been reduced to a 171-mile segment between Bakersfield and Merced, with the original vision of connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco remaining distant.</p>

The planned military expansion includes operations in new areas and destroying infrastructure above and below ground.

          <p>Bayern Munich has secured its 33rd Bundesliga title, reclaiming the trophy after Bayer Leverkusen's historic unbeaten season. Despite a turbulent period with coaching changes, Bayern's success can be attributed to Vincent Kompany's steadying influence, strategic signings like Harry Kane and Michael Olise, and Leverkusen's inability to sustain their previous form. Kane's exceptional scoring record and Olise's creative contributions have bolstered Bayern's attack. Leverkusen's potential loss of key player Florian Wirtz to Bayern could further solidify Bayern's dominance. Bayern's strength in depth has also been crucial, allowing them to overcome injuries to key players.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump stated he would not dismiss the possibility of using military force to gain control of Greenland, an autonomous territory within Denmark. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in US expansion into Greenland, citing its strategic importance for defense and mineral resources. In an interview, Trump also mentioned the idea of annexing Canada, though he deemed it "highly unlikely." He claimed the US subsidizes Canada and expressed openness to discussing making Canada the 51st state with its new prime minister, Mark Carney.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies the Most Damaging Phrase in Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 12:50:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships. This comparison creates insecurity and makes partners feel inadequate. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly communicating needs. Direct communication is key to a healthy relationship, and expressing frustrations without comparison can foster greater understanding and intimacy. Openness and security are essential for couples to thrive.</p>

Trump acknowledged economic difficulties in China, noting a contraction in factory activity.

          <p>Millions of single-family homes in America are underused, situated on spacious lots, presenting an opportunity to address the affordable housing crisis. The article explores the concept of retrofitting these homes into "roommate houses" or adding backyard cottages to increase housing density without significant disruption. Developer Monte Anderson's project in Dallas exemplifies this approach, transforming a single-family home into four studio apartments. This strategy aims to provide affordable housing options in existing neighborhoods while navigating zoning regulations and addressing the housing mismatch in the country.</p>
