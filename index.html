          <p>A second unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died from complications related to measles as an outbreak continues to spread, originating in West Texas and affecting multiple states and Mexico. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited Gaines County to offer support and assess how HHS agencies can assist in controlling the outbreak, which has seen a significant rise in cases this year. The first measles death in a decade occurred in February, and experts anticipate the outbreak could persist for months. &#x3C;br&#x3E;Dr. Peter Marks, former FDA vaccine chief, placed blame on Kennedy for the death, while Kennedy said the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $78,000, as investors reacted to increased financial market volatility following President Donald Trump's implementation of restrictive global tariffs. The decline in Bitcoin's price triggered substantial long liquidations, with traders selling assets to cover losses. Other cryptocurrencies, including Ether and Solana's token, also suffered notable losses overnight. The flagship cryptocurrency usually trades like a big tech stock and is often viewed by traders as a leading indicator of market sentiment, but last week it bucked the broader market meltdown.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, due to mounting fears that President Donald Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession in the U.S. and potentially worldwide.

          <p>The UK government has relaxed regulations for car firms ahead of the 2030 ban on petrol vehicles in an effort to shield the industry from a trade war and boost automobile manufacturing. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced that while the government remains committed to the 2030 deadline, it would introduce more flexible rules to help firms make the transition. The changes include relaxed mandates, extended timelines for smaller firms, and continued market availability for some hybrid vehicles until 2035. The move comes as President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% levy on cars imported to the US, a major export market for the UK motor industry.</p>

          <p>Apple will keep ByteDance-owned TikTok on its App Store for at least 75 more days after receiving assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi. This follows President Donald Trump's executive order to extend the TikTok ban deadline for the second time. TikTok will be banned in the U.S. unless China's ByteDance sells its U.S. operations. Bondi wrote in a letter to Apple that the company should act in accordance with Trump's deadline extension.</p>

          <p>Corporate executives had previously indicated they would collectively voice concerns about President Donald Trump if stocks sank 20%. While some indexes have approached or crossed that threshold, most CEOs remain silent. Some executives have voiced concerns behind closed doors, but fear being the "lightning rod" for public criticism. The Business Roundtable expressed support for fairer trade deals but warned against universal tariffs.</p>

          <p>Probationary workers across the federal government have been left in an uneasy employment limbo after mass firings and subsequent legal challenges. Court rulings have ordered the reinstatement of these workers, but their long-term job security remains uncertain. Many have been placed on administrative leave, and the Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to lift one of the orders. The administration believes the firings were within its authority to manage internal affairs.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old Chinese woman being detained by US border patrol in Arizona for overstaying her visa has died by suicide. The woman was picked up in California and later sent to the Yuma station in Arizona. Initial reports suggest border patrol agents failed to perform required welfare checks prior to the woman’s death. Surveillance footage showed the woman create a noose and tie it around her neck, but no medical response occurred for nearly two hours.</p>
