          <p>Argentina's Supreme Court has discovered dozens of boxes filled with Nazi materials dating back to World War II within its basement archives. The collection includes postcards, photographs, notebooks, and propaganda, which were found during preparations for a museum. The court has invited Argentina's Holocaust Museum to help document and preserve the items and to investigate international financing networks used by the Nazis. The artifacts were originally sent from the German embassy in Japan to Argentina in 1941 but were confiscated due to concerns about Argentina's neutrality during the war.</p>

The meetings, attended by high-level officials from both countries in Geneva, mark the first formal trade negotiations since increased tariffs disrupted bilateral trade and global supply chains.

          <p>President Trump has announced he will sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying what Medicare pays for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to ensure the U.S. pays the same price as the nation with the lowest cost, a plan he unsuccessfully tried to implement during his first term. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices will hurt profits and innovation. The order is likely to impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B, such as infusions and injectables.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane as a donation from the Qatari royal family, which would be upgraded to serve as Air Force One. The plane would then be donated to President Trump’s presidential library when he leaves office, raising ethical concerns. The offer is one of the biggest foreign gifts ever received by the U.S. government, and raises legal and ethical questions. While a Qatari official described the proposal as still under discussion and the White House said that gifts it accepted would be done in full compliance with the law, Democratic lawmakers and good government groups expressed outrage over the substantial ethical issues the plan presented.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal is a "most favored nation" pricing model, though details on its application are limited. The plan is likely to face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will cut into profits and reduce research. The move sets Trump apart from most Republicans, who are typically skeptical of government price setting.</p>

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the two sides had made what he called "substantial progress," but that more details would be announced Monday. Several Trump administration officials also spoke about the positive tone of the talks. After weeks of frazzled financial markets, investors are likely to react positively to this development as a sign that the significant disruption to trade between the two countries could soon resume, with improved economic consequences.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, forcing thousands of Americans to switch to a drug that may be less effective. This decision highlights the consequences of secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, which limit treatment options for patients. Research indicates that Zepbound results in more weight loss than Wegovy, but Caremark claims the decision was made to lower drug prices. Doctors argue that both drugs should remain available to tailor prescriptions to individual patient needs.</p>

Many supermarket products advertising protein content may be gimmicky and not as healthy as advertised, with some containing as many calories as regular products. Extra protein consumption is necessary for people who want to develop muscle by lifting weights.</p>

          <p>The first head-to-head trial of two blockbuster weight-loss drugs has shown Mounjaro is more effective than rival Wegovy. Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. The trial, which was paid for by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Mounjaro, involved 750 obese people. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>
