          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has stated she expects boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. to be deported from the U.S. to face charges of arms trafficking and organized crime in Mexico. Chávez Jr. was arrested by ICE in Los Angeles for overstaying his visa and has a history of legal issues in the U.S., including a DUI conviction and charges for illegal weapon possession. U.S. authorities also suspect his affiliation with the Sinaloa Cartel, which complicated his application for permanent residency. The situation highlights complex legal and diplomatic issues between the two countries involving a high-profile athlete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Republican-led spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims. Instead, the legislation introduces a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 with incomes below certain thresholds, which applies to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts note this provides some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change. Critics also raise concerns that the measure could further strain the Social Security trust fund's finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the location of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident, which occurred at a facility for Devastating Pyrotechnics, left seven individuals unaccounted for and resulted in two injuries. Investigations revealed that the warehouse was operating without the necessary local permits on property owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant. Federal agencies, including the ATF, are now assisting Cal Fire in the investigation into the cause of the catastrophic event, which destroyed multiple structures and burned approximately 80 acres.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a U.S. naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. This decision clarifies a previous order that had lifted a lower court's injunction, which had required the government to provide the migrants a chance to contest their removal over fears of torture. The migrants, originally from Latin America and Asia, have been held in Djibouti for weeks. Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, expressing grave concerns for the safety of the deportees being sent to the politically unstable nation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial in combating global warming by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These organisms gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, effectively sequestering the carbon for centuries. Researchers calculated this process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, stores about 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. This discovery highlights the underappreciated but vital role these small creatures play in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

These schemes also appear to involve significant inheritance tax fraud by undervaluing the estates.

          <p>Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown Los Angeles on the Fourth of July to rally against the Trump administration's immigration raids and the newly passed budget bill that significantly increases funding for them. Demonstrators, including some in costume, marched from City Hall to the Federal Building, chanting against deportations and what they term an occupation. The protest reflects the heightened fear and anger in the community following weeks of aggressive ICE raids and the deployment of the National Guard. Speakers, including local politicians, condemned the new spending as a misuse of taxpayer dollars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a landmark spending package into law, enacting significant tax cuts, new restrictions on social safety-net programs, and a massive increase in funding for immigration enforcement. The legislation makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent but also imposes work requirements on Medicaid and SNAP, which critics say will leave millions without essential benefits. Proponents argue the changes will root out waste, while immigrant rights groups have condemned the $170 million allocated for enforcement as a blank check to terrorize communities. The law also ends many green energy incentives established under the previous administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany started their Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the eight-time champions secured the win, the performance was overshadowed by a potentially serious knee injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the field in tears during the first half. Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, and her participation in the rest of the tournament is now in serious doubt. The win provides a solid start for Germany, but the loss of their captain could be a significant blow as they prepare to face tougher opponents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that will implement significant changes at America's national parks. The order directs federal agencies to charge foreign tourists higher entry fees and give U.S. residents preferential treatment in lotteries or permitting systems for recreational access. Revenue from the increased fees will be used for park infrastructure improvements. The same order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and storytelling within national parks, aligning with the administration's broader policy of ending government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has outlined five food categories he avoids feeding his own children to promote long-term health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of sodium and nitrates. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, as well as deep-fried foods prepared in reused industrial oils.
