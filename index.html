          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, bringing the total rate to 50% if the country does not cease its purchases of Russian oil. The White House stated that India's trade with Russia undermines international efforts related to the conflict in Ukraine and poses a threat to U.S. national security. India's foreign ministry has called the proposed tariffs unfair and unreasonable, arguing its oil imports from Russia began after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. The move signals a hardline stance on secondary sanctions against key U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

Today, both cities are thriving metropolises, serving as powerful symbols of resilience and peace. The article also notes the renewed global anxiety over nuclear weapons amid current geopolitical tensions, quoting Hiroshima's mayor on the importance of peacebuilding.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could significantly impact India's economy, though some key sectors may be insulated. The tariffs, imposed over India's oil trade with Russia, primarily threaten sectors like gems, jewelry, textiles, and apparel, with an estimated $8 billion in exports considered most vulnerable. However, India's major exports to the U.S., such as IT services and pharmaceuticals, are not currently targeted by the duties on goods. Analysts suggest the move may have more symbolic weight than immediate substance, given a 21-day window before implementation, but it introduces significant uncertainty for specific industries.

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Resettling Pompeii After Volcanic Eruption</h2>

          <p>New archaeological research suggests that survivors of the AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence indicates that a 'precarious and grey agglomeration,' similar to a camp, was established in the devastated city and lasted until the 5th century. These settlers likely lived in the upper floors of buried homes, using the lower levels as cellars and salvaging valuable objects from the ruins. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the catastrophic event, revealing a forgotten chapter of resilience and survival in the city's history.</p>

          <p>The Jefferson County District Attorney has determined that a Homewood, Alabama police officer was justified in the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Jabari Peoples and will not face charges. The DA's report states that the officer shot Peoples in the back after a struggle, during which Peoples allegedly ran to his vehicle and grabbed a gun. The family of the teen has questioned this conclusion after viewing a portion of the body camera footage, stating that their son appeared scared and was 'running for his life.' The family's attorney is calling for the full, unedited video to be released to the public for transparency.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down from his role as co-CEO of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, just before the company's acquisition by David Ellison's Skydance Media is finalized. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had already announced its new leadership team for the studio. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, oversaw major franchises like 'Top Gun: Maverick' and 'Mission: Impossible.' He was part of a three-person CEO office that guided the company through a tumultuous period of business pressures and sale negotiations. His departure marks a significant leadership change as the Redstone era at Paramount comes to an end.</p>

          <p>Following a visit to Moscow by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, President Trump has indicated there is a 'good chance' he could meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The White House confirmed that Russia expressed a desire for a meeting and that Trump is open to it. This development comes just before a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face new sanctions, including recently announced tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil. While expectations for a quick resolution remain low, the diplomatic activity signals a potential shift in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions and U.S. tariffs, China is leveraging its control over the global supply of rare earth minerals, which are critical for a vast range of technologies from consumer electronics to advanced defense systems. China holds a majority of the world's reserves and refining capacity, supplying 70% of the rare earths imported by the United States between 2020 and 2023. By imposing export controls on these essential materials, Beijing is using a strategic countermeasure similar to Washington's own tactics of restricting technology exports. This highlights a key vulnerability for the U.S. and its allies in the ongoing global technology competition.</p>

The IPO raised $868 million and gives the Texas-based company a valuation of approximately $6.3 billion. The successful pricing reflects strong investor interest in the space technology sector, which has seen several companies go public this year. Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, recently won a major NASA contract and successfully landed its 'Blue Ghost' lander on the moon. The company will begin trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'FLY.' (not investment advice)</p>

While the Corps of Engineers stated the action was within operational guidelines, the move has drawn criticism regarding the use of public resources for a personal recreational activity.
