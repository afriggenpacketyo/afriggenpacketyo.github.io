          <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is appealing a judge's decision to dismiss a terrorism case against Liam Og Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the rap group Kneecap. The case, involving the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag, was thrown out on a technicality, as the charge was filed after the six-month statutory time limit. Kneecap has condemned the appeal as a "political witch-hunt" and a waste of public funds, suggesting it is motivated by their pro-Palestinian solidarity rather than a legitimate point of law.</p>

Now five games into his NFL career, he describes his mindset of trying to score a touchdown every time he touches the ball. Price, who never scored a return touchdown in college, focuses on meticulously studying punters and tracking the ball's trajectory to position himself for a successful catch and run. He emphasizes maintaining poised feet and an empty mind to execute his role effectively on special teams.</p>

          <p>Gold prices have surged over 50% in the past year, recently surpassing a historic $4,000 an ounce, driven by investor fears of a recession and global market uncertainty. This price spike is creating significant challenges for jewelry companies, who are struggling to absorb the increased cost of the precious metal. Many jewelers, including major retailers like Pandora and smaller brands like Mejuri, are being forced to raise prices or innovate with alternative materials, such as gold-plating or lower-karat gold, to maintain affordability for consumers.

          <p>The world's leading rugby unions, including England, New Zealand, and South Africa, have jointly announced that players who sign with the new globe-trotting R360 competition will be ineligible for international selection. The unions expressed concerns that the proposed for-profit league would fragment the sport, neglect player welfare, and undermine investment in community rugby. This unified stance deals a significant blow to R360's recruitment efforts, as the ability to continue a Test career was a key selling point for potential players.</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7th Hamas attack, data reveals the catastrophic impact of the ensuing war on Gaza's 2.1 million Palestinian residents. Approximately 11% of the population has been killed or injured, with nearly everyone displaced and over 80% of buildings damaged or destroyed. Widespread food shortages have led to famine conditions, while the healthcare system has collapsed under Israeli attacks and supply restrictions. The figures paint a grim picture of a territory transformed by conflict, with a severe and ongoing humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Thoma Bravo co-founder Orlando Bravo has stated that valuations for artificial intelligence companies are currently "at a bubble," drawing comparisons to the dot-com boom. He cautioned that it is unsustainable to value a company with $50 million in recurring revenue at $10 billion, noting the immense pressure this places on management to generate massive cash flow. However, Bravo highlighted a crucial distinction from the past: the current AI boom is being financed by large, established companies with healthy balance sheets, providing a more stable foundation than the venture capital-fueled dot-com era.

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of denying back pay to some furloughed federal employees once the government shutdown ends, a move that appears to contradict a 2019 law. A draft memo from the Office of Management and Budget argues that congressional action is required to enact back pay, despite the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act which was intended to make it automatic. President Trump stated it would depend "on who we're talking about," suggesting a selective approach that adds another layer of uncertainty and pressure for federal workers impacted by the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a case brought by a Colorado counselor challenging the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, arguing it infringes on her free speech rights. The central issue is whether the law regulates professional conduct, which states are permitted to do, or censors specific viewpoints in conversations between therapists and clients. Colorado defends the law as a necessary regulation to protect minors from a harmful and ineffective practice, while the counselor claims it unconstitutionally prevents her from helping young patients align their identity with their personal goals.</p>

However, the WTO sharply downgraded its outlook for 2026, predicting growth will slow to just 0.5% as the global economy cools and the full impact of higher trade tariffs is felt across international markets.

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is scheduled to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss the ongoing trade war between the two countries. The meeting comes after the Trump administration imposed a 35% tariff on most Canadian goods, prompting retaliatory measures from Canada, although some exemptions were later made. Tensions have been high, with Carney previously rejecting Trump's proposal for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, firmly stating that "Canada is not for sale."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Reasons for High US Prescription Drug Prices Amid New Trump Policy Push</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The high cost of prescription drugs in the United States remains a major political issue, with President Trump recently announcing a deal with Pfizer for lower prices and a new government website for direct purchases. Unlike other developed nations that negotiate drug prices for their entire population through national health systems, the U.S. has a fragmented market of private and public insurers, which limits its bargaining power. This system, combined with a desire for access to all available drugs, prevents the U.S. from implementing the kind of value assessments that allow other countries to secure significantly lower prices.</p>

          <p>As consumer debt and default rates rise, it is important for borrowers to understand their rights during the debt collection process, which are protected under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). These rights include freedom from harassment, meaning collectors cannot use abusive language or call at unreasonable hours. Borrowers also have the right to demand and dispute information, forcing collectors to provide verification of the debt. Finally, consumers have the right to control communication and can demand in writing that a collector cease all contact.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has announced plans to match U.S. tariffs by doubling levies on steel imports to 50% and slashing duty-free quotas by nearly half. The move is intended to protect the EU's steel industry from a global glut, particularly from China, and to encourage negotiations with the U.S. for a "metals alliance." However, the proposal has been labeled an "existential threat" by the UK steel industry, as the EU is its primary export market, and it now faces the risk of being shut out and flooded with steel diverted from other markets.

          <p>Consumers may notice that new Halloween candy offerings this year are lighter on chocolate, a trend driven by a global cocoa bean shortage that has caused prices to skyrocket. Major manufacturers like Hershey's and Ferrara are introducing alternative flavors such as pumpkin spice, cinnamon, and salted caramel, or swapping chocolate coatings for vanilla cream. This "cocoa cutting" allows companies to innovate and appeal to consumer demand for novelty while also mitigating the financial risk of relying on the volatile cocoa market. The industry is also leaning more heavily on non-chocolate options like gummies.</p>
