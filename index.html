          <p>A massive Russian attack on Kyiv resulted in at least nine deaths and dozens of injuries, including children, prompting President Zelenskyy to cut short his South Africa trip and return to Ukraine. The attack, involving cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic weapons, targeted residential areas and critical infrastructure. This escalation occurs amidst White House pressure on Zelenskyy to consider a peace plan potentially involving ceding land to Russia, while former President Trump accuses Zelenskyy of prolonging the conflict. The strike underscores the ongoing volatility and human cost of the war despite diplomatic efforts. Optimism surrounding peace negotiations has significantly diminished. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is curtailing his visit to South Africa following a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv, underscoring the severity of the situation in Ukraine. He will return to Kyiv after meeting with the South African president, while his Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha will continue meetings to brief leaders on the situation. South Africa's recent support of a UN resolution reaffirming Ukraine's sovereignty marks a shift from its previous ambiguous stance on Russia's invasion. This visit was intended to foster peaceful resolution efforts, but the recent attacks have heightened tensions and necessitated Zelenskyy's immediate return.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce stated that there are no ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., contradicting recent indications from the White House about easing tensions. A spokesperson emphasized that the U.S. must first cancel all unilateral tariffs on China for talks to progress, echoing the sentiment that China is willing to negotiate only if treated as an equal. This firm stance follows the U.S. imposing 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, which prompted retaliatory measures from Beijing, including restrictions on critical minerals exports. The situation underscores the continued trade friction between the two nations despite some hopes for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to South Africa signifies improved relations between the two nations, aiming to counter Russia's influence in Africa.

The timing of the visit is crucial for both countries, as South Africa also faces pressure from the Trump administration, leading both nations to seek new international alliances. However, the visit was disrupted by a Russian air strike on Kyiv, forcing Zelenskyy to cut short his trip.</p>

The company's overall weakness was driven by declining sales in Asia, North America, and Europe, prompting Kering to increase vigilance amidst macroeconomic headwinds.

          <p>Ex-President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has been indicted on bribery charges, continuing a pattern of criminal investigations against former leaders in the country.

          <p>Japan will implement a revised road traffic law in April 2026, imposing fines for minor traffic violations by cyclists, such as using a mobile phone or ignoring traffic lights. Police will issue 'blue tickets' for over 100 violations, allowing offenders to pay a fine and avoid indictment. The move aims to reduce accidents involving cyclists, particularly after a rise in bicycle commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic. The revised law also requires cyclists to keep to the left and vehicles to pass bicycles safely.</p>
