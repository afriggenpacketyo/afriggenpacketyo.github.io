          <p>A manhunt is underway for seven inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail by breaching a wall behind a toilet. Authorities believe the escape was aided by defective locks and outside help. One of the escapees, Derrick Groves, was arrested for murder in 2018, causing fear among the victim's family who have gone into hiding. Three of the ten escapees have been recaptured, and authorities have increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of the remaining fugitives, with multiple agencies collaborating on the search. The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office released security video of the escape, revealing that the inmates taunted the guards with obscene messages after they escaped.</p>

          <p>Storm systems swept across the midwestern US, resulting in at least 27 fatalities in Missouri and Kentucky, with Kentucky bearing the brunt of the casualties due to a mass casualty event caused by a tornado. The storms, part of a larger weather system, spawned over two dozen tornadoes in several states, leaving hundreds of thousands without power and bringing a heatwave to Texas. Rescuers are continuing their search for survivors in the damaged areas, particularly in Laurel County, Kentucky, where the tornado struck late Friday. The storms also hit after staffing cuts at National Weather Service offices, though Kentucky's governor said he didn't believe alerts were affected.</p>

The attacks have resulted in numerous casualties and severe shortages of essential supplies, with hospitals struggling to provide care. Despite the escalation, negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue in Qatar, though a senior Hamas source said no progress has been made due to Israeli intransigence.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration's policy of granting refugee status to White South Africans, saying it aligns with the U.S.'s role as a beacon for the oppressed. The policy has drawn controversy, with critics questioning the claim of genocide against white farmers in South Africa. President Trump signed an executive order in February directing his government to halt aid to South Africa, alleging a genocide is underway. Rubio said there is evidence of murders and forced removals of properties based on race, prompting the U.S. to offer refuge, and indicated that more arrivals may be expected.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator Chris Murphy has criticized Donald Trump‚Äôs acceptance of a $400 million Boeing jet from Qatar, calling it the ‚Äúdefinition of corruption.‚Äù Republicans have joined in the criticism, with Senator Rand Paul raising concerns about a conflict of interest, and former Vice President Mike Pence pointing out Qatar's history of financing terrorism. Trump has defended his decision, stating it would be "stupid" to refuse the offer, and claimed the jet would serve as the new Air Force One and be donated to his presidential library. Pence said Trump should turn down the offer.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Ari Aster discusses his new film "Eddington," a paranoid thriller set in a New Mexican town during the pandemic, which has divided opinions at Cannes. Aster explains that the film explores the feeling of living in a world where no one agrees on what is happening and the loss of a shared reality. He describes the film as a horror of free-floating political anxiety, reflecting a sense of powerlessness and despair in the face of societal issues. Aster emphasizes that he wanted to create a film about the environment and the tension between the idealism and reality of America.</p>

          <p>Dermatologists advise against storing razors in the shower due to the moist environment promoting bacterial growth and rust, which can lead to skin irritation and infections. Wet razor handles have been found to harbor millions of bacteria, and contaminated blades can cause inflamed razor bumps or folliculitis. Instead, it's recommended to rinse and dry razors thoroughly after use, storing them in a dry place outside the bathroom or in a closed cabinet. Applying after-shave lotion and moisturizer can further prevent skin infections, and razor blades should be replaced every five to seven shaves or sooner if rust or roughness is noticed.</p>
