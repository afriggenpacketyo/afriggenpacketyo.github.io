          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling by more than half compared to the previous year and missing market expectations. The decline is primarily attributed to a severe slump in its memory chip business, which saw its operating profit plunge by over 93%. Despite the downturn in semiconductors, the company's mobile division performed well, with robust sales of its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones. Samsung plans to focus on high-demand AI-driven products and advanced semiconductors in the latter half of the year to regain momentum.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a comprehensive trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% tariff on most South Korean exports to the U.S., a reduction from a threatened 25%. The agreement also includes a commitment from South Korea for $350 billion in U.S. investments and the purchase of $100 billion in American energy products. However, there appears to be a discrepancy between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and purpose of the investment funds. The deal aims to address the U.S. trade deficit while strengthening industrial cooperation between the two allied nations.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Trump's Tariffs Increasing Government Revenue While Widening Trade Deficit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:31:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Verify analysis reveals the complex impacts of the Trump administration's new tariffs on the U.S. economy. While the import taxes have significantly boosted government revenue to its highest level since 1934, they have paradoxically widened the U.S. trade deficit as companies stockpiled goods to avoid the duties. The tariffs have notably reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but Chinese firms appear to be redirecting trade to other partners. Economists are now observing early signs of these tariffs contributing to rising consumer prices on certain imported goods in the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, holding it between 4.25% and 4.5% amidst continued pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a reduction, a rare occurrence signaling a potential shift in policy. Policymakers cited concerns over how new tariffs and tax cuts will affect the economy, noting that inflation remains above their 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized a cautious approach, stating there is a long way to go before the full impact of the tariffs is clear.</p>

The collision occurred when a Ford F-150 crossed the center line and struck their Chevrolet Silverado, causing both vehicles to catch fire just one week after their wedding. The mother, Macey, survived and was taken to a hospital burn unit. The driver of the other vehicle also died at the scene, and police are investigating the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of Congress has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging it is illegally blocking their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers.

This legal action follows several incidents where lawmakers were denied entry to facilities. The lawsuit seeks a court order to grant members of Congress unfettered access to inspect the conditions in which immigrants are being held.</p>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, this article explains the science of how these powerful waves are generated. A tsunami typically requires a strong underwater earthquake, at least a magnitude 6.5 to 7, that causes vertical movement of the seafloor. The quake's proximity to the surface and the coast are also critical factors. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use a network of deep-ocean pressure sensors and coastal tide gauges to detect tsunamis and predict their arrival time and potential height, offering crucial time for evacuation.</p>

The Chinese-led research team found fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not powered by sunlight but by chemicals like methane seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest that such "chemosynthetic" communities may be more widespread in the deep ocean than previously thought.</p>

The growth was largely driven by a sharp drop in imports, a statistical quirk related to the implementation of new tariffs, rather than a fundamental surge in domestic production.

          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly little widespread tsunami damage. Scientists explain that the location and directionality of the quake were key factors in this best-case scenario outcome. The main energy of the resulting tsunami was projected into a relatively empty stretch of the open Pacific Ocean, between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate before reaching populated coastlines. This contrasts sharply with other major quakes, like the 2011 Japan event, where the energy was focused directly at land.</p>

He noted that while a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth argue against a rate cut, other factors like persistently high housing costs and signs of weakening consumer spending create a case for one. Cramer believes the Fed is reluctant to act prematurely and risk a resurgence of inflation, especially with the unclear impact of tariffs. He concluded that the market's negative reaction was due to the Fed not signaling that future rate cuts were inevitable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial outlook after suspending it due to uncertainty over U.S. auto tariffs. The new guidance, which anticipates adjusted earnings between $6.5 and $7.5 billion, now incorporates an estimated $2 billion net negative impact from the import duties. The company reported second-quarter revenue that beat expectations but also recorded a small net loss related to a major vehicle recall. Ford's "Model e" electric vehicle division continued to post significant losses, while its "Pro" commercial business remained a strong growth engine for the automaker.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered the Trump administration to explain why it has not followed his previous orders to restore operations at Voice of America (VOA), the U.S. government-funded news outlet. Judge Royce Lamberth accused the administration of providing "cagey answers" and suggested it may be trying to "run out the clock" on the fiscal year to waste the $260 million Congress appropriated for VOA. The agency has been largely non-operational since March after a Trump-appointed adviser oversaw the dismissal of most of its staff, in a move she called dismantling a "bloated bureaucracy."</p>

His cash-only, no-substitutions shack became a pilgrimage site for food lovers and an inspiration for a new generation of restaurateurs.

          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin, in which he alleged malicious prosecution by state officials regarding the fatal 2021 "Rust" film set shooting. Baldwin had sued prosecutors and sheriff's deputies after the involuntary manslaughter charge against him was dropped last year due to the state withholding potential evidence. The judge dismissed Baldwin's civil suit this week, citing a lack of significant action in the case over the past six months. This ruling comes as legal proceedings related to the on-set death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins are largely concluding.</p>

          <p>This article explores a shift in television trends away from "comfort TV" and towards hyperrealistic, anxiety-inducing shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt." These series use techniques like real-time storytelling and single-take sequences to immerse viewers in the high-stakes, stressful environments of their characters. Psychologists suggest this "vicarious stress" can be satisfying for audiences, as it provides a risk-free thrill and feels more relatable than fantastical escapism. The trend reflects a potential viewer appetite for stories that acknowledge the mundane, day-to-day pressures of modern work and life, offering a form of catharsis.</p>

          <p>An Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas has publicly criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state. The former hostage, who was abducted on October 7, argued that the move "risks rewarding terror" and sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy. She expressed concern that making recognition conditional on a ceasefire could disincentivize Hamas from agreeing to a deal and releasing the remaining hostages. Her statement adds a deeply personal and critical perspective to the recent diplomatic shifts by the UK, France, and Canada.</p>

          <p>A technical failure in the UK's air traffic control system caused significant disruption for air passengers, grounding thousands of flights and leading to over 150 cancellations. The "radar-related" issue at the NATS control center in Hampshire lasted only 20 minutes but created a massive backlog at major airports like Heathrow and Manchester. This is the second major outage for NATS in two years, prompting criticism and calls for an investigation into the system's reliability. Airlines apologized for the disruption, which was outside their control, and worked to clear the backlog of delayed flights.</p>

Supporters of the new U.S. policy argue it is necessary for energy independence and to counter China's dominance in clean technology manufacturing and critical mineral supply chains. However, critics warn that this strategic shift could cede American leadership in the global clean energy transition to Beijing. The move prioritizes short-term economic and security goals at the potential expense of long-term climate targets and competitiveness in the rapidly growing renewables sector.</p>
