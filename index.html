          <p>China has responded to President Trump's accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement by claiming that the U.S. is undermining the consensus. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that the U.S. has been provoking trade frictions and increasing instability through export restrictions and visa revocations, which seriously undermine the Geneva deal. China vows to take measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues its actions. Stephen Olson from the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore notes that Beijing is comfortable taking a firm stance, understanding that any deal with the U.S. will only provide short-term peace. Optimism is dimmed due to the escalating tensions and lack of trust between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This plan represents the first large-scale effort to provide reparations for the atrocity, which decimated the Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street." The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives. The goal is to revitalize the affected community and provide restorative justice for the descendants of the victims. This marks a significant step towards acknowledging and rectifying the historical injustices suffered by the Black community in Tulsa.</p>

          <p>Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the votes, marking a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, supporting traditional Catholic and family values while advocating for Polish sovereignty within the EU. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Trzaskowski favoring closer ties with Germany and France. The result is likely to re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition.</p>

The new company, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both Soul Patts and Brickworks, with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger aims to simplify the structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. The investors clearly approve of this move as it simplifies the odd structure that saw both companies trade at a discount to their peers.</p>

About 320 tons of fin whale meat were unloaded at Sendai port, with some to be transported to markets across the country. The Japanese Fisheries Agency added fin whales to the list of commercial whaling target species in 2024, setting a catch quota of 60 for the year.

The Venezuelan economy is projected to contract, and the minimum wage is critically low, with the government facing dwindling support from its allies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students are being warned about potential subject "cold spots" as universities cut courses due to financial challenges, with a government review underway to address higher education funding. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is supporting collaboration where possible to mitigate the impact of course closures. A Universities UK report suggests greater collaboration could help institutions cut costs and improve efficiency. There is a risk of limited opportunities for students to study desired subjects in their home cities, which would require universities to look at which subjects they recruit the fewest students for and come to an agreement to prevent these cold spots.</p>

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to implement measures to prevent children in temporary accommodation from going "missing" from schools and GPs, after widespread displacement of families across the country. A new report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, with families being displaced due to a lack of affordable housing. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation, aiming to address the critical needs of these vulnerable children.</p>

The law, intended to increase black ownership of land, has been opposed by some who fear it threatens property rights. The government maintains that compensation will be paid in most cases and that the law is needed to address historical imbalances. The law could lead to the expropriation of land that is not being used or has been abandoned, but productive agricultural land is unlikely to be affected, although it is still in its early stages.</p>
