          <p>The Trump administration has deployed numerous federal agents across Washington D.C. to address what the president has termed a crisis of crime and homelessness. On social media, President Trump announced a crackdown, demanding homeless individuals move out immediately and promising a tougher stance on criminals, despite official data showing a decline in the city's crime rates. The visible but limited presence of agents has caused confusion among residents and anxiety within homeless encampments. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has acknowledged the president's concerns while highlighting ongoing improvements in the city.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has declared its plan to officially recognize a Palestinian state during the upcoming UN General Assembly in September. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated the decision aligns with similar moves by the UK, France, and Canada, emphasizing that a two-state solution is the best path toward peace in the Middle East. The recognition is contingent on commitments from the Palestinian Authority that Hamas will not be involved in a future state. This move has drawn criticism from Israel, which views such recognition as a "reward for terrorism."</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented agreement, chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD will pay 15% of their revenue from specific semiconductor sales in China to the U.S. government. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for advanced AI chips, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted due to national security concerns. The move highlights the significant financial costs associated with navigating escalating tech trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. This development occurs amid broader efforts to ease trade frictions, including a temporary truce in the tariff war. (not investment advice)</p>

The women, Sherri Brun and Camille Tate, claim they were "forgotten about" at the gate while other passengers were rebooked onto an earlier flight, highlighting a failure in communication for passengers with disabilities. Southwest Airlines disputed the claim that they were forgotten, stating the women were on their originally scheduled flight, which operated late.

          <p>The UK government is considering significant changes to driving laws in England and Wales, including mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 every three years. The proposed road safety strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These measures follow a coroner's report that criticized the UK's self-reporting system for vision as the "laxest in Europe" after a fatal accident.

          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, scientists explain that newly formed black holes emit a unique form of "music" as they settle into a stable shape. This phenomenon occurs when a new black hole, created from a collapsed star or a merger, sheds its initial irregularities and is molded by its own immense gravity. The resulting gravitational waves create a pure, predictable ringing that reflects the black hole's mass and spin. This process demonstrates the mathematical perfection of these celestial objects, as their final form is precisely determined by general relativity.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (approximately US$501) annually for each child under three years old. The policy is expected to have a more significant economic impact in less affluent regions where the subsidy represents a larger portion of household income. For example, the payment constitutes over 13.5% of an average resident's annual income in Gansu province, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. Analysts believe this financial support could help stimulate consumption and modestly increase birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour title in over two years by winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic playoff against American JJ Spaun. The 45-year-old won on the third sudden-death hole after both players parred and then birdied the 18th hole on their first two attempts. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke behind, tied for third. Rose's win marks his 12th PGA Tour title and makes him the first player in his 40s to win on the tour this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates compared to available vacancies. The plan aims to simplify regulations, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to open. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the initiative but stated its success will depend on whether graduates can actually secure jobs. This move comes as health unions and the government are in a dispute over a recent pay award for NHS staff.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified the gunman who opened fire on the CDC headquarters in Atlanta as Patrick Joseph White, a 30-year-old man who was reportedly fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. White, who was killed during the incident, first killed DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose before being found deceased himself. According to a law enforcement official, White's father had contacted police, stating his son blamed the vaccine for his depression. A union representing CDC workers condemned the violence, linking it to the vilification of scientists and demanding federal officials publicly denounce vaccine misinformation.</p>

          <p>In the Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory over the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance strengthened his case for the backup role. Lance demonstrated his mobility by rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown, complementing his 55 passing yards. His performance is closing the gap with Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The Chargers' defense also shined, with undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, and edge rusher Caleb Murphy recording two sacks, boosting their chances of making the final roster.</p>

          <p>The rapidly growing Lee Fire in western Colorado, now the sixth-largest in state history, has forced the evacuation of a correctional facility. All 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center were safely relocated as the blaze charred over 167 square miles with minimal containment. Over a thousand firefighters are battling the fire, which is being fueled by gusty winds and dry conditions. While no injuries or structural damage have been reported from this fire, health officials have issued air quality warnings for the region due to heavy smoke from the Lee fire and another nearby blaze.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered an endangered spider monkey hidden in a backpack inside his car. The man, Juan Manuel Valdez, admitted to purchasing the monkey in Mexico and lacked the required permits for its importation. This incident highlights the persistent issue of illegal wildlife trafficking, which threatens endangered species, undermines conservation, and poses risks of disease transmission. Spider monkeys are critically endangered due to habitat loss and the exotic pet trade, and authorities are increasing enforcement to combat such smuggling.</p>

          <p>A 2022 study conducted on mice has suggested a possible link between damaging the internal tissues of the nose and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Griffith University found that the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae, which has been found in human brains affected by dementia, can travel up the olfactory nerve to the brain. In mice, this infection led to the deposit of amyloid-beta protein, a hallmark of Alzheimer's. While the findings are yet to be confirmed in humans, they offer a new avenue for understanding the environmental factors that could contribute to the disease.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers are strongly defending their Texas colleagues who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort, which they label as undemocratic "cheating." Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused Texas Governor Greg Abbott of undermining democracy to benefit his party. The new maps could give Republicans a significant advantage in the U.S. House. In response, Governor Abbott has threatened to have the fleeing Democratic lawmakers arrested upon their return to Texas and has vowed to call continuous special legislative sessions until the matter is resolved.</p>
