          <p>The People's Bank of China has kept its key lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The one-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0% and the five-year rate at 3.5%, a decision that aligned with economists' expectations. This move comes as recent economic data, including slowing retail sales and industrial output, indicate signs of fatigue in the world's second-largest economy, though policymakers appear to be holding off on major stimulus for now.

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and head coach Andy Reid were seen in a heated confrontation on the sideline during their game against the New York Giants. The exchange occurred after a drive stalled in the second quarter, and television cameras captured Reid appearing to bump his shoulder into Kelce as he walked away. Coach Reid downplayed the incident to a sideline reporter, stating the team needed some "juice" and that the emotion was a good thing, echoing a similar public interaction between the two during Super Bowl LVIII.</p>

          <p>China's advanced GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been observed with features suggesting it is being adapted for naval deployment. Recent images show the stealth drone with folding wings, a modification indicating it could be operated from aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This development, combined with the drone's profile appearing on the emblem of a new "drone carrier," suggests the GJ-11 may become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, enhancing China's intelligent warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk were seen meeting and shaking hands at the memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, signaling a potential reconciliation after a very public and acrimonious split. The two, who previously collaborated on a government efficiency initiative, had a falling out over a White House spending bill, leading to months of mutual criticism. Their appearance together at the Arizona event, captured in a photo Musk shared, has fueled speculation about a renewed alliance between the influential figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy destroyed a speedboat carrying a large quantity of cocaine in a joint operation with the Dominican Republic, located about 80 nautical miles south of the nation. Dominican authorities recovered 377 packages of the drug from the vessel, which was allegedly transporting a total of 1,000 kilograms. This military strike is part of a broader U.S. mission to combat drug trafficking in the Caribbean, though such operations have drawn criticism from human rights groups over the use of lethal force.</p>

          <p>A large area of unusually warm sea surface temperatures, known as the "warm blob," has re-emerged in the Pacific Ocean south of Alaska. This marine heat wave, the fourth-largest since 1982, is raising concerns among scientists due to its potential impact on marine ecosystems and weather patterns. A similar event from 2014-2016 caused devastating effects on marine life, and meteorologists warn this anomaly could alter the jet stream, potentially bringing frigid Arctic temperatures to the Eastern United States this winter.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence, regardless of its source. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to focus on shared values over division. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including a firebombing at the governor's mansion, to emphasize that such acts leave lasting scars and must be rejected by all.</p>

          <p>After catching Mike Trout's milestone 400th career home run ball, a fan named Alberto negotiated a unique and memorable exchange with the Angels superstar. In addition to receiving signed memorabilia, Alberto asked if he could play catch with Trout on the field, a request the future Hall of Famer happily granted. The heartwarming moment provided a special memory for the fan and his family, highlighting a positive interaction between a player and the crowd that goes beyond the monetary value of a historic piece of memorabilia.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were crucial in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch with his foot to rob a batter of an extra-base hit after the ball was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed that in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run, securing the win and dealing a blow to the Mets' playoff hopes.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has strengthened into the seventh named hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season. While the storm's center is expected to pass east of Bermuda without a direct hit, it is generating large swells that will affect the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. The National Hurricane Center has warned that these swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions into early next week. The season has been quieter than initially predicted, but this storm serves as a reminder of ongoing risks.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would accept a deal in which North Korea agrees to freeze its nuclear weapons program as an interim measure, rather than demand complete denuclearization immediately. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" given that Pyongyang is producing numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that former President Trump and Kim Jong Un could resume talks, viewing their past relationship as a potential pathway to reducing tensions.</p>

          <p>A group of families in south Wales is fighting to raise awareness for Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), a rare and progressive neurological disorder with no cure. Once thought to primarily affect people of Japanese origin, a "cluster" of cases has been identified in the region, affecting a generation of young people with severe symptoms. Parents are struggling to get diagnoses and support for their children while hoping for progress from clinical trials in the U.S. for the devastating inherited condition.</p>

          <p>Week 3 of the NFL season featured several dramatic finishes, including a wild Philadelphia Eagles victory over the Los Angeles Rams sealed by a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown as time expired. In another improbable ending, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers lost a lead to the New York Jets on a blocked field goal return, only to win on a last-second kick of their own. Elsewhere, the Chicago Bears secured their first win, while several other games across the league came down to the final minutes.</p>
