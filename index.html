          <h2>Chinese Farmer Realizes Childhood Dream by Building Homemade Submarine</h2>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by inventing and building his own seven-meter submarine. Inspired by a television program, the man, who had a lifelong fascination with invention, secretly constructed the vessel using 5,000 yuan (US$700) for steel plates, a battery, and an engine. This project fulfilled a long-held dream of creating machines that were previously beyond his reach in his rural village. The submarine now successfully navigates the local river, a testament to his ingenuity and determination.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will conclude its run in May 2025, a decision host Stephen Colbert revealed during a show taping. The network stated the cancellation is a financial decision unrelated to the show's content or performance, even as it remains a top-rated program. The announcement has sparked skepticism, coming shortly after Colbert criticized parent company Paramount Global and as the company seeks federal approval for a major merger. Critics and political figures have questioned the timing, suggesting potential political motivations behind the move.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following public pressure, President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move comes after reports of a letter from Trump to Epstein surfaced and amid growing calls for transparency from both political parties. While the Justice Department is prepared to file the motion, releasing such documents is rare and requires court approval. Critics argue that releasing only the transcripts would be insufficient, calling for broader evidence like videos and interview notes to be made public.</p>

          <p>Economists in China are urging for increased pro-market reforms following a report showing a drop in the country's marketisation index. The National Economic Research Institute's assessment revealed the index fell to 5.62 out of 10 in 2023, a notable decrease from its peak in 2021. The most significant decline was observed in the subindex measuring government-market relations, indicating increased state intervention in the economy. Researchers have called the change "pretty significant" and are advocating for policy shifts to reverse the trend and address economic imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, faces charges of hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing a small Cessna aircraft and causing a security alert at Vancouver's airport. He allegedly threatened a flight instructor before flying the plane to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble fighter jets. Authorities state the suspect acted with an ideological motive to disrupt airspace, linked to his social media posts about climate change and being a "messenger of Allah."

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The moderation was largely driven by an easing in rice prices after the government released stockpiles, though inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Despite the cooling headline number, economists note that underlying inflationary pressures persist, and the economic outlook is complicated by potential U.S. tariffs and political uncertainty ahead of an upcoming election.

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has clarified that his department is legally obligated to transfer inmates to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when presented with a federal judicial warrant. He emphasized that these warrants, signed by a judge for criminal charges, are distinct from civil detainer requests, which the department does not honor under sanctuary policies. Luna's statement aimed to address community fears amid heightened federal immigration enforcement, assuring residents that his department does not assist ICE in street-level operations and has denied nearly 1,000 civil detainer requests in 2024.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines President Trump's announcement that Coca-Cola will switch from high-fructose corn syrup to "REAL Cane Sugar." The piece argues the move is a political gesture aimed at scoring easy points rather than a meaningful public health victory. While some, like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have praised the change, the analysis notes that cane sugar and corn syrup have nearly identical metabolic effects and are both major contributors to health issues. The author suggests this focus on a specific ingredient is a distraction from the larger problem of high sugar consumption in the American diet.</p>

          <p>A university in Dalian, China, has expelled a female student for "damaging national dignity" after she was accused of having "improper interactions" with a foreign man. The decision has sparked a significant backlash on Chinese social media, with many users questioning the university's authority to police a student's private life and labeling the action as misogynistic and nationalistic. The incident has been linked to videos posted online by a professional Ukrainian gamer showing him with an Asian woman. The university's action has ignited a debate about gender bias and rising nationalism in the country.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning "everything TSA does" and that the size limits for liquids could be the "next big announcement." This follows the recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners at airports, which provide more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

          <p>Members of the U.S. Congress set aside their political differences for the annual Congressional Women's Softball Game, a charity event that raises money for the Young Survival Coalition. Unlike the partisan men's game, the women's event features a single "Team Congress" composed of both Democrats and Republicans playing against a team of journalists. The game was co-founded in 2009 by Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor herself. The event highlights a rare moment of bipartisanship and has successfully raised nearly $5 million for young adults affected by breast cancer.</p>

          <p>A wave of relentless immigration raids since June has profoundly impacted life in Southern California, home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants. The crackdowns have forced many into hiding, afraid to go to work or school, leading to shuttered businesses and canceled community events. The article highlights the chaos and fear gripping communities, contrasting the administration's focus on arresting criminals with the reality that many long-term residents with no criminal records are also being detained. This has created a landscape of anxiety and altered the social fabric of one of the nation's most populous regions.</p>

          <p>A precious ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK for analysis. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, this is the oldest ice ever retrieved and contains frozen air bubbles, dust, and ash from an unknown period of Earth's history. Scientists will carefully melt the core to study its composition, hoping to unlock vital information about past climate cycles and tipping points. The research could revolutionize our understanding of climate change, particularly a mysterious shift in glacial cycles that occurred around one million years ago.</p>

          <p>New UK regulations coming into force next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, aimed at protecting consumers from accumulating excessive debt, means some users may be denied this form of credit. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee the currently unregulated sector, ensuring clearer information, faster refunds, and access to the Financial Ombudsman. While providers' profits may decrease, regulators estimate the rules will save consumers £1.8 billion over 10 years by preventing unaffordable borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

The disclosure followed public speculation after photographs showed the president with swollen legs and a bruised hand. A physician's note stated the condition occurs when leg veins struggle to pump blood back to the heart and confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The White House physician affirmed that the president remains in "excellent health," while attributing his bruised hand to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use.</p>
