          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced upcoming trade-related announcements from the Trump administration, noting foreign officials are rushing to finalize deals before high tariffs resume on August 1st. Despite previous July 9th deadlines, Bessent reiterated the August date, stating new tariff rates would be "pretty standard" unless countries negotiate. The administration suggested a mix of bilateral agreements and unilateral tariff letters would be sent out. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 7% decline following CEO Elon Musk's announcement of plans to form a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to influence key congressional races. Investors expressed concern over Musk's deeper political involvement, especially after his previous work with the "Department of Government Efficiency" and recent public disagreements with President Trump. This political venture adds to existing challenges for Tesla, including a recent drop in car deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid attractive CD interest rates and anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, financial experts are advising savers on whether to choose 1-year or 5-year CD terms. While 1-year CDs offer flexibility for future rate shifts, longer terms can lock in current yields. The optimal choice depends on individual financial goals, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance, with many adopting a "Three Buckets" approach to balance accessibility and long-term returns.
