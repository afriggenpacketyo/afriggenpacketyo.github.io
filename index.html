        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israel and Iran are currently engaged in a high-stakes conflict, with neither nation willing to concede defeat, potentially reshaping the Middle East. For Iran, the Ayatollah Khamenei's regime is facing internal instability and feels compelled to retaliate against Israeli strikes to maintain control. Israel, having faced security breaches, seeks to neutralize Iran's perceived nuclear threat and establish a non-threatening government in Tehran, aiming to restore regional deterrence. While Israel denies seeking regime change, the weakening of Khamenei's regime could lead to instability, and President Trump's contradictory statements add uncertainty to the conflict's resolution. The situation remains volatile, with the potential for significant regional and international consequences.</p>

          <p>Ram Trucks, owned by Stellantis, plans to introduce a new industry-leading warranty for its 2026 vehicle lineup, covering the engine, transmission, and related components for 10 years or 100,000 miles. This warranty replaces the current five-year or 60,000-mile warranty, which is standard for full-size pickup trucks. The decision comes as vehicle prices have increased, leading to longer financing periods. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis emphasizes the need to protect customers' investments with extended coverage, given that most truck buyers finance for seven years or more.</p>

          <p>Analysts are struggling to predict the extent to which the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran could influence oil prices. Israel's recent attack on Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure has led to increased warfare between the two nations. The situation has created a "blanket of unease" in oil markets, as analysts weigh the potential for supply disruptions and direct U.S. involvement. Some analysts suggest that the conflict could lead to a $10 per barrel risk premium, while others believe that the conflict may ultimately lead to lower prices once it is over.

The CDC emphasizes that the MMR vaccine remains the best protection against measles and its complications, noting that symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated individuals.

The article suggests that men's reticence to engage in gossip stems from a fear of appearing "messy" or lacking social credibility.

Despite the saber-rattling, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and may be forced to negotiate, potentially leading to a high-level meeting.

          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are using "tariff engineering" to reduce duty liabilities by altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into different harmonized system codes. This practice involves strategic design choices to create products subject to lower tariff classifications and duty rates. Companies in sectors like fast-moving consumer goods, garments, apparel, and footwear can relatively easily implement tariff engineering, while more heavily regulated sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and electronics face greater challenges due to the need for extensive validation and approval. However, companies must tread a fine line between redesigning products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications.</p>

The federal intervention in the case has created tension with the county attorney's office, which also intends to press forward in state court.

This warning comes as President Trump has signaled that the U.S. may take an active role in the conflict, demanding Iran's "unconditional surrender" and boasting about control of the skies over Iran.
