          <p>A progressive Democratic state representative in Rhode Island, Enrique Sanchez, has generated significant controversy by referring to ICE agents as "Nazi Gestapo thugs." The comments were made on social media while he was defending a known MS-13 gang member who had been arrested in an ICE operation. The gang member, an illegally present Honduran national, has a criminal history including fentanyl trafficking charges. ICE officials and conservative commentators strongly condemned Sanchez's remarks, contrasting his defense of a violent gang member with his inflammatory language against federal law enforcement officers.</p>

          <p>The tenure of FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is reportedly in jeopardy following a heated dispute with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. Bongino, a former rightwing media personality, is said to be considering resignation after clashing with Bondi over the narrative surrounding a supposed list of Epstein's powerful clients, a theory popular in Maga circles. The internal conflict, which has drawn in other high-level officials, highlights a growing rift within the Trump administration and its supporters regarding the lingering fallout from the Epstein scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at China's Dalian University of Technology have developed a new manufacturing technique that could solve long-standing issues with the country's aircraft engines. The method involves rapidly cooling forged turbine discs made of superalloy, a core engine component that must withstand extreme conditions. This innovation could significantly improve the performance, power, and durability of China's domestically produced jet engines, a critical step for the development of its next-generation fighter aircraft and a key area where it has historically lagged behind Western nations.</p>

          <p>A man in Victorville, California, has been arrested after leaving a teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin outside a gas station, prompting a significant emergency response. The object, which was created by a South Carolina artist and sold on Etsy, was determined by the coroner's office not to contain any human remains. Authorities arrested Hector Corona Villanueva for causing a false emergency report and planting evidence, stating that such pranks waste valuable resources and can delay responses to genuine crises.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has formally urged the Supreme Court to deny Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her sex-trafficking conviction. Maxwell's lawyers argue that a co-conspirator clause in Jeffrey Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement (NPA) should have prevented her prosecution in New York. However, the DOJ contends that the Florida-based agreement had no nationwide authority and was not intended to benefit Maxwell, whom they describe as an incidental third party. Victim advocates maintain that Maxwell deserves to remain imprisoned for her horrific crimes.</p>

          <p>For the second year in a row, the number of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles County has decreased, dropping by 4% in the 2025 point-in-time count. Mayor Karen Bass hailed the results as evidence that city and county initiatives, such as encampment resolutions and housing programs, are making progress. While officials and advocates celebrate the positive trend, they also caution that the situation remains a humanitarian crisis that requires sustained and intensified efforts.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, in his new role as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has drawn widespread criticism for his out-of-touch health advice. During a Fox Business interview about major cuts to the Medicaid program, he suggested that Americans should "do the most" to stay healthy and avoid things like carrot cake. His comments, made while presenting the host with a carrot cake, were widely mocked on social media as tone-deaf and simplistic.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Major League Baseball is missing a major opportunity by not having its biggest stars, Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge, participate in the annual Home Run Derby. The author suggests the league should be more flexible with the event's rules to accommodate players' concerns, such as Ohtani's about the physical toll of the current format. Doing so would not only boost viewership but also elevate the profiles of other talented players in the competition.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie, who has notably broken with President Trump on key issues, has reported a strong fundraising haul of over $1.7 million. This financial strength positions him for a challenging re-election bid, as top Trump political aides have launched a super PAC with the explicit goal of unseating him in the 2026 primary. The situation highlights a significant intra-party conflict and a test of Trump's influence over the Republican base.</p>
