        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have agreed to streamline prior authorizations, a process criticized for causing delays and physician burnout. The insurers aim to expedite care access and reduce administrative burdens on providers, implementing changes across commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid plans. These voluntary actions, benefiting 257 million Americans, involve standardized online submissions and real-time responses, potentially impacting insurer profits by increasing care utilization. The industry hopes to modernize the system and improve the patient experience through these changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump posted on social media demanding that "everyone" keep oil prices down, warning that high prices play "into the hands of the enemy."

Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling. In response to the president's comments, U.S. crude oil prices experienced a slight decrease, reflecting market sensitivity to geopolitical events and presidential influence.

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, several tankers initially diverted from the Strait of Hormuz due to rising concerns over potential disruptions. While some vessels have since resumed their course, worries persist due to reports of electronic interference and GPS jamming. The recent collision between two tankers near the strait and increasing insurance costs have further heightened anxieties among vessel owners. Geopolitical instability could escalate if Iran, feeling cornered, decides to inflict economic pain on the world, potentially disrupting oil supplies. The current situation reflects a delicate balance as China condemns the U.S. attack but has not offered Iran tangible support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As home equity loan interest rates settle around 8.23% in 2025, experts caution homeowners against taking on excessive debt. While tapping into home equity may seem tempting, especially compared to higher credit card or personal loan rates, it's crucial to assess your debt-to-income ratio, credit score, and home equity. A high DTI ratio, low credit score, limited home equity, unstable income, or lack of an emergency fund are red flags. Before borrowing, experts advise improving your financial position by paying down high-interest debt and building an emergency fund, ensuring you don't put your home at risk.

Cooper cited the group's "long history of unacceptable criminal damage" and the need to protect national security.

          <p>Following U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, analysts believe China is unlikely to directly intervene in the escalating conflict.

While Iran's military has threatened consequences for the U.S., China's focus remains on maintaining regional stability and protecting its economic interests.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, experts are considering potential Iranian responses, ranging from closing the Strait of Hormuz to striking a new nuclear deal with the United States. Sanam Vakil of Chatham House suggests Iran's goals would be to inflict pain, transfer war costs, and showcase resilience. Options include attacking U.S. personnel or interests in the Middle East or beyond, or accelerating efforts to develop nuclear weapons. Another possibility is Iran striking a new nuclear deal with the U.S. to ensure the regime's survival, though this seems unlikely given current conditions.</p>

The strait connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil daily. Iran's control over the northern side makes it a crucial chokepoint. Disruptions could severely impact global energy markets, affecting countries like China, India, Japan, and South Korea.

          <p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the administration is confident that U.S. airstrikes "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities. Leavitt addressed questions about the damage at the Fordo site, one of three facilities attacked by U.S. bombers and cruise missiles. She asserted that the strikes targeted the location where Iran's enriched uranium was stored. Leavitt emphasized that Iran no longer has the capability to build a nuclear weapon and threaten the world.</p>

Despite these challenges, the US cannot afford to isolate India in countering China's rise in the Indo-Pacific region, with India hosting the 2025 Quad Summit.</p>
