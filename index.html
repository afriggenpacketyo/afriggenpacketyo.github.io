          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the need for police forces to embrace change and modernization in light of ongoing funding negotiations between the Home Office and the Treasury. Kyle highlighted that all sectors of society are facing financial pressures and that the government has already provided an additional Â£1 billion to the police. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns about potential cuts to police numbers, while other political figures debated welfare reform and environmental spending. The negotiations will determine departmental spending for the next three to four years, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves warning that not all departments will receive their desired funding. </p>

          <p>Senator Ron Johnson has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's spending bill, arguing that it doesn't go far enough in cutting government waste and reducing the national debt. Johnson insists on returning spending to pre-pandemic levels, which would entail trillions of dollars in deeper cuts than the House GOP proposed. Despite pressure from Trump, Johnson remains steadfast in his position and is prepared to vote against the bill unless significant changes are made. He criticizes the House's approach as mere rhetoric and slogans, emphasizing the need for lawmakers to understand the country's grim fiscal situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, insists that the party is stable despite chairman Zia Yusuf's initial resignation and subsequent return in a different role. Tice explained that Yusuf was exhausted from the demanding job and that the party is reorganizing to better manage its growth. Yusuf's initial decision to quit followed criticism of a Reform MP's question about banning the burka. The party expects to appoint a new chairman and deputy chairman next week.</p>

Initiatives include calls for tech-free classes, the formation of a "Luddite Club," and professors limiting electronic devices in their classrooms. The effort reflects a broader trend of questioning the pervasiveness of technology in higher education, particularly at small residential liberal-arts colleges.
