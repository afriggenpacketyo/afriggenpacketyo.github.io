          <p>This article recounts the story of Julie Moore, an Army wife who revolutionized how the U.S. military informs families of service member deaths. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for a more dignified approach. She arranged with Western Union to receive telegrams herself, personally delivering the news and providing support to grieving widows. Her efforts led to the current protocol where service members notify families in person, offering comfort and assistance during a difficult time; in 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor Julie and her husband Hal.</p>

          <p>A biologically male transgender athlete has qualified for the California girls' track and field state championship in long jump and triple jump, sparking controversy and a federal investigation. The athlete's success has led to accusations of unfair competition, with one parent stating that female athletes are losing opportunities. The California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) is under scrutiny for allowing the athlete to compete and for allegedly suppressing protests. The U.S. Department of Education is investigating CIF for potentially violating federal civil rights law, while the school district maintains it is following state law and CIF policy regarding gender identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mumbai's beloved pav bread, a staple for the working class, is at risk due to a government plan to ban wood-fired bakeries to combat pollution. A study claimed these bakeries contribute significantly to air pollution, but critics argue they are a minor source compared to construction and traffic. Bakers fear switching to cleaner fuels like natural gas or electricity will raise prices, impacting the poor who rely on affordable pav. The wood-fired baking method is also considered essential to the bread's unique smoky flavor and cultural heritage, making the potential ban a complex issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump is strategically dismantling American democratic institutions by turning them against themselves. The author posits that Trump's actions are not random but a calculated effort to reverse-engineer the safeguards designed to prevent authoritarianism. By exploiting legal loopholes, polarizing institutions, and undermining the social contract, Trump aims to create a new social order that deviates significantly from liberal democratic principles. The article suggests that resisting Trump requires a fundamental rewiring of democracy through local activism, civil disobedience, and social mobilization.</p>

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, has undergone an eighth sea trial, according to state media reports. The trial included tests and flights of its ship-borne fifth-generation J-35 stealth fighters, which are designed for catapult launch. The Fujian is the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Armyâ€™s third carrier and the first to be equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults, which will greatly enhance the Chinese navy's abilities in offshore defense and long-distance sea escort operations once it enters service. Traffic control warnings were issued for the area near the mouth of the Yangtze River as the Fujian left the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai.</p>

          <p>A debate has erupted among Democratic policy experts over the "abundance agenda," a set of reforms aimed at streamlining bureaucracy and boosting housing and infrastructure development. Supporters argue it can unlock prosperity and solidify the liberal coalition, while critics fear it's a corporate-aligned effort to undermine progressive values. The agenda challenges the power of activist groups that have shaped the Democratic Party's direction, offering moderate Democrats a distinct identity. The debate centers on the very nature and purpose of the Democratic Party and who should have the authority to guide it.</p>

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election to select a governor and legislators for Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of Guyana, escalating a long-standing territorial dispute. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is using the election to galvanize nationalistic sentiment and bolster support amid domestic discontent and concerns about military loyalty. The move has been criticized as an attempt to divert attention from Venezuela's internal political and economic issues, while Guyana has tightened border security and warned against supporting the election. The International Court of Justice is currently addressing the dispute, further complicating the situation.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Public Expects Rice Prices to Decrease with New Farm Minister, Poll Shows</h2>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister. This expectation comes after the previous minister's dismissal due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a target lower than what Prime Minister Ishiba has pledged. The new minister plans to sell government stockpiles directly to retailers, aiming to make rice available at 2,000 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

Travel advisors report that clients are increasingly worried about potential economic downturns, the treatment of Americans abroad, and government policies. This has led to a drop in summer bookings, particularly to popular European destinations, as travelers adopt a wait-and-see approach. The shift is creating opportunities for last-minute deals and more domestic road trips.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara is working to implement police reform and improve community relations. O'Hara is focused on reducing crime and building trust, despite ongoing challenges such as officer shortages and high crime rates. Reform efforts include adjusting arrest tactics, enhancing officer training, and increasing community engagement. The Justice Department has ended its investigation of the department, but O'Hara is committed to continuing reform efforts.</p>
