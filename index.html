        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Trump's tax bill, including trillions in tax breaks, though the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) remains a point of contention. The House Ways and Means Committee passed the legislation, but some lawmakers are pushing for a higher SALT limit than the proposed $30,000 for those with incomes under $400,000. The current $10,000 SALT cap was implemented to fund the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The full House vote is expected soon, but the bill faces potential changes in the Senate (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>India has asserted its technological advantage over Pakistan's weaponry, specifically referencing Chinese defense systems used by Pakistan during recent clashes. India claims its Air Force successfully bypassed and jammed Pakistan's Chinese-supplied air defense systems during Operation Sindoor. The operation was launched in response to the killing of tourists in Kashmir, an attack India blames on Pakistan. While a ceasefire has been agreed upon, India describes it as a temporary pause. The statement also mentioned that Indian forces targeted air defense radars and systems in Pakistan, including one in Lahore.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that Israeli strikes in northern Gaza resulted in dozens of Palestinian casualties, including children, as Israel threatens to intensify its military campaign. Palestinian health officials stated that over 50 bodies were brought to the Indonesian Hospital, while Gaza's health ministry reported approximately 70 deaths without specifying locations. An Israeli military spokesman had warned of an impending attack in northern Gaza, citing militant rocket fire. The Trump administration is attempting to mediate an end to the 18-month war, which has caused significant casualties and brought Gaza to the brink of starvation.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have secured a $96 billion agreement to sell Qatar Airways up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines. The White House announced the deal, calling it Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order. The agreement was struck during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the deal will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million total domestic jobs over the course of production and delivery. The deal could also draw more scrutiny toward Trump's acceptance, and defense, of Qatar's offer to gift the U.S. a luxury 747 jet that will act as the new Air Force One.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are again targeting Medicaid, proposing changes that include work requirements and increased cost-sharing for enrollees. A GOP proposal would require many enrollees to prove they are working, volunteering, or studying, and to shoulder more of the costs of their care. This effort to cut Medicaid costs is driven by a desire to offset the cost of extending tax cuts passed in 2017. However, the GOP's latest effort toward a massive transformation could be more of a long shot, several health policy experts say. Medicaid enrollment has surged to a record high, with the COVID-19 pandemic driving numbers up and nine more states expanding the program to cover more low-income Americans, including six controlled by Republicans.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details how shipments arriving in the United States from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800 could face 54 percent tariffs. President Trump closed a loophole that had allowed inexpensive Chinese goods to be mailed to the United States without tariffs. The change follows a temporary truce in trade tensions between the United States and China. The de minimis exemption, which previously allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the United States without import duties, had enabled Chinese companies to ship goods directly to American shoppers, angering American businesses.</p>

This move coincides with a wave of bills aiming to restrict the use of fluoride, which has long been added to public water supplies to prevent cavities. The FDA will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by October 31, citing potential health risks that some experts argue are not based in rigorous research.

          <p>A new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) indicates that the gap between what Americans earn and what they need to achieve a basic standard of living is growing. For the bottom 60% of U.S. households, a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach, according to the group. These households, which in 2023 earned an average of $38,000 per year, would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index. From 2001 to 2023, the cost of affording what amounts to a basic level of economic security doubled, according to LISEP's analysis.</p>

          <p>Six children were allegedly tortured by their foster parents and another adult at a Victorville home, with some of the abuse going back at least a decade, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. Authorities arrested Kenneth and Tina Key, both 60 years old, and their daughter Katlynn Key, 23, on suspicion of torture. The foster children at the home ranged in age from 5 to 16. Some of the alleged abuse may have been going on since the children were first placed into the Keys’ home, going back at least 10 years.</p>

He suggested Boeing should lease another plane to the president, even if it's the Qatari jet, to remove any implication that the U.S. is receiving a gift.

Khan Suri was among several individuals legally studying in the US who have been targeted by the Trump administration for their pro-Palestinian activism. Immigration officials revoked his J-1 student visa, alleging his father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, was an adviser to Hamas officials more than a decade ago in addition to claims that he was “deportable” because of his posts on social media in support of Palestine. The judge prohibited federal officials in March from deporting the postdoctoral fellow after his wife filed an emergency court request to prevent deportation.</p>
