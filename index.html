          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located on a volcano in Hawaii, has achieved a significant milestone by capturing a highly detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this tool will enhance their ability to predict solar storms, which can disrupt radio communications and electrical grids on Earth. The National Solar Observatory (NSO) hailed the VTF as the 'heart' of the telescope, emphasizing its potential to answer critical questions in solar physics and mitigate the impact of geomagnetic disturbances. The construction of the telescope faced protests from native Hawaiians due to its placement on sacred land.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against Colorado and Denver, challenging state and city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit targets policies such as restrictions on holding individuals based solely on civil immigration detainers and prohibitions on sharing information with federal immigration authorities. The administration argues that these policies impede federal immigration actions and endanger residents by providing safe havens for criminals. Colorado officials maintain that the state is not a sanctuary and cooperates with law enforcement, while Denver officials emphasize the need to protect sensitive locations from immigration enforcement.</p>

The author advocates for a balanced approach to psychiatric medications, acknowledging both benefits and trade-offs, and warns against ceding the conversation to those who exploit patient suffering for political gain.</p>
