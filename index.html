          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has announced the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique, performed on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient, reportedly helped him regain some limb movement. Unlike Elon Musk's Neuralink, which requires cranial surgery, this approach involves inserting a stent electrode through a neck vein into the brain's vascular network. The procedure is said to reduce surgical risks and significantly shorten the patient's recovery time, marking a potential new direction for BCI technology.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 people in a vast, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The indictment alleges the group stole personal information from over a million Medicare recipients to file fraudulent claims for medical equipment that was never actually provided. While the attempted fraud was in the billions, Medicare paid out approximately $41 million, with supplemental insurers losing an estimated $900 million between 2022 and 2024. The organization allegedly laundered its proceeds through international shell companies and cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue negotiations over tariffs, with a key deadline looming in early July when a 90-day pause on certain U.S. levies is set to expire. Discussions in Washington between Japan's top negotiator and the U.S. Commerce Secretary were described as "fruitful," though significant differences reportedly remain, particularly concerning tariffs on Japan's automotive industry. The Trump administration has suggested the pause could be extended, but has also maintained a hardline stance, creating uncertainty for Japanese exporters who face a potential total tariff rate of 24 percent.

Despite a performance their manager described as not their best, the team managed to clinch the victory. Key moments included a leadoff home run and a game-tying triple by Shohei Ohtani, a two-run homer from Max Muncy, and Mookie Betts' go-ahead single. The bullpen successfully held off a late Royals rally, sealing the win with a game-ending double play and improving the Dodgers' record to 52-31.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that parents in a Maryland school district have the right to opt their children out of classroom lessons that feature storybooks with LGBTQ+ themes, citing religious freedom. The case was brought by parents in Montgomery County who objected to the inclusion of nine specific picture books in the elementary English curriculum. The majority opinion stated schools must provide advance notification to allow for temporary removal of the students. The dissenting justices argued the decision fails to account for the existence of LGBTQ+ people and families within the community.</p>

It recounts an anecdote where a U.S. senator allegedly told an Emirati official that the American goal was not merely regime change but to prevent any regional state from achieving military or technological parity with Israel. The author suggests this neoconservative-driven agenda became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks. The piece frames recent conflicts as a continuation of this decades-long quest for Israeli military dominance and its consequences.</p>

Weiss has been criminally charged with identity theft and unauthorized computer access affecting over 3,000 individuals, allegedly to find intimate photos.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is faster than the rate of sea-level rise, potentially degrading the city's defense against storm surges. Using satellite radar data, researchers identified sinking hotspots in certain neighborhoods, wetlands, and around industrial sites. The findings serve as a wake-up call for the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure the $15 billion levee system remains effective in protecting the low-lying city.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the new aid distribution system in Gaza, calling it "inherently unsafe" and a "death sentence" for people trying to feed their families. The system, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and backed by Israel and the U.S., bypasses the UN. Guterres stated that over 400 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid from GHF sites and that UN-led humanitarian efforts are being strangled. The GHF denies these claims, while the Israeli military has ordered an investigation into allegations of firing at civilians near aid sites.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which sets national vaccine policy, met this week with a new slate of members appointed by Health Secretary Robert F.

The meeting's tone and the administration's recent actions, including cutting funding for a global vaccine initiative, suggest a significant and controversial shift is underway for America's public health and vaccination policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The 6-3 ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, it stated that such sweeping judicial orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts. The decision narrows the injunctions against the birthright citizenship policy, potentially allowing it to take effect in states not party to the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause up to 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom called "devastating" and "cruel," warning it could force rural hospital closures and drive up insurance premiums. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the requirements would leave 4.8 million Americans uninsured nationwide. Newsom argued the changes would threaten California's progress in reducing its uninsured rate and gut an already vulnerable system.</p>

Researchers suggest that specific nutrients, such as those in seaweed and the omega-3 fatty acids in fish, could be linked to improved mental well-being.

The escape, which officials have called the worst in recent state history, occurred due to a faulty cell door and poor infrastructure.

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked a Trump administration executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, calling it "unconstitutional from beginning to end." This is the fourth such ruling against the president's campaign to punish elite law firms for representing clients he opposes or for employing lawyers he dislikes. The orders have sought to suspend security clearances and end government contracts. In each of the four lawsuits brought by different firms, judges have found the executive orders to be a violation of constitutional rights and an attack on the legal system.</p>

          <h2>Labour's Reversal on Welfare Cuts Prompts Questions About its Long-Term Economic Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Labour government's recent U-turn on planned welfare reforms has raised significant questions about the credibility of its long-term economic plans. The reversal, forced by a potential party rebellion, was on cuts to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) intended to save Â£5 billion annually and help meet the Chancellor's borrowing rules. Critics and experts suggest the move highlights a conflict between achieving short-term savings and implementing meaningful long-term reforms to address rising health-related benefit claims. The decision could create a Â£3 billion budget shortfall. (not investment advice)</p>
