          <p>A minor earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 3.0 struck Bergen County, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across the tri-state area, including parts of New York City. The United States Geological Survey reported the event was centered six miles below Hasbrouck Heights. While the shaking was felt up to 60 miles away, there have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries. This article notes this follows other recent small quakes and a larger 4.8 magnitude event in the previous year.</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming World War II 80th anniversary victory parade in Beijing. Some experts, like Vijay Prashad of Tricontinental, suggest that Modi's presence could provide an opportunity for China, India, and Russia to hold a tripartite meeting and help resolve ongoing border disputes. However, other observers believe Modi is unlikely to participate, despite a recent improvement in relations between the two nations.

          <p>In an extensive interview marking the anniversary of his arrest, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz reflects on the 1976-77 murder spree that terrorized New York City. Berkowitz, now a born-again Christian serving multiple life sentences, discusses his troubled childhood, his descent into what he describes as satanic influences, and the murders of six people. He expresses remorse for his actions but claims he was serving a demonic entity, distancing himself from the "Son of Sam" persona. The article provides a detailed retrospective, including accounts from survivors and investigators who remain skeptical of his claims of being part of a cult.</p>

          <p>More than three decades after the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, a key theory centers on two unidentified men seen in the store shortly before closing. Despite initial arrests and convictions that were later overturned due to new DNA evidence, the case remains unsolved. Defense attorneys argue that these two men, who were the last known customers and never came forward, are the most likely perpetrators. The article details how initial confessions were recanted and how a mysterious male DNA profile found on a victim did not match any of the original suspects.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. The probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into former President Donald Trump were politically motivated to influence the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent agency separate from the special counsel role Smith held. This investigation is not criminal in nature and focuses on whether Smith's actions constituted unlawful political interference.</p>

          <p>Over 30 years after four teenage girls were murdered in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved, continuing to torment the victims' families and the original investigators. The article recounts the horrific 1991 crime, the subsequent investigation, and the legal saga that saw two men convicted and later released after their convictions were overturned. A key piece of evidence is a small sample of male DNA found on one victim, which did not match the accused men. Investigators and family members hold out hope that advancements in DNA technology may one day identify the killer and finally bring closure.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Propose Drone Swarm Technology for Precision Electronic Warfare</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a method for drone swarms to create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces during electronic warfare. By coordinating the signals from multiple drones, the system can selectively jam enemy communications while creating a null zone where allied signals are unaffected. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement over traditional omnidirectional jamming, which disrupts all signals within its range, including those of friendly units. The technology aims to provide a strategic advantage by maintaining secure communications for the People's Liberation Army while disabling adversaries.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that recent actions by the Trump administration, such as firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner and removing references to Trump's impeachments from a Smithsonian exhibit, represent an 'Orwellian' effort to control narratives. The firing of the BLS head came just after a disappointing jobs report, with the President explicitly stating he didn't believe the numbers. This move, critics warn, undermines the credibility of vital economic data and sends a chilling message to nonpartisan government officials.

          <p>The recent destruction of the Swiss village of Blatten by a glacier and mountain collapse highlights a growing threat to alpine communities. Climate scientists warn that rising global temperatures are melting glaciers and thawing permafrost, which acts as a geological glue, making devastating landslides more frequent and unpredictable. While Switzerland spends heavily on protective structures, the cost of securing all at-risk areas is immense, sparking a debate about whether some remote villages should be relocated. For residents, however, these villages represent their "heimat" or homeland, a deep cultural identity they are determined to preserve.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather from cancer was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the profession and recalled feeling emotionally overwhelmed when breaking bad news to patients. He explained that his stepfather's passing at age 54 made him realize he didn't want to spend his life in a career he wasn't passionate about. This pivotal moment set him on the path to becoming a successful comedian, known for shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, despite the player's public desire to remain with the club. The potential sale is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While sources indicate United could acquire Sesko without first selling players, an exit like Hojlund's would be necessary to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. Selling Hojlund at this price would represent a book loss for the club, as he is only two years into a five-year contract.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has signaled it will be more cautious with its open-source approach in the future. This shift comes as Chinese companies are rapidly advancing and releasing their own powerful open-source models, such as Alibaba's Wan 2.2 video tool and Zhipu AI's GLM-4.5. Prominent AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem may be its path to surpassing the U.S. in artificial intelligence. The article highlights a strategic divergence in AI development between the two tech superpowers.</p>
