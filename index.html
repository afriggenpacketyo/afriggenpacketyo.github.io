          <p>Walmart and other major U.S. retailers have reportedly instructed some manufacturers in China to resume shipments, signaling a potential recovery in demand despite ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. A major exporter in Ningbo received notification from Walmart to resume normal deliveries to the United States, with the costs of new import duties to be borne by the U.S. clients. This move suggests that U.S. retailers are willing to absorb the tariff costs to maintain their supply chains and meet consumer demand. It also indicates a possible shift in strategy to mitigate the impact of the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, now led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, is projected to win the country's federal election for the fourth consecutive time.

This indicates a continuation of the political status quo, with the Liberals maintaining their position as the dominant party in Canada.

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a previous order withholding his removal due to gang persecution risks. Homan asserted that the facts surrounding the withholding order had changed, claiming Abrego Garcia is now a terrorist, linked to the MS-13 gang, and that the gang he feared no longer exists. This stance is contested by Abrego Garcia's attorneys, who deny his gang affiliation and highlight his lack of a criminal record. The Salvadoran President has refused to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S., leading to diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>A Chinese political scientist has cautioned Southeast Asian countries (Asean) to carefully weigh the risks of siding with the United States over China in the ongoing trade war. Zheng Yongnian suggests that aligning too closely with the U.S. could lead to isolation by China and hinder Asean's growth prospects. He argues that while the U.S. aims to bring manufacturing back to its own country, China is better positioned to support Asean's industrialization goals. This perspective highlights the complex geopolitical considerations facing Asean nations as they navigate the economic competition between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced investigations into Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review following allegations that the legal journal was selecting articles based on authors' race rather than merit. These investigations come amidst an ongoing feud between the Trump administration and Harvard over demands to dismantle DEI programs and screen international students for ideological red flags. The administration previously froze $2.2 billion in grants to Harvard due to concerns about antisemitism. The civil rights offices of the Department of Education and the Department of Health & Human Services will investigate potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>

          <p>As the US-China trade war escalates, US President Donald Trump has temporarily exempted imports from other countries from the punitive tariffs he announced on April 2. He is reportedly trying to bully others into limiting their economic ties with China in exchange for a deal. China is responding by reducing its dependence on the US market and building itself into a large consumer market, employing fiscal and monetary policies to boost domestic demand and manage local government debt.</p>

          <p>President Trump is providing some relief to automakers by adjusting his tariff policies. Importers of foreign auto parts will be able to receive reimbursement from the government for tariffs over the next two years. This decision aims to reward domestic manufacturers while giving companies time to invest in domestic plants. The move comes after automakers voiced concerns about the high tariffs, despite the United Auto Workers' support for the tariffs as a means of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.</p>

Cruz believes that Trump has the opportunity to negotiate much lower tariffs for U.S. goods and services with trading partners worldwide, which would be a historic victory for American jobs and workers. He warned that imposing high retaliatory tariffs permanently would be disastrous for the state of Texas and the country.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the immunotherapy drug dostarlimab can eliminate tumors in some patients with early-stage cancers, potentially allowing them to avoid surgery. In the study, 82 out of 103 participants responded so well to the drug that they no longer needed an operation. The study focused on patients whose tumors had a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic problem that makes cells more likely to respond to immunotherapy. While the results are promising, the study was conducted at a single hospital and included a limited number of patients with each specific cancer type.</p>
