          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) experienced a record-low result in the Tokyo assembly election, winning only 22 seats, a result seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors race. Tomin First no Kai, established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, secured the most seats with 32, reflecting the popularity of her public welfare and child-rearing policies. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and Komeito party obtained 17 and 19 seats, respectively, while Sanseito, a new right-wing populist party, gained three seats. Voter turnout increased to 47.59 percent, highlighting heightened public engagement in the political process. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global oil trade route. This appeal follows Iran's warning that it "reserves all options to defend its sovereignty" after the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian state media reported that parliament supported closing the strait, though the final decision rests with Iran's national security council. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could severely impact the global economy, as it facilitates approximately 20% of global crude oil consumption, roughly 20 million barrels per day. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland is considering establishing a clinic to offer ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, potentially as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not officially licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors, offering a new option for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments. There are also concerns about the potential for misuse and serious health problems, including fatalities, which have been linked to recreational ketamine use. </p>

This marks Bradley's first victory at the tournament, while Fleetwood continues his search for his first PGA Tour title after multiple top-10 finishes.

          <p>Researchers studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, were surprised to find that most of the monkeys survived Hurricane Maria in 2017. The island lost two-thirds of its vegetation, but the monkeys adapted, possibly by eating seaweed and algae deposited on the beach. The research team also managed to save decades of biological data and journals by moving their offices to a sturdier location and maintaining the freezers with generators. The study of these monkeys, who share 94% of their DNA with humans, continues to provide valuable insights into stress, longevity, and overall health. </p>

          <p>Scholars and Iranian Americans are concerned about the fate of Isfahan's architectural treasures following U.S. strikes on nearby nuclear sites. Isfahan, a historic city with landmarks from Persia's 17th-century regional power, includes intricately tiled mosques, bridges, and the UNESCO-listed Naqsh-e Jahan Square. While U.S. military authorities targeted nuclear facilities outside the city, the risk to these cultural assets remains a significant concern. The city's architecture is a testament to the Safavid dynasty, with many landmarks dating back to the rule of King Abbas I, who chose Isfahan as his empire's capital. </p>

          <p>A Florida Republican congresswoman, Kat Cammack, experienced delays in receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns among hospital staff about Florida's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, blames fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the reluctance of medical staff, despite the procedure being legal under the state's statutes. She hopes her experience will foster common ground between opposing political groups, advocating for women to receive necessary care during miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies. Abortion rights activists argue that the law creates confusion and problems, particularly due to its lack of clarity on ectopic pregnancies. </p>

          <p>The U.S. military has provided details of "Operation Midnight Hammer," the mission to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities, involving a 37-hour round-trip flight and multiple mid-air refuelings. According to the Pentagon, the operation included seven B-2 stealth bombers deploying "bunker buster" bombs on key Iranian nuclear sites. A series of decoys were used to distract from the main strike package, and Israeli dominance over Iranian airspace enabled American bombers to operate with impunity. The Trump administration claims the operation has "obliterated" Iran's nuclear regime, but the true extent of the damage is yet to be measured. </p>

          <p>Details are emerging about the U.S. air strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, with President Trump claiming the facilities have been "obliterated." The Pentagon said the strikes involved B-2 stealth bombers and precision-guided weapons. The strikes have drawn mixed reactions, with some supporting the move and others criticizing it as unconstitutional. While the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization acknowledged the bombing, it downplayed the damage, stating that the targeted sites had been evacuated. The potential for Iranian retaliation remains a significant concern. </p>
