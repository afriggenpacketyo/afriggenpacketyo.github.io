          <p>Deutsche Bank announced a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strong euro and mixed results in its investment banking division. The German lender confirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets for 2025, with its profit before tax rising 34% year-on-year. While its fixed income and currencies division saw a revenue increase, the origination and advisory unit experienced a significant decline due to market uncertainty. The bank is navigating a lower interest rate environment in Europe but sees opportunities in increased defense spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a program offering monthly electronic subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care services and stimulate consumption. The policy targets seniors assessed as moderately to severely disabled, providing them with allowances between 500 and 800 yuan per month. This move represents a rare form of direct fiscal support from Beijing, which has typically avoided cash-like handouts. Economists believe strengthening the social safety net in this way could help reduce precautionary savings and address the financial strain on households from a rapidly aging population.</p>

          <p>Spanish company Deoleo, the world's largest olive oil producer, has warned that a potential 30% tariff on EU imports by the U.S. could lead to higher prices and reduced access for American consumers. With the U.S. importing approximately 95% of its olive oil, the company argues that such trade measures would directly impact end-users. The Trump administration has threatened to raise tariffs by an August 1 deadline if a trade deal is not reached with the 27-nation bloc. The uncertainty has rattled European exporters, including winemakers and cheesemakers, who fear the economic consequences of the proposed duties.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal battle, former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by a UK court. The ruling raises questions about the prosecution of individuals following the 2008 financial crisis and may open the door for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. Both Hayes and Palombo have called for a public inquiry into their cases and the conduct of the Serious Fraud Office. The decision follows a similar move in the U.S., where convictions were also overturned, leading to settlements with former employers.</p>

The ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda.

However, universities stress they are not a replacement for clinical NHS services and face their own resource challenges. The discussion highlights the complexity of the issue, from the strain on academic tutors to the difficulty students face navigating support systems, raising fundamental questions about the duty of care in higher education.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has spoken out about the physical and psychological abuse he endured after being deported by the Trump administration to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Despite having no criminal record, he was accused of gang affiliation and held for four months in the CECOT prison alongside dangerous criminals. Suarez, who was recently released in a prisoner swap, described constant beatings and inhumane conditions. His ordeal highlights a controversial U.S. immigration policy where individuals were sent to third countries, raising serious questions about due process and human rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant shift in U.S. immigration policy, the Trump administration has directed border officials to offer unaccompanied migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. Previously, a 2008 anti-trafficking law required that all such minors from non-contiguous countries be transferred to government-run shelters. The new policy, which was once limited to children from Mexico and Canada, would see U.S. officials facilitate the prompt deportation of teens who accept the offer. Those who decline would still be sent to the shelter system overseen by HHS.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency (EA) in England has cancelled thousands of water tests intended to detect harmful river pollution over the last three months because of significant staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that monitoring for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural runoff, has been severely impacted. The EA confirmed that seven national testing programs have been paused, affecting investigations across the country, including in protected areas like the River Wye. Campaigners warn that the lack of data will make it harder to identify and address the growing crisis of water pollution.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the relationship has reached an "inflection point," pointing to a historic trade deficit and the need to rebalance economic ties. While President Xi called for mutual trust and strategic cooperation, the talks were overshadowed by disagreements over market access, industrial subsidies, and geopolitical issues.

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography made a rare discovery on a La Jolla beach: a vibrant violet sea snail, Janthina janthina. These pelagic snails, which float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft, are not typically found on Southern California shores. Their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore waters, leading to speculation about a potential link to climate change. The sighting is the first by Scripps researchers in a decade, and they are urging the public to report any further discoveries to help study the potential shift in the species' range.</p>

This success has allowed SK Hynix to challenge its rival Samsung's dominance in the memory market. The company anticipates strong, continued demand for AI memory for the rest of the year, fueled by ongoing investments from major tech firms and governments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age-verification systems for their users. The rules, which took effect Friday, mandate that platforms use methods like credit card checks, photo ID matching, or age estimation via selfie to prevent minors from accessing explicit material. Companies that fail to comply face substantial fines of up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue. However, critics and users have raised concerns about data privacy and the potential for people to circumvent the checks using tools like VPNs.</p>

          <p>The White House has dismissed reports that President Donald Trump's name appears in newly surfaced Justice Department documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A spokesperson characterized the claims as "fake news" concocted by political opponents, although an unnamed official reportedly did not deny his name was present. Being named in the documents does not imply any wrongdoing. The pushback comes as a federal judge denied a DOJ request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's Florida case, citing state secrecy laws, complicating the administration's previous promises to release more information.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic and often-controversial frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. The article recounts his journey from a working-class background in Birmingham to becoming one of rock's most influential and mythologized figures. It highlights how Black Sabbath invented the heavy metal genre by reacting against the popular music of the late 1960s, creating a heavier, darker sound. The piece credits guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident, as a key element of the band's revolutionary sound.</p>

This contrasts sharply with his previous stance at the Boston Red Sox, where he was adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The position change was necessitated by an injury to the team's primary first baseman, and Devers contributed two hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Atlanta Braves.</p>
