            <p>President Trump voiced his support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth following reports of a second Signal chat leak involving sensitive military information. The reports allege that Hegseth shared details about a planned attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen with individuals including his wife, who does not hold a government position, his brother, and personal lawyer. Hegseth dismissed the allegations as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees, while the White House press secretary defended Hegseth's leadership at the Pentagon. The Pentagon's inspector general is currently reviewing Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military actions.</p>

            <p>This article explores the challenges facing major tech companies as they enter earnings season, with uncertainty surrounding the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The tariffs are creating market chaos, affecting revenue and earnings for companies reliant on imports.

Tesla faces supply chain challenges, Alphabet is concerned about ad spending and cloud infrastructure costs, and Meta is wary of reduced ad revenue from China.

            <p>Gold prices reached a new record, exceeding $3,400 per ounce, as President Trump's actions against the Federal Reserve and his tariffs increased investor uncertainty. The surge in gold prices is attributed to investors seeking safe-haven assets amid concerns about the U.S. economy and a weakening dollar. Trump's pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates has further fueled market volatility. Citi analysts predict that gold prices could continue to rise due to tariff-related growth concerns and strong central bank demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The shooting, which targeted Hispanics, is one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.

Researchers warn that the cuts will jeopardize the federal government's ability to systematically track injuries, the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people under 45.

Biles eventually regained her ability to twist in time for the 2016 Olympic trials after consulting with her family and therapist.

The call for Hegseth's removal follows reports of a second Signal chat where Hegseth discussed plans to strike Houthis in Yemen, allegedly including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The White House, however, has expressed strong support for Hegseth, defending his leadership at the Pentagon.</p>

            <h2>Friendship Industry Falls Short in Addressing Loneliness</h2>

            <p>The growing friendship industry, comprised of ventures aimed at curing Americans of alienation, faces a significant flaw: it focuses on quantity over quality. Many startups assume loneliness stems from a lack of friends and promote meeting new people as the solution. However, research suggests loneliness is more about the quality of relationships and feelings of intimacy. Achieving true connection requires consistency, positivity, and vulnerability, elements often lacking in one-off friendship events. Structural issues such as affordability and mental health treatment gaps also contribute to loneliness, which the friendship industry fails to address.</p>

            <p>Stocks fell sharply after President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser." The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all experienced significant declines. Investors are grappling with ongoing tariff uncertainty and awaiting the release of U.S. tech companies' earnings this week. Powell's warnings about tariffs driving up inflation and stymieing growth have further fueled market volatility. Experts suggest any attempt by Trump to fire Powell would likely trigger a steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets.</p>

This year's event was held shortly after the death of Pope Francis, whom Trump honored in brief remarks. The event is sponsored by corporations, including Amazon, YouTube, and Meta, a departure from the traditional sponsorship by the American Egg Board. Sponsors receive various levels of recognition and access in exchange for their financial contributions. The theme of this year's egg roll looks forward to the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding.</p>

            <p>CATL, the world's largest supplier of batteries for electric vehicles, has announced a significant breakthrough in battery technology. The new technology will enable the production of lighter, cheaper, faster-charging, and more cold-resistant batteries with greater driving range. The company claims the technology will allow EVs to charge enough for 320 miles of range in just five minutes. The technology is still several years away from public availability but could make electric cars more competitive with gasoline-powered models. The new battery system uses auxiliary batteries in the car's underbody, reducing the use of graphite.</p>

            <p>Iowa is considering a constitutional amendment to address how traumatized witnesses testify in court, balancing a defendant's right to confront their accuser with the need to protect vulnerable individuals. The proposed amendment would allow limitations on the confrontation clause for witnesses under 18 or those with mental or developmental disabilities. The move stems from a state Supreme Court decision requiring face-to-face encounters between defendants and witnesses. Supporters argue it will protect victims, while opponents worry it could hinder defendants' rights. The measure requires further legislative approval and a public vote to be enacted.</p>
