Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the lessons of the battle and passing them on to future generations as the spirit of Okinawa. Ishiba acknowledged the tragedy of war and pledged to work towards a peaceful and prosperous Okinawa, while also addressing the ongoing burden of U.S. military bases on the prefecture. Asako Idogawa, an 89-year-old who experienced the war, paid her respects to her brother, highlighting the enduring pain and cruelty of war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending at their upcoming summit, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP) due to pressure from the U.S. The proposed 5% consists of 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure like cyber warfare capabilities. While some member states support this target, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold agreed upon a decade ago. Despite potential clashes over the specifics, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East underscore the importance of increased defense capabilities. European aerospace and defense companies are closely monitoring these commitments, hoping for concrete government procurement to scale up production capabilities.</p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a recreational drug, has shown potential in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. Experts emphasize the importance of controlled administration and lower doses in clinical settings compared to recreational use, and the Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to release an updated report on psychedelics with information on ketamine. Prof Andrew McIntosh hopes to offer the treatment to patients with hard-to-treat depression, offering additional hope and an extra thing to help patients that is not currently available widely in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, suggesting investors believe the conflict is contained. The MSCI World index saw only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets traded mixed, indicating a lack of widespread panic. Some analysts believe the U.S. strikes have reduced the nuclear threat in the region, minimizing systemic risk to global markets. Traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the strikes on its nuclear facilities, but the initial market reaction suggests a contained geopolitical event. The markets view the attack on Iran as a relief with the nuclear threat now gone for the region.</p>

          <p>Two brothers, Gabriel and Sebastian Shemirani, attribute their sister Paloma's death to their mother Kate's anti-medicine conspiracy theories. Paloma, diagnosed with cancer, refused chemotherapy due to her mother's influence and died seven months later at age 23. Kate Shemirani, a former nurse, had been struck off for promoting misinformation about Covid-19 and has publicly blamed the NHS for her daughter's death. The brothers hope to prevent similar deaths by raising awareness about the dangers of medical misinformation on social media, as conspiracy theory influencers share anti-medicine views to millions, potentially harming vulnerable individuals. The brothers hope that their story can help prevent other deaths and that social media companies should take stronger action against medical misinformation.</p>

          <p>The article criticizes Western leaders for their feeble and complacent response to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, particularly the US's involvement. It argues that these leaders are merely passengers in Israel's war, unwilling to question its wisdom or address the root causes of the conflict. The author accuses them of prioritizing unconditional support for Israel over international and human rights law, resulting in a shattered system of global order. The piece contends that Western leaders are unsuited for crisis, unable to rethink or challenge the status quo, and instead, they perpetuate a world order of failing assumptions and hierarchies.</p>

          <p>At an upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, faces new challenges as NATO aims to set ambitious goals for defense spending and troop levels. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe, NATO's target of 5% of economic output on defense is met with skepticism. The German government supports a figure of 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for infrastructure, but achieving this by 2032 would require a significant increase in spending. The Bundeswehr also needs to recruit additional troops, potentially requiring between 50,000 and 60,000 new soldiers, though there are no plans to reinstate conscription at this time.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on increasing defense spending, a major demand by U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially giving him a significant win. NATO countries are expected to commit to spending 5% of their GDP on defense to deter Russia and appease Trump. While this goal is ambitious and could transform European societies, some countries like Spain are seeking exemptions, and others like Italy are requesting more time to meet the obligation. The summit may be disappointing for Ukraine, as its aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to be a central focus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City will implement ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate receives a majority. While ranked choice voting aims to ensure broad support for the winner, it can also be complex and potentially lead to delays in election results.</p>

          <p>Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk who gained notoriety in 2015 for denying same-sex marriage licenses, continues to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling that legalized same-sex marriage. Davis, citing her Christian faith, defied court orders and was jailed for contempt before her staff issued licenses without her name. Despite a Kentucky law later removing county clerks' names from marriage licenses, Davis's lawyers are attempting to bring her case before the Supreme Court again. Davis's attorney stated the goal is to affirm her constitutional rights and overturn Obergefell.</p>

The restructuring of the military education system aims to create a more efficient and higher quality system for nurturing talent and preparing for war. The ministry has also removed the requirement for military academy students to have three years of work experience before becoming commanders, allowing them to pursue postgraduate studies immediately after graduation.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump disputed Iranian attempts to downplay the strikes on its nuclear facilities, asserting that "obliteration" was an accurate description of the damage. The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine reported "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, though he stopped short of confirming total obliteration. Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) is still pending to fully evaluate the extent of the damage and whether the targets remain operable. Reuters cited an Iranian source claiming that most of the highly enriched uranium at Fordo had been moved prior to the strikes.</p>

Garcia faces human smuggling charges, and while the judge found the government failed to prove he was a flight risk, he may be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody instead. Garcia, a Salvadoran native, had been deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The defense argues that the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in Garcia's case, as another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release.</p>
