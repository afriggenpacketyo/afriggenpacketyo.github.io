          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in the Netherlands, focusing on Iran and defense spending. Despite a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel, Trump noted violations by both sides. He aimed to secure commitments from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of their GDP on defense, with NATO already agreeing to boost spending. Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and on new defense spending levels. Russia's war in Ukraine remains a concern for NATO members. The article notes a single two-and-a-half-hour session was held instead of multiple sessions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A French court ruled the state bore partial responsibility for the 2016 death of a jogger, Jean-Rene Auffray, who died after inhaling toxic hydrogen sulfide from rotting algae on a Brittany beach. The court cited the state's negligence in implementing regulations to protect waters from agricultural pollution, which causes the algae bloom. The court found the state 60% responsible, noting Auffray also took a risk jogging there. Brittany, a major agricultural region, faces algae blooms due to excessive fertilizer use and runoff from pig farms, costing taxpayers millions annually. The jogger's widow will receive €277,343 ($321,750), while each of his three children will receive €15,000, and his brother €9,000.</p>

Environmental organizations and immigration advocates raised concerns about the ecosystem and detainee well-being.

Allegations include firebombing, kidnapping, and bribing. Combs pleaded not guilty, insisting any sexual acts were consensual. The defense plans to rest its case without calling witnesses.

The Fed is monitoring the combined effects of Trump's policies on taxes, immigration, and regulation.
