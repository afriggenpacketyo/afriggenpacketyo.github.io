          <h2>Trump Plans to Officially Rename Persian Gulf to Arabian Gulf</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 22:23:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump intends to announce that the U.S. will officially refer to the Persian Gulf as the Arabian Gulf during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia. This decision follows pressure from Arab nations seeking to change the geographic name of the body of water, while Iran maintains its historical ties to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. military has already been using the term Arabian Gulf in its statements, and while Trump can change the name for U.S. purposes, he cannot dictate global usage. The article highlights the sensitivity of the issue, especially for Iranians who embrace their country’s history as the Persian Empire.</p>

Pakistan has condemned the strikes as an act of war and promised a robust response, with reports indicating that Pakistani state media claimed three Indian Air Force fighter jets were shot down. The United States is monitoring the situation closely and urges both sides toward a peaceful resolution, while airlines are diverting flights from Pakistani airspace.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Nashville, Freddie O'Connell, expressed concern that recent ICE arrests in the city, including a convicted child sexual assault offender and an alleged gang member, are not focused on making the city safer. O'Connell emphasized that the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department does not have federal immigration authority and lacks access to federal immigration databases. DHS responded by stating that the mayor should want these criminal illegal aliens off American streets, noting a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers. ICE reported arresting over 66,000 illegal immigrants and removing more than 65,000 during President Trump’s first 100 days of his second term.</p>

Over 5 million borrowers are currently in default, with millions more at risk of defaulting soon, and the Education Department will notify borrowers about the resumption of collections. Borrowers can check their loan status and servicer information through their online Federal Student Aid account.

Five Mexican nationals have been charged in connection with the incident, which is described as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by maritime smuggling.

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite months of previously disparaging remarks about Canada. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, a stark contrast to his earlier rhetoric about potentially annexing the country. Carney, however, firmly rejected any notion of Canada becoming the 51st state, emphasizing its independence. The meeting, which touched on various topics including trade and diplomacy, aimed to ease tensions and foster a more amicable relationship between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, Alvin Brown, was abruptly removed from his position by the Trump administration, a rare move that has raised questions. The decision comes as the NTSB is actively investigating numerous high-profile cases, including aviation disasters and infrastructure collapses. Jeff Guzzetti, a former NTSB and FAA accident investigator, noted the unusual nature of the removal, as board members typically serve out their terms or remain until a successor is appointed. The White House has not provided a reason for Brown's removal.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a US bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to President Trump's increased tariffs. The company, which imports about 90% of its bikes from China, has seen its import duties skyrocket, making it financially unfeasible to continue importing. The company has canceled new orders from China and is exploring alternative manufacturing options, but fully manufacturing in the US is currently cost-prohibitive. The tariffs are disrupting the company's supply chain and impacting its ability to provide affordable bicycles to consumers.</p>

IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology, aligning with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminium industry.</p>
