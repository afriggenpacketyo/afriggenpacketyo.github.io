          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to meet with US President Donald Trump in Scotland, where he will raise the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza. The discussion comes as previous negotiations in Qatar have stalled and international pressure on Israel mounts over the severe humanitarian crisis. Aid agencies warn of mass starvation, and despite some airdrops, the supplies are a fraction of what is needed. Starmer's government is also working to evacuate critically ill children from the territory, reflecting the dire situation on the ground.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan men deported from the United States to El Salvador's notorious CECOT mega-prison have described experiencing brutal abuse, including beatings and sexual assault by guards. The men were sent to the maximum-security facility under the Trump administration's use of the rare Alien Enemies Act, accused without evidence of being gang members. Recently freed in a prisoner exchange, former detainees are now speaking out about the inhumane conditions and violence they endured. Human rights groups argue the deportations likely constituted forced disappearance and violated due process.</p>

Telecom giant Verizon also made the list after raising its profit guidance, offering a substantial dividend yield. These selections are based on analyses of the companies' financial health and ability to provide consistent shareholder returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has intervened in the border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, announcing that both nations have agreed to meet for immediate ceasefire talks. The intervention comes as fighting has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced thousands. Both countries have thanked Trump for his efforts, though shelling reportedly continued overnight. The diplomatic push occurs just before significant US tariffs on both nations are set to take effect, with Trump linking the resumption of trade talks to the cessation of hostilities.</p>

          <p>Beijing has condemned a failed recall vote against 24 Beijing-friendly Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan, labeling the effort a form of "political manipulation" by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). A spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office stated the result shows that the DPP's actions are unpopular and contrary to the will of the people. The statement reflects the ongoing political pressure mainland China exerts on Taiwan, which has intensified since the election of President William Lai Ching-te, whom Beijing views as a separatist.</p>

This move, which includes selling advanced U.S. arms to NATO allies to supply Ukraine, marks a significant change from previous rhetoric and has drawn both praise and criticism.

          <p>Scientists report that climate change is exacerbating the formation of sinkholes globally by intensifying extreme weather patterns. Periods of drought weaken the ground by lowering the water table, and subsequent heavy rainfall adds immense weight, causing the land to collapse. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in "karst terrains" with soluble bedrock, such as those in Florida, Turkey, and parts of China. Researchers are using technology to predict these hazards, but they stress that managing water resources is crucial for prevention.</p>

          <p>A traveler shares a humorous yet frustrating account of a trip on Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn, which was beset by problems from the start. The journey included last-minute train changes, extensive delays caused by a flock of sheep on the tracks, and an eventual cancellation in Hamburg due to staff exceeding their work hours. The story serves as an anecdotal illustration of the broader systemic issues plaguing the German rail network, such as dilapidated infrastructure and personnel shortages, which have led to notorious unpunctuality.</p>

          <p>Greece continues to battle devastating wildfires in multiple regions, including the Peloponnese peninsula and the islands of Evia and Kythera, following nearly a week of extreme heat. Strong winds have fanned the flames, leading to widespread evacuations, the destruction of homes, and significant damage to forests and farmland. Firefighters, supported by aircraft from several countries, are working to contain the blazes as officials warn that the risk remains very high across much of the country, recalling the destructive fires of the previous year.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, the sport has struggled to develop in the eastern part of the continent, with Poland being the region's sole representative at Euro 2025. Experts attribute this disparity to a combination of historical factors, cultural norms that discourage female participation, and a lack of investment in infrastructure and professional opportunities. However, there is growing optimism that initiatives from UEFA and increased visibility from major tournaments are beginning to foster positive change and unlock the region's talent pool.</p>

The situation has left them frustrated and confused, as they believe they are being trolled by someone exploiting the city's automated citation process.

While desperate for relief from months of starvation and shortages, many fear the measure is insufficient and will not lead to a permanent solution or an end to the war. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with widespread malnutrition reported, particularly among children and those with specific dietary needs, leaving many to feel the aid is like a painkiller for a much deeper wound.</p>

This article examines the puzzling disconnect, suggesting several factors are at play, including a surprisingly resilient economy, solid corporate earnings, and a growing market belief that the administration's final trade actions will be less severe than its initial rhetoric. This investor sentiment, dubbed the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out), reflects a recalibration of expectations in a new and unpredictable trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>
