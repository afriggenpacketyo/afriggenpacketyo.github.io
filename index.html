          <p>Oregon Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley delivered a marathon speech on the Senate floor, speaking overnight to protest the policies of the Trump administration. He criticized the weaponization of the Justice Department, deportation efforts, and the potential deployment of the National Guard to cities like Portland, which he represents. Merkley described the current political climate as the "biggest threat to our republic since the Civil War," arguing that President Trump is undermining the Constitution. The lengthy address, which became one of the longest in recent Senate history, was intended to raise alarm over what he termed the administration's authoritarian actions.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Western Alliance, Kenneth Vecchione, addressed investor concerns by stating that an alleged loan fraud incident that triggered a recent selloff is believed to be an isolated case. The regional bank had set aside $30 million for potential losses on a loan to the Cantor Group after suing the borrowers for alleged fraud. Vecchione assured analysts that the bank has since reverified its major loan portfolio and found no other irregularities, helping to calm market fears about systemic issues within the regional banking sector. The bank's report of rising net interest income also provided some reassurance to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thames Valley Police have announced that no charges will be filed against four men arrested for projecting images of Donald Trump and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle. The incident occurred in September during President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom. The men were initially arrested on suspicion of malicious communications and public nuisance. After a thorough investigation, the police force concluded that no further action would be taken, closing the case related to the protest gesture.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed that U.S. forces conducted a strike on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean suspected of trafficking drugs, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on board. This marks the eighth such strike against alleged drug boats since early September but the first to occur in the Pacific. The Trump administration has justified these actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" against drug-trafficking organizations, which it likens to terrorist groups. The operation has now resulted in at least 36 fatalities, raising questions about the use of lethal military force in counter-narcotics efforts.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, has urged a parliamentary select committee to summon Prince Andrew to give evidence regarding his lease of Royal Lodge in Windsor. The call for an inquiry comes amid heightened scrutiny of royal finances and a desire for greater transparency from the Crown Estate, which manages the property. Documents revealed that the prince's lease arrangement involved large upfront payments instead of annual rent, a deal described by some as potentially unfavorable to the taxpayer. This push for accountability follows Prince Andrew stepping back from royal duties due to his connections with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>The director of the Louvre, Laurence des Cars, has admitted that the museum failed to detect thieves early enough to prevent the theft of €88 million worth of French crown jewels. Speaking to French senators, she revealed that the museum's perimeter CCTV was weak and aging, with the only camera near the entry point facing the wrong direction. The gang of four thieves broke in and escaped in under 10 minutes, taking eight prized pieces, including a necklace Napoleon gave to his wife. Des Cars stated, "We failed these jewels," and highlighted the need for significant security upgrades at the historic institution.</p>

          <p>A coalition of civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, has accused U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of systemic medical neglect of pregnant women in its custody. In a letter to ICE and Senate committees, the groups detailed interviews with over a dozen women who reported issues such as being shackled, denied prenatal care, and suffering miscarriages without adequate medical attention. The letter highlights specific cases from detention centers in Louisiana and Georgia, describing instances of delayed treatment, invasive procedures without consent, and malnourishment. Advocates are demanding an immediate review and the release of all pregnant individuals from ICE detention.</p>

The redrawn map specifically targets the state's main battleground district, currently held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis, by altering its boundaries to be more favorable to conservative candidates. Democrats have condemned the move, arguing it dilutes the voting power of Black communities, while Republicans contend the map respects the will of voters who supported President Trump.

The article argues that Russia has studied and emulated U.S. soft power tactics for years, from cultural exchanges to funding NGOs, but has repurposed them to undermine democratic values and strengthen authoritarianism.

For instance, some medications were associated with an average weight gain of four pounds, while others were linked to an average weight loss of over five pounds.

This potential tax hike, expected to be announced in next month's Budget, aligns with the chancellor's goal of having "those with the broadest shoulders pay their fair share."

          <p>The 2025 NFL draft class is making an unprecedented impact early in the season, setting records for total yards and touchdowns by rookies after just seven weeks. Several first-year players, including both high and mid-round draft picks, are already playing key roles for their teams. Analysts attribute the rookies' success to being better prepared for the professional level, with players like receiver Emeka Egbuka and tight end Tyler Warren excelling immediately. The performance of young quarterbacks like Jaxson Dart has also been highlighted for rejuvenating franchises, signaling a significant infusion of new talent across the league.</p>

          <p>A council in south-west London has cancelled a £150 fine issued to a woman for pouring the last of her coffee down a street drain. The woman, Burcu Yesilyurt, explained she disposed of the small amount of liquid to avoid spilling it on a bus she was about to board. She was stopped by three enforcement officers and fined under the Environmental Protection Act, which prohibits disposing of waste in a way that could pollute water. After the story gained media attention, Richmond-Upon-Thames Council reversed its decision, stating the contravention was minor and an appeal would have likely succeeded.</p>

          <p>A $22 million contribution from Alphabet, Google's parent company, is helping to fund President Donald Trump's controversial White House ballroom project. The funds are part of a legal settlement reached after Trump sued the company over his ban from its YouTube platform following the January 6 Capitol riot. This revelation helps clarify the funding for the $250 million project, which Trump has stated will be paid for by private donors and not taxpayers. The use of legal settlement funds for a personal legacy project at the White House has intensified ethical questions surrounding the ballroom's construction and financing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new study from Schroders, nine out of ten working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before reaching the age of 70, despite financial advice that waiting ensures higher monthly payments. While delaying benefits until age 70 can increase payments by about 24% compared to claiming at the full retirement age of 67, most respondents intend to file early. The primary reasons cited include the immediate need for income upon retirement due to insufficient personal savings and concerns about the long-term solvency of the Social Security program. This highlights a significant disconnect between optimal financial strategy and the practical realities facing many retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The rapid construction of new data centers to power the artificial intelligence industry is a major factor driving up electricity prices for consumers. Energy demand, which had been flat for two decades due to efficiency gains, has seen a significant increase, largely from these energy-intensive facilities. In some regions, tech companies are engaging in energy speculation by requesting power commitments from multiple utilities for data centers that may not be built, causing grid operators to plan for inflated demand. Ultimately, if this projected demand doesn't materialize, the cost of the unnecessary infrastructure could be passed on to regular customers.</p>

          <p>A study conducted by New York University law professor Ryan Goodman suggests that some federal courts are losing trust in the Department of Justice under the Trump administration. The research, which tracks over 400 lawsuits, has identified numerous cases where judges have explicitly criticized the government for non-compliance with court orders or for providing false and misleading information. According to the study, these instances have occurred across the country with judges appointed by both parties, indicating a systemic issue. This erosion of trust is considered highly unusual and potentially damaging to the DOJ's ability to function effectively within the U.S. legal system.</p>

With over 40 million Americans relying on SNAP, advocates warn that a delay or stoppage of benefits could be devastating, forcing families to choose between paying for food and other essential expenses.

          <p>Scientists analyzing samples from China’s Chang’e-6 mission have discovered fragments of a rare type of meteorite, known as carbonaceous chondrite, on the far side of the Moon. This marks the first time this material, which is rich in water and other volatile compounds, has been identified on the lunar surface. These meteorites are extremely fragile and seldom survive entry into Earth's atmosphere, making the discovery particularly significant. The finding suggests that volatile-rich asteroids from the outer solar system can reach the Moon, supporting theories that such bodies may have delivered water to both the Earth and the Moon billions of years ago.</p>
