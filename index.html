          <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, stated that the Trump administration is actively exploring the possibility of suspending habeas corpus, the right to challenge the legality of detention, to address illegal immigration. Miller referenced the Constitution's allowance for such suspension during times of invasion, aligning with the administration's view of undocumented migrants. The writ of habeas corpus, originating in English common law and enshrined in the Magna Carta, has been suspended only four times in U.S. history, typically with Congressional authorization. The administration's decision hinges on whether courts align with their stance on deporting undocumented immigrants. Optimism is low considering the context of the situation.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at an ICE detention center in Newark, according to New Jersey's interim top prosecutor. The prosecutor stated that Baraka ignored warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials, while Rep.

Baraka, a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, has been a vocal opponent of the detention center, filing a lawsuit to block its opening.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to increased tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, making it too costly for U.S. retailers to import goods. Tariffs on Chinese goods rose to 145%, prompting China to retaliate with 125% levies on American goods. This shift has led to a 21% decrease in shipments from China to the U.S., while exports to Southeast Asian countries have surged by the same amount. President Trump hinted at potentially lowering tariffs to 80%, but even this rate would still be prohibitively expensive for many U.S. businesses. The situation is unstable.</p>

          <p>President Trump has praised the new trade agreement with the U.K. as a "maxed out deal," but some experts are skeptical, noting that high tariffs remain in place. Despite some concessions, a 10% tariff on U.K. imports persists as part of Trump's broader minimum import tax. Economists warn that even with potential trade deals, the effective average tariff rate will remain high, potentially impacting businesses and consumers. The Cato Institute notes that the deal is a modest improvement but still worse than the pre-Trump status quo. The situation is unstable.</p>

Gonzales expressed frustration with the Zambian government's lack of action, noting minimal arrests of senior officials. The cut in aid is distinct from previous Trump administration changes and aims to prompt the Zambian government to address the theft, with a critical window for securing alternative funding to avoid dire consequences.

Trump expressed openness to the tax hike, noting he would "graciously accept" the tax increase to "help the lower and middle income workers."
