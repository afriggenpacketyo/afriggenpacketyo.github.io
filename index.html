        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Julia Roberts has responded to backlash against her new film, "After the Hunt," which some critics at the Venice Film Festival claim revives outdated arguments about believing women's allegations of sexual assault. Roberts argued that the film is intended to spark conversation and challenge audiences, not to make definitive statements. She emphasized the importance of dialogue in a society that she feels is "losing the art of conversation." The psychological drama, directed by Luca Guadagnino, centers on a professor whose life is upended when a student accuses a colleague, forcing her to confront a secret from her own past.</p>

          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with the armed robbery of rapper Macklemore's home in June. The suspect allegedly entered the home through an unlocked door and used bear spray on the nanny while the rapper's three children were present. Investigators linked the man to other high-profile burglaries and recovered stolen items, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders ring, from a local jewelry store. The suspect was arrested for a separate robbery and is expected to face charges for the home invasion in the coming days.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has announced she will run for Congress, contingent on California voters approving a redrawn district map in a November special election. The 67-year-old former Secretary of Labor is targeting the newly configured 38th District, which would be left without an incumbent. Solis has already secured endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and several sitting members of Congress, signaling strong establishment support for her campaign. The proposed redistricting is part of a broader Democratic strategy to gain more House seats in California.</p>

          <p>Montreal-based luxury fashion retailer SSENSE has announced its intention to file for bankruptcy protection, citing significant financial pressure from new US trade policies. CEO Rami Atallah specifically pointed to President Trump's recent executive order eliminating the "de minimis" exemption, which had allowed for duty-free shipping of packages valued under $800 to the US. This change, combined with tighter liquidity, created an immediate financial crisis for the company, which employs 1,200 people globally. The company plans to continue operations while restructuring under creditor protection.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has called for an investigation into Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over allegations of inappropriate tax avoidance. The controversy centers on the purchase of a flat where she reportedly saved £40,000 in stamp duty by declaring it her main residence, while her primary home for council tax purposes was listed elsewhere. Tory Party chairman Kevin Hollinrake has asked the prime minister's standards adviser to determine if Rayner broke ministerial rules. A spokesperson for Rayner stated that she paid all relevant duties properly and has not broken any laws.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, showed that prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, edged up to 2.9%, indicating persistent price pressures. Despite this, consumer spending increased by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are still spending, though many are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases. Analysts believe these figures keep the Fed on track to consider an interest rate cut at its September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

Secretary of State Marco Rubio accused the officials of undermining peace efforts and seeking unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. This move is highly unusual, as the U.S., as the UN host country, is generally expected to facilitate travel for all member and observer state delegations. The decision comes as several countries, including France, are pushing for the recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN, a move the Trump administration opposes.</p>

Initially understood from just a single bone, the new findings provide a clearer picture of this "punk rocker" dinosaur, which also had a tail weapon and a bony collar.

In court, Cook's lawyers argued her removal was unlawful, lacking the required "cause," and that she learned of it via social media. The Trump administration has justified the move by citing unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud, which Cook's team labels a pretext and a "weapon of choice" to attack the Fed's independence.

This led to a lawsuit and a federal settlement that mandated the recent election.

The primary will be held on February 3, 2026, with the general election on May 5. The vacancy was created when the Democratic incumbent was elected to the U.S. House. Democrats currently hold a narrow 19-18 majority, and a Republican victory would create a tied chamber, potentially allowing the GOP to block Whitmer's legislative agenda in her final year.

          <h2>Trump Administration Moves to Cut $5 Billion in Foreign Aid, Bypassing Congress</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress has already allocated for this fiscal year. The White House is using a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," where a request to cancel funds is made so late in the fiscal year that the money may expire before Congress can act. The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funds for international peacekeeping and promoting democracy. The move is expected to face legal challenges and has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans as an unconstitutional bypass of Congress's power of the purse.</p>

          <p>Generative AI has become deeply integrated into the academic lives of both students and educators, fundamentally altering the educational landscape. For the first time, graduating seniors in high school and college have had AI tools available for their entire four-year careers, leading to its normalization for everything from writing essays to completing assignments. While students have widely adopted AI for productivity, many educators have a "blind spot" regarding the extent of its use. This has created a "pedagogical debt," forcing a re-evaluation of teaching methods, assignments, and the core goals of education in an AI-driven world.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled the Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, seven months after she left office. While former vice presidents are legally entitled to six months of protection, this can be extended by presidential directive, which former President Biden had reportedly done for Harris. The decision has drawn criticism from prominent California Democrats, who have called it politically motivated retribution. The move comes as Harris is about to begin a book tour, raising concerns about her security and the strain on an already overburdened Secret Service.</p>

          <p>The UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court ruling that would have forced 138 asylum seekers to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction was granted to the local council, which argued the hotel's owner breached planning rules. However, the appellate court found the original decision "seriously flawed," stating it failed to consider the difficulty of relocating the migrants. The case arose following protests outside the hotel after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexual assault, a factor the court worried could encourage "further lawlessness" if it influenced legal decisions.</p>

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates still relatively high, seniors have several alternative ways to tap into their home equity without altering their existing home loans. One key option, available only to homeowners aged 62 and older, is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments without requiring monthly repayments. Other viable choices include home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line with variable rates. These methods allow senior homeowners to leverage their assets while preserving their current, likely lower, mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>

While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, fueled by AI demand, the slowdown in the key data center segment and what the CEO called "lumpiness" in growth concerned investors.

Zelenskyy's comments followed reports that European leaders were considering a 40km demilitarized strip.

These remarks have been condemned by medical experts and lawmakers as unscientific and dangerous.
