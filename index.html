        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices are surging as investors seek safe havens amidst trade policy uncertainties and diminishing confidence in traditional U.S. assets like Treasurys and the dollar. Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Vivek Dhar notes that bullion has filled the safe-haven void due to President Trump's trade policies, while the traditionally inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has weakened. Analysts suggest that waning trust in U.S. economic exceptionalism and the dollar's weakening are contributing to gold's allure, as it carries no credit risk and is not tied to a single nation's trajectory, with some analysts forecasting gold to reach $4,000 by 2026.

          <p>South Korea's SK Hynix exceeded first-quarter revenue and profit expectations, driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose 42% and operating profit surged 158% year-on-year, with the company crediting AI's impact on the memory market for the robust performance. However, SK Hynix warned of potential demand volatility in the second half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainties, including potential U.S. tariff policies, but expects AI server demand to remain relatively strong, also benefiting from consumer electronics with new AI features.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, accused of accepting bribes through the employment of his former son-in-law at a budget airline in Thailand.

Despite dismissing claims of currency manipulation, the U.S. expects Japan to honor the G7 agreement on currencies reflecting economic fundamentals, while the Trump administration emphasizes addressing tariffs, non-tariff barriers, and government subsidies to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.</p>

Frankel emphasizes that the impact of Trump's tariffs and the current economic data point to a significant risk of recession in the coming year, potentially leading to economic instability.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at an airline, joining a long line of South Korean presidents facing scandal. Prosecutors argue that Moon's son-in-law received undue benefits in exchange for the airline CEO leading a state-funded agency. Moon's Democratic Party has condemned the prosecution as politically motivated, while the current government is led by acting president Han Duck-soo of the People Power Party.</p>

This strategy reflects Pop Mart's position as a high-end brand targeting adult buyers, allowing it to exercise pricing power despite tariff pressures.</p>
