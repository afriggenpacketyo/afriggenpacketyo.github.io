          <p>Microsoft's stock experienced a significant jump after the company released its quarterly earnings report, which exceeded expectations in both earnings per share and revenue. The growth was primarily fueled by the strong performance of its Azure cloud business. Looking forward, Microsoft provided a robust revenue forecast, alleviating investor concerns about the potential impact of newly announced tariffs on the tech sector. The company's continued investments in AI infrastructure also contributed to the positive outlook, with Azure revenue growing substantially due to AI-related services. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has been marked by an intensified "America First" approach, leading to trade wars, expansionist ambitions, and shifts in international relations. The administration has pursued sweeping trade policies, sought control over foreign territories, and redefined its role in longstanding conflicts. While some initiatives aim to secure critical minerals and broker peace, others have strained alliances and raised concerns about U.S. leadership. The first 100 days of Trump's second term have signaled a lasting impact on the country's global standing and the broader world order.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced the creation of a new reconstruction and investment fund, formalizing an economic agreement intended to give the U.S. access to proceeds from Ukraine's mineral reserves. The agreement aims to provide Ukraine with a security arrangement while addressing President Trump's concerns about unchecked aid to Kyiv. Despite the fanfare, the deal's significance hinges on the cessation of fighting between Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian officials emphasized that the fund would be split equally and that Ukraine would retain control over its resources.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's vow of a massive deportation operation to Mexico, the numbers have been lower than the previous year. While illegal border crossings have decreased due to Mexican efforts and changes in asylum policies, the Trump administration has focused on deporting migrants already inside the U.S., which is more complex and expensive. Mexico is also accepting deportees from other countries, and there are concerns about the legal status and care of these migrants. Migrant advocates say that the Mexican government is preventing large numbers of people from being seen at the border to reflect well on the Trump administration.</p>
