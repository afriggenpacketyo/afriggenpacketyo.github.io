          <p>The United States has revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and halted new visa issuances due to South Sudan's failure to comply with US repatriation efforts.  The State Department accuses South Sudan of exploiting the US by not accepting the return of its citizens.  This action affects all visa appointments and existing visas, preventing South Sudanese nationals from entering the US until the matter is resolved.  The move comes amid ongoing conflict in South Sudan and the expiration of temporary protected status for South Sudanese individuals in the US.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of crypto holders are opting for self-custody of digital assets like Bitcoin due to a lack of faith in institutional control, however recent global events like wildfires and wars highlight the physical risks involved.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's new tariff regime, triggered by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, is facing significant implementation challenges.  The policy goals, including correcting global imbalances and restoring manufacturing, surpass the capacity of the current federal government.  Agencies like Customs and Border Protection are underfunded and ill-equipped to handle the surge in disputes and compliance actions.  The lack of a formal rulemaking process and interagency coordination further exacerbate the challenges, potentially leading to delays, confusion, and retaliatory tariffs.</p>

          <p>Homebuilders are facing a glut of unsold homes, the highest level since the Great Recession, prompting them to offer incentives like price cuts and mortgage rate buydowns.  Builders are trying to attract buyers in a market affected by higher mortgage rates and declining affordability.  The increased inventory presents an opportunity for buyers, but builders are slowing down construction, suggesting the deals may not last.  The market shift reflects a change in dynamics after a period of high demand during the pandemic.</p>

          <h2>Millennials Embrace Polyworking to Stay Ahead of Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-06 10:00:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that over half of millennials are working multiple jobs to cope with inflation and stagnant wages.  The trend, known as "polyworking," is driven by the need to add to savings, pursue personal interests, and gain skills for career advancement.  While some critics express concern about the long-term effects on work-life balance, many view polyworking as a form of entrepreneurism and a way to hedge against unemployment.  This new reality reflects a shift in the workplace, where employees face the choice of polyworking or cutting expenses to maintain their desired lifestyle.</p>

          <p>National security advisor Mike Waltz mistakenly included Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a Signal group chat discussing US strikes in Yemen.  The error stemmed from a series of missteps, beginning with Goldberg's email to the Trump campaign and Waltz inadvertently saving Goldberg's number under the contact for a Trump spokesperson.  Trump was reportedly angered more by the fact that it was Goldberg than by the breach of security.  The White House conducted a "forensic review" of the incident and authorized the use of Signal due to the lack of alternative platforms.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration argues that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The Justice Department requested an appeals court to suspend the judge's order, claiming it infringes on executive power. Abrego Garcia, who had protection from deportation, was sent to a notorious El Salvador prison due to an “administrative error.” The White House maintains he is an MS-13 gang member, a claim disputed by his attorneys.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is facing criticism for supporting Israel's decision to deny entry to two UK Labour MPs planning to visit the occupied West Bank.  Badenoch stated that countries should control their borders and found it shocking that other countries wouldn't allow certain Labour MPs entry.  Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey condemned her comments, while Tory MP Richard Fuller expressed concern about restricting parliamentarians' access to other countries.</p>
