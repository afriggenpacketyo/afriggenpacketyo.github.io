          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials demonstrated a 99.9% effectiveness rate among participants receiving the drug, marking a significant advancement in HIV prevention. Gilead's CEO, Daniel O'Day, hailed the approval as a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV, expressing optimism about potentially ending the epidemic. However, concerns have been raised about the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which experts warn could set back progress by a decade. The article highlights the ongoing need for a vaccine despite the approval of lenacapavir.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is implementing a five-pronged policy to combat the spread of New World screwworms, including building an $8.5 million fly dispersal facility in Texas. This facility will breed millions of sterile screwworm flies to mate with fertile flies, preventing them from laying eggs in open wounds, which can cause deadly infestations. The USDA also plans to convert a fruit fly breeding facility near Mexico's border into a screwworm fly breeding center. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to eradicating screwworms, which were largely banished from the country in the 1960s, and the new facility aims to protect the American cattle herd from this devastating pest.</p>

          <p>Torrential rains in northern West Virginia caused flash flooding that resulted in at least eight deaths, including a young child, and one person is still missing. Officials reported that 2.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in a short period, overwhelming local waterways and infrastructure. First responders conducted multiple water rescues, and the governor declared a state of emergency in Ohio and Marion counties. The unexpected deluge submerged vehicles and damaged roads and bridges, leading to significant infrastructure damage and hampering rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered Peter Stinson, a former Coast Guard officer, to home detention with GPS monitoring after accusations that he made threats against President Trump on social media. Stinson, who served in the Coast Guard from 1988 to 2021, allegedly made multiple threats on platforms like X, Reddit, and Bluesky. Prosecutors argued that Stinson's military background as a sharpshooter contradicted his claims of lacking the skills for an assassination. The defense argued that the statute in question is specific in relation to threatening language, and that political hyperbole is protected speech under the First Amendment.</p>

The trial garnered significant public attention, leading to a Hulu show, podcasts, and a Netflix documentary.

          <p>President Trump has approved attack plans on Iran but has not made a final decision on whether to strike the country, according to sources. Trump is reportedly holding off in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, with the possibility of strikes on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility being considered. Trump stated he would make the final decision at the last moment, citing the changing nature of war, while Iran insists it will not negotiate under duress and will respond to any threat with a counter-threat. Iran has reportedly prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court upheld a $1 million jury verdict against the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect a middle school student from bullying. Eleri Irons sued the district in 2019, alleging she was subjected to verbal and cyber bullying by three students from November 2017 to June 2018. The court found the district negligent in supervising and training its employees, which contributed to the harm suffered by Irons. The appeals court rejected the district's arguments that it was immune to liability and that Irons failed to prove injuries were caused by employee negligence.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association reveals that official U.S. records significantly underestimate mortality and life expectancy disparities for Native Americans. The research found that the life expectancy of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations was 6.5 years lower than the national average, with a life expectancy of just 72.7 years. The study also uncovered widespread racial misclassification, with 41% of AI/AN deaths incorrectly classified as "White" in the CDC WONDER database.

          <h2>Trump Reportedly Considers Strikes on Iranian Nuclear Facility</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly considering strikes on Iran's nuclear facility, the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The source indicated that multiple strikes are being considered, and preparations are underway. This consideration comes as there has been no response from the Iranians regarding ongoing nuclear talks, potentially due to Trump's demand for unconditional surrender. Trump is also assessing the reaction of the MAGA base to potential strikes and has been briefed on the security of U.S. Army bases, which could be vulnerable to retaliation.</p>

          <p>England U21s manager Lee Carsley described his team as "shell-shocked" after their loss to Germany, noting that the first half performance was not good enough.

He emphasized the need for a stronger start in the next game against Spain, warning that giving Spain a two-goal lead would be detrimental. Carsley acknowledged the pressure and expectations on the team, particularly with the absence of key players due to club commitments.</p>

He declined to specify whether those options included the use of GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs requested by Israel to disrupt Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the strength of the economy but noted that new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth.

          <p>The State Department issued new guidelines for more extensive social media vetting of international student visa applicants, instructing consular officers to look for signs of "hostility" toward the United States. Applicants will be asked to set all social media accounts to "public," and failure to do so could be seen as evasive. U.S. officials will look for indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States. This follows a previous announcement that Citizenship and Immigration Services would consider "antisemitic activity on social media" as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, appear to be at odds over the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program. Gabbard has stated that U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, while Trump has dismissed this assessment, claiming that Iran is "very close" to having one. This disagreement highlights a growing rift within Trump's "America First" movement over whether the U.S. should intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict. The situation mirrors arguments made during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, where intelligence findings about weapons of mass destruction ultimately proved to be unfounded.</p>

He promoted false hopes that sentences would be reduced when it was highly unlikely.
