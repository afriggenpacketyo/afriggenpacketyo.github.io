          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans early Friday morning, after creating a hole in their cell wall and shedding their jail uniforms. The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office suspects the inmates received assistance from individuals within the department, as supervisors and lower-level staff members were on duty at the time of the escape. The office also cited defective locks and doors as contributing factors to the breach. The escape has drawn criticism from officials, including Louisiana’s attorney general, who called for an investigation into the security failures and the delay in notifying the public. The FBI is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.</p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is planning to integrate artificial intelligence into its weather forecasting system to improve accuracy, particularly in areas such as typhoon path prediction. A new team was established in April to combine AI predictions based on historical weather data with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system will analyze vast amounts of data to generate forecasts for temperature and rainfall. While AI will play a significant role, human forecasters will still oversee the process and issue final weather reports and disaster alerts. The agency is also exploring the use of deep learning to process observational data from the Himawari-10 weather satellite, which is set to begin operation in fiscal 2029.</p>

          <p>The Chicago area experienced a rare dust storm on Friday, leading to significantly reduced visibility on several Interstate highways and ground stops at both Midway and O'Hare International Airports. The National Weather Service issued multiple dust storm warnings as a wall of dust moved through the region at 50 mph. Some areas also experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of showers and storms coinciding with the dust storm. While the most significant storm threat remained east of I-55, the dust storm caused widespread disruptions, and some schools closed due to power outages from earlier severe weather.</p>

Toru Fujii, head of the brewery, hopes that opening up to overseas participants will eventually lead to increased exports to Europe. Despite some concerns within the domestic industry about revealing trade secrets, Fujii believes that increasing sake's global appeal is essential to counteract the shrinking domestic market.</p>

Right-wing lawmakers also derailed Trump’s signature legislation in the House of Representatives, preventing its passage through a key committee. These events occurred as Trump concluded a tour of Arab nations in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, but notably excluding Israel.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to release the audio recordings of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur, despite objections from the Biden administration. A four-minute audio clip of the interview released Friday evening showed Mr. Biden speaking softly and haltingly as he struggled to recall key dates. Republicans have long sought the release of the audio, arguing it might offer evidence of a decline in Mr. Biden’s mental acuity. Hur's report, released in 2024, declined to recommend charges against Mr. Biden but described him as “an elderly man with a poor memory,” sparking controversy.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The life-size statue, which had been in place since 2020, was found to be missing on Tuesday, with only its feet remaining. Residents suspect the theft was either an act of vandalism or a means to melt the statue down for cash. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze, had been commissioned by an American artist as an interrogation of President Trump’s harsh stance on immigration. While the town has capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump, some locals felt the statue was unaesthetic and did not flatter her.</p>

Senator Chris Murphy, who once vouched for Biden's readiness for re-election, now admits he had "no doubt" about Biden's cognitive decline. Representative Ro Khanna, another Biden advisory board member, stated it was “obvious now” that Mr. Biden “was not in a condition to run for re-election.” As the Democratic Party seeks to rebuild trust, some strategists believe confronting the handling of the 2024 race is necessary.</p>

          <p>Tesla has changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breaches of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares to initiate or maintain a derivative proceeding, a stake worth over $30 billion. This change takes advantage of a Texas state law, where Tesla is incorporated, allowing corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits. Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert, notes this would be a significant barrier to bringing lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty against Tesla insiders.</p>

This would be the first time Japan has successfully received fugitives from the UK, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The California Board of Environmental Safety voted to rescind a proposal that would have allowed municipal landfills to accept contaminated soil, which is currently required to be dumped at sites specifically designated and approved for hazardous waste. Concerns were raised that the change could result in toxic dust blowing into communities near local landfills or dangerous chemicals leaching into groundwater. State officials initially argued that the current rules make it difficult and expensive to dispose of contaminated soil. Environmental advocates rallied outside of the DTSC offices in Cypress, calling on state officials to uphold California’s hazardous waste standards for contaminated soil.</p>

This downgrade means that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the United States their highest rating. The rating agency expressed concerns about the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs.
