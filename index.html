          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have unveiled a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its comprehensive terms. The proposal mandates an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of Israeli hostages and remains in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and the destruction of Hamas's infrastructure. It envisions a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee overseeing Gaza, supervised by an international "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, with former UK PM Tony Blair involved. While leaving the door open for a Palestinian state after reforms, Trump warned Israel would have full US backing to "finish the job" if Hamas rejects the plan.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Tuesday, with the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate decision serving as a key regional focus. A Reuters poll anticipates the RBA will hold its cash rate steady at 3.6%, as elevated inflation continues to constrain its ability to ease monetary policy. Experts suggest that any shift in the RBA's commentary or future guidance could significantly impact Australian dollar crosses, particularly after recent fluctuations in building approvals. While major indices in Japan and Australia saw minor changes, South Korea's Kospi gained, and U.S. markets closed higher overnight, reflecting broader economic sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday morning, with its projected path leading it away from the southeastern United States. This ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season is currently causing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions across the northwestern Bahamas. The National Hurricane Center expects Imelda to make a sharp turn east-northeast, heading towards Bermuda by Wednesday. While moving away from the U.S. mainland, swells generated by Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are anticipated to create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along much of the U.S. East Coast, urging coastal residents to exercise caution.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, challenging the president's directive to deploy 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland. Attorney General Dan Rayfield contends that President Trump's federalization of the Guard lacks constitutional authority, emphasizing that Oregon communities are stable and capable of managing public safety without federal interference. The White House defends the deployment as a lawful measure to protect federal assets and personnel from what it describes as "violent riots." Local officials, including Governor Tina Kotek, have criticized the move as an abuse of power, warning it will compromise residents' safety and autonomy.</p>

          <p>The Senate has returned to Washington facing an imminent government shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans continue to trade blame over a funding impasse. Democrats are advocating for a stopgap measure that includes extending expiring health insurance subsidies and rolling back certain Medicaid restrictions, which Republicans have deemed unacceptable. With a GOP majority in both chambers and the White House, Democrats are under pressure to leverage this funding fight to advance their policy priorities. However, President Trump and Republican leaders insist on a "clean" continuing resolution, escalating the political stalemate and increasing the likelihood of federal agencies halting non-essential functions.</p>

          <p>A Florida-based multi-agency task force, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), has achieved a record-breaking seizure of one million pounds of cocaine in fiscal year 2025. This massive haul, equivalent to 378 million lethal doses, represents an estimated $11.34 billion in denied revenue for cartels and narco-terrorists. The task force, operating across 42 million square miles, collaborates with partner nations to disrupt illicit drug flows and weaken transnational criminal organizations. This unprecedented seizure highlights intensified counter-narcotics efforts by the Trump administration, which has also designated several groups as foreign terrorist organizations and targeted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro for alleged drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. A jury found Javice guilty of multiple fraud and conspiracy charges after she misrepresented Frank's customer numbers, inflating them from under 300,000 to over five million, which influenced JPMorgan's $175 million acquisition in 2021. During the sentencing, Judge Alvin Hellerstein acknowledged Javice's remorse but stressed the need for deterrence. Beyond her prison term, Javice is ordered to pay $22.36 million in forfeiture and $287 million in restitution to JPMorgan, underscoring the significant legal repercussions for such corporate misconduct.</p>

          <p>California and a coalition of other Democratic-led states have initiated another lawsuit against the Trump administration, accusing it of illegally stripping them of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal security and disaster relief funding. The states assert that these funding reductions are a direct retaliation for their "sanctuary" policies and refusal to aid federal immigration enforcement, contravening recent judicial decisions. California Attorney General Rob Bonta condemned the action as an unlawful coercion tactic, arguing it undermines states' autonomy in deploying law enforcement resources. The lawsuit aims to secure a temporary restraining order to prevent the reallocation of funds, emphasizing that the cuts are politically driven rather than based on genuine security assessments.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown threatening federal operations, this article explains that members of Congress and the President are constitutionally guaranteed to continue receiving their salaries. Their compensation is permanently appropriated, meaning it is not subject to annual funding renewals, unlike most federal agencies. In contrast, hundreds of thousands of federal employees face delayed pay or potential furloughs, though those in critical positions must continue working without immediate compensation. While a 2019 law ensures back pay for furloughed federal employees once funding is restored, federal contractors lack this guarantee, highlighting a significant disparity in financial security during a shutdown.</p>

The Antideficiency Act governs these operations, with exceptions for protecting life and property.

Key initiatives include advancing exploration of critical metals like copper, lithium, and nickel, developing ultra-pure and advanced rare earth materials, and enhancing recycling efforts. This move addresses depressed processing fees and squeezed smelter margins within the state-dominated sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article raises concerns about Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's unusual decision to summon over 800 generals and admirals from around the world to a single in-person meeting in Quantico, Virginia. The Atlantic questions the necessity and security implications of gathering such a large portion of top military command, the Secretary, and the President in one location. Speculation ranges from a lecture on "warrior ethos" and a "loyalty check" amidst leaks, to a potential mass firing or a significant reorganization announcement. The article suggests this move is more about Hegseth asserting authority and demonstrating toughness rather than addressing substantive national defense issues responsibly.</p>

This "hiatus" stemmed from Kay's habit of sharing private family matters with the media, which Matthew would subsequently read about in the news. The turning point occurred after she gave a media tour of his childhood home without his permission, driven by her immense pride. Matthew explained that he needed to achieve greater stability in his public life before fully trusting her again. Their relationship has since reconciled, with Matthew now openly encouraging his mother to speak freely. The two are even co-starring in the upcoming film "The Lost Bus."</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has revealed that former UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair will join an international "Board of Peace" responsible for supervising Gaza's temporary governance, as part of a new American peace plan. Blair, who previously held a Middle East envoy role, endorsed the 20-point proposal as the "best chance of ending two years of war, misery and suffering." This comprehensive plan aims to demilitarize and redevelop Gaza, mandating an immediate cessation of hostilities, the release of all hostages, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces. Blair's acceptance indicates a departure from earlier Trump administration concepts that involved the forced displacement of Palestinians, which Blair's office had publicly opposed.</p>
