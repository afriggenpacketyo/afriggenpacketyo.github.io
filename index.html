        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters in Los Angeles triggered by immigration enforcement operations, National Guard troops have been deployed. Protests erupted across L.A. County, leading to multiple arrests and injuries to federal officers, with the LAPD emphasizing its non-participation in civil immigration enforcement due to the California Values Act. The Trump administration affirmed its commitment to continuing immigration enforcement, while California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and initiated a lawsuit, accusing the president of illegally activating the National Guard. Former Vice President Kamala Harris and Representative Maxine Waters also voiced their concerns over the escalation and its potential to provoke further chaos as protesters blocked freeways, vandalized vehicles, and clashed with authorities, resulting in numerous arrests and property damage. </p>

          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are reducing hiring and not replacing departing workers, resulting in a decline in job vacancies. Between March and May, the number of available jobs decreased by 63,000, while the unemployment rate experienced a slight increase. According to the Office for National Statistics, there is a weakening trend in the labor market, accompanied by a notable reduction in the number of individuals on payrolls. This contraction coincides with increased National Insurance Contributions paid by employers and the implementation of a minimum wage increase in April. </p>

          <p>Temu and Shein are increasingly focusing on Europe as U.S. consumer spending declines due to unfavorable trade policies, however, they may face similar regulatory challenges in the EU. Consumer spending on Temu in the U.S. fell approximately 36% in May year-over-year, while Shein's spending decreased by 13% during the same period. The EU is preparing a new two-euro flat fee on previously customs-free small packages, and complaints have been filed against both companies for alleged unsavory business tactics. Despite increased ad spending and operational expansion in Europe, stricter regulations on product safety and consumer protection could pose significant hurdles for these platforms. </p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane," provided testimony in the rapper's federal trial for sex crimes, recounting instances of alleged abuse and coercion during their relationship. Legal experts suggest Jane's testimony could powerfully corroborate Cassie Ventura's account if the jury finds similarities between their experiences, and video evidence of Jane's injuries, which included a bruised eye and welts on her forehead, was shown in court. However, the prosecution's evidence of Jane Doe’s alleged coercion centers more on emotional manipulation than violence, which could prove to be a weakness for the prosecution case because Jane’s evidence was introduced later in the trial, closer to when the jurors will deliberate. Jane also testified to being with Diddy when she saw the video of the rapper assaulting Cassie Ventura at the InterContinental Hotel in 2016. </p>

Belgian investigators have uncovered at least 28 similar consignment switches since 2023, involving an estimated 28 tonnes of ketamine.

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in global fertility rates, with hundreds of millions of people unable to have their desired number of children. The report cites the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as primary reasons, based on a survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries. While urging caution against panicky policies, the UNFPA emphasizes that many individuals are undershooting their fertility ideals due to financial limitations and lack of time. The report also notes that some countries are experiencing low fertility, population ageing, population stagnation used as an excuse to implement nationalist, anti-migrant policies and gender conservative policies. </p>

This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of naloxone, less deadly fentanyl, more accessible addiction healthcare, and safer drug choices among teens and twenty-somethings. Despite this positive trend, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential funding cuts to addiction services could jeopardize the progress. While a major decline in drug related deaths is a positive trend, there is still a long way to go. </p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while the company’s Ascend chips lag behind US chips by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved through methods like “stacking and clustering.” In an interview with People’s Daily, Ren highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. His comments suggest that US sanctions have not halted China’s technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence. The interview comes as Washington increases restrictions on China, with Huawei at the center of the storm. </p>
