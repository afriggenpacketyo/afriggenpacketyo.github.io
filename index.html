          <p>Tripadvisor's 2025 Transparency Report indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, more than double the amount detected in 2022. This increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems. The company uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to moderate reviews. Tripadvisor categorizes fake submissions into boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, and uses AI and behavioral biometrics to identify patterns and penalize violators.

          <p>Donald Trump's tariffs are threatening European winemakers, particularly in Burgundy, France, a prestigious wine region with the US as its biggest export market.
