          <p>Following the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, a political violence expert suggests that public discourse is focusing on the wrong questions. Arie Perliger, a UMass Lowell professor, argues that obsessing over an assassin's individual political affiliation is less productive than examining the broader societal conditions that enable such acts. He identifies high political polarization and a dysfunctional political system, where leaders delegitimize opponents, as key factors that create an environment where violence becomes normalized. Perliger suggests this erodes trust in democratic processes and pushes individuals toward extreme actions.</p>

          <p>The General Services Administration (GSA) is urgently seeking to lease hundreds of private office properties across the U.S. to support a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. This "ICE surge" initiative is designed to accommodate thousands of new enforcement officers being hired as part of a government-wide effort to increase arrests and deportations. The move has caused frustration among some GSA employees, who are now reversing recent downsizing efforts and renegotiating leases at higher rates to meet ICE's urgent demands for space in at least 19 cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the latest interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A new $50,000 home equity loan with a 15-year term now has an average monthly payment of about $487, a modest decrease from earlier in the year. The article breaks down the costs for different loan terms and compares them to previous periods, noting that while the changes are not dramatic, they can lead to significant savings over the life of the loan. It also briefly compares the product to a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article examines the historical tension within American higher education, which has been pulled between three competing functions: providing cultural formation, preparing students for careers, and advancing academic research. It traces this conflict back to the late 19th century, contrasting the classical, culture-focused college model with the rise of the modern university, which emphasized practical skills and research. The author argues that this fundamental debate over the purpose of a college degree has never been fully resolved and continues to fuel contemporary discussions about the value and "return on investment" of higher education today.</p>

          <p>While speaking at a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump suggested a potential breakthrough in the Russia-Ukraine war could be imminent. Trump stated he hopes to "have some good news" soon, citing his obligation to end the long-running conflict in which millions have died. He also expressed disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, "He's really let me down." Trump admitted the war has been more difficult to resolve than he anticipated, despite having claimed during his campaign that he could end it in a single day.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with attorneys general from seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary, Ticketmaster. The suit alleges that the companies enabled ticket brokers to purchase large quantities of tickets, which were then resold to consumers at significantly inflated prices. The complaint accuses the live-event giant of violating consumer protection laws by privately benefiting from a broker system it publicly claims to oppose. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit filed in May that accused the companies of illegally monopolizing the live entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has carried out its first deportation under a new pilot agreement with France, sending an Indian national who had crossed the Channel by small boat to Paris. The "one in, one out" scheme allows for the exchange of migrants in an effort to deter illegal crossings. The deportation proceeded despite ongoing legal challenges that have sought to block the removal of other migrants on modern slavery and trafficking grounds. In return, the UK is expected to accept its first asylum seeker from France through a new legal route in the coming days.</p>

It examines how athletes attempt to unsettle rivals to gain a competitive edge in a sport decided by fractions of a second. Featuring insights from former champions like Ato Boldon, the piece discusses various strategies, from overt intimidation in the call room to projecting quiet confidence. However, it also notes that such "mind games" can backfire if they provide motivation to an opponent or cause the instigator to lose focus.</p>

          <p>This article traces the political evolution of Jimmy Kimmel, whose recent suspension by ABC marks a culmination of his years-long feud with Donald Trump. Initially known for his apolitical, "regular guy" persona on shows like "The Man Show," Kimmel began incorporating politics into his monologues in 2017 following personal experiences with the healthcare system and a mass shooting in his hometown. His emotional commentary transformed him into a prominent liberal voice and a frequent critic of Trump, who in turn repeatedly attacked the host and reportedly pressured Disney executives to rein him in as early as 2018.</p>

          <p>Two Israeli soldiers were killed in an attack at the King Hussein Bridge crossing between the West Bank and Jordan. The perpetrator, a Jordanian driver delivering humanitarian aid destined for Gaza, was shot and killed by security forces at the scene. In response, Israel's military recommended a temporary halt to aid convoys from Jordan pending a security review. The incident occurred as Israel also launched a series of airstrikes against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and reported its first four soldier deaths since beginning its ground offensive into Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The agency, Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, was cited for a "long record of deficiencies directly tied to patient harm," following reports of organs being procured from patients who still showed signs of life. Kennedy stated the move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to restore trust in the organ donation process, which has been damaged by patient safety scandals.</p>

          <p>Southern California is experiencing its first significant rainfall in months as moisture from a former tropical storm moves through the region. While the rain has brought cooler, muggy conditions and caused some localized flooding, meteorologists say it will have only a marginal effect on the upcoming wildfire season. Officials note that much more precipitation is needed to significantly reduce the fire threat ahead of the dangerous Santa Ana winds season. The region remains in a state of severe drought despite the unusual September storm, which is not expected to provide long-term relief.</p>
