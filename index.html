          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. New York City Mayor Eric Adams stated the shooter, identified as Shane Tamura from Las Vegas, was targeting the NFL offices located in the building. Investigators found a note in which Tamura, a former high school football player, expressed belief that he suffered from CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. The attack occurred after Tamura apparently took the wrong elevator, leading him to a different company's offices where he began his rampage.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk plummeted after it announced a leadership change and lowered its financial outlook. The company cited weaker growth expectations for its popular Wegovy obesity drug in the United States, attributing the slowdown to competition from compounded drugs and a slower-than-anticipated market expansion. Company veteran Maziar Mike Doustdar was appointed as the new CEO. The firm now projects full-year sales growth of 8% to 14%, a significant reduction from its previous forecast of 13% to 21%, signaling challenges ahead for its key products.

          <p>PayPal reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading the company to raise its full-year guidance for profitability and earnings per share. Despite the positive results, the company's stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading. Key metrics like total payment volume and active accounts showed healthy growth, with Venmo revenue increasing by over 20%. CEO Alex Chriss's strategy has focused on improving profitability by monetizing key assets like Venmo and Braintree, which appears to be yielding positive results for the payment giant.

          <p>A military tribunal in Beirut has sentenced a man to death for the murder of Irish soldier Private Seán Rooney, who was killed during a UN peacekeeping mission in December 2022. The main defendant, Mohammad Ayyad, was convicted in absentia and remains at large, a point of dissatisfaction for the Irish government. Three other soldiers were injured in the attack on their armored vehicle. While welcoming the conviction, Irish officials expressed disappointment over what they considered lenient sentences for other men involved in the shooting, stressing the need for justice for peacekeepers.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club announced the sale of 25 shares of Eli Lilly, locking in a significant profit. The decision was prompted by disappointing news from Novo Nordisk, a primary competitor in the GLP-1 drug market, which saw its stock plunge after cutting its sales forecast due to weaker U.S. demand and slower market expansion. While acknowledging that Novo Nordisk's competition struggles could benefit Eli Lilly, the club expressed concern over the signals of a slowing market. They opted to reduce their position to mitigate risk ahead of Eli Lilly's upcoming earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, many importers have either absorbed the initial tariff costs as a hit to their profits or held shipments abroad to await clarity on the new trade policies. While some targeted price increases have occurred, the full impact on shoppers has been blunted, though experts warn this may be a temporary reprieve.</p>

          <p>Contrary to widespread pessimism, recent data suggests that the institution of marriage in the United States may be stabilizing and even strengthening. Divorce rates have fallen by nearly 40% since the 1980s, and the share of children living in two-parent married families has slightly increased since 2012. After decades of decline, the marriage rate among prime-age adults has also shown a modest uptick since 2020. The author argues that marriage is adapting, with husbands contributing more to childcare, and continues to offer significant benefits in happiness, health, and financial security for both men and women.</p>

The procession will take place on Wednesday, moving along Broad Street to the Black Sabbath Bridge and bench, which has become a memorial site with numerous tributes. The event, funded by Osbourne's family, allows the public to honor the late Black Sabbath singer, who died on July 22 at age 76.

          <p>Enthusiasts at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in the UK have meticulously restored the fuselage of a de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial passenger jet. The Comet, which first flew with paying passengers in 1952, ushered in the jet age with unprecedented speed and comfort but was plagued by a series of catastrophic structural failures that led to its grounding. The restoration project has recreated the plane's luxurious 1950s interior, offering a unique glimpse into the dawn of jet travel.

Reform has pledged to scrap the law, arguing it suppresses free speech without effectively protecting children. Farage condemned Kyle's comments as "absolutely disgusting" and demanded an apology. The new law requires tech firms to implement stricter age verification and content moderation to prevent children from seeing harmful material, a move some critics claim is ineffective.</p>

          <p>A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reveals that while most U.S. adults use AI for information searches, younger generations are more likely to integrate it into other aspects of their lives. About 60% of adults under 30 use AI for brainstorming ideas, compared to just 20% of those 60 or older. Younger adults are also more likely to use AI for work-related tasks and drafting emails. The findings highlight a generational divide in AI adoption, suggesting that while the technology is becoming ubiquitous for search, its role as a productivity assistant is still emerging.</p>

The alert, while stopping short of a formal famine declaration, warns of widespread death without immediate, large-scale humanitarian intervention and an end to hostilities.

          <p>A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia, brokered by Malaysia, has been met with cautious optimism after days of deadly border clashes. The truce aims to de-escalate tensions over disputed territory that killed dozens and displaced around 200,000 people. Analysts suggest the ceasefire may hold as both sides have achieved political objectives, with the conflict weakening the Thaksin dynasty in Thailand while strengthening the Hun family's rule in Cambodia. However, concerns remain about the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism to enforce the agreement, though pressure from the U.S. involving potential trade tariffs may have helped facilitate the deal.</p>
