            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-08 11:12:26 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>President Trump's administration aims to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. by imposing steep tariffs on trading partners. However, Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, believes that the 49% tariff on Cambodian goods will not result in manufacturing reshoring to the U.S. Instead, manufacturers are considering relocating their supply chains to countries like Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. The tariff has caused uncertainty, leading to paused orders and potential factory closures in Cambodia, while the Cambodian government explores fiscal policies to mitigate the pressure. </p>

            <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla received a warm welcome during their state visit to Italy, marked by a flypast over Rome featuring the Red Arrows and Frecce Tricolori, symbolizing closer military ties between the UK and Italy. The royal couple was greeted by Italy's President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale Palace, which has historically housed popes, kings, and presidents. The visit, coinciding with their 20th wedding anniversary, aims to strengthen the alliance between Italy and the UK, particularly in supporting Ukraine, and to "reset" relations with European neighbors after Brexit.</p>

            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the U.S. is seeking "fair deals" with every country through tariff negotiations, suggesting potential flexibility in the Trump administration's trade policies. Trump, however, threatened to veto a bipartisan bill requiring congressional approval of tariffs and to impose additional tariffs on China for retaliatory measures. A senior White House official mentioned a potential total tariff of 104% on China, adding to existing reciprocal tariffs. Bessent believes that China is in a weaker position due to the trade imbalance between the two countries.</p>

This initiative reiterates a decision from November and is part of broader efforts to stabilize the domestic economy and boost market confidence against the impact of escalating trade tensions with the U.S., especially after the U.S. imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting countermeasures from Beijing.</p>

Economists predict that the Bank of England will cut interest rates more than previously expected to mitigate an economic downturn. This anticipated easing of monetary policy is expected to influence mortgage companies to price in the potential rate cuts, leading to a decrease in mortgage rates.</p>

            <p>Walmart's membership program, Walmart+, is emerging as a key driver of store traffic and online sales, potentially providing a buffer against the economic impact of tariffs and recession fears. Walmart+ members account for nearly 50% of spending on Walmart's website and app, shopping twice as much and spending nearly three times as much as non-member customers. The program's growth is seen as a "frequency driver," helping Walmart maintain low prices and invest in competitive areas. Walmart is expected to provide updates on its membership program and other alternative revenue streams at an upcoming investor event.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk reportedly made several personal attempts to persuade Donald Trump to reconsider his global tariff surge, which has caused significant market turmoil. Musk's efforts were unsuccessful, highlighting a potential rift between the two figures, especially as Musk leads White House efforts to curb federal spending. Musk also publicly advocated for zero tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union. The disagreement follows reports that Musk may leave his government role to focus on his businesses, which have faced challenges amid backlash to his political involvement.</p>

            <p>Experts suggest that China's centralized political system, dominated by the Communist Party, may give it an advantage in the trade war with the U.S. compared to other countries. China's system allows for "macroscopic prevention, adjustment and shifting" to address the trade war's impact on its economy and industry. However, some experts warn that Chinese companies and local governments may lack the creativity to respond effectively due to their reliance on central government directives. If the trade war leads to a sharp decline in China’s exports to the US, it would “have a catastrophic impact on the economy and damage people’s livelihoods and social stability”, Zhu said.</p>

Vietnam has become a manufacturing hub for companies like Nike, Adidas, and Apple, and many Chinese manufacturers have relocated there to avoid U.S. tariffs.
