          <p>Progressive "Squad" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib's campaign reportedly spent over $35,000 on luxury limousine services from October 2024 to September 2025, according to Federal Election Commission filings. These expenditures, made to "Aline Luxury Limo Services," are listed as "travel" and "transportation" expenses. The spending draws criticism given Tlaib's public stance against wealth inequality and corporate greed, as she has championed legislation like the "Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act." This article highlights a perceived contradiction between her political advocacy and campaign expenditures.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris admitted he will face "consequences" for his first-lap collision with teammate Oscar Piastri at the Singapore Grand Prix. The incident, where Norris ran into Max Verstappen's car and damaged his front wing, led to internal team accountability. McLaren's fundamental rule is to avoid crashing with teammates, and while this was a minor contact, it generated controversy. Red Bull's Max Verstappen jokingly suggested McLaren favored Norris, a claim later clarified as a jest, while Piastri expressed satisfaction with the team's unbiased approach.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, former National Security Adviser to President Trump, has been indicted in Maryland on 18 criminal counts for allegedly mishandling classified information. The indictment claims Bolton shared over a thousand pages of diary entries, some with top-secret classifications, with two unnamed relatives via non-governmental email. His lawyer denies wrongdoing, stating the records were unclassified personal diaries known to the FBI since 2021. This article highlights Bolton's defense, the nature of the charges, and the broader context of other Trump critics facing indictments.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is facing repercussions after suggesting federal troops be deployed to San Francisco, leading prominent tech investor Ron Conway to resign from the Salesforce Foundation board.

While Benioff later clarified his stance, the initial remarks sparked controversy.

          <p>President Trump announced that the cost of IVF drugs will "dramatically" decrease, with a major component's per-cycle cost expected to fall by an estimated 73% for consumers. This reduction stems from price negotiations with biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono, which agreed to provide "massive discounts" on fertility drugs like Gonal-f. The administration is also encouraging companies to offer supplemental fertility insurance coverage. This article highlights the financial relief for couples undergoing IVF, although the overall cost of a cycle will not decrease by the same percentage due to other associated fees (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Americans are experiencing a significant surge in robocalls and robotexts, reaching an average of 2.56 billion calls monthly—the highest in six years—and 19 billion robotexts annually. These unsolicited messages, often from crime rings, aim to extract personal information or money through various scams, including impersonating the IRS or package delivery services. The problem is exacerbated by sophisticated AI tools that make scams easier to deploy, and by the failure of many phone companies to implement robocall-fighting software.

          <p>An article reviewing Apple's new "Live Translation" feature for AirPods highlights its significant shortcomings in real-world, noisy environments. Despite promotional promises, the feature struggles with ambient sound, causes delays, and provides inaccurate translations, particularly with regional Spanish dialects. The reviewer experienced issues with the microphone, constant warnings, and the awkwardness of interrupting natural conversation. This article concludes that the feature, while conceptually ambitious, fails to deliver a seamless translation experience, flattening human communication rather than enhancing it.</p>

The compact's demands included accepting a two-sex gender definition, restricting foreign student enrollment, and mandating SAT/ACT scores.

          <p>An article analyzes Henry Dwight Sedgwick's 1904 Atlantic story, "The American Coup d’Etat of 1961," as a "frightening American fable" with prescient warnings about the country's trajectory. The story depicts a future where an imperial president, unchecked power, and corporate influence lead to societal collapse and a compromised new order. Sedgwick's work was a critique of the industrial era's materialism and expanding executive power. This article draws parallels between the historical fable's themes—such as economic instability, political chaos, and erosion of democratic norms—and contemporary concerns about American democracy.</p>
