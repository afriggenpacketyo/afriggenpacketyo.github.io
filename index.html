          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>UK inflation experienced a decrease to 2.6% in March, primarily driven by a reduction in petrol prices, according to official data. However, analysts anticipate a potential rise in inflation starting from April due to escalating bills and higher business expenses. While wages are currently outpacing inflation, economists predict that April's inflation figures may reach around 3% due to increased gas, electricity, and water prices. The impact of Trump's trade wars is also expected to affect UK exports and investments, potentially weakening the economy and increasing unemployment.</p>

            <p>Families are reporting that civil rights investigations in schools have been stalled due to federal cuts to the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). One mother describes her daughter, who has disabilities, being repeatedly secluded in a padded room at school, leading her to file a complaint with OCR. The office, which lost over 40% of its staff, is facing a lawsuit aiming to force action on such complaints. Advocates worry that the cuts will undermine civil rights protections for students with disabilities, who often rely on OCR to address systemic discrimination.</p>

The Worldwide Painted Lady Migration Project identified ten generations of butterflies within their annual migratory cycle, which follows seasonal rains and blooming flowers. Photographer Lucas Foglia documented the butterflies' trek and their interactions with people, noting their adaptation to climate change by altering routes to find blooming flowers. Foglia also drew parallels between the butterflies' border crossings and the experiences of human migrants, highlighting interconnectedness between human history and nature.</p>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as its new trade envoy, replacing Wang Shouwen, amidst escalating trade tensions with the US. The appointment comes as officials criticize the U.S.'s "tariff barriers and trade bullying" for impacting the global economy. China's GDP growth exceeded expectations, but officials warned of economic challenges ahead due to U.S. tariffs. Li Chenggang, a former assistant commerce minister and WTO ambassador, will play a key role in future negotiations, should they arise.</p>

            <p>The U.S. government is transferring control of a federal land strip along the U.S.-Mexico border to the Department of Defense, allowing the military to control the area as part of a base. This move potentially enables troops to detain intruders, including migrants, circumventing federal laws restricting military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The Department of Defense will test control of a section of the Roosevelt Reservation in New Mexico, erecting fences and posting warning signs. Unauthorized individuals could face arrest, and detained migrants will be handed over to civilian law enforcement agencies.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs, which led to a temporary suspension of the duties. Yields on the 10-year Treasury surged, prompting questions about who was selling and why. While China's role as a major creditor is scrutinized, analysts debate whether selling Treasuries would harm China's own investments. Japan's life insurers are also under scrutiny as potential sellers, driven by concerns about U.S. policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

While Columbia University agreed to many demands after funding cuts, Harvard has drawn a line, leading to a battle over academic freedom and federal oversight.</p>
