        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed threats to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S., a move that could significantly damage Britain's already fragile film industry. The UK's sector, a substantial economic contributor, is heavily dependent on U.S. partnerships, with American studios accounting for 65% of its production spending. This potential tariff, reiterated by Trump who claims other countries have "stolen" the movie-making business, adds to existing challenges like struggling box office sales and rising streaming competition. Industry experts are debating the practicality of such tariffs, with some suggesting it might prompt the UK to explore more co-production opportunities with European and Asian territories.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced an independent inquiry into "repeated failures" at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust's maternity units, following reports of potentially avoidable harm to babies and mothers. A BBC investigation revealed 56 baby deaths and two mother deaths in five years might have been preventable, with over 70 families describing traumatic care. The trust acknowledges the need for improvements, while bereaved families advocate for Donna Ockenden, who led similar reviews, to chair the investigation. This inquiry aims to uncover the truth and address systemic issues, as the units were recently downgraded to "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open higher this week, showing resilience despite recent volatility driven by concerns over bad loans in the U.S. banking sector. Key indices such as the U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, and France's CAC 40 are all projected to see positive gains. Analysts note that while U.S. lenders faced issues, European banks have largely reported solid results without significant negative surprises. This positive outlook comes ahead of a busy week for earnings reports in Europe and the U.S., alongside crucial inflation data, which will continue to shape market sentiment.

          <p>Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz has been elected Bolivia's new president, securing 54% of the vote against right-wing rival Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga in a runoff election. This victory signals a major political shift, ending two decades of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism party, as voters expressed frustration over the country's economic crisis. Paz, who gained traction with working-class and rural voters, plans to implement gradual free-market reforms, including ending the fixed exchange rate and phasing out fuel subsidies, while aiming to maintain social protections. He faces the daunting task of stabilizing an economy plagued by dollar shortages and high inflation.</p>

          <p>Former England striker Wayne Rooney has stated that Alexander Isak, Liverpool's British-record signing, does not merit a starting position over Hugo Ekitike. Isak, who joined from Newcastle for £125m, has scored only one goal in seven appearances, none in his last three Premier League starts. Rooney attributes Isak's struggles to a lack of pre-season training, suggesting he's "paying the price" for a disrupted preparation. This critique comes as Liverpool faces its first four-game losing streak since 2014, with Rooney also noting a perceived complacency and increased pressure on manager Arne Slot.</p>

Challenges include cumbersome planning processes, environmental regulations, and skill shortages. Reed remains confident, outlining reforms like forcing councils to adopt local plans faster and granting him more powers to review rejected schemes, alongside a "grey belt" concept for low-quality green belt land.</p>

U.S. President Trump also affirmed the ceasefire was still in place, suggesting "rebels within" Hamas might be responsible for the shooting.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in "No Kings" rallies across the U.S. and worldwide to protest President Trump's policies, which Republicans criticized as "Hate America" events. Demonstrators expressed outrage over the administration's actions, including cracking down on undocumented migrants, deploying National Guard troops, and perceived authoritarian tendencies. Major cities like New York, Boston, and Los Angeles saw large turnouts, with many participants emphasizing a "fierce love for our country." While some protests saw tensions, particularly in Portland, the events were largely peaceful, with participants signaling their intent to resist what they view as chaos and cruelty.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen, after winning the United States Grand Prix, acknowledged for the first time that securing a fifth world championship is a real possibility, embracing the "positive pressure." Having gained 64 points in the last four races, he has significantly closed the gap to McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Verstappen attributes his resurgence to finding a better balance with his Red Bull car and recent upgrades, proving competitive even on a "normal" circuit like Austin. With five races remaining, his dominant form suggests he could continue closing in, despite upcoming tracks that might favor McLaren's strengths.</p>

          <p>Artillery shrapnel from a U.S. Marine Corps celebration at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance, struck at least two vehicles on a California highway, sparking a political dispute between state and federal officials. Governor Gavin Newsom vehemently criticized the decision to fire live munitions over Interstate 5, calling it "dangerous" and a "vanity project" by Donald Trump and Vance. Vance's communications director, William Martin, accused Newsom of stoking fears. The incident, which saw a 155mm shell detonate prematurely, led to the cancellation of further firings and an ongoing investigation by the Marine Corps.</p>

          <p>Bereaved families are urgently calling for a public inquiry into what they describe as "repeated failures" by the UK government to protect vulnerable individuals from websites promoting suicide. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation claims government departments received 65 warnings about such online forums since 2019, but failed to act, leading to at least 133 deaths linked to a toxic chemical promoted by these sites. Families argue that coroners' warnings have been ignored and current regulations are insufficient. They seek accountability and systemic changes to protect mental health, emphasizing that current responses are fragmented and slow.</p>

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested during a late-night operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District, initially sparking widespread concerns about a possible ICE raid due to the presence of unmarked vehicles. Social media posts, including videos showing people confronting law enforcement, fueled these fears, particularly around the popular gay bar The Abbey. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved. The operation was conducted by local law enforcement in response to reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activity in the area.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of leading Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, argues that Elon Musk's vision-only approach to self-driving vehicles is not safe enough, advocating instead for a multi-sensor system. Qiu asserts that Level 3 or 4 driving automation requires additional sensors like LiDAR to address "corner cases" where vision-only systems struggle, such as detecting white cars against the sky or black cars in tunnels. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu notes its cost has significantly decreased while performance has improved. Other auto executives, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, also view LiDAR as "mission critical."</p>

          <p>A California farmer experienced significant financial loss when his entire grape harvest was rejected by his sole winery customer due to subtle climate-induced changes in the grapes' chemistry. This incident underscores the growing challenge of climate volatility, which impacts agricultural planning beyond just droughts or wildfires. The article highlights the precarious position of small growers dependent on single buyers, where strict quality standards can lead to absorbed losses. It offers broader financial lessons on diversification, insuring livelihoods, and reassessing climate risk in investments, while also encouraging support for local supply chains.

The exhibit, "Monuments," displays 18 such pieces alongside contemporary art, directly confronting the "Lost Cause" ideology that romanticizes Confederate figures. Curator Hamza Walker emphasizes that these figures fought for white supremacy, not just states' rights. This initiative comes as President Trump advocates for reinstalling Confederate monuments, contrasting sharply with efforts to re-contextualize or remove symbols tied to slavery and racial injustice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest a simple language shift from "I can't" to "I don't" can effectively help individuals establish boundaries at work and prevent burnout. Career coach Helen Tupper explains that "I don't" is more definitive and less open to negotiation, allowing for clearer communication of personal limits. This advice comes as many workers experience high levels of stress and pressure, with former TV chef Lorraine Pascale sharing her own burnout experience from being unable to say no. The article emphasizes that setting boundaries and adjusting goals to current capacity are crucial for mental and emotional well-being.</p>
