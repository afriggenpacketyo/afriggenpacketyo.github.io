          <h2>UK Nurses to Vote on Pay Deal Amid Strike Threat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 04:08:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a proposed 3.6% pay increase amidst a bitter dispute that previously led to strikes. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the offer, deeming it inadequate and potentially leading to further industrial action. The vote, considered the largest ever launched by the profession in the UK, will determine the next steps in the ongoing conflict over pay and working conditions, with the RCN emphasizing the need for nurses to be valued and fairly compensated to address issues such as staff shortages. The government maintains that the pay rise is the second above-inflation increase for NHS staff in recent months and demonstrates their commitment to rebuilding the health service. Optimism surrounding a resolution is tempered by the RCN's strong opposition and the potential for renewed strikes. </p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is initiating a nationwide strategy to arrest illegal immigrants leaving courtrooms after asylum hearings, focusing on those residing in the U.S. for under two years. The DHS aims to expedite deportations by having immigration judges dismiss cases, allowing for swift removal without a hearing, however, some immigration attorneys believe that the ICE initiative is a scheme for the Trump administration to easily and quickly boost illegal immigrant apprehension numbers. This move is expected to generate controversy, potentially deterring migrants from attending hearings and targeting individuals without criminal records beyond illegal entry. Supporters argue it enforces existing laws and reverses prior policies, while critics claim it targets those seeking legal citizenship and diverts resources from pursuing dangerous criminals. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to address a "challenging" shortage and maintain a safe blood supply. The number of regular donors needs to increase to over one million to avoid a "red alert" situation where demand exceeds capacity, potentially delaying treatment for patients. There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have blood types that can treat sickle cell disease. The appeal comes after an "amber alert" was issued last year due to low stocks, highlighting the importance of regular donations to support patients needing transfusions for conditions like cancer. Increased donor registration is needed to bolster blood supplies. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration has enacted a new presidential proclamation restricting entry to the U.S. for nationals from 12 countries, citing national security concerns and inadequate information sharing. The ban affects individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, with limited exceptions. Additional restrictions, including stricter visa checks, will apply to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The administration argues that these measures are necessary to protect the U.S. from potential security threats, while critics contend that the ban is discriminatory and may have political and economic motivations. </p>

          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, marking the steepest drop in over five years, while overall exports growth missed expectations. Chinese exports to the U.S. fell by 34.5% year-on-year, while imports from the U.S. also decreased. This decline was partially offset by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, the European Union, and Africa. The drop in exports to the U.S. is attributed to prohibitive tariffs, even with a temporary trade truce in place. (not investment advice) </p>

This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference and follows warnings about the environmental damage caused by bottom trawling.
