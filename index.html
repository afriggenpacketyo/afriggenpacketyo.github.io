          <p>Russia launched a major overnight aerial assault across nine Ukrainian regions, killing at least three people and injuring over 30. President Zelenskyy described the attacks on civilian infrastructure and a residential building in Dnipro as a deliberate strategy to intimidate the population. Ukraine's air force reported intercepting a significant number of the 619 drones and missiles launched. In retaliation, Ukraine claims to have successfully targeted major Russian oil refineries in the Samara and Saratov regions, highlighting the escalating cross-border drone warfare and its strategic focus on Russia's economic assets.</p>

The Secret Service detained an armed man exhibiting suspicious behavior at the venue, a former deputy sheriff with expired credentials. The event, designated a Level 1 Special Event, has become a focal point for national debate on political rhetoric following Kirk's assassination, with lawmakers from both parties condemning violence but disagreeing on its causes. Vigils for Kirk are being held nationwide, reflecting a country in mourning and political turmoil.</p>

          <p>Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for Virginia's eastern district, has resigned from his position amid significant pressure from the Trump administration. His departure follows his office's decision not to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political rival of the president, due to insufficient evidence of mortgage fraud. President Trump publicly stated he wanted Siebert "out" and later claimed to have fired him, citing the prosecutor's endorsement by Democratic senators. The move has been criticized as an attack on the rule of law and an escalation of politically motivated actions.</p>

          <p>The armed wing of Hamas has released "farewell" photographs of the 47 remaining hostages in Gaza, warning that Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza City endangers their lives. The group explicitly invoked the case of Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who disappeared in 1986 and is presumed dead, to underscore the potential outcome. Meanwhile, international pressure on Israel is mounting, with a UN conference on the two-state solution scheduled for next week. Officials hope the conference will compel Israel to end the war and address violations of international law regarding humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to clear the country's asylum application backlog. The plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing applicants. Party officials argue this emergency measure is necessary to secure funds and act decisively on an issue impacting asylum seekers, communities, and taxpayers.

          <p>Sacramento police have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of shooting into the lobby of the ABC10 news station. The incident occurred a day after protesters gathered outside the building to demonstrate against the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, which was related to his commentary on the assassination of Charlie Kirk. While a motive has not been confirmed, the shooting left multiple bullet holes in the building's windows, though no one was injured. The suspect, Anibal Hernandez Santana, was identified with FBI assistance and faces multiple charges, including assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Christian nationalist figures in the United States are portraying him as a martyr for their cause, a move experts believe could energize the movement. Kirk's own political trajectory mirrored the rise of Trump-era Christian nationalism, shifting from secular conservatism to embracing a "spiritual battle" for America's soul. Analysts note that this framing, using terms like "holy war" and describing his death as the "seed of the church," is a powerful tool for mobilization.

This national-security agreement grants the White House veto power over strategic decisions like plant closures.

          <p>The United States appears to have shifted its public strategy regarding naval warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump returned to office. Under the previous administration, such freedom-of-navigation operations were regularly and publicly announced as a challenge to Beijing's territorial claims. However, there have only been three known transits under the current administration, which were only confirmed after media inquiries. While Beijing has previously condemned the "public hype," Chinese observers view this change as a tactical shift rather than a substantive change in U.S. policy, as the operations themselves continue.</p>

According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are responsible for this grocery inflation. These include the Trump administration's tariffs on imported goods like coffee, the impacts of climate change forcing food production to shift geographically, and a significant shortage of agricultural labor in the United States. As companies face higher costs from these pressures, they pass them on to consumers, sometimes through "shrinkflation," where the product size decreases but the price remains the same.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark short-term interest rate, long-term rates, including those for mortgages, unexpectedly increased. Bond traders, who influence long-term yields, reacted to the Fed's move by selling off bonds, which drives their yields higher. Analysts suggest these traders are concerned that the Fed may be easing its focus on inflation at a time when the economy remains steady, a risk for longer-duration investments. This divergence highlights the complex relationship between Fed policy and consumer borrowing costs, as higher long-term yields can impact affordability for homes and cars.

          <p>An ongoing severe drought across Vermont is placing significant strain on the state's vital dairy farming industry. The lack of rain has stunted the growth of essential feed crops like corn and grass, forcing farmers to spend thousands of dollars on supplemental feed for their cattle. Some farmers have also had to resort to hauling water daily as their wells run dry, a costly and labor-intensive measure to keep their herds hydrated. With 80% of the state now in a severe or extreme drought, farmers are facing major financial losses from diminished crop yields.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data reveals the cities where household incomes are rising the fastest, with Tampa, Florida, topping the list with a 15% increase between 2023 and 2024. Four of the top ten cities are in California, including Long Beach, San Jose, and San Francisco, which already boast some of the highest median incomes in the country. Much of the growth in Tampa is attributed to rising incomes among its senior population. While many large cities outpaced the modest national income growth of just over 1%, some saw significant increases that still left their median income below the national average.

          <p>This article explores the pervasive issue of impostor syndrome, the feeling that one's accomplishments are fraudulent despite evidence to the contrary. Author Arthur C. Brooks suggests that recognizing this feeling is often a sign of authenticity, as a "true phony" rarely questions themselves. He offers several strategies to combat these feelings of inadequacy, with a primary recommendation being to change one's internal monologue and avoid self-criticism. The piece frames the struggle against impostor syndrome as a journey toward being more honest with oneself and, consequently, with others, helping to align self-perception with reality.</p>

          <p>South African police have arrested five North American citizens and a local farm caretaker after discovering a large-scale methamphetamine lab operating on a farm near Johannesburg. Authorities, acting on a tip about a strange chemical smell, raided the property and found precursor chemicals, manufacturing equipment, and approximately $20 million worth of crystal meth stored in buckets and lunchboxes inside freezers. The five foreign suspects, who were in the country illegally, were apprehended while attempting to flee on foot. Two other suspects, believed to be from West Africa, escaped and remain at large.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers. The order, which cites "abuse" of the program, is set to take effect on September 21 and will apply to new applications for a six-year period. The administration argues the fee will force companies to prioritize hiring Americans, while critics warn it will devastate small businesses and startups that rely on foreign talent. The move represents a significant overhaul of the program, which previously involved administrative fees of around $1,500. (not investment advice)</p>

The patient, Ed Langevin, underwent a minimally invasive procedure at Northwestern Medicine to place a stent in the affected artery, which immediately restored blood flow and resolved his symptoms.

While the COVID-19 pandemic and chronic absenteeism are contributing factors, experts note that this downward trend in student achievement began well before 2020.
