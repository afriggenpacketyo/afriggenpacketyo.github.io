          <p>New Jersey Representative LaMonica McIver has been charged by the Department of Justice for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers outside an ICE detention facility. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated that McIver's actions on May 9, which involved allegedly assaulting and impeding law enforcement, cannot be overlooked. McIver, however, claims the charges are politically motivated and misrepresent her actions during the protest with other members of Congress and Newark's mayor. The charges against Mayor Baraka were dropped, and top House Democrats have voiced their support for McIver, vowing to respond vigorously to what they see as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant jump in their Hong Kong trading debut, rising as much as 14%.

CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite a 9.7% drop in 2024 annual revenue due to intense competition, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>A Mexican naval ship, the Cuauhtémoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuring at least 22 others.

The ship was on a good-will tour with scheduled stops including New York, Jamaica, Cuba, and Iceland.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and a Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, as investors move away from U.S. dollar assets. The Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, topping U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are making emerging markets more attractive.</p>

The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move comes as part of a broader stimulus package, including reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves.

          <p>Ruth López, a leading human rights activist in El Salvador, has been arrested on charges of embezzling state funds, allegations her organization Cristosal denies as politically motivated. López, who leads the anti-corruption and justice program for Cristosal, has been a vocal critic of President Nayib Bukele and has documented human rights abuses in the country. Cristosal has denounced her arrest as a "short-term enforced disappearance" amid a growing crackdown on dissent and closer ties between the Trump administration and the Bukele government.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in passing a sprawling tax and budget bill due to conflicting demands from various Republican factions. Conservatives are pushing for deeper cuts to Medicaid and clean energy tax credits, while moderate lawmakers from competitive districts oppose significant reductions to social programs. Lawmakers from high-tax states are fighting to raise the cap on state and local tax deductions, creating a precarious situation for Johnson with his narrow majority. The bill would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</p>

The agreement aims to ease trade frictions, but specifics regarding timeframes and costs are still being negotiated. Some Brexiteers criticize the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, trading some power for easier trade. The deal will determine the cost, defence cooperation, youth travel, and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. While the government touts a "reset," the trajectory of the relationship remains subject to change with future administrations.</p>
