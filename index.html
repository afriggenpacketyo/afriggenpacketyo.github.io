          <p>The Trump administration has declassified and released 230,000 pages of documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. These files, including extensive FBI surveillance records, had been sealed by a court order since 1977. King's family acknowledged the release but urged the public to consider the context of the government's intense and hostile surveillance campaign against the civil rights leader. The declassification fulfills a campaign promise by the president to release records from several high-profile assassinations from that era.</p>

          <p>Despite China reporting robust economic figures for the first half of 2025, many citizens are experiencing significant financial strain, including wage stagnation and job insecurity. An accountant in Chengdu exemplifies this struggle, finding it impossible to afford a home on a salary that has not increased in five years. This discrepancy highlights a growing gap between official government statistics and the lived economic reality for households and businesses. Experts note that the public's perception reflects a different, less optimistic world than the data suggests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 90 million Americans are under heat alerts as a massive heat dome settles over the U.S. Corn Belt and parts of the Southeast. The National Weather Service warns of feels-like temperatures reaching up to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, exacerbated by high humidity from "corn sweat." While not record-breaking, these temperatures are 10 to 15 degrees above average and pose significant health risks, especially with minimal overnight cooling. Climate analysis indicates that human-caused climate change has made such extreme July heat at least three times more likely.</p>

          <p>At the request of President Trump, the Texas Legislature is holding a special session to redraw the state's congressional districts, aiming to increase the number of Republican-held seats in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting effort is highly unusual and is seen by critics as a purely political maneuver to benefit the GOP in the upcoming midterm elections. The move comes despite ongoing legal challenges to the existing 2021 map, which voting rights groups argue diluted the power of non-White voters. Experts warn the strategy is legally and politically risky for Republicans.</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods in Central Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is urging the Trump administration to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting infrastructure, arguing it will save both lives and money. In a letter, she outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading Doppler radar, replacing old satellites, and improving supercomputing capabilities for more accurate predictions. This plea comes as the administration plans significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which could terminate key research programs aimed at improving flood and storm warnings.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's latest tax bill will increase the U.S. national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations, while offsetting only a fraction of the cost through $1.1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. These cuts are projected to leave 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warns the total addition to the deficit, including interest, will be closer to $4.1 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

Harvard's lawyers contended the move was an attempt to control the university's operations and would harm vital public research without any evidence it would combat antisemitism.

          <p>After a three-month retrial, a jury has convicted former store clerk Pedro Hernandez of murder in the 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz in New York City. The verdict came after nine days of deliberation, resolving a case that had remained a painful, unsolved crime for nearly four decades. Hernandez had confessed to the crime in 2012, but his first trial in 2015 ended in a hung jury. Etan's disappearance was a landmark case that led to new law enforcement practices and heightened parental awareness regarding child safety.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, was arrested in connection with a fire at a San Jose post office. Police responded to reports of a vehicle on fire inside the building's lobby early Sunday morning. Authorities are investigating the incident as a potentially intentional act, and Tillman was booked on an arson charge. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career to enlist in the Army after 9/11 and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004, a story that captured national attention.</p>

          <p>A fragile, U.S.-backed truce has temporarily halted over a week of deadly sectarian clashes in Syria's southern Sweida province between the Druze religious minority and Sunni Muslim tribes. The violence, which killed over 1,200 people and displaced more than 128,000, also drew in Syrian government forces and prompted Israeli airstrikes. The conflict highlights the immense challenges facing Syria's new government under President Ahmad al-Sharaa as it struggles to unite the country and disarm militias formed during the 14-year civil war. The instability in the region raises fears it could derail Syria's delicate post-war recovery.</p>

This is the first time anyone close to the former president has mentioned Ambien in connection with the debate, which preceded his withdrawal from the 2024 race.

The analysis points to the stock forming a "cup and handle" pattern, a technical indicator often seen as bullish, with a potential price target between $950 and $1,550. This forecast comes as Coinbase, which was recently added to the S&P 500, launched perpetual futures trading in the U.S. The company's stock has performed strongly, hitting an all-time high on the same day a major crypto-related bill was signed into law.

          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 2025, the average rates for both products are nearly identical, with a HELOC at 8.27% and a home equity loan at 8.28%, resulting in almost the same monthly payment. However, a key difference is that home equity loan rates are fixed, while HELOC rates are variable and can change with market conditions. Homeowners must consider their risk tolerance for potential rate increases when choosing between the two options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are offering unusually high interest rates, making them an attractive option for parking a sum like $20,000. Before investing, savers should consider that while short-term CDs provide protection against market fluctuations, long-term CDs may yield more total interest over time despite having slightly lower rates. Furthermore, the most competitive CD rates are typically offered by online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional brick-and-mortar institution. It is important to weigh these factors to make an informed decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The late investor Charlie Munger, former vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, held a famously blunt view on homeownership, once stating he didn't care if single people ever bought a house. At a 1998 shareholder meeting, he advised that the time to buy a house is simply "when you need one," which for a married person, he joked, is "when your wife wants one." This perspective contrasted with Warren Buffett's capital allocation approach, focusing instead on practical utility. Munger's advice, which suggests homeownership is a lifestyle choice rather than a default milestone, resonates today amid a challenging housing market. (not investment advice)</p>
