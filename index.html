          <h2>Astronomers Witness Earliest Stages of Rocky Planet Formation Around a Young Star</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 04:11:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope and the ALMA array, astronomers have observed the earliest signs of rocky planet formation around a young star named HOPS-315. This unprecedented discovery provides a direct look at the hot region where planets like Earth are born, confirming that these initial steps are happening right now. The detection of silicate minerals, the building blocks of terrestrial planets, in such a young system suggests that the process which formed our own solar system might be common throughout the universe.</p>

          <p>Days of torrential rain in South Korea have triggered devastating floods and landslides, leading to the deaths of at least 14 people, with another 12 reported missing. The destruction has been most severe in the country's central and southern regions, submerging villages, damaging thousands of buildings, and forcing nearly 10,000 people to evacuate their homes. In response, the government has ordered the worst-hit areas to be declared special disaster zones and has launched a major recovery effort involving multiple agencies.</p>

          <p>The mother of Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old congressional intern shot and killed in Washington, D.C., is pleading with police to find those responsible for her son's death. Investigators believe Tarpinian-Jachym was not the intended target of the shooting, which also injured two others. His mother, Tamara Jachym, warned that the perpetrators will strike again if not caught and highlighted the incident as part of a concerning trend of violence in the nation's capital, which has seen 91 homicides so far this year.</p>

          <p>Facing a new 30% U.S. tariff set to begin in August, South Africa is actively working to increase its exports to China to mitigate the economic impact. A high-level delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and diversify the nation's export portfolio beyond raw commodities to higher-value products like pharmaceuticals and green energy technology. This strategic shift aims to address a significant and growing trade deficit with China, which reached nearly $10 billion in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian boxer Tim Tszyu suffered a significant career setback, losing his world title rematch against Sebastian Fundora via a seventh-round corner stoppage in Las Vegas. This defeat is Tszyu's third in his last four bouts, casting doubt on his future at the top level of the sport after an impressive 24-0 start to his career.

          <h2>U.S. to Implement New $250 'Visa Integrity Fee' for Most Foreign Visitors</h2>

          <p>The United States is introducing a new, non-waivable '$250 visa integrity fee' for most nonimmigrant visitors, including tourists and business travelers, starting in fiscal year 2025. This fee, part of the Trump administration's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' will be charged in addition to existing visa application costs. While a provision allows for reimbursement if travelers comply with their visa conditions, the U.S. Travel Association notes that scant details on the implementation and reimbursement process have created significant confusion.
