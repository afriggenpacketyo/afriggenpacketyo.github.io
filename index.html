          <p>The women's dating safety app, Tea, has disabled its direct messaging feature after a significant cybersecurity breach. The hack exposed thousands of users' private images, posts, and comments, including sensitive verification photos that were supposed to be deleted. The U.S.-based app, with 1.6 million members, is now investigating the incident, which affected users who signed up before February 2024. The company has promised to offer free identity protection services to those whose personal information was compromised during the breach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission has proposed new draft guidelines to tighten oversight of state-supported investment funds. The rules aim to curb redundant spending and prevent "homogeneous competition" by directing capital towards strategic sectors like advanced manufacturing and the digital economy. This initiative seeks to foster more efficient, long-term "patient capital" to support innovation and stabilize investments across economic cycles. The guidelines emphasize stronger top-down planning and better coordination between central and local government funds to avoid crowding out private investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Chinese strategist has suggested that Beijing should closely examine the future-oriented visions of America's right-wing tech leaders to better anticipate the policies of a potential second Trump administration. The expert noted that this "tech right" represents a powerful capital bloc with a distinct philosophy of "tech accelerationism" aimed at shaping America's future dominance. This perspective suggests that understanding this group's influence is crucial for China to look beyond current trade tensions and grasp Washington's broader strategic goals. The analysis highlights a shift from nostalgic political movements to a forward-looking, technologically driven agenda.</p>

          <p>The tradition of friends setting each other up on dates, once a primary way for couples to meet, is now largely overshadowed by online dating apps. While setups offer a layer of vetting and accountability, modern daters often prefer the vast choice and control provided by algorithms that connect them with people outside their immediate social circles. Experts note that as dating became a more individual pursuit of self-actualization, the role of community in matchmaking diminished. Despite growing frustration with app-based dating, a full-scale return to setups seems unlikely, though some are finding creative ways to bring a community feel back to dating.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has prompted tsunami warnings and evacuation orders across the Pacific, affecting Japan, Russia, and parts of the U.S. west coast. The quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, generated waves up to 4 meters high in Russia, causing flooding and damage to a port. In Japan, nearly 1.9 million people were urged to evacuate to higher ground as authorities warned of potential waves up to 3 meters. While initial waves have been smaller than feared in some areas, alerts remain active as the tsunami continues to travel across the ocean.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented move, Cuba has leased farmland to a foreign company, Vietnam's Agri VMA, to boost its domestic rice production amid a severe agricultural crisis. The project in Los Palacios is showing encouraging results, with the first harvest yielding nearly four times the national average thanks to Vietnamese seeds and resources. This partnership aims to reduce Cuba's reliance on costly imports, which have been strained by U.S. sanctions and a lack of foreign currency. The Vietnamese company manages the land independently and directly hires Cuban workers, marking a significant shift in the country's state-controlled agricultural model.</p>

          <p>The euro zone's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in the second quarter, a better-than-expected result compared to forecasts of no growth. This modest expansion follows a stronger 0.6% growth in the first quarter, which was partly boosted by companies front-running U.S. tariffs. Economists suggest the data indicates that the euro zone has so far been resilient to the shifts in U.S. trade policy and the associated uncertainty. The slowdown was anticipated as the initial effects of tariff-related stockpiling diminished, but the overall performance points to a degree of stability in the face of trade pressures.

Experts emphasize that the Fed's independence is crucial for maintaining economic stability and public trust, as it allows policymakers to make necessary but potentially unpopular decisions, like raising rates to curb inflation. Historically, political interference with central banks has led to negative economic outcomes, such as the high inflation of the 1970s.

          <p>New research on Great Tits, a European songbird, reveals that some avian pairs effectively "divorce" by ceasing to associate with each other after the breeding season ends. Using radio tags to track the birds' social interactions, scientists at the University of Oxford found that while many couples remain together through the winter, others drift apart. These "divorcing" birds associate less with their former partners as winter progresses, suggesting they are forming new social bonds ahead of the next breeding season.

It was first used to describe young, effeminate men who adopted an over-the-top, Anglophile fashion style, likely as a reference to "Yankee Doodle." The term later evolved to describe East Coast city dwellers visiting "dude ranches" in the West. In the mid-20th century, it was adopted by African American and Mexican American communities as a marker of solidarity before being popularized globally by California's surfer and skater culture, solidifying its place as a flexible and enduring part of the American lexicon.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady this week, despite repeated and intense public pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. Investors see almost no chance of a change, although they are more optimistic about a potential cut in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has maintained that policy decisions are based on economic data, not political attacks, as he waits to see the full impact of the administration's new tariffs. While some Fed officials argue for a cut now, concerns about inflation remaining above the 2% target support a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's government has stated that its security forces have located and killed three Pakistani militants responsible for a massacre of 26 tourists in Kashmir three months ago. Home Minister Amit Shah informed Parliament that evidence, including voter IDs and matching cartridges, linked the slain individuals to the April attack. The incident had previously escalated tensions, leading to a brief military conflict between India and Pakistan. This announcement comes as the Indian government faces political pressure over intelligence and diplomatic failures related to the attack, with opposition parties calling for greater accountability.</p>

          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has completed a £65.5 million transfer from Liverpool to German champions Bayern Munich, signing a four-year contract. The 28-year-old, who joined Liverpool in 2022, said he was leaving "proud of everything we achieved together" after winning four major trophies with the club, including the Premier League title last season. Diaz's departure is part of a significant summer of transactions for Liverpool, who have generated substantial funds from player sales while also investing heavily in new talent.

          <p>Following a tsunami warning triggered by a massive earthquake near Russia, many residents of Hawaii heeded official advice and evacuated low-lying coastal areas, leading to significant traffic. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center confirmed that waves several feet high were recorded on Maui, Oahu, and the island of Hawaii. While Governor Josh Green noted he had not yet seen a "wave of consequence," he urged people to remain calm and on higher ground as the danger could persist for hours. For many on Maui, the orderly evacuation stood in stark contrast to the devastating wildfires two years prior, which had struck without warning.</p>

          <p>Google has announced it will sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice on artificial intelligence, a move that fellow tech giant Meta has refused to make. While endorsing the guidelines to promote access to AI tools, Google expressed concerns that the EU's broader AI Act could slow innovation and harm Europe's competitiveness. Meta had previously rebuffed the code, arguing it introduced legal uncertainties and went beyond the scope of the landmark AI Act. This divergence shows a split among major tech companies on how to approach the EU's comprehensive new regulations governing the rapidly advancing technology.</p>

          <p>HSBC has announced a new $3 billion share buyback program, even as its second-quarter profit before tax fell to $6.3 billion, missing analyst expectations. The 29% year-over-year profit decline was attributed to impairment charges related to a Chinese bank and the loss of income from disposed businesses. The bank's CEO flagged "structural challenges" to the global economy, including tariffs and fiscal vulnerabilities, that are creating uncertainty. While HSBC warned that lending demand would likely remain muted, it expects its wealth division to continue to see double-digit growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cultural commentary piece examines the online mockery directed at New York Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns, whose expressive gestures and tone of voice have been labeled "zesty" and queer-coded by social media users. The author connects this scrutiny to broader societal anxieties about Black masculinity and the policing of joy and softness in men, drawing parallels to personal experiences with homophobia. Despite having the best season of his career, Towns became a target for those uncomfortable with expressions that deviate from rigid masculine norms. This article argues this phenomenon is not about his actual sexuality but about punishing aesthetic freedom and emotional expression.</p>

He praised Amorim for bringing new demands and a focus on mentality, stating that the coach requires 100% effort and will not hesitate to bench any player who fails to meet his standards.

The deal, which runs until the end of July 2030, is one of the company's largest to date for lithium iron phosphate batteries. While the customer's identity is confidential, reports suggest it is Tesla, aligning with the EV maker's goal of diversifying its battery supply chain away from China. The contract is expected to be linked to LG's new manufacturing plant in Michigan, which recently began production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's annual inflation rate dropped to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and falling below economists' expectations. This places inflation just within the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) target range of 2-3%, increasing pressure on the central bank to cut interest rates at its next meeting. While the RBA has been cautious, citing a strong labor market, analysts believe the weaker inflation figures, coupled with a slowing global growth backdrop, provide sufficient evidence for a rate reduction. The data suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, although the RBA remains watchful. (not investment advice)</p>
