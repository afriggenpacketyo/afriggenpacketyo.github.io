          <p>The Shandong, China's first domestically constructed aircraft carrier, has made its inaugural port call in Hong Kong, showcasing Beijing's growing naval capabilities. Commissioned in 2019, the 70,000-tonne vessel is a key instrument in China's strategy for long-range power projection beyond the first island chain in the Western Pacific. As the nation's second carrier, following the retrofitted Liaoning, the Shandong represents a significant milestone in President Xi Jinping's military modernization plans.

While inflation has remained relatively low, concerns persist that tariffs could lead to price increases and potential stagflation. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the data, with Chairman Jerome Powell signaling a potential openness to cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy if needed.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport, after suffering from severe delays and cancellations in April and May, showed significant improvement in June, becoming the most reliable airport in the New York City area. The earlier problems were attributed to runway construction and air traffic control system outages. While on-time performance has markedly improved, many travelers remain wary due to past negative experiences. The upcoming July Fourth holiday travel surge will be a major test for the airport's recovery and the resilience of its infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to deliver a speech in Iowa to kick off a year of "America250" events celebrating the nation's 250th anniversary. The event will serve as a platform for the president to promote his second-term policy agenda, including the sweeping tax and spending bill currently being pushed through the House. Trump is also expected to detail proposals like a "Patriot Games" for high school athletes and a "Great American State Fair." The speech will also touch on his trade agenda, particularly concerning farmers who have been impacted by his tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Recent research highlights a phenomenon where some healthy individuals experience a sharp drop in blood sugar two to three hours after eating carbohydrates, leading to fatigue, hunger, and mood changes. These individuals, termed "dippers," may consume hundreds of extra calories per day as a result. To stabilize blood sugar, experts recommend pairing carbohydrates with protein, fiber, and healthy fats, a practice they call "putting clothes on your carbs." Additionally, spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day and eating proteins and fats before carbs in a meal can help prevent these significant fluctuations.</p>

          <p>A two-day strike by French air traffic controllers has caused widespread travel disruption across Europe, forcing Ryanair to cancel more than 170 flights and affecting over 30,000 passengers. The strike, called by two unions over working conditions and staffing shortages, has impacted not only flights to and from France but also those using French airspace. Ryanair's CEO criticized the union for holding holiday travelers "to ransom" and called on the European Commission to ensure minimum service levels during such industrial actions.

          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon that intensifies heatwaves for city dwellers. This effect is caused by heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt, a lack of cooling vegetation, and heat trapped by tall buildings and pollution. The temperature difference can be as much as 15 degrees Celsius. Potential solutions include greening cities with more trees and parks, installing "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight, and using permeable pavements that enhance water evaporation to cool surfaces.</p>
