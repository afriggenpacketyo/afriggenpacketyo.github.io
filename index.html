          <p>Palantir has been awarded a significant contract by the U.S. Army, valued at up to $10 billion over the next decade. The deal aims to streamline military efficiencies and data management by consolidating 75 separate contracts into one enterprise agreement. This partnership highlights the increasing role of artificial intelligence in government operations under the Trump administration's cost-cutting initiatives. The move has been positively received by the market, with Palantir's stock value more than doubling this year.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have publicly explained their recent votes against holding interest rates steady. Both officials argued that the central bank should implement a quarter-point rate cut, viewing the inflationary impact of tariffs as temporary. They expressed concern that delaying policy easing poses a significant risk to the labor market and overall economic growth. Their statements represent a rare public dissent and highlight a growing debate within the Fed on how to navigate current economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "Amy Bradley is Missing," is bringing renewed focus to the case of a 23-year-old woman who vanished from a cruise ship in 1998. The series explores various theories, including falling overboard or foul play, and features interviews with her family, who still hold out hope for answers. The directors stated they were motivated by the family's ongoing pain and the need for justice after realizing previous coverage was superficial. The documentary has reportedly generated new tips, which are being vetted by law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of a significant slowdown, adding only 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics sharply revised down the job gains for May and June by a combined 258,000, indicating that hiring was much weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, and sectors like federal government and business services saw job losses.

          <p>A massive lightning flash, or "megaflash," that stretched 515 miles across Texas and Missouri in 2017 has been officially recognized as a new world record for horizontal distance.

          <p>The Smithsonian's National Museum of American History has removed a temporary label detailing President Trump's two first-term impeachments from its "American Presidency" exhibit. The museum stated the removal is temporary, pending a larger, more comprehensive update to the gallery, which has not been significantly revised since 2008. The decision follows a period of tension between the White House and the Smithsonian over content, with the administration criticizing what it calls "divisive, DEI exhibits" and seeking to remove "improper ideology" from museums.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's latest wave of global tariffs is creating significant uncertainty for U.S. retailers as they begin ordering for the upcoming spring season.

This move is a direct response to efforts in Republican-led states like Texas to engage in mid-decade redistricting to favor the GOP in national elections. To proceed, California voters would first need to approve changes to the state's independent redistricting commission, established to prevent partisan gerrymandering.

          <p>Celebrity chef Paula Deen has announced the sudden and permanent closure of her flagship Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons, which she ran with her sons for nearly three decades. The restaurant was instrumental in launching her to fame, but it closed its doors for good on July 31, along with her other Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. The statement did not provide a reason for the closures but thanked customers for their loyalty. Deen's four other restaurants located in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Missouri will remain open.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas. The Bureau of Prisons confirmed the transfer to FPC Bryan, a facility for female inmates. The move occurred shortly after Maxwell met for two days with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to reportedly discuss individuals associated with Epstein's crimes. Officials have not provided a specific reason for the transfer from the facility where she was serving her 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

          <p>Advocates for in vitro fertilization (IVF) are questioning the status of a campaign promise from President Trump to ensure the treatment is covered for all who need it. An executive order signed in February directed policy recommendations to be made by May, but that deadline has passed with no update from the White House. With out-of-pocket costs for a single IVF cycle ranging from $12,000 to $25,000, access remains a significant barrier for many families. The issue has broad, nonpartisan support, and advocates are urging the administration to follow through on its pledge.</p>

          <p>U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff visited a controversial, Israeli-backed humanitarian aid distribution site in Gaza, a trip intended to assess the on-the-ground situation. The visit to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site has drawn criticism from some Palestinians, who labeled it a "media stunt" that fails to address the ongoing crisis. The GHF-run sites have been associated with deadly violence, and UN agencies continue to warn of mass starvation in the territory. Human rights groups have called for the suspension of the militarized aid operation.</p>

Verstappen is also under investigation by race stewards for appearing to throw an item from his cockpit while on track, adding to a difficult day for the championship leader.</p>

          <p>The new "Naked Gun" film, starring Liam Neeson, embraces the spirit of the original trilogy by delivering a high volume of gags and one-liners. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the movie casts Neeson as Frank Drebin Jr., a role that spoofs his own stone-faced action-hero persona, much like Leslie Nielsen's original portrayal. The article praises the film as a refreshing, out-and-out farce in a cinematic landscape dominated by serious action blockbusters. It argues that the movie's commitment to silly, point-less fun provides a much-needed comedic experience for theater audiences.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's efforts to end gender-affirming care for minors. The suit challenges a presidential executive order that denounces such care and directs the Justice Department to investigate providers, which the states argue is an unconstitutional overreach. The legal action contends that the federal threats have created a chilling effect, causing clinics to close and leaving vulnerable youth without necessary medical care. The lawsuit seeks to have the executive order vacated entirely.</p>

He called the significant post-earnings drop in Amazon's stock an "amazing buying opportunity," dismissing concerns over its AWS cloud growth as a misinterpretation of the earnings call. Regarding Apple, which also saw a stock decline, Cramer suggested that while the company's AI strategy remains unclear, its strong quarterly performance, especially in China, is a positive sign.

Newcastle reportedly values the 25-year-old Swedish international at around £150 million, a figure Liverpool is unwilling to meet at present. Isak, who was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour due to a minor injury, is reportedly interested in a move away from the club.

          <p>A new Department of Energy report, intended to justify rolling back major environmental regulations, has been slammed by climate scientists as a "farce" filled with misinformation. The report was released alongside an EPA proposal to undo the 2009 "endangerment finding," which underpins most U.S. climate rules. Experts like Michael Mann and Naomi Oreskes condemned the document for cherry-picking data and using long-debunked arguments to downplay the climate crisis. They argue its purpose is not scientific but political, designed to promote fossil fuels by undermining legitimate climate science.</p>

Andersen, who rose from a humble background, penned timeless fairy tales like "The Little Mermaid" and "The Ugly Duckling" that explore universal themes of longing, identity, and social injustice. While his stories are beloved by children, they often contain subtle social criticism and profound messages for adults.
