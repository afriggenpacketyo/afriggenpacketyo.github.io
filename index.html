          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is projected to intensify into a Category 4 hurricane, posing a severe threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. Forecasters anticipate catastrophic flash flooding, landslides, and extensive wind damage, with the storm potentially becoming the strongest to impact Jamaica in over 35 years. Its slow movement increases the risk of significant intensification and prolonged exposure to destructive conditions. One fatality has already been reported in Haiti due due to a downed tree.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a U.S. strike in the Caribbean on a suspected Tren de Aragua drug-smuggling vessel, killing all six on board. This marks the tenth such strike by the Trump administration, bringing total fatalities to at least 43, with operations now extending to the Pacific. The U.S. is deploying the USS Gerald Ford carrier strike group to the region, intensifying its anti-trafficking campaign. Both Colombia and U.S. lawmakers have questioned the legality and rationale of these strikes, demanding congressional authorization and evidence for what they consider acts of hostility.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed flights following a nationwide ground stop caused by a "significant IT outage," though disruptions, including over 400 flight cancellations, persisted into Friday. The airline apologized for affecting more than 49,000 passengers and implemented a flexible travel policy to assist those impacted. While operations are gradually returning to normal, the specific nature of the technical issue that led to the system-wide shutdown has not been disclosed by the Seattle-based carrier.</p>

          <p>President Trump sanctioned Colombian President Gustavo Petro and suspended aid after Petro accused the U.S. of "murder" for killing an innocent fisherman in one of its alleged anti-drug strikes, which have resulted in 43 deaths. This article questions the legality and constitutionality of the Trump administration's expanding military campaign, including deploying an aircraft carrier strike group, arguing it represents an extraordinary power grab. It highlights the use of sanctions as "presidential pique" and the controversial "non-international armed conflict" justification.</p>

          <p>This article critically analyzes the demolition of the White House East Wing for President Trump's new ballroom, viewing it as a symbolic disregard for public accountability and constitutional norms. Drawing historical parallels, it argues that past White House renovations maintained a balance between grandeur and restraint, respecting the building's republican representation. The article contends that Trump's privately funded, oversized project, undertaken without public notice, physically and symbolically imbalances the structure, reflecting an indifference to its history and undermining the foundational idea of a government for the people.</p>

          <p>Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced a pause on his province's anti-tariff advertisement campaign in the U.S. after President Trump terminated trade talks, labeling the ad "FAKE." The controversial ad quoted Ronald Reagan on the negative impact of tariffs. Ford's decision, made after discussions with Prime Minister Mark Carney, aims to facilitate the resumption of trade negotiations. This incident highlights Canada's struggle to secure a trade deal with the Trump administration, being the sole G7 country still facing significant U.S. tariffs, and the differing diplomatic approaches within Canada.</p>

This allegation intensifies scrutiny on the execution, which witnesses described as "botched," with Black groaning in pain. His legal team suggests the sedative pentobarbital failed to work as intended and that officials may have violated viewing rights by closing curtains prematurely.

The finance chief attributed this slowdown to U.S. consumers facing price increases and subsequently reducing discretionary spending.
