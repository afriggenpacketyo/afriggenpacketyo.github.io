          <p>An appellate court ruled the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. While acknowledging the plaintiffs' case has merit, the court found insufficient evidence to block the policy's implementation during the ongoing legal battle. The administration argues the countries are now safe for return, a claim disputed by advocacy groups and contradicted by State Department travel advisories. This decision has alarmed groups assisting with Afghan relocation, who warn of families being separated and allies being endangered.</p>

          <p>Observers and political opponents accuse President Trump of attempting to divert public attention from the Jeffrey Epstein case by making a series of unrelated and provocative statements. These include demanding the Washington Commanders revert to their former name and sharing a fake video of Barack Obama's arrest. The moves come as the administration faces criticism from its own base for its handling of the Epstein files, particularly the DOJ's announcement that no "client list" exists. Critics argue these actions are a deliberate strategy to shift the narrative away from the controversy.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight arriving in Minot, North Dakota, performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 military bomber. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained the bomber appeared unexpectedly on a converging course, and the local air traffic control tower, which operates visually, had not provided a warning. The Air Force confirmed a B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover. The Federal Aviation Administration is now investigating the near-miss incident, which startled passengers but resulted in a safe landing.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Bill Cosby shared his memories of his former on-screen son in an exclusive interview. Cosby described Warner, who played Theo Huxtable, as a consummate professional and a great studier with whom he maintained a close, mentor-like relationship long after the show ended. The role of Theo was loosely based on Cosby's late son, Ennis, adding a personal dimension to their connection. The article also notes the multiple sexual assault allegations against Cosby, providing context to his public reappearance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily preventing the Trump administration from cutting Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The defunding measure was part of the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The judge ruled that the law likely unconstitutionally punishes Planned Parenthood affiliates that do not provide abortions, siding with the organization's argument that losing the funds would severely impact non-abortion services for over a million people. The Department of Justice had argued the provision was intended to stop federal subsidies for abortion providers and is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

The author suggests that countries like Canada, China, and the European Union are being forced to confront and remove long-standing domestic regulations and protectionist policies that hinder their own economic growth. The piece posits that the economic losses from these internal barriers could be as significant as the costs imposed by the U.S. tariffs, framing the crisis as a catalyst for economic liberalization.

Speaking at a Federal Reserve conference, Bessent argued for scrapping a proposed dual capital requirement structure, stating it was designed to "reverse-engineer" higher capital levels without a principled basis. He claimed excessive capitalization rules are stifling lending, hurting economic growth, and pushing financial activities into the less-regulated non-bank sector. The Treasury will now take a more assertive role in driving these reforms to boost innovation and competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

Farmer voiced skepticism about the Trump administration's handling of the files, citing the emotional toll on survivors from the shifting promises of transparency.

          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and prompting a debate among global timekeepers about an unprecedented solution. This acceleration could eventually require the subtraction of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an event known as a "negative leap second," which has never been done before. Experts worry this could create widespread issues for computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping. Interestingly, the melting of polar ice due to climate change is creating a counteracting drag, slowing the rotation and delaying the need for this adjustment.</p>

          <p>This analysis examines the Trump administration's strategic and aggressive use of the judicial system to advance its agenda, a process that is altering the traditional balance of power in U.S. government. The article details how the administration has leveraged a wave of executive orders, challenged unfavorable rulings, and publicly criticized judges, while also benefiting from key Supreme Court decisions that have expanded presidential immunity. This confrontational approach has led to an unprecedented level of hostility between the executive and judicial branches, raising fundamental questions about the future of presidential authority and judicial independence.</p>

          <p>The 13-year-old step-grandson of reality TV star Duane "Dog the Bounty Hunter" Chapman has died in what is being described as a tragic accident.

Local law enforcement is currently investigating the shooting as an isolated incident, and no arrests have been made. In a statement, Chapman and his wife confirmed the death, calling it an "incomprehensible tragic accident" and asking for privacy as their family grieves the loss.</p>

          <p>Nissan is planning a significant reduction of its manufacturing capacity in Mexico by closing two plants, including a historic facility in Civac and a joint-venture factory with Mercedes-Benz. The move is part of a broader corporate restructuring plan aimed at cutting costs and reducing global production capacity. The decision is also influenced by the Trump administration's tariffs on vehicles imported from Mexico, which have made some models less profitable for the U.S. market. The nearly 60-year-old Civac plant, Nissan's first outside of Japan, is reportedly outdated and no longer cost-effective. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>America First Legal, a group founded by former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, has asked the Department of Justice to investigate what it calls "illegal DEI practices" at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The complaint alleges that the university systematically uses race and identity-based preferences in admissions, scholarships, and hiring, thereby violating civil rights laws and the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. The group claims Johns Hopkins is using socioeconomic status as an illegal proxy for race, part of a broader conservative legal effort to dismantle diversity programs across American institutions.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, the ex-officer convicted in connection with the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor, has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for violating her civil rights. This article highlights the political context of the sentencing, noting the Trump-led Justice Department had recommended only a one-day sentence, a stark reversal from the Biden administration which initially brought the charges. This shift is part of a broader rollback of Biden-era police oversight policies. Taylor's mother criticized the DOJ's lenient stance but said the judge "did the best she could" with the case.</p>

The letter comes after Lionesses defender Jess Carter revealed she had been a target of racist abuse throughout the recent tournament.

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its deportation efforts by specifically targeting sanctuary cities, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Following the shooting of an off-duty officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person, border czar Tom Homan announced a plan to "flood the zone" in these cities with more ICE agents. Homan stated that if local jails won't cooperate, agents will make arrests in the community, detaining anyone found to be in the country illegally. The administration blames the policies of mayors in cities like New York and Chicago for creating unsafe conditions.</p>

          <p>This analytical article argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated not by a coherent policy ideology but by personal grievances, anger, and small-minded vengefulness. The author cites numerous examples, from renaming military bases and harassing former officials to flip-flopping on Ukraine policy based on whether he feels slighted by Vladimir Putin. The piece suggests that this culture of retribution permeates the executive branch, with decisions often driven by a desire to punish perceived enemies or undo the legacy of his predecessor. This approach, the article concludes, replaces substantive governance with capricious, emotionally-driven actions.</p>

Bove's nomination is presented as a key example of this shift.

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's latest tax bill will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, primarily benefiting corporations, while also introducing new deductions. These revenue losses are only partially offset by an estimated $1.1 trillion in savings from cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs. The CBO projects these cuts will leave 10 million more Americans without health insurance by 2034, while also funding increased immigration enforcement. (not investment advice)</p>
