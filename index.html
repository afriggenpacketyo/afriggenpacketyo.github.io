          <p>Kavan Markwood, a 20-year-old former high school football MVP, was critically injured after falling from a 21-foot wall at PNC Park during a Pirates game. He graduated from South Allegheny High School in 2022, where he was known for his resilience, strength, and kindness, and played football at Walsh University and Wheeling University. The Pittsburgh Public Safety is treating the fall as accidental, and Pirates Chairman Bob Nutting expressed deep sadness over the incident. Markwood's friend jumped onto the field from the stands after the fall, and he was taken to a hospital with a fractured skull.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to sensitive Social Security Administration (SSA) data.

The judge emphasized the importance of privacy expectations with SSA records, highlighting a significant fissure in this foundation.

As a result, Temu is now shipping all U.S. orders from local warehouses and has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.

          <p>Prince Harry expressed his devastation after losing his legal battle for security protection in the UK, emphasizing his desire for reconciliation with the Royal Family. He stated that his father, King Charles, is not speaking to him because of the security dispute and voiced concerns about bringing his family to the UK without adequate protection. The court upheld the decision to remove automatic police protection, citing Harry's change in status after stepping down as a working royal. He said he does not picture himself returning to the U.K. with his family in light of the court's decision.</p>

          <p>Major footwear companies, including Nike and Adidas, are requesting a tariff exemption from President Trump, citing an "existential threat" to the industry. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America sent a letter to the White House, highlighting that reciprocal tariffs pose significant challenges, especially for companies producing affordable footwear for lower and middle-income families. The letter warns that without relief, many companies may be forced to close, and U.S. consumers could face shortages of footwear inventory.</p>
