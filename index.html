        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to roll out new vocational qualifications called V-levels for 16-year-olds in England, intending to replace Level 3 BTECs and other technical courses. This initiative aims to simplify the educational options available after GCSEs, which ministers have described as a "confusing landscape." The proposal is part of a wider government focus on enhancing vocational training, although details on the subjects and implementation timeline are still under consultation. Educational groups have expressed caution, warning that the new V-levels might not fully compensate for the removal of established qualifications like BTECs, which serve many students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israel launched retaliatory airstrikes, stating that Hamas militants had violated the agreement by killing two of its soldiers. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered "strong action" against what he termed "terrorist targets," and aid deliveries into the territory were temporarily halted. Hamas denied involvement in the reported clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and claiming it had lost contact with its groups in the area. The escalation resulted in at least 38 Palestinian fatalities, according to hospital sources in Gaza, before the Israeli military announced it would resume enforcing the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced discussions to hire former Everton and Burnley manager Sean Dyche. The move follows the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou, which occurred shortly after the team's 3-0 loss to Chelsea. Forest, currently in the relegation zone at 18th place, is seeking to stabilize its performance after a challenging season with only one win in eight league games. While other candidates like Roberto Mancini were considered, sources indicate Dyche has emerged as the leading contender, with the club hoping to finalize an agreement soon.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay showcased his adaptability by shifting offensive strategy in a 35-7 victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars. With star receiver Puka Nacua sidelined, McVay abandoned his typical three-receiver sets in favor of formations using three tight ends, a personnel grouping the Rams had barely used all season. This tactical change proved highly effective, as quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for five touchdowns on fewer than 200 passing yards. The article highlights McVay's ability to innovate and scheme effectively even without his top offensive player, solidifying the Rams' offense as a formidable force.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech company Akeso announced promising trial data for its cancer drug, ivonescimab, which combines two proven cancer-fighting strategies. The drug demonstrated a clear advantage in treating a specific type of lung cancer compared to a key competitor, with lower toxicity and higher efficacy, according to data presented at a European medical symposium. Following the news, Akeso's Hong Kong-listed shares initially surged before declining amid a broader sell-off of Chinese biotech stocks. Analysts at Jefferies noted the drug's potential, suggesting it is positioned as a highly advanced asset, potentially years ahead of competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her posthumously published memoir, 'Nobody's Girl,' Virginia Giuffre recounts the severe abuse she endured from Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, stating she feared she might "die a sex slave." The book provides harrowing details of her experiences and reiterates her claim of having sexual encounters with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, allegations he has consistently denied. The memoir describes a web of powerful individuals involved in the abuse of young women orchestrated by Epstein and Maxwell. Its publication places renewed scrutiny on Prince Andrew, who recently relinquished his titles amid the ongoing controversy.</p>

Industry experts and filmmakers express concern that such a tariff would jeopardize this crucial partnership, making it difficult to finance and produce British films. While some believe the complexity of modern filmmaking makes the tariff impractical, the threat alone adds to the challenges facing the already fragile UK industry. (not investment advice)</p>

The Home Builders Federation noted that construction is "flatlining" at around 200,000 homes per year, far short of the 300,000 needed annually.

This decline, driven by a persistent slump in the property sector and slowing manufacturing spending, was described by one economist as "rare and alarming."

          <p>During a live-fire demonstration at Camp Pendleton celebrating the U.S. Marine Corps' 250th anniversary, a California Highway Patrol (CHP) vehicle was hit by falling shrapnel. Officials reported that an artillery round fired over the Interstate 5 freeway detonated prematurely, causing a metal fragment to strike the hood of the patrol car. The incident occurred while the CHP was supporting a temporary freeway closure for the event, which was attended by Vice President JD Vance. No injuries were reported, but the remaining live-fire exercises over the freeway were immediately canceled, and an investigation has been launched into the concerning event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will slash financial assistance to Colombia and impose new tariffs on its exports, accusing President Gustavo Petro of failing to stop drug production. In a social media post, Trump referred to Petro as an "illegal drug leader" and warned of more forceful U.S. action if Colombia does not shut down its drug operations. Petro vehemently rejected the accusations, defending his country's counter-narcotics efforts and describing Trump's statement as a threat to national sovereignty. This move marks a significant escalation in tensions between Washington and one of its key Latin American allies.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that updated medical guidance recommending the early introduction of peanut products to infants has successfully prevented approximately 60,000 children from developing peanut allergies. The study, published in 'Pediatrics,' analyzed health records and found that peanut allergies in young children declined by over 40% after guidelines were expanded in 2017. This change in practice was prompted by a landmark 2015 trial that proved early exposure significantly reduces the risk of developing the life-threatening allergy. The findings represent a major real-world public health success, reversing decades of previous advice to delay the introduction of common allergens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered that the exceptional longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats are associated with a particular version of a protein involved in DNA repair. This protein is also present in humans, suggesting that the mechanisms behind the rodent's long lifespan could inform new anti-aging strategies. Naked mole-rats can live up to 37 years, an extraordinary lifespan for a mammal of their size. The research, published in the journal 'Science', provides a molecular basis for how enhanced DNA repair contributes to longevity and could inspire therapeutic approaches to improve human health and lifespan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service found what officials described as a "suspicious stand" in a wooded area near Palm Beach International Airport, which is used by President Trump for travel to Florida. The object, which appeared to be a hunting or observation platform set up in a tree, was discovered during a routine security sweep before the president's arrival. According to the Secret Service, there was no immediate threat, no individuals were present at the location, and presidential movements were not affected. Sources indicated the stand had likely been there for months and was only discovered after airport construction rerouted Air Force One to that area.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have indicated they may seek the removal of Patrick Fitzgerald, the lead defense attorney for former FBI Director James Comey, due to a potential conflict of interest. The issue stems from Fitzgerald's alleged role as an intermediary when Comey disclosed memos to the media shortly after being fired by President Donald Trump in 2017. In a court filing, prosecutors suggested that Fitzgerald's involvement in the release of information later deemed classified could make his representation of Comey untenable. They have requested a special "filter team" to review evidence that could clarify Fitzgerald's role without violating attorney-client privilege.</p>

          <p>The British military will be given new authority to shoot down drones that are perceived as a threat to its bases in the UK. The new policy, to be announced by Defence Secretary John Healey, will allow troops to take more decisive "kinetic" action against unauthorized drones. This move follows several mysterious drone sightings over British airbases used by U.S. forces last year and disruptions at airports across Europe. Under current protocols, soldiers are generally limited to disrupting a drone's signal, with shooting it down permitted only in extreme circumstances, a rule the new powers are set to change.</p>
