          <p>A recent Russian drone assault on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulted in the deaths of two individuals, including a one-year-old baby, and left thirteen injured. The attack targeted multi-storey residential buildings and infrastructure, causing fires and partial destruction. Ukrainian officials condemned the strikes as deliberate targeting of civilian facilities, while Russian President Vladimir Putin simultaneously escalated warnings to Western nations regarding aid to Ukraine. This event underscores the ongoing human cost and intensifying nature of the conflict.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that international leaders who attempt to appease Donald Trump inevitably face negative consequences, citing examples such as India's Narendra Modi and France's Emmanuel Macron. The article suggests that Trump's relationships are personal and transient, often leading to broken pledges and diplomatic setbacks. It advises Britain's Keir Starmer to learn from these experiences and adopt a stance of resistance rather than deference, advocating for strength and alternative options in dealing with the former US president.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated "Patriot 2.0," a new immigration enforcement operation in Massachusetts, targeting immigrants who have been released from local custody despite ICE attempts to detain them. This move escalates tensions with "sanctuary cities" like Boston, whose Mayor Michelle Wu has defended local policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents. A DHS spokesperson criticized these policies, asserting that the operation aims to apprehend "worst of worst" criminals, while Wu's administration prepares for potential federal deployments and reviews legal precedents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial investigative report into the deadly Lisbon funicular crash, which resulted in 16 fatalities and 21 injuries, has concluded that a cable linking the two cabins snapped shortly before the derailment. Inspectors found that the cable disconnected after the cars had traveled only a short distance, causing them to lose their balancing force. Despite a visual check conducted hours earlier that detected no anomalies, the 140-year-old Gloria funicular swerved off its tracks and crashed into a building in under 50 seconds.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is employing thousands of military decoys, including inflatable tanks and flat-pack guns, to trick Russian forces into wasting valuable ammunition and resources. These imitations, which can mimic various equipment from artillery pieces to drones, are designed to create radar illusions or appear real to thermal imaging cameras. Volunteer groups play a crucial role in supplying these cost-effective decoys, forcing Russia to expend expensive munitions like Lancet kamikaze drones on fake targets, highlighting a clever aspect of Ukraine's defensive strategy.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis, affectionately known as "God's influencer" for his use of technology to spread Catholic teachings and document "miracles," is on the path to becoming the first millennial saint. His canonization, postponed after the death of Pope Francis, has drawn over a million pilgrims to Assisi, where his body lies preserved. A shrine in London's Our Lady of Dolours Church, where he was baptized, has also seen increased visitors, as the Vatican seeks to inspire young people through his modern approach to faith.</p>
