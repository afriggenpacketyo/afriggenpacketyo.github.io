          <p>Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh, a potential candidate to lead the institution, is calling for a significant policy overhaul, labeling it a "regime change." He criticizes the current Fed's reluctance to cut interest rates and advocates for a new collaborative accord with the Treasury Department to manage the nation's debt and the Fed's balance sheet. Warsh's views align with President Trump's public pressure for lower rates, suggesting a potential shift in the central bank's approach to monetary policy and its relationship with the executive branch if he were appointed.

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has granted Elon Musk an extension until August 29 to formally respond to a lawsuit concerning his acquisition of Twitter, now known as X. The SEC alleges that in 2022, Musk illegally delayed disclosing his growing stake in the company, which allowed him to purchase additional shares at a lower price, saving at least $150 million. The agency is seeking disgorgement of these gains and a civil penalty. Musk's legal team has previously dismissed the lawsuit as a "sham," denying any wrongdoing in the lead-up to his $44 billion purchase.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Push to Classify Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster for Federal Aid Eligibility</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a record-breaking heat dome in June, several Democratic lawmakers are proposing legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local communities to access federal FEMA funding for heat-related emergencies, which could be used for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. Currently, extreme heat is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster, and past gubernatorial requests for such declarations have been denied. The bill faces Republican opposition and debate over whether existing hazard mitigation grants are sufficient to address the issue.</p>

          <p>The music industry is facing a new wave of disruption as AI-generated music gains viral traction, exemplified by the synthetic psychedelic rock band "The Velvet Sundown," which has over a million monthly Spotify listeners. Platforms like Suno and Udio now allow for the easy creation of complete songs, leading to concerns about copyright infringement, artist compensation, and market saturation. While major labels are suing these AI platforms, some in the industry see the technology as a new tool for creativity. The trend is causing anxiety among human artists who already struggle to earn a living from streaming royalties.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, targeting foreign aid programs and public broadcasting. The Republican-led initiative, part of a broader effort to reduce federal spending, includes an $8 billion cut to USAID global health programs and over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The bill now returns to the House, where its fate is uncertain after senators removed a controversial $400 million cut to the PEPFAR HIV/Aids program that was in the original House version.</p>

The Corn Refiners Association warned that such a switch could lead to the loss of American manufacturing jobs and an increase in foreign sugar imports.

          <p>A comprehensive study published in the journal Nature reveals that first-generation migrants in Germany earn almost 20% less than native-born workers. Researchers found this wage gap is not due to unequal pay for the same job, but rather to structural barriers that limit migrants' access to higher-paying industries and roles. The study, which compared Germany to eight other Western nations, also found that the wage gap persists into the second generation at a higher rate than the international average. The authors recommend improved language support and recognition of foreign qualifications to address the disparity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has experienced a record number of flood warnings in 2025, with several deadly flash flooding events devastating communities from Texas to the Northeast. Experts attribute the intensification to a combination of factors, including a warming atmosphere that holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall. Additionally, aging infrastructure, such as sewer and drainage systems, was not designed to handle the volume of modern deluges. Increased population density and urban development, which reduce the ground's ability to absorb water, also exacerbate runoff and contribute to the destructive power of these rapid-onset floods.</p>

The officials warn that prioritizing speed over rigorous safety reviews, especially for new and unproven reactor designs, could increase the risk of a nuclear accident, drawing parallels to the Fukushima disaster in Japan.

          <p>James Clapper, former Director of National Intelligence under President Obama, was barred from attending a graduation ceremony for a CIA bomb-sniffing dog he had sponsored and named after his late wife.

Although the event was unclassified, CIA officials interpreted the order as a ban on Clapper setting foot on agency property.

          <p>Germany and the United Kingdom have signed a historic friendship treaty in London, aimed at strengthening their relationship following the UK's exit from the European Union. The "Kensington Treaty" establishes plans for close cooperation on defense, security, and economic matters, including joint export campaigns for co-produced military equipment and a pledge by Germany to assist the UK with combating illegal immigration. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a significant step to deepen ties amid growing geopolitical uncertainty and threats from Russia.</p>

          <h2>Experts Predict Home Equity Loan Rates Unlikely to Fall After July Fed Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 10:12:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts believe that home equity loan rates are unlikely to decrease following the Federal Reserve's July meeting, as persistent inflation makes a rate cut improbable. With inflation still above the Fed's 2% target and a strong jobs report, the federal funds rate is expected to remain in its current range. Since home equity loan rates are heavily influenced by the Fed's decisions, significant rate drops for borrowers are not anticipated until the central bank signals a clear move towards cutting rates, which markets now suggest is more likely in September or later in the year.

According to a National Association of Home Builders survey, 38% of builders reduced prices in July, with an average reduction of 5%, as buyer traffic hit a more than two-year low. Despite a slight uptick in overall builder confidence, sentiment remains negative for the 15th consecutive month.

          <p>Connie Francis, a top-selling female artist of the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 87. Her death follows a recent, unexpected resurgence in popularity after her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" went viral on TikTok. Francis's career was marked by massive hits like "Who's Sorry Now" but also by immense personal tragedy, including being brutally beaten and sexually assaulted in a motel room in 1974. This event led to a long period of trauma and reclusion, after which she became a prominent advocate for crime victims and mental health awareness before returning to performing.</p>

This advanced model, grown from living human tissue, includes nerve cells, immune cells, and capillary-like structures, offering a more complex and human-like platform for research than previous experiments. Scientists hope to observe how brain tissues behave in orbit in real-time. The research aims to provide crucial data for space medicine and neuroscience, potentially leading to new insights into brain aging and neurological disorders like Alzheimer's disease.</p>

While Kennedy has spoken of his lifelong commitment and shielded the Indian Health Service (IHS) from some cuts, leaders point to President Trump's budget as evidence of a disconnect. The proposed budget provides only a modest increase for the chronically underfunded IHS and fails to include advance appropriations, a key provision that protects tribal health services from government shutdowns, leaving many to question the administration's true commitment.</p>

          <p>Iran has dramatically escalated the deportation of Afghan migrants, expelling hundreds of thousands in recent months and separating thousands of children from their parents. The regime is publicly justifying the crackdown with unsubstantiated claims that Afghans assisted with recent Israeli military operations. However, the policy is seen as a way to deflect from internal pressures and capitalize on long-standing anti-immigrant sentiment. The deportations are particularly devastating for Afghan women and girls, who are being sent back to the oppressive rule of the Taliban, which severely restricts their rights and access to education.</p>
