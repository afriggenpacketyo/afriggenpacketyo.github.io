          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of up to 200% on pharmaceuticals imported into the United States, suggesting the new duties could be announced "very soon." However, he indicated that drugmakers would be given a grace period of about a year to a year and a half to move their manufacturing operations to the U.S. before the tariffs take effect. The pharmaceutical industry has pushed back, warning that such levies could disrupt the supply chain, increase costs for patients, and deter investment in American manufacturing and research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that details on the policy will be finalized and announced at the end of the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI is now assisting the Metropolitan Police Department in the investigation into the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym in Washington, D.C. The shooting occurred on June 30, when multiple individuals reportedly exited a vehicle and opened fire on a group of people. Investigators believe Tarpinian-Jachym, an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, was not the intended target of the attack. His family released a statement expressing their devastation over the tragic and senseless loss of their son, remembering him as a kind soul dedicated to public service.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Temporarily Proceed with Mass Federal Layoffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:13:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, permitting the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs of federal employees. The executive order, which directs agencies to prepare for "reductions in force" (RIFs), had been blocked by a federal judge in California. Labor unions and other groups challenging the order argue the president is overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress, which previously rejected a similar plan. The administration contends the president has the authority to reorganize the executive branch, and the Supreme Court's decision allows these preparations to resume while the case proceeds in lower courts.</p>

          <p>A memo from the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that a so-called "client list" for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein does not exist, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories. The investigation also found no credible evidence that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals and reaffirmed the official finding that his death in 2019 was a suicide. This announcement follows President Trump's campaign promise to release files related to the case, a move that has frustrated some supporters who anticipated new revelations. The White House clarified that previously mentioned files related to the case were withheld due to their graphic nature, not because they contained a list of clients.</p>

Ricketts' campaign responded by labeling Osborn as a tool of out-of-state liberal donors, a reference to the significant funding Osborn received from Democratic-leaning PACs in his previous race.

Netanyahu's comments come as polls show a significant shift in public opinion, with more Democrats sympathizing with Palestinians.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the progressive argument that universal welfare programs like Social Security are more politically durable than means-tested ones like Medicaid, which was recently cut. It contends that the political resilience of programs for the elderly stems from their perceived "earned" nature and the high voting rates of seniors, not their universality. The author points out that some universal programs, like unemployment insurance, have been significantly cut, while overall spending on targeted, means-tested benefits has grown substantially over the past 50 years. The analysis concludes that while universal programs may have policy advantages, creating them is politically difficult due to fiscal constraints and voter aversion to tax increases.</p>

Despite the high prices, consumer demand for beef has remained remarkably strong.

The temporary closure is a yearly routine that allows park staff to convert the ride into the Haunted Mansion Holiday, a seasonal overlay inspired by the film “The Nightmare Before Christmas.” This macabre makeover is a staple of the Halloween season at the resort. According to Disney officials, the attraction is scheduled to reopen on August 22, just in time for the official start of Halloween Time at the park, and the brief downtime is an expected part of the seasonal transition.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, during his visit to Washington. The discussions focused on the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, a potential ceasefire agreement in Gaza, and the aftermath of the recent U.S.-Israeli military operations against Iran. Netanyahu's visit comes amid criticism from some Democratic lawmakers who accuse him of trying to draw the U.S. into a larger conflict. Following the meetings, Netanyahu praised the unprecedented level of cooperation with the Trump administration, stating it has created new opportunities for peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is "not happy" with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine, accusing him of throwing "bulls---" at the U.S. in response to peace efforts. His comments came just days after a weapons shipment to Ukraine was paused, a move Trump claimed he did not order. The president confirmed that the U.S. would now send additional weapons to help Ukraine defend itself, acknowledging the war has been tougher than Russia likely expected. Trump reiterated his belief that the conflict should never have happened and expressed disappointment with a recent phone call with Putin, suggesting the Russian leader is not looking to end the war.</p>

          <p>This review praises the new James Gunn-directed "Superman" movie for its fresh and brilliant approach to the iconic character. Unlike previous films that depicted Superman as a solitary god, this version places him in a world already populated with other superheroes, which helps to define his unique, earnest altruism. The film is described as consciously sincere and lighthearted, a departure from the snark of Gunn's Marvel work and the grimness of the preceding DC films. By surrounding Superman with peers and skeptics who question his goodness, the movie effectively explores and affirms the hero's core compassionate nature for a modern audience.</p>

          <p>British Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five tiers of men's football in England. The legislation, reintroduced by the new Labour government, aims to protect the financial sustainability of clubs and place the interests of fans at the center of the game. The move was celebrated by campaign group Fair Game as a historic step towards a fairer future for football. However, MPs voted against a proposed amendment that would have required at least 10 Premier League matches per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television.</p>

          <p>For savers with $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between fixed rates and accessibility. This article calculates that for short-term periods, such as three to six months, a CD currently offers a slightly higher return due to elevated short-term rates. However, for longer terms like nine months to two years, a high-yield savings account could potentially earn more, assuming its variable rate remains stable. The best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, as CDs lock in a guaranteed return but restrict access to funds, while savings accounts offer flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

This polarization obscures a more nuanced discussion about the technology's real-world effects on jobs, the environment, and society.

According to sources briefed on the matter, the change would end a policy that has been in place for nearly two decades. The shoe removal requirement was implemented in 2006 following the failed attempt by Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber," to ignite explosives hidden in his footwear in 2001.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advises homeowners to be cautious when considering a no-closing-cost home equity line of credit (HELOC). While avoiding upfront fees is appealing, these costs are often rolled into the loan via a higher interest rate or recouped through penalties if the line of credit is closed early. Borrowers should calculate the break-even point to see if paying a higher rate over time is more expensive than paying closing costs upfront. Lenders also tend to have stricter credit requirements for these products, and it's crucial to read the fine print regarding prepayment penalties before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

While the Trump administration's tariffs on imports are designed to be paid by other countries, the costs are often passed to U.S. consumers. So far, a strong job market and retailers absorbing costs have sustained consumer spending, but this sales event could be an early indicator of future trends. (not investment advice)</p>
