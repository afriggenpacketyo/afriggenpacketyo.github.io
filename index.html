          <p>A U.S. judge sharply criticized the Trump administration for mistakenly deporting a man to a notorious prison in El Salvador, demanding his immediate return to the United States. Judge Paula Xinis stated that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was seized and held without any legal authority, violating U.S. law. The Justice Department's lawyer who argued the case was put on leave after admitting ignorance of key details, while Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the deportation, alleging Garcia's gang affiliation without providing evidence.

Other cryptocurrencies, such as Ether and Solana's token, suffered even steeper losses.

The changes include relaxed mandates for phasing out petrol and diesel production, allowing smaller firms like Aston Martin and McLaren to continue making petrol cars beyond 2030, and permitting some hybrid vehicles to remain on the market until 2035.</p>

It acknowledges the potential for further downside, possibly to an 18 multiple on $220 in projected S&P 500 earnings, which takes us down to roughly 4,000, while emphasizing the importance of being prepared for a European response.

          <p>Despite market turmoil and international calls for de-escalation, President Trump's advisors have defended the administration's sweeping tariffs on imports. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed recent stock market falls, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted that reciprocal tariffs would be implemented as planned. Other countries are scrambling to negotiate deals, while China has announced retaliatory tariffs. The UK Prime Minister is expected to announce measures to protect British businesses from the impact of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Apple will continue to host TikTok on its App Store for at least 75 more days following assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi. This decision follows President Trump's second extension of the TikTok ban deadline, which requires ByteDance to sell its U.S. operations. Bondi's letter to Apple stated that the company would not be penalized for hosting the platform. This extension comes amid broader trade tensions, with Trump suggesting he might reduce tariffs on China to facilitate a deal for ByteDance to sell TikTok's U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old Chinese woman died by suicide while in the custody of US border patrol in Arizona after overstaying her visa. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal stated that initial reports suggest border patrol agents failed to perform required welfare checks prior to the woman’s death. Surveillance footage allegedly showed the woman creating a noose, but no medical response occurred for nearly two hours. The incident raises concerns about conditions at detainment facilities and the treatment of detained individuals.</p>

          <p>A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on leave for purportedly failing to defend the Trump administration's deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador vigorously enough. Reuveni struggled to answer questions about the deportation and acknowledged the absence of evidence justifying the detention. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Reuveni was put on administrative leave for not vigorously arguing on behalf of his client. The administration has faced criticism for its stepped-up enforcement against immigration rights.</p>

          <p>California has a unique opportunity to reduce emissions and improve climate resilience by investing in climate-smart agricultural practices. While California has climate programs to help farmers adopt eco-friendly methods, these programs are not adequately funded. Investing in these programs would help farmers save money, reduce pollution, and improve soil health. The legislature should allocate 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to climate-smart agriculture programs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered all national parks to remain open despite severe staffing shortages, a move criticized by conservation groups. The order requires approval from the National Park Service director and assistant secretary before any closures or reduction in hours. Critics argue that the order sidelines the expertise of park staff and creates unnecessary bureaucracy. The order comes after the administration cut about 1,000 National Park Service workers, further straining the agency's ability to manage the parks.</p>

The question remains about the sustainability of any rally. The timing of the tariffs news, which coincided with the beginning of the first-quarter earnings season, is contributing to the gloomy outlook. (<br><i>not investment advice</i>)</p>
