          <p>Vancouver's Filipino community is in mourning after a car ramming attack at the annual Lapu Lapu festival resulted in 11 fatalities and dozens of injuries. Police have taken a 30-year-old suspect with a history of mental health issues into custody, but have ruled out terrorism as a motive. The attack occurred at the festival, which commemorates a Filipino hero, leaving the tight-knit community in shock and confusion, as residents frantically checked on loved ones. City officials have described the incident as the "darkest day" in Vancouver's history, while organizers expressed deep grief over the tragic event. Optimism that the community will recover is moderate. Optimism score: 40</p>

          <p>A letter penned by Titanic survivor Col. Archibald Gracie before the ship's sinking has been auctioned for nearly $400,000. In the letter, Gracie wrote of the ship: "It is a fine ship, but I shall await my journey's end before I pass judgment on her." Gracie survived the sinking but died less than eight months later due to complications from the shipwreck.

          <p>The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has announced that generative artificial intelligence can be used in films considered for nominations, leading to concerns about the impact on human creativity. Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo argues that AI may diminish the human element in art, potentially affecting craftsmanship and artistic choices. He suggests that while AI may assist in certain aspects of filmmaking, the reliance on AI could negatively impact the collaborative nature of art creation. The Oscars are also implementing a new rule requiring members to watch all nominated films before voting. Optimism score: 60</p>
