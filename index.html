            <p>Families are reporting that civil rights investigations in schools have stalled due to significant staff reductions at the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). A mother in Indiana filed a complaint with the OCR after her daughter, who has disabilities, was repeatedly secluded in a padded room at school. The OCR lost over 40% of its staff, leading to delays in investigations and undermining civil rights protections for students with disabilities. Advocates argue that OCR investigations are crucial for addressing systemic discrimination in schools, while others believe the Justice Department should handle these complaints.</p>

            <p>A woman in Montana struggles to navigate the state's mental health system to help her mother, who has schizoaffective disorder and is homeless. Budget cuts in 2017 led to a loss of case management services for her mother, exacerbating her mental illness and leading to a cycle of homelessness, jail, and emergency room visits. While Montana has allocated $300 million to improve its behavioral healthcare system, the lack of stable housing remains a significant barrier to long-term recovery for psychiatric patients. Advocates emphasize the need for increased spending on community-based services and housing solutions to break the cycle of crisis.</p>

            <p>Scientists have successfully traced the migration route of painted lady butterflies, revealing a journey spanning thousands of miles across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The Worldwide Painted Lady Migration Project identified ten generations of these butterflies during their annual cycle, following seasonal rains and blooming flowers. Photographer Lucas Foglia documented this journey, highlighting the butterflies' adaptation to climate change and their interaction with human migration patterns. The butterflies' ability to cross borders freely contrasts sharply with the challenges faced by human migrants seeking refuge in Europe.</p>

            <p>Conservationists are warning that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being pushed closer to extinction due to intense grass fires, exacerbated by a record dry spell and high temperatures. Endangered birds, such as hen harriers and golden plovers, along with water voles, are particularly vulnerable as their habitats are destroyed. The National Trust reports that 2025 is shaping up to be the worst year for human-caused fires, impacting irreplaceable ecosystems like temperate Atlantic rainforest. Calls are being made for increased funding to restore peat bogs and for closer oversight of controlled burns to protect these fragile environments.</p>

            <p>The US Army will control a strip of federal land along the US-Mexico border, potentially allowing troops to detain migrants. The transfer aims to circumvent a law prohibiting military involvement in domestic law enforcement. The Pentagon is reviewing the plan, but the government intends for troops to detain migrants on the border. The move represents an escalation in the military's role in border security, previously limited to building infrastructure and providing support to border patrol agents.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off, causing yields to rise to their highest levels in months, coinciding with President Donald Trump's tariff announcements. Experts are debating the cause, with some suggesting that China is weaponizing its Treasury holdings, while others point to Japan's life insurers or hedge funds. The sell-off is unusual given that investors typically flock to the safety of U.S. debt during times of uncertainty. The long-term implications of the sell-off remain to be seen.

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with demands from US President Donald Trump, risking $2.2 billion in federal funding. The university's president, Alan Garber, asserted that no government should dictate the curriculum of private universities. This decision follows Trump's administration freezing federal funds due to alleged antisemitism on campus. Experts suggest that Harvard, with its substantial endowment, is uniquely positioned to withstand the financial repercussions, but the move could signal a broader conflict between the government and higher education.</p>

Research indicates that vape users are transitioning to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban. The percentage of 16-24 year olds primarily using disposable vapes has nearly halved in the past year. The government aims to reduce littering and youth vaping rates with this ban, while still allowing vaping as a means to quit smoking.</p>
