          <p>The Trump administration's ambiguous tariff threats are causing significant disruption for Chinese exporters, many of whom use Southeast Asian nations for transshipment. This policy puts the region in Washington's crosshairs and forces Chinese companies to delay investment and expansion plans due to the lack of clarity on implementation. Business owners are struggling to navigate the volatile trade environment, adopting a cautious approach while awaiting more concrete details from the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, just days after his administration paused some military aid shipments. The decision comes amid Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian cities, which the president described as crossing a line. While the White House cited a need to review military stockpiles for the initial pause, the reversal aims to ensure Ukraine can defend itself as the conflict continues. The move has been met with criticism from the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to raise costs for a wide array of consumer goods and industrial products. Economists warn that because copper is essential for appliances, electronics, electric vehicles, and infrastructure, the tariff could fuel inflation. The administration argues the move is necessary for national security and will help rebuild the domestic copper industry, though experts note it would take years to significantly increase U.S. production.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has confirmed 1,288 measles cases this year, the highest number recorded since 1992 and surpassing the major outbreak of 2019. The majority of cases are linked to an outbreak in West Texas, which has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health experts attribute the surge to declining vaccination rates, as herd immunity requires a 95% vaccination rate, which many communities are failing to meet. The CDC continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the highly contagious virus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan for large-scale layoffs across the federal government. The decision allows the administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to significantly reduce the federal workforce. Labor unions that challenged the plan expressed disappointment, warning the move jeopardizes essential public services and disregards congressional authority. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration's agenda to shrink federal agencies.</p>

          <p>A tentative three-year contract has been reached between the city of Philadelphia and its blue-collar workers, ending an eight-day strike that disrupted city services. The strike involved 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees, causing trash to pile up across the city. The agreement includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, which is significantly less than the union's initial demands. Workers began returning to their jobs immediately, with trash collection expected to be caught up by the weekend.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent erratic decisions regarding military aid to Ukraine have left European allies feeling confused and struggling to keep up. A surprise halt in weapons shipments was followed by an abrupt reversal and a pledge for more aid, all with little communication from Washington. This unpredictability, combined with a looming review of U.S. troop presence in Europe, is causing significant anxiety among NATO members. Allies feel the administration's approach has been uncoordinated, making it difficult to form a coherent strategy.</p>

          <p>This article interprets Pixar's animated film "Elio" as a politically relevant story, particularly in the context of current U.S. immigration policies and ICE raids. The author argues that the protagonist, a Latino boy who feels like an outsider, reflects the alienation felt by many in the Latino community. The piece suggests the film's themes of belonging and migration resonate deeply at a time when many families live in fear. It also speculates that the film's poor box office performance could be linked to a climate of fear deterring families from public activities.</p>
