          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report on the Hudson River helicopter crash in April, which resulted in six fatalities, indicates the helicopter broke apart mid-air. The report details the helicopter's flight path and reveals that witnesses heard loud bangs before the tail boom separated from the main body. The helicopter, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, was carrying a family of five from Spain and the pilot, and it lacked video or data recording devices. Investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the tail boom failure, which led to the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old woman was killed by an alligator while canoeing with her husband on Lake Kissimmee in Florida. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported that the alligator attacked after the canoe passed over it, causing the boat to overturn and the woman to fall on top of the alligator. Her husband attempted to intervene but was unsuccessful, and nuisance alligator trappers were called to the scene, recovering two alligators, one matching the description of the one involved in the incident. This incident is a somber reminder of the potential dangers of wildlife encounters, though fatal alligator attacks remain rare.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates, citing increased uncertainty due to President Trump's tariffs. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the labor market's strength but expressed concerns about potential risks of higher unemployment and inflation. The Fed is taking a wait-and-see approach to assess the economic fallout from the administration's policies, including tariffs on goods from various countries, as the central bank grapples with conflicting goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and stable inflation. Powell emphasized the Fed's readiness to respond to economic developments, but dampened expectations of rate cuts in June.</p>

          <p>The White House is expected to withdraw its nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat as U.S. Surgeon General after right-wing activist Laura Loomer raised concerns about Nesheiwat's qualifications and past support for COVID-19 vaccines. Loomer criticized Nesheiwat for receiving her medical degree from American University of the Caribbean instead of the University of Arkansas. Nesheiwat's potential nomination faced scrutiny due to her medical credentials and previous statements on vaccines, leading to the expected withdrawal.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to preserve the Community Relations Service, a civil rights-era office often referred to as the "peacemakers program."

Democrats argue that the Community Relations Service combats violence and unrest, while the Justice Department has confirmed receipt of the letter but has not commented further.</p>
