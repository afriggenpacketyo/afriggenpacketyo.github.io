          <p>Despite publicly opposing Israel's attacks on Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have taken actions that indirectly support Israel's defense. Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones to protect its own airspace, while Saudi Arabia likely allowed Israel to use its airspace for interceptions. These actions reflect a complex balancing act, as both countries navigate domestic tensions stemming from historical antipathy towards Israel. Jordan's decision is further complicated by its dependence on the US and the need to maintain stability amidst regional conflicts. </p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran continues, speculation grows about the possibility of regime change in Tehran, but historical examples show that foreign-imposed regime change often leads to disastrous consequences.

Experts warn that a ground force would be necessary to topple the current Iranian regime, and there is no guarantee that a new government would bring stability.

          <p>Experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, specifically the FDA's slow approval process for new UV filters, contribute to this disparity. While US sunscreens generally protect against UVB rays, they often provide weaker UVA protection compared to products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives. </p>

          <p>A senior Iranian official has described proposals put forward by European powers at nuclear talks in Geneva as "unrealistic," suggesting an agreement will be difficult if they persist. The official stated that Iran will review the proposals in Tehran and respond at the next meeting. French President Emmanuel Macron spoke with his Iranian counterpart, agreeing to accelerate negotiations, but insisted Iran must ensure its intentions are peaceful. The Iranian official dismissed negotiating defensive capabilities and reiterated that zero uranium enrichment is a dead end. </p>

The strategy involves absorbing Israeli strikes, mobilizing Putin to dissuade Trump from military action, and agreeing to negotiations while delaying progress.
