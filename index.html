        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil announced first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street predictions, although profits decreased compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by concerns that President Trump's tariffs would negatively impact global demand. The oil major reported that volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting initiatives, largely compensated for lower earnings resulting from weak oil prices. The company's first-quarter capital expenditures aligned with guidance, and Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, showcasing its financial strength amidst market uncertainties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services department killed nearly 2 million wild animals last year for various reasons, including protecting endangered species and preventing bird strikes at airports. However, the majority of these killings involved species like coyotes, starlings, and feral hogs that conflict with animal agriculture, highlighting a consequence of meat and dairy production. The agency uses methods such as firearms, poisons, and traps, with some former employees criticizing the program's deference to ranchers and the overblown threat posed by predators to livestock. While the agency has increased its use of non-lethal deterrents, advocates argue that these efforts are insufficient to address the impact of agricultural sprawl on wildlife.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released a report advocating for psychotherapy over gender-affirming care for transgender children and teens, citing alleged harms from medical interventions like puberty blockers. The report claims low evidence of safety and mental health benefits from puberty blockers and hormone therapies, while experts argue these treatments are generally safe and have a positive impact on mental health. The American Academy of Pediatrics expressed deep alarm over the HHS report, stating that it misrepresents the current medical consensus and fails to reflect the realities of pediatric care. The report has fueled concerns about increasing anti-LGBTQ+ legislation and its potential harm to transgender individuals.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is launching a campaign targeting vulnerable Republicans in Congress who are expected to support a bill that could slash the social safety net to fund tax cuts. The "Fight to Save Medicaid" campaign will focus on lawmakers in districts carried by Kamala Harris or with slim Trump margins. The DNC plans to organize town halls, encourage voter outreach, and use social media to pressure these Republicans to oppose the bill. The Republican bill aims to reduce government spending by at least $1.5 trillion, potentially impacting Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).</p>

          <p>The article argues for the benefits of reindustrializing the United States, citing a poll showing that 80% of Americans believe the country would be better off with more manufacturing jobs. It suggests that a strong manufacturing sector has a positive effect on the entire economy, leading to higher wages, national self-sufficiency, and increased leverage in trade negotiations. The piece contends that reshoring manufacturing is good politics and could help the left regain working-class voters. It also suggests that America’s deindustrialization could be an advantage for its industrial rebirth, as the destruction of old factories gives the country a fresh start.</p>
