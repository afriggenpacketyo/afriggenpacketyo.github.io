          <p>Rivian Automotive is adjusting its 2025 delivery targets downward, now expecting to deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 units, and increasing its capital expenditure guidance to $1.8 to $1.9 billion. This adjustment comes amidst concerns about the global trade and economic environment, particularly evolving trade regulations, policies, and tariffs under President Trump, impacting consumer sentiment and demand. Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year and anticipates adjusted losses before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion. The company reported a better-than-expected first quarter, achieving its second consecutive quarter of gross profit and ending the quarter with $8.5 billion in liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For over a decade, humanitarian organizations have been rescuing refugees in the Mediterranean Sea, yet they continue to feel unsupported by the European Union, according to this article. Despite agreements between the EU and countries like Libya and Tunisia aimed at reducing migration, human rights violations persist, with rescued migrants reporting instances of torture and sexual assault. The organization SOS Humanity, which has rescued over 38,000 refugees, advocates for a collective European sea rescue program and an end to cooperation agreements with countries where migrants face abuse. Migration experts emphasize the ongoing failure to prevent deaths in the Mediterranean, calling for solutions rooted in the rule of law and human dignity rather than populism.</p>

AMD's data center segment, which includes server CPUs and GPUs, experienced a 57% increase in sales, driven by strong demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs used in AI applications. The company's forecast for the current quarter includes approximately $7.4 billion in sales, with a gross margin of 43%, although it also anticipates incurring $800 million in costs due to U.S. export controls on some AI chips.

          <p>Friedrich Merz was elected as Germany's 10th postwar chancellor after an unprecedented initial failure to secure enough votes in Parliament, leading to concerns about his leadership's strength during a critical period for Germany and Europe, according to this New York Times article. Despite his party holding enough seats to elect him, Merz fell six votes short on the first ballot, raising questions about dissent within the coalition. He ultimately won on a second ballot, but analysts warn that the setback could undermine his ability to project strength internationally and pass key legislation to address Germany's economic challenges, counter Russian aggression, and manage immigration concerns.

Despite Trump's earlier criticisms of Canada's dependence on the U.S., the meeting struck a more conciliatory tone, with Trump praising Carney's election victory. The discussions, however, did not yield breakthroughs on key issues like tariffs, with Trump indicating no immediate policy changes, although both leaders agreed to continue talks and address global concerns of common interest.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat analyzes the portrayal of the rich in American television, contrasting aspirational, judgmental, and reassuring spirits, in this New York Times opinion piece. He focuses on "Your Friends & Neighbors," an Apple TV show, which uniquely eliminates aspirational elements, depicting affluent characters in leafy Connecticut as unhappy and financially insecure, despite their wealth. Douthat contrasts this with shows like "Mad Men," where characters, despite personal problems, inhabit a more stylish and enviable world. The author questions whether this bleak portrayal is an accurate reflection of the contemporary rich, suggesting it may be an overdetermined and less convincing view compared to more aspirational depictions.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching his new film, Ocean, which he considers one of the most important of his career, as he approaches his hundredth year, according to this BBC article. The film argues that the ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate change, while also documenting the catastrophic decline in marine life. Attenborough emphasizes the ocean's capacity to recover rapidly if given the chance, highlighting the story of whales as a source of optimism. The film calls for leaders to take firm action to protect a third of the world's oceans, which could transform the planet.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States would cease bombing the Houthis in Yemen after the rebel group pledged to stop attacking U.S. ships in the Red Sea, according to this ABC News article.

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a 12% drop despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration, prompting analysts to raise concerns about international revenue, according to this CNBC article. CEO Alex Karp defended the company, stating that Palantir is "pretty happy" and that investors are not obligated to buy their shares. While Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and lifted its revenue guidance for the year, analysts attributed the stock's decline to a decline in international revenue and failure to reach a high bar on growth. The company reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

While the filing may appear as a victory for abortion access, it avoids revealing the administration's plans for mifepristone.

          <p>Randi Weingarten argues for a shift in America's approach to education, advocating for multiple pathways beyond the traditional four-year college route, in this New York Times guest essay. With a significant percentage of high schoolers not enrolling or completing college, Weingarten proposes aligning high school to both college prep and in-demand vocational career pathways. She highlights successful programs, such as the Brooklyn STEAM Center and the Red Hawks Rising Teacher Academy, that provide students with relevant coursework and career opportunities. She contrasts this approach with the Trump administration's proposed cuts to K-12 education and Republican-led states' embrace of school vouchers.</p>
