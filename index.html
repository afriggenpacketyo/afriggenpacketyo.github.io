          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and drifted into the bridge's underside, causing significant damage to its masts and rigging. Emergency responders transported the injured to Pier 16, where crowds gathered to cheer on the survivors. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident, which briefly closed all lanes of the Brooklyn Bridge and raised concerns about potential structural damage, though initial inspections found none.</p>

          <p>A recent internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that less than 1% of German soldiers harbor right-wing extremist views. While the study offers some reassurance, it also reveals that a notable percentage of soldiers hold chauvinist or xenophobic attitudes. Researchers caution against complacency, noting that the survey relies on voluntary responses and may underestimate the true extent of extremism within the military. With the German government aiming to increase recruitment, maintaining rigorous checks on potential recruits will be crucial.</p>

          <p>In the retrial of Karen Read, accused of murder in the death of her boyfriend, a Massachusetts judge has barred references to a separate, mishandled murder investigation by Canton Police. The judge's decision comes amid scrutiny of police procedures in the Read case, with concerns raised about evidence handling and documentation. Experts emphasize the importance of proper police training and documentation to avoid errors that could compromise cases. Read denies striking O'Keefe with her car and claims she is being framed, while the prosecution aims to prove she committed a drunk-driving hit-and-run.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel argues that while President Trump's family has brazenly profited from his position through foreign deals and influence peddling, this behavior is not entirely new in American politics. The article points to past instances of politicians, including Joe Biden and the Clinton family, engaging in similar activities, highlighting a broader pattern of ethical lapses. The author contends that Trump's actions have dismantled key tools against foreign corruption, damaging the U.S.'s global reputation.

In Europe, driven by environmental concerns and government support, sleeper trains are becoming a competitive alternative to short-haul flights. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to prioritize car-centric infrastructure and invest in unproven, niche transportation projects. The article advocates for revitalized rail networks in America, emphasizing their potential to foster community, reduce environmental impact, and offer a more sustainable vision for the future of travel.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using public-private partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans through the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Projects like Nairobi's mega-highway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are adopting PPPs, with Chinese contractors recouping investments through toll fees. This approach allows China to continue supporting infrastructure development in Africa while mitigating financial risks for both parties.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 02:24:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed delaying the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and charging current beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" a monthly fee of $100 starting in 2027. Citing budget deficits, Newsom aims to address a $12 billion shortfall partly attributed to tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The plan would suspend access to comprehensive services for undocumented adults over 19, while those with "unsatisfactory" status would face monthly charges. The proposals are expected to save California $5.4 billion by fiscal year 2028-29.</p>
