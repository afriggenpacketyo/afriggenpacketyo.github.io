            <p>The introduction of a 125% tariff on goods imported from China to the US, under President Trump's trade policy, could significantly increase the cost of iPhones and other popular gadgets. Analysts predict that if these costs are passed on to consumers, iPhone prices in the US could rise by hundreds of dollars. While Apple is exploring diversifying its supply chain, shifting production from China to other countries like India and Vietnam is a complex and costly process, taking years and billions of dollars.

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause on country-specific tariffs after initially implementing them, citing negotiations with over 75 countries. This decision followed market declines and pressure from investors. While these tariffs are on hold, the 10% baseline tariff on all imports remains, and tariffs on China have increased to 125%. The EU is also pausing retaliatory tariffs against the US, signaling a willingness to negotiate, but the trade war between the US and China appears to be escalating.</p>

            <p>President Trump's abrupt reversal on tariffs demonstrates the dangers of unchecked executive power, as his decisions, driven by personal whims, can significantly impact the global economy. The system of checks and balances intended to limit executive authority has failed, with Congress, the Cabinet, and the courts seemingly unable to restrain the president. This situation underscores the importance of legislative and judicial oversight to prevent one-man rule and potential economic instability.</p>

            <p>Inflation slowed in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, but economists warn that tariffs could reverse this trend. The consumer price index rose 2.4% for the year, down from 2.8% in February. However, rising grocery prices and Trump's tariff policy pose challenges. Economists predict that tariffs will be the main driver of inflation, potentially pushing the U.S. inflation rate to around 4% by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Republicans are portraying President Trump's decision to pause tariffs as a strategic move, while Democrats criticize it as chaotic. Republican lawmakers claim Trump created leverage and brought countries to the negotiating table. Billionaire Bill Ackman praised the decision as "brilliantly executed." However, some economists argue the effective tariff rate is higher with the pause due to tariffs on China. Democrats accuse Trump of playing games with the economy and creating opportunities for insider trading.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has introduced significant uncertainty into the oil market, causing crude price fluctuations and undermining investor confidence. U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped sharply before rebounding after Trump paused tariffs on most trade partners. This volatility creates an environment of "extreme uncertainty" for U.S. oil producers, potentially jeopardizing domestic production. Companies may reduce capital expenditures and scale back activity in the oil patch. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's political allies have expressed relief following his recent reversal on tariffs, framing it as part of a larger strategic plan. While Trump backed off imposing higher tariffs on most countries, he escalated the trade war with China and maintained a 10% tariff rate globally. Billionaire Bill Ackman, who had previously questioned Trump's rationale, now lauded the decision as "brilliantly executed". However, some Republicans expressed concern over the 10% baseline rate, which remains historically high.</p>
