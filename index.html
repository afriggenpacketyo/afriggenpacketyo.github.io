        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its UK growth expectations downward, citing US tariff barriers and high interest payments on government debt as key factors. The think tank lowered its forecast for UK growth this year to 1.3% from the 1.4% predicted in March, emphasizing the country's limited buffer in public finances. The OECD urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider boosting tax revenue and cutting spending to strengthen public finances, suggesting a balanced approach involving targeted spending cuts and tax increases. Despite better-than-expected growth between January and March, the OECD cautioned that momentum is weakening due to deteriorating business sentiment, forecasting a 1% expansion in 2026. Optimism for the UK economy remains tempered by concerns over public finance stability.</p>

Soliman, who is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at a pro-Israel demonstration, was in the U.S. on an expired tourist visa, though he had previously been granted a work permit that also expired. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that terrorists and their families on visas would be found, visas revoked, and deported under the Trump Administration.

          <p>Elon Musk has voiced strong disapproval of President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," labeling it a "disgusting abomination" and criticizing its contribution to the national debt. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts while increasing spending on military and border security, adding an estimated $3.8 trillion to the federal debt over the next decade. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed Musk's criticism, reaffirming the president's support for the bill.

Voter turnout was an impressive 77.8%, the highest ever seen in a Korean election, reflecting the public's desire for change after Yoon's controversial imposition of martial law.

The data, collected by former Kennedy Center employees and confirmed by a current staff member, suggests potential mismanagement by the new leadership. A boycott by Les MisÃ©rables cast members and cancellations of several shows have also contributed to the center's challenges since Trump assumed control.</p>

          <p>The White House defended the President Donald Trump-endorsed tax bill after Elon Musk criticized it as a "disgusting abomination." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president's opinion of the bill remains unchanged despite Musk's criticism. Musk, who previously led cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), had criticized the bill for undermining the work his team was doing. Trump acknowledged Musk's criticism but emphasized the need to secure votes to pass the bill.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy. The proposed changes would add another layer to President Trump's government-wide immigration crackdown, targeting a massively backlogged asylum system. Advocates worry that this could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy.
