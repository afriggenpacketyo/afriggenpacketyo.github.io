          <p>During high-level talks in Xiamen, China committed to expanding its support for Pacific Island countries in building climate resilience, including a $2 million contribution to a climate change fund. The investment aims to enhance cooperation in renewable energy, agriculture, fishery, low-carbon infrastructure, and tourism. China will also undertake 100 "small-and-beautiful" projects to improve the capability of Pacific Island nations to tackle climate-related hazards, shifting the focus of the Belt and Road Initiative towards sustainable improvements in people’s lives. This initiative is part of Beijing's ongoing efforts to reinforce its outreach to the strategically important region. The meeting included representatives from 11 of the 18 member states of the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, describing it as "beyond comprehension," following an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinian civilians. The Israeli government's slow response to these remarks indicates their impact, especially considering Germany's historical sensitivity towards criticizing Israel. Merz stressed the importance of speaking out when international humanitarian law is violated, a sentiment echoed by the Israeli media's coverage of his comments. Experts believe that the silence from Israeli officials suggests Merz's words have resonated deeply with the political elite in Jerusalem, particularly given growing concerns about Israel's international isolation.</p>

          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition force in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape and mirroring the broader surge of far-right movements in Europe. The party secured 60 seats in the National Assembly, surpassing the Socialist party and challenging the traditional dominance of center-right and center-left parties. Chega's rise, fueled by its hardline stance against immigration and the instability of traditional parties, represents a profound change in Portuguese politics. The center-right Democratic Alliance, led by Luis Montenegro, will now face an emboldened far-right competitor campaigning under the slogan "Save Portugal."</p>

          <p>A gas cylinder found at a construction site in eastern Tokyo, the site of explosions that injured 10 people, had expired in November 1964. The explosions occurred during piling work for a new house in Edogawa Ward, which had been a parking space for about 40 years. Police believe workers drilled into the cylinder, causing the acetylene gas to ignite. The cylinder had a hole measuring about 6 centimeters in diameter and was entirely rust-covered when recovered by police.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel's $15 billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel is under investor and analyst scrutiny regarding its near-term benefits, even with hopes for strong U.S. demand. The merger would create the world's third-largest steel producer, but concerns exist about potential new share issuances to fund the takeover. Analysts are questioning whether this is the best use of capital, especially given Nippon Steel's investment commitments to a new coal-dependent blast furnace at a time when the global steel sector is shifting towards low-carbon alternatives. The deal also faces potential dilution and uncertainty regarding short-term returns, considering U.S. Steel's recent net loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution stipulates that only Congress, not the president, has the authority to levy taxes. The immediate implications of the court's ruling are unclear as the case needs to go through the appeals process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 17,000 people in Canada's Manitoba province are being evacuated due to raging wildfires, prompting a province-wide state of emergency. The Manitoba government has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney to aid in both the evacuation and firefighting efforts. Evacuations include the town of Flin Flon, along with several other remote towns and Indigenous communities, with most evacuees being transported to Winnipeg.

          <p>In a drastic move to curtail international students in the U.S., Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the federal government will "aggressively" revoke visas from Chinese students and enhance scrutiny for future applicants. The edict could affect many of the approximately 280,000 Chinese high school, university, and graduate-level students currently in the U.S. Rubio did not define what he meant by "critical fields," but he likely means students working in areas like semiconductor engineer or aerospace where the U.S. and China are technological rivals.</p>
