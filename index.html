        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a plan to significantly lower the cost of drugs for in vitro fertilization (IVF) by negotiating lower prices. President Trump stated that the per-cycle drug costs could fall by an estimated 73% after biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono agreed to provide substantial discounts on its fertility drugs. While this move is presented as a major victory for families, the overall cost reduction for a full IVF cycle remains unclear, as drug prices are only one component of the expensive procedure. This action follows a previous pledge by Trump to seek full insurance or federal coverage for IVF treatments.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement followed a lengthy phone call between the two leaders, which the Kremlin described as frank and informative. High-level advisors from both the U.S. and Russia are scheduled to meet next week to prepare for the summit. This diplomatic effort comes amid President Trump's growing frustration with the prolonged conflict and occurs just one day before he is scheduled to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revealed plans to construct a large triumphal arch, dubbed the 'Arc de Trump,' in Washington D.C. to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. The proposed monument, inspired by Paris's Arc de Triomphe, would be situated at the end of the Memorial Bridge near the Lincoln Memorial and is reportedly being privately funded. However, the project faces significant regulatory hurdles, as constructing new memorials in the capital is a complex and lengthy process requiring congressional approval and review by multiple commissions. Experts suggest that completing such a monument by the 2026 anniversary is highly unlikely given the typical multi-year timeline for design, approval, and construction.</p>

          <p>Over 3,000 individuals in the United Kingdom have initiated a joint legal claim against Johnson & Johnson, alleging that the company's talcum-based baby powder was contaminated with asbestos, leading to cancer and other illnesses. The lawsuit, potentially worth over £1 billion, claims J&J was aware of the carcinogenic fibers for decades but continued to sell the product, only withdrawing it from UK shelves in 2023. Kenvue, the company spun off from J&J that now handles these claims, maintains that its talc products are safe and asbestos-free, citing years of independent testing and regulatory compliance.</p>

The breach prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue an emergency directive, ordering federal agencies to apply the latest security updates immediately. F5 stated it has not seen evidence of active exploitation of any undisclosed vulnerabilities since discovering the attack in August.</p>

          <p>Fishermen in Venezuela are expressing growing fear for their safety following a series of U.S. military strikes on suspected "narco-boats" in the Caribbean, which have killed at least 27 people. The U.S. has deployed a significant naval and air presence as part of an operation targeting narco-terrorism allegedly linked to the Venezuelan government. This military escalation has created a climate of anxiety among local fishing communities, who worry they could be mistakenly targeted in the crossfire. The situation has prompted some fishermen to join government-backed militias in a show of defiance against the U.S. presence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block a new rule imposing a $100,000 annual fee for each H-1B visa. The H-1B program allows U.S. companies to hire skilled foreign workers, and the Chamber argues that this steep fee is unlawful and will be prohibitive for many businesses, especially startups and small to midsize companies. The lawsuit claims the fee overrides the Immigration and Nationality Act, which requires such fees to be based on the government's processing costs. This move is part of the administration's broader effort to overhaul immigration and encourage domestic hiring.</p>

          <p>A recent report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund reveals that Americans are receiving an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month, the highest volume in six years. The problem has been exacerbated by a shift to robotexts, which have nearly tripled since 2021, and the increasing sophistication of scams using artificial intelligence. Despite the 2019 TRACED Act, which mandated stronger anti-robocall technology, less than half of phone companies have fully implemented the required software. This proliferation of unsolicited messages continues to pose a significant financial risk, with victims losing thousands of dollars to increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes.</p>

          <p>Representative Ro Khanna is introducing a House resolution calling for significant reforms at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The proposal urges mandatory body cameras, visible identification for agents, and the transfer of ICE oversight to the Department of Justice. This move follows recent federal immigration crackdowns, particularly in Chicago, where agents' use of unmarked vehicles and tear gas has drawn heavy criticism. While the resolution is unlikely to pass in the Republican-controlled House, it aims to increase accountability and transparency amid heightened tensions over immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Goaltender Carter Hart has agreed to a contract with the Vegas Golden Knights, making him the first of five players from the 2018 Canadian world junior team to return to the NHL after being acquitted of sexual assault. The players were charged in 2024 in connection with a 2018 incident, but a judge found the prosecution did not meet the burden of proof. While the players were not found criminally liable, the NHL stated their conduct was "unacceptable" and they are not eligible to play in games until December 1 as part of a reinstatement process.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the average annual percentage rates (APRs) on consumer credit cards have not seen a proportional decrease. A report from CardRatings.com found that while the Fed lowered its benchmark rate, the average credit card rate fell only marginally, remaining over 24% for many consumers. Experts explain that card issuers are influenced by various factors, including credit conditions and individual credit scores, and may not pass on the full savings to borrowers. Some retail credit cards have even increased their rates, citing other regulatory pressures on their profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

This was the fifth such strike in the Caribbean, bringing the total death toll to 27.

          <p>While debt settlement can be an effective strategy for unsecured debts like credit card balances, many types of financial obligations do not qualify for this form of relief. Secured debts, such as mortgages and auto loans, are typically excluded because lenders can repossess the collateral. Government-backed debts, including federal student loans and back taxes owed to the IRS, also fall outside the scope of traditional settlement programs. Furthermore, legally mandated payments like child support, alimony, and court-ordered fines cannot be negotiated down, requiring alternative strategies like bankruptcy or specialized repayment plans for resolution.</p>

The top spending categories include costumes, decorations, party supplies, and candy for trick-or-treaters. The report suggests that consumers view Halloween as a relatively low-cost holiday, making them less likely to cut back on spending.
