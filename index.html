          <p>The NCAA women's basketball tournament Final Four experienced a significant decrease in TV ratings compared to the previous year, which had record-breaking viewership due to Caitlin Clark's presence. This year's broadcasts averaged 3.9 million viewers, a 64% decrease from 2024's 10.8 million. However, it was still the second-most watched Final Four in history. Clark's popularity had previously boosted WNBA viewership and attendance records, but the playoffs also saw a drop after her team's season ended.</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers face uncertainty as the Biden administration's SAVE plan is blocked by legal challenges, and the Trump administration alters repayment plan terms. Borrowers in the SAVE program are in an interest-free forbearance, but this doesn't count towards loan forgiveness. Alternative IDR plans like Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, and Income-Contingent Repayment are available, but automatic loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years is currently unavailable under ICR or PAYE. Borrowers should explore their options to manage their debt effectively.

          <p>A psychologist with 20 years of experience explains that parents who raise emotionally resilient children demonstrate four key behaviors. These include acknowledging and respecting their own emotions, effectively managing their feelings, avoiding labeling emotions as inherently good or bad, and engaging in self-reflection. By modeling these behaviors, parents teach their children that emotions are valuable sources of information and guide them in navigating life's challenges with confidence and wisdom.</p>

          <p>President Trump has told Americans to "hang tough" as new tariffs go into effect, describing them as an "economic revolution" aimed at bringing back jobs and businesses. The tariffs include a 10% universal duty on all US imports and reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations. China has announced retaliatory tariffs. The tariff announcement has sent global markets plummeting, but Trump insists China has been hit harder.</p>

          <p>Texas is on the verge of passing a significant school voucher bill, which would provide parents with $10,000 annually for private school tuition. Governor Greg Abbott has made this a top policy priority and has actively campaigned for its passage. The bill has advanced out of committee, and Abbott plans to celebrate its likely enactment into law. This program aims to expand school choice beyond affluent families to the state's large student population.</p>

          <p>Stanley Plumly's poem "Chickadee" reflects on themes of memory, connection, and loss. The poem contrasts the grand and sublime with the small and intimate, focusing on the simple act of feeding chickadees. It explores the speaker's relationship with nature and the feelings of separation and longing that arise during winter. The poem concludes with a sense of appreciation for the small moments of warmth and connection in a world often defined by distance.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the growing class divide in America, arguing that a "comfort class" of individuals with generational wealth and financial security dominates societal systems. This disconnect from the lives of the majority contributes to misunderstandings and resentment, as seen in the rejection of DEI and the rise of Donald Trump. The author highlights the importance of recognizing and addressing the financial anxieties of working-class Americans, who often feel ignored by the elite.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen won the Japanese Grand Prix, but McLaren faced strategic challenges that prevented them from capitalizing on their car's potential. McLaren attempted an undercut strategy with Lando Norris, but Red Bull anticipated their move. Tire degradation was lower than expected, diminishing McLaren's advantage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US dollar has weakened following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, as recession fears outweigh the expected positive impact. Investors are seeking safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The euro has risen due to optimism surrounding a potential peace deal in Ukraine. Experts believe the currency market can withstand these moves, but companies may become more aggressive in hedging their currency risk.
