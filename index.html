          <p>Despite JPMorgan Chase's record profits and growth under CEO Jamie Dimon, Dimon frequently expresses concerns about the economy and geopolitical risks. While Dimon's warnings about potential economic calamities have not always materialized, JPMorgan has consistently outperformed its rivals. Some analysts suggest Dimon's downbeat remarks serve to keep his management team focused and prevent complacency, while others believe it's a strategy to manage expectations and protect his reputation. Dimon's cautious outlook may also stem from the inherent fragility of financial institutions, as evidenced by the past failures of other major firms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant number of millennials are choosing not to have children, contributing to a record low fertility rate in the U.S. This trend is attributed to financial burdens, career priorities, and concerns about climate change, but also a cultural shift in defining harm and abuse. Millennials are holding their parents to higher standards, expecting them to be accountable for their mental health and career success well into adulthood, creating a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. This generation's dread of parenthood stems from the fear of not meeting these elevated expectations and potentially causing harm to their children. </p>

          <p>A proposed Republican plan for student loans, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," could extend repayment terms to up to 30 years, raising concerns about "indentured servitude," according to higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. The House-passed bill would offer two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan (IDR) with loan forgiveness after 30 years. While supporters argue it ensures borrowers pay down their principal, critics fear the extended repayment timeline will burden borrowers for decades. The House bill's student loan provisions are unlikely to significantly change in the upper chamber before Trump signs it into law, Kantrowitz said. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Soap Made With Sydney Sweeney's Bathwater Sparks Controversy</h2>

          <p>Dr. Squatch, a boutique soap company, has released a limited-edition soap called "Sydney's Bathwater Bliss," purportedly made with Sydney Sweeney's used bathwater. The product's announcement has drawn mixed reactions, with some finding it humorous and others deeming it "weird and gross." The soap is said to smell like Sweeney's childhood homeland, the Pacific Northwest, so anyone who has a warm and innocent association with that area’s pine, Douglas fir and earthy moss essence is likely to have that completely ruined. The controversy surrounding the soap highlights the extremes of celebrity culture and marketing tactics.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, amidst investor uncertainty regarding the proposed merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Trump previously described the deal as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment from Nippon. However, the structure of the deal remains unclear, particularly after President Joe Biden rejected Nippon's acquisition on national security grounds in January. Investors and union members are looking for clarity on the future of U.S. Steel and the nature of the agreement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has voluntarily dismissed its civil lawsuit against Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. This action reflects a more accommodating stance towards cryptocurrencies under the Trump administration. The SEC said that dismissing the enforcement case was appropriate “in the exercise of its discretion and as a policy matter”. Since returning to the White House, Trump has expressed support for the crypto industry and reversed previous regulatory crackdowns, and has launched a cryptocurrency and hosted a dinner for the coin’s top holders.

The author has previously returned to some of her characters as adults, such as in her adult fiction book Think Again, but remains wary of doing so with Tracy Beaker. Dame Jacqueline said she still felt anxious when writing. "Always about halfway through a book, even now, you think 'I've got the hang of this with all these books that I've written', but I get that terrible doubt and worry about it and and it's just something you learn.

The sale symbolizes the end of a significant chapter in British banking history, though the government will take a loss of £10bn.

Red Bull and Ferrari hope the restrictions will boost their competitiveness, while McLaren believes it will have little effect on them. Teams have long used front-wing flexibility to boost speed on the straights while retaining downforce in the corners.</p>
