        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. Treasury yields and the dollar weaken due to trade policy shifts under President Trump, gold has surged to new highs, reaching $3,500 per ounce, and is projected to climb further. Analysts attribute this trend to dwindling faith in U.S. assets amid economic and geopolitical uncertainties, compounded by tariff-induced inflation expectations. Gold's appeal lies in its independence from any single nation's credit risk or policy trajectory, making it a preferred asset during times of wavering confidence in traditional financial instruments. This shift marks a departure from the traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SK Hynix, a key Nvidia supplier, reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding revenue and operating profit estimates due to high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. Revenue rose 42% and operating profit surged 158% year-on-year, although there was a drop compared to the record-high December quarter. While macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies, create demand volatility that will impact the second half of the year, SK Hynix anticipates limited impact from tariffs on its AI server demand. The company expects continued spending on AI from Big Tech and sovereign AI projects to fuel memory demand, citing DeepSeek's open-source R1 reasoning model as a catalyst for AI development.</p>

          <p>Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been indicted on bribery charges, adding to the recurring pattern of criminal investigations against former leaders in the country. The indictment relates to the employment of his former son-in-law at a now-defunct budget airline in Thailand. Prosecutors allege that the salary and housing allowances received by the son-in-law were a bribe paid to Moon by a South Korean businessman who controlled the airline, given the son-in-law's lack of qualifications for the position.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the United States has no specific currency targets in trade negotiations with Japan, ahead of a meeting with Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato.

While the U.S. is not pursuing specific exchange rates, it expects Japan to honor the G7 agreement that currencies should reflect economic fundamentals. The Trump administration believes tariffs, nontariff trade barriers, currency manipulation, and government subsidies should be addressed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.</p>

          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi vaccine alliance have jointly warned of a global increase in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, meningitis, and yellow fever. Cases of measles have risen by 20% in a year, reaching 10.3 million in 2023, and this trend is expected to continue. Insufficient vaccination, funding cuts, misinformation, and humanitarian crises have contributed to the resurgence of these diseases.

          <p>Victims of murder, manslaughter, and stalking are advocating for perpetrators to be restricted to specific zones after release from prison, arguing that current exclusion zones around victims' homes are insufficient. They propose that high-risk former prisoners should only be allowed to live, work, and travel in designated areas of the UK. While some experts raise concerns about breaching perpetrators' human rights, victims argue that their freedom is already compromised by the fear and anxiety caused by released offenders. The Ministry of Justice states that offenders on license must follow strict conditions, including curfews and exclusion zones.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor and former member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, assesses the likelihood of a US recession in the wake of Trump's tariff policies. He notes indicators such as an inverted yield curve, declining consumer confidence, and prediction market odds, which suggest a high probability of recession. While some economic measures like retail sales show continued growth, nowcasts indicate a potential slowdown. Based on current information, Frankel estimates the odds of a US recession at 60% for the coming year, potentially higher in the long term.</p>
