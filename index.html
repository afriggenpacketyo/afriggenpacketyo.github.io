          <p>President Trump has softened his stance on potentially firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he has frequently criticized for keeping interest rates high. While reiterating his disapproval of Powell's performance, Trump noted that the Fed chair's term will end in about eight months anyway, making a dismissal "highly unlikely." The comments come amid ongoing friction between the White House and the central bank over monetary policy and a controversial renovation project at the Fed's Washington headquarters. This ongoing dispute highlights the political pressures facing the independent institution as it navigates economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 59-year-old dual U.S.-Chinese citizen, Chenguang Gong, has pleaded guilty to stealing over 3,600 files containing sensitive trade secrets from a Los Angeles-area defense contractor. The stolen data included blueprints for advanced infrared sensors used in space-based missile detection systems and for protecting U.S. military aircraft. Prosecutors stated the theft could cause over $3.5 million in economic damage and would be dangerous to national security if obtained by foreign actors. Gong, who had previously applied to China's "Talent Programs," now faces a maximum of 10 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for September.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency has officially identified the remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, who was killed in action in Laos during the Vietnam War. Hall was one of 11 servicemen who died when their remote radio site on a mountain peak was attacked by commandos on March 11, 1968. His remains were discovered during joint recovery operations on the mountain earlier this year. Using anthropological and DNA analysis, scientists confirmed his identity, bringing closure to his family nearly six decades after his death. He is scheduled to be buried in Kansas this September.</p>

          <p>A detailed article explores the controversial role of Hikmat al-Hijri, a spiritual leader of Syria's Druze community, in the recent deadly violence in the Sweida province. Critics label him a belligerent warlord whose uncompromising stance toward the new Syrian government escalated the conflict, while supporters see him as a defender of his community's dignity. Al-Hijri's rejection of ceasefire agreements and his call for international protection have deepened sectarian tensions. His actions highlight the deep divisions within the Druze community and the broader challenges facing Syria's fragile transition as minority groups negotiate their future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by BBC's Jeremy Bowen suggests that nearly two years into the war, Israel is facing increasing international isolation as evidence of its war crimes in Gaza accumulates. While Hamas committed atrocities on October 7, 2023, Israel's subsequent actions, including the starvation of civilians and disproportionate destruction, have drawn condemnation from key allies. A recent joint statement from the UK, EU, Canada, and others strongly criticized Israel's failing aid model and the killing of civilians seeking aid. This growing impatience, even from the U.S., puts pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu and signals a potential shift toward diplomacy if a ceasefire can be achieved.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing number of American retirees are substantially dependent on Social Security benefits, with about two-thirds now relying on them for income compared to half in 2005. This increased reliance coincides with declining public confidence in the program's long-term stability, as it faces a potential funding shortfall by 2034. The survey highlights a widespread concern, with 78% of Americans worried that benefits will be insufficient for retirement. Despite its importance, many people lack basic knowledge about the program, such as the age to maximize benefits, underscoring the need for greater public education and political action.

Phillips offered to provide personal information about former UK defense secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents.

Phillips, who reportedly dreamed of being like James Bond, provided a USB stick with sensitive information and applied for a job with UK Border Force as part of his plan.

          <p>The UK High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech tycoon Mike Lynch and his former business partner, Sushovan Hussain, owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's firm, Autonomy, with the court finding that the company's finances were misrepresented during the sale. Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year, had prepared a statement calling HPE's claim a "wild overstatement." This judgment concludes a long and bitter legal battle, although a further hearing will determine the final damages and potential for an appeal by Lynch's estate.</p>

While President Trump has dismissed the issue, Carlson has channeled supporter anger, arguing the government's refusal to provide more information is a betrayal of the base. At a recent conference, Carlson compared the administration's dismissiveness to the establishment attitude Trump campaigned against, framing it as a key reason for his distress. This stance positions Carlson as a powerful dissenting voice, challenging Trump's control over the narrative and highlighting deeper ideological divides within the right-wing movement.</p>

With an expected 12 million people losing Medicaid coverage by 2034, emergency rooms will face a surge in uncompensated care, which already totals nearly $6 billion annually. This financial strain will disproportionately affect rural hospitals, which are highly dependent on Medicaid reimbursement and already at risk of closure.

          <p>A new analysis highlights how recent legislation shifting the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to states could dramatically increase food insecurity in the U.S. The bill is expected to cut $186 billion in federal SNAP spending over ten years, potentially causing over 3 million Americans to lose benefits. With states now responsible for covering costs, many may be forced to scale back or eliminate their programs, overwhelming food banks. The article reviews the history of SNAP, from its origins in the 1960s to its current role in feeding 42 million Americans, arguing these cuts undermine the program's fundamental purpose.</p>

          <p>Target has announced it will discontinue its long-standing price matching policy for competitors Amazon and Walmart, effective July 28. For 12 years, the policy allowed shoppers to receive a price match on an identical item found for less at the two rival retail giants within 14 days of purchase. A Target spokesperson stated the change is because customers overwhelmingly price match Target's own online prices rather than competitors'. The decision comes as the retailer grapples with declining sales and store traffic in what its CEO has described as an "exceptionally challenging environment" for consumer spending.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has confirmed that a five-day strike by resident doctors in England will begin on Friday after negotiations with the government failed to produce a breakthrough. The talks had focused on improving working conditions, but the BMA stated that the core issue of pay restoration was not adequately addressed. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the union had "recklessly" opted for strike action despite offers on non-pay issues. The strike is expected to cause significant disruption, with NHS England's plan to limit cancellations of routine treatments drawing criticism from the BMA for potentially stretching senior doctors too thin.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, appointing former foreign and home secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary.

The reshuffle aims to advance the party's policy renewal and present a unified front, though it comes at a time when the Conservatives are struggling in opinion polls eight months into Badenoch's leadership.</p>

The child's father has been hailed as a hero for pulling the minor from the animal's jaws on a popular trail. Following the incident, the child was airlifted to a Seattle trauma center and has since been discharged. Park officials later located and euthanized the collared cougar responsible for the attack, stating there is no ongoing danger to visitors.

          <p>The United States has announced its decision to withdraw from UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural and education agency, effective December 2026. The State Department accused the organization of promoting a "woke, divisive" agenda and cited its inclusion of Palestine as a member state in 2011 as "highly problematic" and fostering anti-Israel rhetoric. UNESCO's Director-General, Audrey Azoulay, called the decision regrettable but anticipated, refuting the claims and highlighting the agency's work in Holocaust education. This marks the second time the U.S. has left the Paris-based agency, having previously withdrawn under Trump in 2017 before rejoining under the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>A media analysis piece suggests the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" is less about a single political or financial reason and more about the fundamental shift in media consumption. While critics and supporters point to the show's partisan politics and financial losses, the underlying cause is the end of an era of mass, shared culture. Late-night shows once thrived by appealing to a broad audience, but today's fragmented landscape of streaming and niche content makes the high-budget, broad-appeal model unsustainable. The show's end signifies the triumph of a la carte media, where platforms cater to smaller, dedicated audiences rather than a unified national one.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 11:26:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies the concept of grace periods for credit card payments, which are often misunderstood by consumers. Most credit cards offer a grace period on new purchases, allowing cardholders to avoid interest if they pay their balance in full by the due date. However, this protection typically disappears if a balance is carried over from the previous month. Crucially, there is no legally required grace period for late payments; once the due date passes, cardholders risk immediate late fees, penalty APRs, and damage to their credit score. The article advises contacting the issuer immediately if a payment will be late to potentially mitigate these consequences. (not investment advice)</p>
