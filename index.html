          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for a significant increase in the production of artillery shells to bolster his armed forces, as the country continues to deepen its military cooperation with Russia. Recent intelligence assessments suggest that North Korea has been supplying arms and potentially troops to support Russia's war on Ukraine. Analysts believe that North Korea's support for Russia aims to solidify a long-term partnership with Moscow and secure compensation, potentially including advanced military technology that could enhance the threat posed by Kim's nuclear-armed forces.</p>

          <p>India launched missile strikes into Pakistani-administered territory, targeting what it claimed were militant infrastructure sites.
