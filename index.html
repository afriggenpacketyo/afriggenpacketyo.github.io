          <p>Shares of generator maker Generac are experiencing their best week since last November, driven by increased demand due to a major heat wave across the U.S. and forecasts for an active Atlantic hurricane season.

Analysts note that the growing electrical load, partly from new data centers, presents a long-term tailwind for the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

While the panel did not find race to be a direct factor, the incident sparked widespread protests and has been called a "catalyst for change" in police procedures.

          <p>Top Trump administration officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, are publicly defending the recent U.S. military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. Hegseth characterized the operation as an "historically successful attack" and accused media and intelligence leakers of attempting to undermine its success. This defense comes after a preliminary intelligence assessment suggested the strikes may have only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months. Questions remain regarding the full extent of the damage and whether Iran moved nuclear material beforehand.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed "Trump Card," an investment visa costing $5 million, is attracting interest but faces substantial legal, tax, and market challenges, according to immigration attorneys. The plan aims to raise government revenue by selling residency to wealthy foreigners, but key obstacles remain. These include the need for congressional approval to alter the existing EB-5 visa program and to create a special tax exemption for cardholders from the U.S. policy of taxing worldwide income. Experts also question the market size, suggesting demand will be far lower than White House projections.</p>

          <p>The White House is intensifying its push for President Trump's cornerstone legislative package, dubbed the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," as it faces significant hurdles in the Senate. With a self-imposed July 4 deadline approaching, Senate Republicans are struggling with intraparty disagreements and procedural obstacles. The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that key provisions, including a plan to cut Medicaid funding, violate budget rules and would require a 60-vote threshold. This complicates the path for the massive bill, which combines the president's tax, defense, border, and energy priorities.</p>

          <p>A black bear with a history of aggressive behavior was euthanized by a park ranger after it broke into a camper's trailer near Lake Tahoe and injured a woman. The camper sustained cuts and bruises after the bear swiped at her. The same bear had been the subject of multiple 911 calls for breaking into homes and cars, including one with a child inside. Wildlife officials stated that euthanasia was a last resort, taken only after attempts to haze the bear away from human areas had failed and it was deemed a public safety risk.</p>
