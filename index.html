          <p>Millions of workers in China, particularly in the tech sector, are increasingly concerned about the "curse of 35," a term describing the risk of being laid off once they reach that age. This phenomenon reflects growing age discrimination amid a competitive job market, with many job listings explicitly stating candidates should be no older than 35. The 'curse' has become more widespread and is a symptom of the increasing pressures felt by workers in China's fast-paced tech industry. The reasons behind this trend and the sectors most affected remain a significant concern for many Chinese professionals.</p>

          <p>California Democrats are grappling with the question of whether their leaders are too old, sparking a debate over imposing a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. The discussion, initiated by San Francisco Democrats, stems from concerns about leaders remaining in power past their prime, referencing examples such as Dianne Feinstein's declining health. While some argue that age limits are ageist and discriminatory, others believe it is necessary to make way for younger candidates with fresh perspectives. A Pew Research Center survey indicates that a majority of Americans support age limits for elected officials.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney secured victory in Canada's recent election, campaigning on a platform to confront Donald Trump's trade policies and defend Canadian sovereignty. His campaign focused on standing up to Trump's threats to Canada's economy and independence. Carney's win was unexpected, as the Liberal Party had been trailing significantly in polls before his leadership. The election became a referendum on who could best handle Trump, with voters rallying behind Carney's stance against the US president's policies. The article notes that voters on the left and even some Quebec separatists supported Carney because of concerns about Canada's independence from the US.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel 'Conclave', which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, has drawn a comparison between the process of selecting a new Pope and the TV show 'The Traitors'. Harris suggests that the dynamics within a conclave, where cardinals secretly vote to elect a new Pope, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying 'traitors' among a group. He argues that the ancient ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a brilliant way to find the right leader, and that political parties should learn from it. Harris also notes the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.</p>

          <p>America's European allies are facing a period of reckoning and backlash during President Trump's first 100 days of his second term, marked by trade disputes and concerns over NATO commitments. Trump's rhetoric and tariff policies have shocked and insulted Europeans, undermining trade relationships and shaking the foundation of the transatlantic alliance. While there's acknowledgment that European members need to increase their defense spending, there's growing fear that the Trump administration may abandon them, undermining one of the greatest alliances in modern history. The article notes that Europeans are more committed to the relationship with the US than the other way around.</p>

This decision follows successful trials in several cities and aims to make the service more accessible to individuals who prefer cash or do not have bank cards. While the cash payment option is now widely available, individual drivers can still opt out of accepting cash for safety reasons. The move comes as a major report suggests shops and services might need to be forced to accept cash in the future to protect those who rely on it.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) employees, effectively shutting down the US taxpayer-funded news service for overseas listeners. The court's decision reverses an earlier ruling that granted a temporary stay on Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order dismantling the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). This ruling means that it is unlikely that broadcasters will return to work until the case has been resolved by the courts, impacting the agency's ability to provide news and information in countries with limited access to independent media sources.</p>

          <p>As Europe commemorates VE Day, there is a somber mood due to concerns about the state of transatlantic relations, particularly with Donald Trump's presidency. Trump's apparent respect for Putin, combined with his verbal threats towards allies, has shocked and unnerved many Europeans. While the US helped rebuild Europe after World War II and provided security guarantees through NATO, the absence of a common enemy has strained the friendship. Many Western Europeans now view the White House as a threat to peace and security in Europe, prompting increased discussions about boosting defense spending.</p>

Reform's success is particularly evident in wards that heavily voted to leave the EU in 2016 and in working-class areas. This victory underscores the ongoing political divisions and the challenges faced by the Conservative and Labour parties in appealing to this segment of the electorate.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides most students attending an accredited private school with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000 per year. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to private institutions, primarily benefiting wealthier families already enrolled in private schools.
