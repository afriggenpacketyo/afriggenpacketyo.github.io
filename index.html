          <p>Taiwan is facing growing uncertainty after the United States' deadline for new trade tariffs passed without the island being granted an exemption. Government officials suggest that negotiations are still in progress, but critics fear this silence indicates that Taiwan may face even harsher terms in a future round of tariffs. The lack of a clear resolution has created significant anxiety, with opposition lawmakers pointing to recent high-level diplomatic trips to Washington as evidence that the talks are not proceeding smoothly. This situation leaves the island in a precarious position regarding its trade relationship with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Germany's government has unveiled a new budget that includes unprecedented levels of investment in the nation's defense and infrastructure. Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil highlighted the country's significant investment backlog, citing dilapidated roads, bridges, and schools as urgent priorities for the €115 billion earmarked for infrastructure this year. The budget also marks a major policy shift with a massive increase in defense spending, aiming to meet and exceed NATO targets by more than doubling the defense budget by 2029. This new financial direction is funded by a substantial increase in borrowing, raising long-term concerns about national debt and interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has announced plans to accelerate the expansion of its high-speed railway network to enhance connectivity with neighboring countries. A senior official stated that Beijing is committed to advancing major landmark projects, including the Hungary-Serbia, China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan, and China-Thailand railways. The initiative aims to support both large-scale infrastructure and smaller, people-focused projects, providing skills training and tangible benefits to partner nations. This effort is part of a broader strategy to increase China's global influence and participate in setting international railway standards, despite scrutiny from regions like the European Union.</p>

          <p>The first report from the inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal has revealed the devastating and widespread impact on sub-postmasters wrongly accused of theft due to the faulty Horizon IT system. The report highlights that the scale of suffering was far greater than previously known, with evidence suggesting more than a dozen suicides may be linked to the scandal. Inquiry chair Sir Wyn Williams concluded that senior figures at both the Post Office and Fujitsu knew the system was flawed yet maintained the pretense of its accuracy for years. The findings also criticized the Post Office for its adversarial approach to compensation and recommended systemic changes for redress.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and influential figure in Margaret Thatcher's government, has passed away at the age of 94. As a loyal Thatcher ally, he served as Conservative Party chairman and led key departments, championing legislation to curb trade union power in the 1980s. Lord Tebbit was also a survivor of the 1984 IRA bombing in Brighton, an event in which both he and his wife were seriously injured. Political figures from across the spectrum, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and former Prime Minister David Cameron, have paid tribute to his political conviction, courage, and significant impact on British politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has recorded its most significant first-half decline since 1973, falling 10.7% against other global currencies amid a range of economic pressures. Analysts attribute the slide to factors including ongoing policy volatility, increasing national debt and deficits, and the potential for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exports, there are growing concerns about the potential erosion of its status as the world's primary reserve currency, prompting some central banks to increase gold purchases.

          <p>The UK's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), projects that the annual cost of the state pension 'triple lock' will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times the original estimate. The policy guarantees the state pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR report warns that the UK's public finances are in a vulnerable position, with rising government debt exacerbated by recent reversals of planned spending cuts. This growing pension expenditure, driven by the triple lock and an aging population, contributes to a long-term unsustainable fiscal path. (not investment advice)</p>

The article critiques Hegseth's public support for service members accused of war crimes, suggesting this undermines the military's internal accountability and discipline.

This shift is attributed to the erosion of cultural barriers between secular and religious music, allowing for a new hybrid genre that some analysts call "barstool conversion rock."

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has indicated it will not enforce the Johnson Amendment against churches whose pastors endorse political candidates during religious services. In a joint court filing with the National Religious Broadcasters Association, the IRS asked a federal court to interpret the 1954 law so that it does not apply to communications from a house of worship to its congregation. This move effectively carves out an exception for religious organizations, aligning with President Trump's long-stated goal of eliminating the rule.

This has created a credibility problem as the administration tries to manage the narrative following a Justice Department report on Epstein's death. The situation illustrates how the administration is struggling to control a conspiracy theory that some of its own key figures once actively promoted.</p>

          <h2>Political Response to Texas Floods Highlights Republican Fealty to Trump</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the catastrophic floods in Texas that killed over 100 people, the Republican response has been characterized by praise for President Trump rather than engagement with policy questions. While Democrats are calling for an investigation into whether cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) hampered forecasting, prominent Republicans have focused on thanking Trump for federal aid. Critics argue this reflects a party more concerned with avoiding the president's criticism than addressing the potential role of his administration's budget cuts and agency dismantling in the disaster's severity. The approach avoids discussion of the climate crisis and potential government failures, framing the event solely as a natural tragedy.</p>

          <p>Mark Zaid, a prominent national security lawyer who represented a whistleblower during Donald Trump's first impeachment, is suing the administration after his security clearance was revoked. Zaid was named in a presidential memo that also targeted high-profile figures like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, an action he views as political retribution. The lawsuit argues the revocation was unconstitutionally vague, violated his due process rights, and was an illegal act of revenge. Zaid, whose work depends on access to classified materials, says the move is part of a broader, vindictive agenda intended to chill legal opposition to the administration.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Club World Cup semi-final between Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain is framed by a bitter off-field dispute involving star striker Kylian Mbappé. Just before the match, Mbappé withdrew a legal claim of harassment against his former club, though a demand for €55 million in unpaid wages remains, with PSG filing a counterclaim. His acrimonious departure from PSG for Madrid last year was followed by a surprising season where PSG won the Champions League while Madrid did not. This on-field clash is seen as a chance for revenge and redemption, adding a layer of intense personal and financial drama to the high-stakes game.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the case of Adriana Smith, a Georgia woman who was kept on life support for four months after being declared brain-dead so that the fetus she was carrying could continue to gestate. The author argues this event, allegedly driven by the state's abortion ban, represents a profound desecration of a woman's body and a symbol of women's degradation in a post-Dobbs America. The column draws a parallel to a similar case in Texas, contending that such laws reduce women to mere instruments for the state's ends, ignoring their personhood and dignity. It frames the situation as the ultimate expression of the anti-abortion agenda, using a female body without the "encumbrance of a female person."</p>

          <p>A profile of General Dan Caine explores his unconventional path to becoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Donald Trump. Caine, a retired three-star Air Force general and former fighter pilot, was promoted over all active-duty four-star generals, a decision rooted in a 2018 meeting in Iraq that impressed Trump. Despite the president's portrayal of him as a MAGA-hat-wearing loyalist, Caine is known in military circles as an apolitical, team-oriented professional with deep respect for the chain of command. His tenure is marked by the challenge of providing independent military advice to a president who demands personal loyalty and often rejects expertise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new economic paper reveals that the housing affordability crisis, once concentrated in coastal U.S. cities, has spread to the Sunbelt. Economists Ed Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko found that cities like Miami, Tampa, and Phoenix, which previously kept prices moderate by building new housing, have significantly slowed construction over the past two decades. This has caused home prices to explode, mirroring trends in cities like San Francisco and Boston. The researchers hypothesize that the spread of NIMBYism and stricter regulations are key factors, estimating that America would have 15 million more housing units if construction had continued at its earlier pace.

          <p>A Mexican court has found ten men guilty of murder and kidnapping in a case connected to a property known as the "ranch of horror" in Jalisco state. The ranch allegedly served as a forced recruitment and training center for the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). The men were arrested last year after a shootout with police, during which one deceased person was found and two captives were freed. According to a survivor, recruits were lured with false promises and then subjected to brutal weapons training, with those who refused or tried to escape being tortured and killed.</p>

The proposed "humanitarian city" would be established on the ruins of Rafah in southern Gaza, initially housing 600,000 people with the eventual goal of containing all 2.1 million residents. According to the plan, individuals would undergo security screening before entering and would not be permitted to leave. The proposal has been condemned by a human rights lawyer as a potential "crime against humanity" and raises fears of forced displacement, which is prohibited under international law.</p>

          <p>In a notable policy shift, a new Republican-led bill includes a $16 billion investment in federal child care tax credits, despite making deep cuts to other social programs. The legislation, championed by Senator Katie Britt, raises the cap on Dependent Care Flexible Spending Accounts and expands tax credits for working parents and for businesses that provide child care support. The move reflects a growing recognition within the GOP of the economic pressures facing families, although the benefits are primarily aimed at middle- and upper-middle-class households. The bill marks a rare instance of Republicans taking the lead on expanding a social safety net program.</p>

The decision marks a notable development, as the administration had previously been pushing for an end to the war and had rolled back some aid provided by the previous administration. The move comes after Trump expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating there has been "no progress" in ending the conflict following a recent conversation.</p>

          <p>A Berlin administrative court has ruled that the German government must issue visas to an Afghan woman and her 13 family members, upholding a prior commitment made under a program for those at risk from the Taliban. The family, currently in Pakistan and facing deportation to Afghanistan, had been promised admission before the conservative-led government halted the program. The court determined that the government's promise was a "legally binding" commitment that it could not simply revoke. This ruling comes as the German government takes a harder line on migration and has canceled several admission schemes for Afghan nationals.</p>
