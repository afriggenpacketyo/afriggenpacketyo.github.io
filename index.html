          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold its remaining stake in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding a 17-year investment. BYD executives framed the sale as a normal investment decision, noting the significant profits Berkshire realized, while thanking Buffett and Charlie Munger for their long-term support. Despite this positive framing, BYD's shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong following the news, reflecting investor concern amid signs of cooling growth for the company. Concurrently, Berkshire has increased its investment in Japanese trading houses, recently surpassing a 10% stake in Mitsui. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in at least 44 Palestinian deaths, according to health officials, as airstrikes and gunfire continue across the region. The attacks occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN, asserting his intention to "finish the job" against Hamas, despite increasing international pressure for a ceasefire. Hospitals in Gaza are facing collapse due to shortages and damage from the offensive, with aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders suspending activities due to the high risk. The humanitarian situation is worsening, with experts reporting famine conditions in Gaza City and aid deliveries being restricted.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly condemned Reform UK, stating the party's policies "will tear this country apart" ahead of the Labour party conference. Starmer highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly "shocking," arguing it targets long-term residents who contribute significantly to British society. Arriving in Liverpool, he positioned Labour as the alternative to the "toxic divide and decline" offered by Reform. The comments come as Starmer faces internal and external pressure, with opinion polls showing Labour trailing Reform UK and speculation about potential leadership challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has summoned hundreds of generals and admirals from around the world to Washington for a meeting of unclear purpose. This unusual gathering has raised concerns among observers due to the significant security risk of having so many high-ranking military officials in one location simultaneously. Analysts speculate the meeting could be an effort by the current administration to communicate its expectations to the military leadership.

          <p>Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve was ejected from a playoff game against the Phoenix Mercury after a furious reaction to a non-call that resulted in an injury to her star player, Napheesa Collier. Reeve confronted an official in the final minute of the 84-76 loss, incensed that a steal by an opposing player, which left Collier on the floor in pain, was not deemed a foul. In her post-game press conference, Reeve bypassed questions and delivered a two-minute critique of the league's officiating standards, calling for a change in leadership and describing the officiating crew's assignment to a semifinal game as "malpractice."</p>

As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and went on to serve in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. Armed Forces, celebrated for their exceptional skill and for breaking racial barriers.

          <p>The resilience of the U.S. stock market is increasingly seen as a primary driver of consumer spending, potentially keeping the economy from a recession despite a weak jobs picture. Recent economic data shows surprisingly strong consumer spending and income, fueled by the "wealth effect" from rising stock values, which disproportionately benefits the top 10% of earners who own 87% of the market. However, economists warn this creates a significant vulnerability; a downturn in the stock market could abruptly halt consumer spending and push the economy into a recession. This precarious balance exists alongside high stock valuations, raising concerns about the sustainability of the current economic strength. (not investment advice)</p>

While the president is correct that mortgage rates and gasoline prices have decreased slightly over the past year, his assertions that grocery prices are down and that inflation has been "defeated" are inaccurate, as both continue to rise. Federal data shows residential electricity costs have also increased. The stock market has indeed reached new highs, but manufacturing has seen job losses despite a recent increase in factory production, presenting a complex picture of the economy that contrasts with the administration's consistently positive rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party back to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant internal criticism and poor polling numbers, raising questions about his leadership. Colleagues and insiders describe him as slow in decision-making and lacking strong communication skills, with one senior figure noting his judgment on people and policy has been flawed. While some allies defend his steady leadership and success on the world stage, there is a widespread feeling that the government lacks a clear vision or narrative. As the party gathers for its annual conference, Starmer is under immense pressure to reassert his authority and articulate a compelling direction for the country.</p>

          <p>Iran has recalled its ambassadors from Britain, France, and Germany in a significant diplomatic move. This action followed the failure of a UN Security Council resolution, backed by China and Russia, which aimed to block the reimposition of global sanctions against Tehran. The resolution was defeated with nine votes against, including from the three European nations. Iranian state media reported that officials condemned the process as "bullying and illegal," asserting that Iran will not surrender to pressure but remains open to dialogue based on mutual respect and the lifting of sanctions.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power in Africa through its government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture and now operate in 49 African nations. These institutes offer scholarships and language training, attracting students who see it as a path to economic opportunity. However, critics express concern over the institutes' presence within universities, suggesting they may compromise academic freedom and indoctrinate students with Chinese political values. Some analysts argue this cultural expansion is intertwined with China's economic goals, including securing access to the continent's vast natural resources.</p>

          <p>Unidentified drones have been observed over several Danish military facilities, including the country's largest airbase in Karup, prompting a temporary closure of civil airspace. This follows a series of similar incidents that disrupted major Danish airports earlier in the week. The repeated, unexplained drone activity has heightened security concerns across the region, with possible sightings also reported over military sites and airports in Germany, Norway, and Lithuania. While Danish authorities have not assigned blame, the incursions are being treated as a serious security issue, prompting coordination with European partners on anti-drone capabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace firm Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system called Surface Alert (SURF-A). The technology is designed to give pilots more advance warning of potential collisions on the ground by using GPS data to detect traffic on the runway. Demonstrations recreating recent near-disasters showed the system could provide pilots with crucial additional seconds to react and avoid a collision. While not yet required by regulators, safety experts and some airlines are embracing such advanced alerts as a critical layer of safety to mitigate risks in increasingly congested airports.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered their social media photos were used without consent to create explicit deepfake pornography on a "nudify" website called DeepSwap. The case highlights a significant legal loophole, as the creation of such material for personal use, without distribution, may not be illegal in many jurisdictions. The victims have experienced significant psychological trauma and are now working with Minnesota State Senator Erin Maye Quade on legislation to hold AI companies accountable. The incident underscores the rapid proliferation of easy-to-use generative AI tools that can be weaponized to cause severe personal harm.</p>

          <p>The federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress is being viewed by some legal experts as vulnerable to dismissal. They argue that President Trump's years of public attacks on Comey, coupled with his celebratory comments following the indictment, provide strong evidence for a defense motion based on "selective or vindictive prosecution." The case is further complicated by the abrupt replacement of the top prosecutor in the office handling the case with a former Trump defense lawyer, and reports that career prosecutors had previously recommended against bringing charges.</p>

          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries from vehicles. In many low- and middle-income countries, used batteries are broken open and the lead is melted down in unsafe conditions, releasing toxic dust that contaminates communities. This public health crisis persists because unsafe recycling is more profitable than regulated methods. The article highlights that solutions already exist, citing Brazil's success in formalizing the industry through tax incentives and policies that make manufacturers responsible for taking back old batteries.</p>
