          <p>Uber and Waymo have launched their robotaxi service in Atlanta, expanding their partnership to offer autonomous rides to the public. The service covers a 65-square-mile area in Atlanta, utilizing Waymo's driverless technology integrated into electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs. This launch follows a similar rollout in Austin, Texas, earlier this year, marking a significant step in the companies' efforts to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology. The vehicles will not yet travel on highways or to the airport, focusing on urban environments for now. This initiative puts pressure on competitors like Tesla to accelerate their robotaxi development.</p>

          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are unveiling a framework for a bill to establish regulatory guidelines for digital assets. The proposed legislation aims to define crypto classifications as commodities or securities, enabling crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). It also seeks to reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight of digital currencies and incorporates measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. This effort builds on bipartisan momentum from a recent stablecoin bill, with lawmakers aiming to finalize the market structure bill this year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A severe June heatwave is affecting much of the eastern US, with extreme heat warnings in effect from the Carolinas to Maine.

Cities like Washington DC, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston have declared heat emergencies, opening cooling centers and offering free transportation to help residents cope.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to rescind the "roadless rule," a nearly quarter-century-old regulation that blocked logging on national forest lands. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the decision, arguing that the rule impeded responsible timber production and wildfire risk reduction. The rule affects approximately 59 million acres of national forest land nationwide. Environmental groups have criticized the plan, arguing that logging exacerbates climate change and intensifies wildfires.

          <p>This article critiques Zohran Mamdani, a candidate for New York City mayor, for his ambiguous stance on the pro-Palestine slogan "Globalize the intifada." The author argues that Mamdani's refusal to denounce the slogan, despite its potential for violent interpretation, signals a problematic unwillingness to draw lines and a commitment to what the slogan represents. The author suggests that Mamdani's defense of the slogan, particularly his claim that the role of mayor is not to police language, is inconsistent with his own criticisms of dehumanizing language used against him.</p>

          <p>Jessica Chaikof, who has Usher syndrome Type 1F, fears that cuts to federal research funding could prevent the development of gene therapies needed to save her eyesight. She is concerned that terminations of NIH grants at Harvard University, due to alleged antisemitism, will impact research into rare genetic disorders prevalent in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. While there are no existing grants specifically for Usher 1F, researchers fear that future applications will be negatively impacted. Corey had an NIH grant terminated that was supporting basic science into the genetic mechanism of hearing.</p>
