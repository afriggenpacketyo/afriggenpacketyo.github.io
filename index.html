          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory over Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race. Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, capitalized on social media engagement and enthusiasm among younger voters. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign and its appeal to young people, later indicating the possibility of an independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, as no candidate secured over 50% of the vote, with comprehensive results expected in early July. The winner of the Democratic primary is likely to have an advantage in the general election in heavily Democratic New York. The possibility of incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent adds another layer of complexity to the election. Optimism score is not contained in this summary.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court convicted U.S. Marine Lance Cpl. Jamel Clayton of sexual assault on Okinawa and sentenced him to seven years in prison. Clayton was found guilty of attacking a woman in May 2024, choking, sexually assaulting, and injuring her. The court deemed the victim's testimony credible, describing Clayton's behavior as dangerous and malicious. The case has heightened anger and safety concerns on Okinawa, which hosts a significant U.S. troop presence, leading to renewed calls for revising the Status of Forces Agreement. Tensions are high due to the island's historical context and the continued burden of hosting U.S. military facilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months. The strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo, to be sealed off, potentially delaying the resumption of the enrichment program. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House disputes the assessment, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt calling it "flat-out wrong," while other officials stand by claims of "total obliteration." Conflicting statements from officials underscore the debate over the strikes' effectiveness and the path forward.</p>

The band members were familiar with the manga, praising its unique world-setting and intricate foreshadowing. They appreciated the subtle emotional nuances within the calm environment of the inner palace. The director emphasized the themes of "parent and child" and "life and death," which resonated with the band in creating the song's lyrics and overall tone. The band aimed to express the duality of characters through their music.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup's scheduling highlights the challenge of playing soccer in the U.S. during the summer heat, posing risks for the 2026 World Cup. Games are often scheduled for European viewers, leading to midday kick-offs in hot U.S. venues, which can disadvantage European teams. Despite concerns, historical data from past tournaments in the U.S. doesn't definitively show European teams struggling more in the heat. Organizers could improve scheduling by prioritizing cooler locations and times, but ultimately, elite players are mostly able to endure harsh conditions, though this doesn't mean they should have to.</p>

          <p>The House and Senate are considering versions of a bill that would impose federal work requirements on Medicaid for the first time. Individuals aged 19 to 64 would need to work or participate in qualifying activities for 80 hours per month to be eligible. The Senate version introduces stricter requirements, limiting parental exemptions to those with children aged 14 and under. While some states may implement work requirements through waivers, concerns exist about potential coverage loss and the effectiveness of such policies, as seen in Arkansas, where more people became uninsured without significant employment gains.</p>

          <p>While President Trump claims U.S. strikes "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facility, intelligence and administration officials suggest diplomacy remains critical. European allies advocate renewed nuclear talks, and Secretary of State Rubio acknowledges the need for a diplomatic solution. However, the Trump administration sends mixed signals on the urgency of negotiations, with officials declining to describe the U.S. approach as "maximum pressure." Experts emphasize the importance of dismantling Iran's nuclear infrastructure and verifying compliance through the IAEA, raising concerns about the whereabouts of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile.</p>

Several factors have contributed to this resilience, including Iran's decision not to target oil supplies, traders' skepticism of price spikes, and the approach of the autumn season. The world's oversupply of oil and the U.S.'s dominant position as a producer have also played significant roles in stabilizing the market. Despite geopolitical tensions, the oil market has proven resilient to disruptions.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why US Bunker-Busting Bombs May Have Missed Iranian Nuclear Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite claims of "total obliteration," a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests U.S. bunker-busting bombs caused only limited damage to Iran's Fordo enrichment site. The effectiveness of the GBU-57 depends heavily on factors like the type of rock and geological structure, which may have hindered its penetration. Experts suggest going deeper underground is a simpler solution than improving bunker-busters. The U.S. likely dropped multiple bombs to fracture the rock and target ventilation systems, but the facility's location under a mountain ridge maximized its protection.</p>

Other leaders express hope for unity, but the possibility of a lack of consensus remains amid concerns over the threat from Russia and the international security situation.</p>

          <p>The UK government feared that victims of the Post Office scandal who had not yet sought compensation would feel "harassed" if officials chased them to apply. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found that many sub-postmasters were yet to receive "fair and timely" redress. The government had no current plans to follow up with people eligible for compensation, after just one in five letters sent to sub-postmasters about restitution received a response. The Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said it had paid out more £1bn in compensation to date, and will consult the Horizon Compensation Advisory Board on the suggestion that follow-up letters should be sent to potential Horizon Shortfall Scheme applicants who have not yet applied for redress.</p>

More than 130 MPs, including 122 Labour MPs, have signed an amendment that would give them the opportunity to vote on a proposal to reject plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save £5bn a year by 2030. Senior cabinet ministers are calling MPs to try to convince them to vote with the government. The BBC's chief political correspondent said some cabinet members were "taken aback by quite how sour the mood is on this issue and fearful that might bleed into a broader problem for this Labour leadership".</p>

Heat exhaustion is less severe, marked by headache, fatigue, and sweating, while heat stroke is life-threatening, causing impaired consciousness and a rapid rise in body temperature. For heat exhaustion, it is advised to move to a cool place, drink water, and apply cold cloths. Heat stroke requires immediate medical attention, cooling the body with cold water, and calling emergency services. Prevention involves avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and protecting the head with a hat.</p>
