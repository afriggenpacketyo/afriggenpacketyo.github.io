          <p>The German cabinet is set to approve the first draft of the 2025 budget, which has been delayed due to national elections earlier in the year. This budget follows a major fiscal package approved by parliament in March, which included changes to debt policies. These changes are intended to enable increased spending on defense and a €500 billion infrastructure fund, addressing critical areas for Germany's future development and security. The budget aims to balance fiscal responsibility with necessary investments in key sectors. The approval marks a significant step in Germany's economic planning for the coming year.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after a week of aerial attacks following Israel's strike on Iran's nuclear program. This announcement came after Iran carried out a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, in response to U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran. While Trump declared a "Complete and Total" ceasefire, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran had ceased strikes but denied any formal agreement. The conflict began on June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets, leading to retaliatory attacks from Iran.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell defended the LAPD's handling of recent protests, asserting that officers acted appropriately to quell unrest during demonstrations against President Trump's immigration policies. McDonnell stated that the department would conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each use-of-force incident and address any officer misconduct. He acknowledged that while most protests were peaceful, some were marred by violence and vandalism, justifying the police's swift and measured response. Critics, however, have raised concerns about the use of hard foam projectiles and mounted police units, leading to potential civil litigation alleging excessive force by the LAPD.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments by £5 billion a year by 2030. The welfare reform bill, called the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment (Pip). The amendment cites concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and on people's health. The vote on the government's bill is currently scheduled for July 1.</p>

          <p>Florida is planning to build a migrant detention center in the Everglades, which has been dubbed the 'Alligator Alcatraz,' with funding expected from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The facility is to be built on the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, about 58km from Miami, and is expected to cost about $450m a year to run. Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier said the detention center could be built in 30 to 60 days and hold an estimated 1,000 people, arguing the location acts as a natural deterrent for escapees due to the presence of alligators and pythons. The Democratic mayor of Miami-Dade County, Daniela Levine Cava, criticized the plan, saying the impacts to the Everglades ecosystem could be devastating.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' which protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins described the rule as outdated and overly restrictive, arguing that rescinding it would enable better forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups, however, have denounced the decision, stating that it threatens wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk, arguing that commercial logging can exacerbate climate change and increase wildfire intensity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants to countries other than their own without advance warning or the chance to challenge them on the grounds of potential torture or death. The court lifted an injunction issued by a federal District Court judge, with the three liberal justices dissenting. Justice Sonia Sotomayor criticized the decision as a gross abuse of the Court's equitable discretion, noting the government's previous wrongful deportations. Assistant Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin praised the ruling as a victory for American safety and security, while the head of a legal group representing the immigrants expressed horror at the stripping away of critical due process protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, although neither country has definitively confirmed it. White House officials are touting this as a diplomatic breakthrough, potentially stepping back from the brink of a broader conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran would cease its attacks if Israel stopped its aggression, leading to a halt in Israeli attacks by the specified deadline. This development follows Iranian retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, with no reported American casualties or damage from the Iranian missiles directed at a U.S. base in Qatar.</p>

The heat is due to a heat dome, an area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity.

Investigations were opened in Paris after three people reported being stabbed in separate incidents, with one French influencer warning about social media calls for women to be targeted with syringes.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in New York are set to rest their case in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs. The 55-year-old music mogul is accused of using his power to facilitate the sexual abuse of women and conceal his crimes, charges he denies. Key witnesses included musician Casandra Ventura, who testified about her abusive relationship with Mr. Combs, and "Jane", who shared similar stories. The prosecution sought to prove Mr. Combs ran a "criminal enterprise" to facilitate his conduct, but legal experts suggest the technical parts of the racketeering statute could complicate the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's dominance in rare earth production has been significantly strengthened by its reliance on supplies from Myanmar. Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year, with these imports being particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents. This dynamic has created a supply chain where extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China. The rare earths extracted in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of "rare earth oxides" for further processing and refining.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, many immigrant workers, particularly street vendors, are facing the threat of deportation amid increased immigration raids, forcing them to choose between their safety and their livelihoods. These raids have sparked protests and economic hardship, with many vendors, who are often undocumented, fearing to leave their homes. Community organizations and local leaders are providing support through "Know Your Rights" workshops, food deliveries, and legal assistance. Senator Maria Elena Durazo introduced Senate Bill 635 to protect street vendor data and prevent immigration enforcement agents from accessing it, aiming to empower microbusinesses across the state.</p>

          <p>Chongqing, China’s largest inland city, has evolved into a hub of international trade, thanks to the launch of two expansive cross-border rail networks. One runs west to Germany and the other extends south, reaching as far as Singapore. These trade corridors give China faster, more reliable access to global markets while offering other countries a clear route into its vast interior. The city aspires to become a central node in the global economy through which other countries trade – a rail-based “Suez Canal”, connecting Asia and Europe. This development showcases China's efforts to deepen its global trade footprint amid rising geopolitical risks.</p>

          <p>Florida officials have asked the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law that makes it a crime for people in the United States unlawfully to enter Florida. The state is seeking to put on hold a federal judge's decision preventing law enforcement officers from enforcing the law, known as SB 4-C, which the judge deemed likely unconstitutional. Florida's Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law, stating it was a “measured effort” by the state to protect its sovereignty and falls within Florida's law enforcement responsibilities. The law was passed earlier this year and makes it a crime for people living in the U.S. illegally to enter Florida after coming into the country by eluding immigration officers.</p>

The law firm KP Law launched the claim, stating that 3M knew the ear plugs were defective, referencing evidence from litigation in the US.
