Additionally, the program will feature the story of Enoteca Maria, a Staten Island restaurant where dishes are prepared by grandmothers from around the world, and Cole Escola's Broadway hit "Oh, Mary!" about Mary Todd Lincoln's secret passion.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement on social media that he was renaming November 11 as "Victory Day for World War I," the White House has clarified that it will be an additional proclamation, not a replacement for Veterans Day. Trump also stated his intention to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." According to the Congressional Research Service, establishing a federal holiday or patriotic observance requires the passage of a law. This clarification comes after some confusion regarding the initial announcement.</p>

          <p>More than 60 days into Israel's total siege of Gaza, doctors are reporting a catastrophic humanitarian situation with severe shortages of food, water, and medicine leading to a surge in preventable illnesses and deaths. Muneer Alboursh, director general of Gaza's health ministry, says he is unable to provide solutions to patients seeking life-saving medication. Humanitarian groups and European officials accuse Israel of using aid as a political tool, violating international law. The United Nations reports that 91 percent of the population faces food insecurity, with many relying on looted local charity kitchens for sustenance.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists excavating the Basilica of St. Stephen on Caelian Hill in Rome have unearthed a stone head depicting a Roman deity. The Appian Way Regional Park announced the discovery, noting that the head was found in the foundation of the church. Experts believe the bearded male figure is likely a deity, though layers of mortar obscure its features. The artifact will be studied and restored by the Central Institute for Restoration in Matera, contributing to understanding the cultural dynamics of the Appia Antica territory in the late antique period.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to impose minimum 10% tariffs on imports is causing significant disruption at the San Pedro Bay port complex in Los Angeles, with approximately a third of the traffic grinding to a halt. This slowdown is expected to affect waterfront communities and the broader US economy, as the port handles 40% of all containerized imports into the country. Experts predict that front-loaded stock will only last six to eight weeks, and the situation is not resolving soon. The ports are projecting 30 combined blank sailings for this month, up from 10 in April.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project (LAIP) claims to have uncovered new evidence that could exonerate Scott Peterson in the murder of his pregnant wife, Laci. The LAIP alleges that the prosecution suppressed and destroyed exculpatory evidence, including evidence of a burglary across the street from the Petersons' home on the day of Laci's disappearance. The organization also argues that new research indicates Laci was killed days after the prosecution claimed, at a time when Peterson could not have been responsible. While some legal experts remain skeptical, the LAIP's investigation has generated renewed interest in the case.</p>

          <p>An article argues that the Trump administration's health policies, particularly those championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk, promote a form of "soft eugenics." These policies emphasize personal responsibility for health while cutting social services, potentially leading to the culling of the weak and infirm. Kennedy's focus on diet and lifestyle, coupled with cuts to public health programs, and Musk's emphasis on "smart" people having more children are cited as examples of this approach, suggesting a disregard for the lives of the vulnerable. The article highlights potential consequences such as increased child mortality and disease outbreaks due to cuts in foreign aid and healthcare access.</p>

The production humorously and ominously explores narcissism, deception, and the gap between false perfection and reality. It contrasts with another play, "Vanya," which suggests richness in seeing oneself as multiple intertwining voices, raising questions about performance, truth, and self-expression.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Slashes Research into LGBTQ Health</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated over $800 million in research grants related to LGBTQ health, affecting studies on cancers, viruses, and sexually transmitted infections. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) justified the cuts by stating that the research no longer aligns with agency priorities and is based on "unscientific" results. The cuts have led to firings and the closure of LGBTQ-focused labs, sparking concerns about the impact on clinical trials and the overall health of sexual and gender minority groups. Critics argue that the administration is creating a hierarchy of patients and undermining efforts to address health disparities.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the ethics of science and the responsibilities of scientists, drawing on a conversation between Werner Heisenberg and Friedrich von WeizsÃ¤cker after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. It argues that scientists, as citizens, have a responsibility to ensure their discoveries are used for good and to engage with the public and policymakers. The article highlights ethical dilemmas posed by artificial intelligence, biotechnology, advanced medical procedures, and climate change. It also emphasizes the need for scientific education and communication to inform public debate and policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is set to receive a Patriot air-defense system from Israel after it undergoes refurbishment, and Western allies are considering providing another system from Germany or Greece. The delivery comes as Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine, including a recent deadly missile strike on Kyiv. President Trump's recent remarks on the war have softened in favor of Ukraine, and a delayed minerals deal was signed, paving the way for more U.S. military aid. However, the systems are scarce, and their deployment requires careful consideration of global crises.</p>

          <p>Despite warning signs that Donald Trump's tariffs were destabilizing the US economy, Republican leaders in Congress took measures to protect his trade policy. The White House issued a veto threat against a Senate resolution targeting the levies, and the House of Representatives enacted a rule to prevent its consideration. While all Democrats and two Republicans voted for the resolution in the Senate, it deadlocked, and Vice-President JD Vance broke the tie on a procedural motion to kill the measure. Democrats are now using this to force Republicans to take ownership of the tariff policy.</p>
