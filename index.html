          <p>A dugout canoe carrying approximately 160 migrants, primarily from The Gambia and Senegal, capsized off the coast of Mauritania while en route to Spain's Canary Islands. At least 49 people have died, with around 100 still missing, while 17 have been rescued. Survivors report the vessel left The Gambia six days prior, and the accident occurred when passengers moved to one side after spotting coastal lights. This tragedy highlights the increasing danger of the Atlantic migration route, which saw nearly 47,000 arrivals in the Canary Islands last year amid significant risks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has eliminated the 'de minimis' trade exemption, which previously allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the country duty-free. This executive order affects countless retailers, from large corporations like Tapestry and Lululemon to small online businesses on platforms such as Etsy and eBay, who relied on the provision to manage costs. The sudden change is causing significant operational challenges, snarling global supply chains and forcing businesses to overhaul their models. Experts predict the move could lead to higher prices for consumers and create widespread uncertainty for international e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has clarified his recent comments following a surprising EFL Cup defeat to Grimsby, stating his remarks were driven by emotion. After the loss, Amorim said his team was "completely lost" and that "something has to change," leading to speculation about his future at the club. He has since explained that such emotional reactions are part of his character, admitting he sometimes feels like quitting after a major defeat but is now focused on the next match. The club's ownership reportedly still supports him despite the team's winless start to the season.</p>

The new reward is a Cadillac Optiq EV, featuring a custom "pink pearl" finish, marking a significant step towards sustainability for the 60-year-old company. This move honors the brand's history of empowering its sales force, a tradition that began after founder Mary Kay Ash faced discrimination when trying to purchase a car.

          <p>An immigrant detainee, Luis Manuel Rivas Velásquez, who was feared dead by his family after collapsing at a Florida detention facility known as 'Alligator Alcatraz', has been found alive. Without informing his lawyers or family, ICE transferred him first to a facility at Fort Bliss, Texas, and then again to another processing center in El Paso. His attorneys describe his treatment as an "enforced disappearance" and retribution for speaking out about the harsh conditions in detention.

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to expand its list of critical minerals, adding 51 commodities including copper, silicon, and silver. This strategic update aims to secure domestic supply chains for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar energy, thereby reducing reliance on foreign sources, particularly China. The list guides government investment priorities, tax incentives, and the speed of permitting for mining operations. The move is a response to potential disruptions from geopolitical disputes or other global events that could threaten access to essential materials for the U.S. economy and national security.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Britain has issued a sharp rebuke to the UK and Japan, urging them to "deeply reflect on their erroneous words and deeds" regarding Taiwan and maritime issues. The warning came in response to a joint statement from the British and Japanese defense ministers, who reaffirmed the importance of peace in the Taiwan Strait and expressed "serious concerns" about the situation in the East and South China Seas. Beijing characterized the statement as interference in its internal affairs and an attempt to create regional tension, reflecting growing geopolitical friction in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Such Great Heights," chronicles the "indie rock explosion" of the 2000s, an era that saw bands like Grizzly Bear and Modest Mouse move from niche scenes to mainstream consciousness. This article reviews the book and reflects on how the internet, music blogs like Pitchfork, and a shift in cultural taste propelled the genre's success. While initially defined by a preference for artistic complexity over commercial polish, "indie" eventually became a broader lifestyle brand. The movement's idealism ultimately influenced mainstream pop, but its original form faded with the rise of streaming algorithms and changing music industry economics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government proceeded with the largest reorganization of English councils in decades without commissioning its own independent analysis of the potential costs and savings. The Ministry of Local Government based its estimate of £2.9 billion in savings on a 2020 report from the County Council Network (CCN), a lobbyist group. However, the CCN has since updated its analysis, now suggesting the mergers could result in no savings or even cost hundreds of millions in certain scenarios. Critics find it "astonishing" that such a significant reform was undertaken without a thorough, independent financial review by the government itself.</p>

          <p>Recent Ukrainian drone strikes on the Druzhba oil pipeline in Russia have disrupted Hungary's oil supply and significantly strained relations between the two countries. Hungarian officials have condemned the attacks as a threat to Europe's energy security, while Ukraine maintains its goal is to undermine Russia's war economy. The situation is exacerbated by Hungary's ongoing blockade of Ukraine's EU accession talks. The strikes expose the vulnerability of Hungary's heavy dependence on Russian energy and highlight the complex geopolitical ripple effects of the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Scottish Member of Parliament Colin Smyth has denied a new allegation that he hid a secret camera in a toilet at the Scottish Parliament building in Holyrood. Smyth, who was previously suspended by the Labour Party over a separate charge, has had his access to the parliament building revoked due to the ongoing criminal investigation. In a statement, he expressed "utter shock" at the new charge and criticized the police for releasing details that he says forced him to leave his home. The parliament confirmed that a security sweep of all toilets found no recording devices.</p>

          <p>An Italian website known for posting digitally altered, explicit images of prominent women, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has been forced to shut down following a widespread political outcry. The site, which had been active for two decades, featured a section with photos of female politicians and celebrities accompanied by obscene and sexist commentary. The closure comes after female politicians and public figures denounced the platform for its degrading content and incitement to sexual assault. This event follows the recent shutdown of a similar Facebook group, signaling a growing intolerance for such online exploitation in Italy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's economy expanded at an annual rate of 7.8% for the quarter ending in June, surpassing economists' forecasts. The strong growth was driven by robust performance in the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors. Despite the positive real GDP figure, some economists point to a slowdown in nominal GDP growth as a sign of potential cooling. The impressive growth rate positions India's economy to potentially expand by a world-beating 7% this year, even as it faces challenges from new U.S. tariffs that recently came into effect.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast, this article revisits the catastrophic event through a collection of photographs and reflections. The storm, which became the costliest and one of the deadliest in U.S. history, led to nearly 1,400 deaths and inundated 80% of New Orleans after its levee system failed. The retrospective highlights the humanitarian crisis at the Superdome, the heavily criticized slow federal response, and the lasting impact on communities. Neighborhoods like the Lower Ninth Ward have yet to fully recover, underscoring the long-term consequences of the disaster.</p>
