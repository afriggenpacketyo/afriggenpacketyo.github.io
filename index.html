          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, with its effects felt across parts of the New York City area. The U.S. Geological Survey placed the epicenter northeast of Hasbrouck Heights in Bergen County. While the event caused brief shaking and generated local reports, there were no immediate accounts of significant damage or injuries. The quake originated approximately 10 kilometers below the surface, causing a minor stir in the densely populated region.</p>

          <p>In a rare television interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz reflects on the 1976-1977 murder spree that terrorized New York City. Berkowitz, serving six life sentences, discusses his life before the killings, his claimed descent into darkness influenced by satanic forces, and his current life in prison as a born-again Christian. The article revisits the climate of fear in the city at the time and includes perspectives from survivors and investigators, who remain skeptical of his claims about being part of a cult.</p>

          <p>Decades after the 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, a theory focusing on two unidentified male customers has gained prominence. Despite initial arrests and overturned convictions, the case remains cold, but investigators and defense attorneys point to these men, who were seen in the shop shortly before the crime and never came forward. This article explores the possibility that these individuals, not the men previously charged, could be the actual perpetrators, a lead that has persisted since the early days of the investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal watchdog agency, has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith. The probe stems from a request by Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith may have violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in political activities. Cotton's letter claims Smith's actions were intended to unlawfully influence the 2024 election by harming Donald Trump's candidacy. The OSC investigation is a non-criminal inquiry into these allegations.</p>

This retrospective examines the brutal 1991 crime, the subsequent decades-long investigation, and the profound impact on the victims' families. It details the initial investigation, the false leads, the overturned convictions of four men, and the pivotal role of a small, unidentified male DNA sample that cleared the suspects and now represents the best hope for finally solving the case.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones to create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces. The system works by precisely adjusting signals to jam enemy communications while simultaneously creating a null zone where allied signals are unaffected and can operate freely. This targeted approach represents a significant advancement over traditional, indiscriminate jamming methods that disrupt all communications in an area. The technology could provide a major tactical advantage for the People's Liberation Army in future conflicts.</p>

President Trump publicly rejected the offer on social media, telling Schumer to "go to hell" and urging Republicans to hold their ground.

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key factor in his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the emotional demands of medicine and realized he did not want to spend his life in a profession he wasn't passionate about. He recalled a particularly difficult experience breaking bad news to a patient's family, which solidified his feeling of being "out of his depth." This personal tragedy ultimately set him free to pursue entertainment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, despite him only being two years into a five-year contract. This development comes as the club continues to show interest in signing RB Leipzig's forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources claim they can sign a new player without first selling, an exit would be necessary to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. If Sesko were to arrive, Hojlund's position at the club would become marginalized, prompting the potential sale.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it may adopt a more careful strategy regarding future open-source releases. This shift in thinking contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development. Meta's potential pivot reflects the evolving strategic landscape of global AI competition.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died has finally been solved by researchers. The young platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gift but perished just days before reaching England. For decades, it was rumored that the animal died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, newly analyzed archival records, including the attendant's logbook, reveal that the platypus likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, with water temperatures far exceeding a safe threshold.</p>

According to the global association for the theme park industry, these attractions act as powerful economic drivers. For every one yuan of operating revenue a park generates, it creates an estimated 3.8 yuan of economic impact for the local area.</p>

Born into a famous artistic family, Rahbani carved his own path with work that was deeply political, satirical, and critical of the sectarianism that fueled the country's civil war. He was known for blending jazz and other global styles with traditional Arab music, and for his transformative collaborations with his mother, the iconic singer Fairuz. His art provided a voice for the common person and became an inseparable part of Lebanon's cultural fabric.</p>

Folkenflik notes that the current environment, with an administration actively pressuring news organizations and stripping public media of funding, raises critical questions about the future constriction of independent information and criticism in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," author Carol Mason argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become deeply connected with insurrectionary and white nationalist ideologies. Mason traces the evolution of rhetoric from simply opposing abortion to ignoring the rule of law, seeing parallels between clinic protest tactics and the January 6 Capitol riot. She contends that the movement has facilitated intersections among various far-right groups, sometimes framing the issue through the lens of white demographic decline and replacement theory, making it a bridge to broader extremist politics.</p>

The proposed law, part of a broader bill, could lead to up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law. This includes advertising fake documents or promising illegal work. The move comes as officials report that a vast majority of migrants arriving by boat used social media to contact smuggling gangs.</p>
