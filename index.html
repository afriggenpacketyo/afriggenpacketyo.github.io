          <p>The UK is experiencing a 'notably different' climate compared to just a few decades ago, according to a new report from the Met Office. The country is breaking heat and rainfall records with increasing frequency, leading to more very hot days and fewer extremely cold nights. This shift, driven by global warming, is also making the UK's winters significantly wetter and is having a tangible impact on the nation's natural world, affecting species and ecosystems. The evidence suggests that this trend of more extreme weather events is the new normal.</p>

          <p>Following Chelsea's stunning 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, star player Cole Palmer praised head coach Enzo Maresca for building something special. Palmer, who scored two goals, credited Maresca's game plan for their dominant performance against the European champions. The victory, which crowns Chelsea as world champions, is seen as a major validation of the club's youth-driven strategy. The event was also notable for former President Donald Trump being booed by the crowd during the trophy ceremony.</p>

          <p>King Charles has invited Donald Trump for a second state visit, but the timing has been strategically scheduled for when the UK Parliament is in recess for party conferences. This scheduling choice effectively removes the possibility of the U.S. president making a controversial address to lawmakers, an honor given to past leaders like Barack Obama. The visit is a diplomatic coup for the White House, making Trump the first elected politician in modern history to be granted two state visits to the UK.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that King Charles III will host U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a state visit from September 17-19. The visit is unprecedented, as second-term presidents are not typically offered a full state visit. The event will take place at Windsor Castle due to ongoing renovations at Buckingham Palace. This diplomatic occasion is viewed by some as a powerful tool of soft diplomacy by the British government towards an ardently monarchist president.</p>

          <p>Staying up late to binge-watch television shows can be detrimental to your brain health, according to psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen. He explains that sleep is an essential period when the brain cleans and washes itself, and cutting this process short can impair decision-making the following day. Prioritizing sleep improves memory, energy, and focus. Dr. Amen also cautions that exposure to blue light from screens before bed can decrease melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and get adequate rest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The backlash erupted after a Justice Department memo stated there was no 'incriminating client list' or evidence of blackmail, contradicting the expectations of many who were anticipating major revelations. This has created a rift, with figures like Elon Musk and Laura Loomer voicing frustration and highlighting a growing division over the handling of the case.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled 'Swag,' which critics are describing as a raw, quirky, and authentic return to his R&B roots. The album moves away from his polished pop sound, featuring murky production and demo-like tracks that reflect a more improvisatory and personal approach. This project comes after a period of personal and professional change for the artist. The review suggests the messy yet beautiful music sympathetically reflects a tumultuous period in his life, drawing favorable comparisons to other idiosyncratic modern pop stars.</p>

While the pilot had been medically cleared to fly, sources suggest he had taken time off for mental health issues. The crash killed all but one of the 242 people on board the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.</p>

          <p>Sudan's civil war has intensified as paramilitary RSF forces launched a major offensive on el-Fasher, the last army-controlled city in the Darfur region.

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82. A towering and often polarizing figure, his legacy is complex, having led an aggressive anti-corruption campaign as a dictator in the 1980s before returning to power as a democratically elected president in 2015. His second term was marked by significant economic decline and widespread insecurity, leaving behind a fraught but influential legacy in Nigerian politics. He retained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>
