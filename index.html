          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would remove all sanctions on Syria to give the country "a chance at greatness" during a speech at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh. He stated his administration had already taken steps to restore normal relations between the U.S. and Syria. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. government since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following the Assad regime's crackdown on anti-government uprisings. Trump's announcement was met with celebrations in Damascus, Syria, where people waved Syrian flags in response to the news.</p>

He also indicated that officials who can't be charged should be publicly shamed, despite DOJ policy against commenting on uncharged individuals. Biden issued pardons to family members, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Gen. Mark Milley, and Jan. 6 Committee members before leaving office, sparking Martin's decision to review them.</p>

This move raises ethical concerns, potentially enriching Mr. Trump's family while he addresses TikTok's U.S. operations.

          <p>President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million luxury airliner from Qatar has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, raising concerns about conflicts of interest and national security. Critics argue the gift could be a bribe for future influence, given Qatar's record of abuses and funding of Hamas. Some Republicans worry about the plane being a security risk, with fears of intelligence assets. Senator Murphy highlighted numerous instances of Trump and his administration misusing their positions for personal gain, calling it "mind-blowing corruption."</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing key components of their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including tax and Medicaid cuts, despite internal disagreements. The plan proposes significant cuts to Medicaid, imposing work requirements and stricter eligibility checks. Demonstrators protested the Medicaid cuts, leading to arrests at the House Energy and Commerce Committee markup. While the plan avoids some of the most drastic cuts sought by hardliners, it faces opposition from both moderate Republicans and conservative members like Rep. Chip Roy, creating uncertainty about its passage.</p>

The company anticipates an operating loss of around $85 million for the quarter, reflecting higher-than-planned discounting and inventory charges.

The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that a "minimal quality of life" is out of reach for the bottom 60% of U.S. households. These households, earning an average of $38,000 per year, would need $67,000 to afford essential items. The cost of basic economic security doubled from 2021 to 2023, with housing and healthcare costs surging.</p>
