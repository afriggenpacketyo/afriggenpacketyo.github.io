            <p>Despite China's announcement of increased tariffs on U.S. imports, U.S. stock futures moved into positive territory, signaling a potential rebound on Wall Street. China's decision to raise tariffs from 84% to 125% followed President Trump's increase of U.S. levies on Chinese imports to 145%, escalating the trade war between the two economic giants. The initial market reaction in Asia was negative, with Tokyo falling more than 4%, but U.S. futures indicated resilience, with S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq futures all showing gains.

            <p>China announced it is raising tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125% in response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, stating the move is a reaction to the U.S.'s "arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs." The Chinese Commerce Ministry criticized the U.S.'s actions as a violation of international trade rules and common sense, declaring that further tariff hikes would be ignored. China also filed another complaint with the World Trade Organization over U.S. tariffs, while European stock indexes slumped following China's announcement, with analysts warning of increased recession risk. The ongoing trade war raises concerns about global economic stability.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, exceeding economists' predictions of 0.1% growth, driven by a strong performance in the services sector and improvements in manufacturing and production. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to computer programming, telecoms, and car dealerships, but analysts cautioned that the impact of newly imposed US tariffs could curtail future growth. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the encouraging figures but stressed the need for further action to stimulate economic growth, as the UK faces challenges from tax rises and increased household bills. Some experts believe the tariffs could create opportunities for the UK as a trade-friendly economy.</p>

            <p>Analysts believe that the European Union and China are unlikely to form close alliances despite strained relations between the U.S. and both entities due to Trump's tariffs. Max Bergmann from CSIS suggests that economic clashes and existing trade issues present major hurdles, as both economies are export-driven and compete fiercely in sectors like automotive and clean tech. Carsten Nickel from Teneo points to fundamental differences beyond trade, including concerns about overcapacity in China, human rights issues, and China's support for Russia in the Ukraine conflict. Despite potential opportunities for China to forge closer ties with the EU, deep mistrust persists regarding intellectual property, technological surveillance, and industrial policy.</p>

            <p>CNBC's 2025 MLB team valuations reveal that the average team is worth $2.62 billion, with the New York Yankees leading at $8 billion, second only to the Dallas Cowboys and Golden State Warriors among North American sports franchises. The Los Angeles Dodgers follow at $5.8 billion, generating $701 million in revenue during the 2024 season, but MLB faces revenue challenges due to the decline of regional sports networks and concerns about national TV rights. Despite these headwinds, overall revenue hit a record $12.1 billion in 2024, driven by increased attendance, ticket sales, and sponsorship revenue, with international prospects also appearing bright. The league's lack of a salary cap impacts profitability compared to other major sports leagues.</p>

            <p>Job seekers are increasingly using AI-powered tools to enhance their resumes, find jobs, and even provide answers during interviews, sparking debate about the ethical use of technology in the job search. Recruiters have noticed applicants using AI to embellish their experience and provide identical cover letters, leading some companies to require candidates to sign agreements not to use AI during interviews. While AI can be helpful for research and improving cover letters, concerns arise when it distorts a candidate's true skills and experience, raising questions about authenticity and misrepresentation. As competition for jobs intensifies, job seekers and employers grapple with the appropriate use of AI in the hiring process.</p>

            <p>Scientists are working to revive the sunflower sea star population, which has been decimated by a mysterious disease, in hopes of restoring kelp forests along the California coast. The sunflower sea stars, once abundant, play a crucial role in controlling urchin populations, which can decimate kelp forests if left unchecked. Researchers are making strides in breeding the animals in captivity and are working to increase genetic diversity by transporting starfish from Alaska to California. Restoring the starfish population could help revitalize kelp forests, which are vital for carbon sequestration, marine life, and economic activity.</p>

He criticized the selection of Hagerty Consulting as the main fire recovery contractor, suggesting AECOM would have been a better choice, and raised concerns about the lack of clarity regarding Hagerty's work.

The Reclaimers argue that alternatives offered by HACLA are inadequate, and they advocate for the option to purchase the Caltrans homes, while officials maintain they must follow legal processes.

The elimination of research and evaluation programs undermines the ability to assess the effectiveness of government programs and policies, hindering efforts to improve performance and address timely questions. The public needs access to credible information to counter false claims made by public officials.</p>

            <p>Michael Hiltzik analyzes the abrupt reversals in Donald Trump's tariff policies, exploring theories ranging from stock market manipulation to genuine economic concerns and attributing the shifts to Trump's dealmaking genius. The article questions whether Trump's actions were driven by a desire to manipulate the stock market, pressure countries into negotiations, or simply a lack of understanding of international trade. Hiltzik also raises concerns about the potential for insider trading and the damaging impact of Trump's tariff policies on the U.S. economy, particularly in relation to China. The author concludes that Trump's policies have left the international trade system in chaos.</p>

            <p>Jonathan Smucker discusses the power and pitfalls of protest, arguing that while protest is essential for social change, it also carries risks and can be easily framed negatively by powerful actors. He emphasizes the importance of understanding how Trump exploits class-based cultural divides to undermine protest movements and the need to break out of the "woke protester" framing. Smucker suggests that effective protest movements should emphasize relatable aspects of their identities, punch up at powerful economic culprits, and organize for long-term power-building, ultimately aiming to win a real voice for working people in determining policies that impact their lives.</p>

            <p>A Senate report reveals that the Trump administration has weakened tools used to combat foreign-influence campaigns, even as such efforts are growing in scope and sophistication. The report highlights attempts by Saudi Arabia to thwart a Senate investigation into the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which owns LIV Golf, and the refusal of PIF officials to cooperate with subpoenas. Senator Richard Blumenthal is calling for reconsideration of moves to limit enforcement of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara) and is introducing legislation to strengthen transparency requirements for sovereign wealth funds. The report raises concerns about the increasing influence of foreign actors and the need for stronger measures to protect U.S. interests.</p>

The performance will feature collaborations with artists like Zedd and Laufey, blending classical music with other genres, while the orchestra will present a bombastic mix of festival-primed classical music. The performance also arrives at a fraught moment for the arts in America, highlighting the importance of art in healing and inspiring people.</p>

            <p>An unfortunate reality now confronts Americans who value the rule of law: The court system has limited capability to act as a guardrail against Trumpist authoritarianism. And so elections matter—vitally. The final and most powerful check on Donald Trump has always been, and will always be, the ballot box. The president knows this, and that is why he has now turned his attention to the election system. His recent executive order on election “integrity” is nothing less than an attempt to disenfranchise his opponents and forestall electoral defeat.</p>

Linda Kelly, a 67-year-old patient, credits the drug with giving her extra years of life and enabling her to travel with her husband, experiencing minimal side effects. The drug, when combined with hormone therapy, has shown to double the time it takes for cancer to grow and shrink tumors in some patients, delaying the need for chemotherapy.
