          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals connected to an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans. Authorities collaborated to disrupt the attack, which was reportedly planned by a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community and aimed to radicalize teenagers. The suspects included the alleged leader of the group, arrested on illegal weapons possession charges, and a teenager arrested on child pornography charges. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of any safety concerns prior to or during the show, which was intended to boost Rio's economy, and that they worked closely with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Rory Truex, a China expert at Princeton University, discusses Donald Trump's evolving China policy, noting a shift from initial ease to aggressive trade tactics. Truex suggests that Trump's actions might be bargaining strategies but indicate a broader disinterest in resetting the relationship with China. He also points out the growing pressure in Washington for policy specialists to adopt an anti-China stance. Truex initially considered the possibility of an authoritarian realignment between Trump, Putin, and Xi Jinping, viewing Trump as a proto autocrat with an affinity for authoritarian leaders.</p>

          <p>The bodies of 13 security guards kidnapped from the La Poderosa gold mine in Peru were discovered, with the mining company blaming informal miners allegedly linked to criminal gangs for the abduction. La Poderosa reported that 39 of its workers have been killed since 1980 due to violence from criminal groups vying for control of the mine. The company criticized the state of emergency declaration and police presence for failing to improve security conditions. Relatives of the victims are demanding justice following the incident, which is part of a surge in extortion and violence affecting the northern mining area of Peru.</p>

Backeberg, now 82, is living outside of Wisconsin and was located through her sister's ancestry.com account. Detective Hanson spoke with Backeberg who sounded happy, confident in her decision, and without regrets, suggesting that an abusive marriage may have contributed to her initial choice to leave.</p>

          <p>A ballistic missile launched from Yemen struck near Israel’s main international airport, resulting in a temporary suspension of flights and several injuries. The Houthi militia claimed responsibility for the attack, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to threaten retaliation against both the Houthis and Iran. International airlines canceled scheduled arrivals and departures following the strike. This attack marks a significant security breach and raises concerns about Israel’s ability to intercept such attacks despite its missile defense systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he will not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, despite repeatedly calling for Powell to lower interest rates. Trump expressed his belief that Powell does not like him and is deliberately keeping interest rates high. However, Trump acknowledged that he will have the opportunity to replace Powell in a short period of time. Trump has been critical of the Federal Reserve's policies and has frequently called for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.</p>
