          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated at the company's annual shareholder meeting that they have not observed any decrease in consumer demand or significant price increases as a result of President Trump's tariffs.

          <p>The U.S. government has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift to be potentially used for the Air Force One fleet. This decision has stirred controversy, particularly because the U.S. Constitution prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without congressional approval. The White House argues the gift is legal as it's being given to the defense department, not the president personally. The plane, estimated to be worth $400 million, will require significant modifications and upgrades to meet security standards before it can be used to transport the president.</p>

Drawe, a Trump supporter, expressed disappointment with the eminent domain laws, noting that the wall disrupted his idyllic rural life.

          <p>Tax cuts pushed by President Trump are exacerbating debt and deficit concerns among bond investors, influencing interest rates. The bond market is showing signs of nervousness due to the administration's tax bill, which is expected to increase the federal deficit. Rising Treasury yields reflect these concerns, with the 10-year Treasury yield climbing above 4.5 percent. Economists warn that volatility in the Treasury market could heighten economic uncertainty, potentially affecting household and business spending. (not investment advice)</p>

Decreasing enrollment poses challenges for school districts due to reduced revenue, leading to job cuts and program reductions. Despite the overall decline, transitional kindergarten enrollment is growing, but falling short of state goals.</p>

Single parents and pensioners express concerns about financial strain and the reduced value of their pensions, highlighting the widespread impact of rising prices on various segments of the population.
