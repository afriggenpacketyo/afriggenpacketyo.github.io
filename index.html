          <p>Afghanistan's Taliban government has significantly restricted access to major social media platforms, including Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat, on mobile networks. This action, following a 2022 ban on TikTok and a recent country-wide internet suspension, marks a further tightening of digital control. While the Taliban has not officially confirmed the restrictions, users across the country report slow internet connections or complete service cuts without VPNs. Rights groups express grave concerns about these measures, highlighting their serious implications for the Afghan population, particularly women and girls, who rely on these platforms for vital communication and information access.</p>

          <p>Portland, Oregon, is experiencing heightened anxiety as President Trump attempts to deploy federalized National Guard troops, despite court orders blocking the move. Local businesses, like Mother's Bistro and Bar, report significant declines since 2020, exacerbated by Trump's rhetoric describing the city as 'war-ravaged.' Business owners have supported a state lawsuit against the deployment, arguing that the president's statements are damaging Portland's image and hindering its recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation during his 2020 Senate testimony. The federal grand jury indictment stems from allegations that Comey falsely denied authorizing an FBI staffer to be an anonymous source for news reports on 2016 investigations. Comey's lawyer plans to seek dismissal, citing vindictive prosecution and questions about the U.S. Attorney's appointment. The case is seen as an escalation of President Trump's efforts against political opponents.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the possible revival of the Keystone XL pipeline project during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the issue in the context of broader trade talks, and Trump was receptive to the idea. The pipeline, previously blocked by Obama and Biden administrations, faced strong environmental and indigenous opposition. While the company behind it had 'moved on,' the discussions signal a potential renewed push for the controversial project.</p>

CoreWeave, which recently went public and has seen its stock soar, has inked multi-billion-dollar deals with OpenAI and Meta, emphasizing that these represent a massive, fundamental infrastructure buildout in the market.

The National Treasury Employees Union condemned the decision, emphasizing the negative impact on American taxpayers, especially as the extended tax-filing deadline approaches.
