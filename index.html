          <p>Actress Genevieve Chenneour, known for her role in Bridgerton, has spoken out about the severe trauma she experienced after a violent phone theft in a London café. The incident, which left her with a concussion, has caused her to become severely agoraphobic and move out of the capital for her safety. An 18-year-old has been jailed for the assault and theft, but Chenneour remains fearful as a second assailant has not been identified and criticizes the lack of aftercare from police.</p>

While sectors like business services and manufacturing are shedding jobs, the healthcare and social assistance sector remains a robust area of growth, accounting for nearly half of all employment growth over the past year.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America rejected him as a customer, forcing him to move hundreds of millions of dollars to smaller banks. He made these remarks amid reports that his administration is preparing an executive order to fine banks for "de-banking" customers on political grounds. Trump suggested regulators under the previous administration pressured the banks, a claim that aligns with broader conservative grievances against financial institutions. JPMorgan responded by denying it closes accounts for political reasons but agreed that regulatory change is needed.</p>

Committee Chairman James Comer also subpoenaed the Justice Department for its complete, unredacted Epstein files. The move compels testimony from a wide range of former high-ranking officials, including past attorneys general and FBI directors from multiple administrations. This action follows the current administration's decision not to release more federal files on Epstein, which has drawn criticism.</p>

While the latest revision was unusually large for a non-recessionary period, former officials stress it does not indicate manipulation or failure, but rather reflects the challenge of timely data collection.

          <p>Rupert Murdoch will provide sworn declarations about his health to former President Donald Trump's legal team as part of a libel lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal. Trump sued Murdoch and News Corp. over an article about an alleged raunchy birthday greeting sent to Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump claims is fake. Trump's lawyers had initially sought an immediate deposition of the 94-year-old mogul, citing his age and health issues, but have now agreed to pause that request. In return, Murdoch will provide regular health updates and notify Trump's team of any material changes in his condition.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals a growing disparity in workforce participation between women with and without a college degree. Over the past two decades, the share of college-educated women in the workforce grew by nine percentage points, while participation for women without a degree increased by less than one point. Researchers attribute this divergence to changes like the rise of flexible and remote work, which primarily benefit white-collar jobs typically held by degree holders. The report highlights that benefits like paid leave and childcare subsidies are also more common in these sectors, leaving noncollege-educated women, particularly mothers, behind.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed fines totaling nearly £46 million against former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm, Woodford Investment Management (WIM). The penalties relate to the 2019 collapse of the Woodford Equity Income Fund, which locked in and led to losses for about 300,000 investors. The FCA found that WIM and Woodford made "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions" that compromised the fund's liquidity. WIM has stated it "strongly" disagrees with the findings and plans to appeal, arguing the true cause of investor losses was the decision to liquidate the fund.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has ended with the capture of Austin Robert Drummond, the prime suspect in the killing of four people in northwest Tennessee. Drummond, 28, was apprehended in a wooded area in Jackson and is considered a suspect in the deaths of Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. The investigation began after an infant belonging to two of the victims was found abandoned in a car seat in a nearby county.

          <p>Yum Brands reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations, largely due to struggling U.S. sales at its KFC and Pizza Hut chains. Both brands saw a 5% decline in U.S. same-store sales, which executives attributed to insufficient value messaging in a competitive market. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, with a 4% increase in same-store sales driven by popular new menu items. Overall, the company's global same-store sales grew by 2%, supported by strong international performance, particularly from KFC in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration's new phone-sharing system, intended to reduce wait times, is reportedly causing new problems for people seeking help. Calls to local field offices are now being rerouted to available staff nationwide, who often lack the jurisdiction to resolve the caller's specific case, according to employees and advocates. This can lead to further delays, as the issue must then be referred back to the correct servicing office. While the agency claims all staff are equipped to handle inquiries, union representatives and legal aid attorneys argue the system is ineffective and undermines public confidence.</p>

          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, "King of Kings," challenges deterministic views of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, presenting it as a contingent event shaped by miscalculation and accident. The book argues that the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini's theocracy was not inevitable but resulted from a convergence of factors. These included the Shah's hubris and secret illness, and the U.S. government's profound ignorance and internal division regarding the situation in Iran. By focusing on the actions of key individuals in the crucial months leading to the revolution, the book suggests that a series of freakish circumstances led to the outcome.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has weighed in on the contentious Texas redistricting battle, stating that Republicans are "entitled" to the five additional congressional seats the proposed maps would likely create. In a CNBC interview, he asserted his belief in the plan while criticizing states like California and Illinois for what he claimed, without evidence, was Democratic gerrymandering. His comments come as Texas Democrats have fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the new maps. The move has created a high-stakes political standoff, with the Texas governor threatening to have the absent lawmakers arrested.</p>

          <p>Critics and civic groups are raising alarms that the new congressional maps proposed by Texas Republicans are a form of racial gerrymandering that unconstitutionally dilutes Latino voting strength. The plan would significantly alter districts like the one representing Austin, which was drawn by federal judges to ensure Latino representation, and break up cohesive minority communities. Despite Hispanics being the state's largest demographic group, the new map fails to create additional Latino-majority districts and weakens existing ones. Voting rights organizations argue the map clearly violates the Voting Rights Act and is a calculated move to suppress the growing influence of minority voters.</p>

          <p>For individuals turning 70, an annuity can provide a guaranteed income stream for life, offering peace of mind in a volatile economic climate. Buying an annuity at an older age typically results in higher monthly payments, as the insurer's payout period is expected to be shorter. This can be particularly advantageous for healthy individuals with a family history of longevity, especially with current interest rates making fixed annuities more attractive. However, potential downsides include high fees, a lack of liquidity, and the possibility of not recouping the initial investment if one's health declines unexpectedly. (not investment advice)</p>

An unnamed senior official stated the goal is the "full conquest of the Gaza Strip" to defeat Hamas, even if it means clashing with military leadership. The potential move has alarmed the families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, who fear for their safety, and would likely be condemned by international allies pushing for a ceasefire. The proposal comes after ceasefire talks broke down and as humanitarian conditions in Gaza continue to deteriorate.</p>
