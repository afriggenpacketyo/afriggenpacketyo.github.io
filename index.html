          <p>Derrick Groves, the final inmate from a May mass escape at the Orleans Parish Justice Center, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff, concluding a months-long, multi-agency manhunt. His apprehension brings significant relief to victims and the New Orleans community, who had been rightly concerned by a convicted violent offender's prolonged evasion of justice. Groves, facing life imprisonment for past crimes and additional charges for the jailbreak, was found in a crawl space and taken into custody peacefully. This incident has highlighted severe design flaws and staffing issues at the justice center, prompting ongoing investigations into the escape's facilitation and the need for improved custodial security.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans voted down legislation that would have required President Trump to seek congressional authorization before using deadly military force against drug cartels. The 48-51 vote, largely along party lines, highlighted a clash over presidential war powers, with the administration asserting drug traffickers are armed combatants. Democrats and some Republicans expressed unease, questioning the legal justification and lack of information regarding strikes that have already destroyed vessels and killed at least 21 people. Critics worry this precedent could redefine lethal force usage and inadvertently lead to broader conflicts, while supporters praised Trump's actions as essential for national security.</p>

          <p>Eight individuals were injured, one seriously, when a Metrolink train collided with a stationary empty train at Los Angeles Union Station. The incident occurred around 7:30 a.m., involving Ventura County Line Train 104 carrying 85 passengers. Metrolink's safety department is currently investigating the cause of the collision, which also led to the cancellation of two San Bernardino Line trains.

          <p>An illegal immigrant from El Salvador has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for repeatedly sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in Virginia Beach. Ricardo Leonel Mejia will serve his sentence in the Virginia Department of Corrections before being transferred to ICE custody for deportation. The case has intensified a debate among Virginia leaders regarding cooperation with federal immigration authorities, with some advocating for policies that would limit such assistance. Mejia's conviction for multiple counts, including sexual assault of a child under 13, highlights a horrific crime and its broader political implications.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has seen its membership almost halve over the past five years, falling from nearly 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000. This decline occurred despite the party's most successful general election in terms of seats won last year, and having the most active membership among UK parties. Experts suggest that a lack of public profile and perceived chances of government participation may contribute to the drop, which has been partially masked by the inclusion of "registered supporters" in official figures. Meanwhile, the Green Party has experienced a significant surge in membership, highlighting shifting political engagement.</p>

The deal, which also involves the release of Palestinian prisoners, aims to end the two-year-long war that began with Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack and has resulted in significant casualties.

          <p>An article from The Atlantic describes President Trump's escalating "revenge crusade," driven by his fixation on his legacy and past legal challenges. The president has openly called for the jailing of political opponents, including the Illinois governor and Chicago mayor, and the federal government has initiated legal action against figures like former FBI Director James Comey. This marks a significant shift, as the traditional barriers between the White House and the Department of Justice appear to have eroded.

          <p>The Pentagon Press Association has reached an impasse with the Defense Department over proposed new restrictions on reporters' credentials, calling them a "message of intimidation." The rules would require journalists to acknowledge not disclosing classified or "controlled unclassified information" not formally authorized for publication, threatening credential revocation for non-compliance. Critics argue these policies stifle a free press by potentially preventing the use of unnamed military sources and could expose journalists to prosecution for doing their jobs. The Pentagon maintains that access is a privilege and reasonable regulations are necessary for information handling.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan for Gaza outlines a multi-phase roadmap, endorsed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, aimed at ending the two-year conflict. Key elements include an immediate ceasefire, the release of all remaining Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line. The plan also proposes demilitarizing Gaza under independent supervision and establishing a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" for governance, overseen by an "International Stabilization Force" and a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. While offering a "credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination," it sidesteps immediate Palestinian statehood, focusing instead on stabilization and economic redevelopment.</p>

          <p>Tesla Cybertruck owners are reporting an unexpected issue with rapid tire wear, with some drivers needing second pairs of tires after as little as 17,000 to 22,000 miles. This contrasts sharply with the average all-season tire lifespan of 50,000 to 70,000 miles, raising concerns about the vehicle's durability and high ownership costs. Experts suggest the Cybertruck's significant weight, over 6,000 pounds, and instant torque contribute to the accelerated degradation. Drivers are advised to practice regular maintenance and adjust driving habits to extend tire life, as the issue adds to the vehicle's disappointing sales run since its 2023 launch.</p>

          <p>The war in Gaza has tragically claimed the lives of an estimated 20,000 children, nearly a third of all Palestinian casualties, with thousands more maimed, injured, or orphaned. UNICEF and Save the Children report a child dying every hour, highlighting the immense human cost of the conflict. Aid workers describe scenes of profound trauma, with children witnessing loved ones die and enduring repeated, violent displacement. The destruction of universities and schools means 660,000 children are out of school, leading to fears of a "lost generation," as humanitarian conditions, including malnutrition and lack of sanitation, continue to worsen for the displaced population.</p>

The note, captured in a photograph, read "Very close. We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first."

          <p>An article warns that the ongoing government shutdown is entering a critical phase, moving beyond political bluster to inflict tangible harm on Americans nationwide. Air-traffic control systems are buckling, military personnel and federal workers face missed paychecks, and vital programs like WIC for low-income mothers are running out of funds. President Trump's administration has attempted to mitigate some impacts, such as repurposing tariff revenue for WIC, while Congress remains deadlocked. Economists predict significant economic losses and a potential catastrophic chain reaction if a resolution isn't reached soon, affecting both federal services and private businesses.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have agreed to a ceasefire deal, marking the "first phase" of a peace plan intended to end the devastating two-year Gaza war, as announced by President Trump. The agreement, brokered by mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, is expected to involve the release of nearly 50 hostages in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Key elements include Hamas disarming and relinquishing governance of Gaza, with Israel maintaining a security perimeter before eventual troop withdrawal. While a major breakthrough after previous failed truces, the deal's precise details and a clear roadmap for Palestinian political rights remain to be fully resolved.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian journalist, Vitaly Shevchenko, discovered through satellite images a well-used road leading to his childhood home in Russian-occupied Verkhnya Krynytsya, suggesting it may now be a Russian military base. His village, near the front lines in Zaporizhzhia, was occupied in February 2022, with Russian soldiers known to move into vacant properties for shelter during winter. The Kakhovka reservoir, a cherished local landmark, also disappeared after its dam's destruction in June 2023, irrevocably altering the landscape.

          <p>President Trump declared that Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for opposing federal efforts to deploy National Guard troops to their cities. Trump continues to portray Chicago and Portland as "war-ravaged" and "burning," escalating tensions over his militarized campaign against what he describes as "antifa" and immigration opposition. Democratic leaders characterize Trump's rhetoric as "deranged" and a step towards authoritarianism, vowing to resist federalization of state troops.

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner lauded defender Maya Le Tissier, fueling speculation about her potential inclusion in England's starting lineup for upcoming matches against Brazil and Australia. Despite being a consistent and top-performing defender in the Women's Super League, Le Tissier has limited international caps, often played out of position at right-back by England coach Sarina Wiegman. Skinner praised the 23-year-old as a "rock" for United, highlighting her composure and technique, particularly after she scored a crucial penalty in their Champions League debut. Injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze could open a path for her central defensive role.</p>

          <p>Britain's membership in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has become a highly divisive political issue, with the Conservative Party pledging to withdraw if they win the next election. This stance, aimed at curbing illegal immigration and protecting borders, contrasts sharply with Liberal Democrat and Labour positions, which advocate for reform rather than complete withdrawal. The debate, fueled by historical clashes over issues like prisoner voting rights and immigration cases, highlights concerns about UK sovereignty versus international legal obligations. Experts acknowledge the complexity, noting that leaving the ECHR might not be a "silver bullet" for immigration but carries significant international implications, including for the Belfast Agreement.</p>
