Shares of companies heavily reliant on imported products suffered the most significant losses, with some experiencing double-digit declines. The long-term economic consequences of these tariffs remain uncertain, but experts warn of potential negative impacts on growth and employment.</p>

The plan targets major trading partners like China and the European Union, potentially impacting trillions of dollars in trade.
