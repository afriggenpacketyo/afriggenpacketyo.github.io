          <h2>UK Weighs Retaliation Against Potential US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-30 00:24:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst ongoing negotiations, the UK government is prepared to retaliate against potential US tariffs on British exports.  The government is seeking an exemption, highlighting the relatively balanced trade relationship between the two nations. However, a trade war could significantly harm the UK economy, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.  The potential for bias lies in the UK's focus on its own economic interests, potentially downplaying the potential benefits of the US tariffs for American businesses.</p>
