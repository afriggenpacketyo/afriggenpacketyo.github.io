          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports. President Trump stated the agreement includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and will open Japanese markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. The deal comes after Japan's prime minister faced political pressure and provides relief from previously threatened higher tariffs. Following the announcement, Japanese automotive stocks surged, reflecting market optimism about the resolution of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Law enforcement in Hillsborough County, Florida, is alerting the public about a dangerous social media trend known as the "door kick challenge." The warning follows an incident where several minors targeted a home, with one kicking the door and firing an airsoft gun before fleeing. Police and parental control experts express concern that the trend, aimed at frightening homeowners for online attention, could lead to tragic consequences. Authorities are urging parents to discuss the serious risks of such behavior with their children.</p>

          <p>A Worcestershire musician has spoken out about her experience with cyberflashing, stating she felt ignored by police after reporting that a man sent her unsolicited explicit images. Despite providing evidence, she faced a months-long delay before the perpetrator was arrested and convicted, feeling forced to investigate the crime herself. The case highlights the challenges victims face and the need for law enforcement to take digital harassment more seriously. The man was ultimately convicted and received a two-year community order for his actions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has directed its national governing bodies to align with a presidential executive order, effectively barring transgender women from competing in women's sports. In a letter, the USOPC stated its obligation to comply with the federal directive, which threatens to rescind funding for non-compliant organizations. This move, which follows a similar policy change by the NCAA, has been condemned by advocacy groups like the National Women's Law Center as a submission to political pressure that harms athletes.</p>

The piece connects the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" by Paramount, which is seeking federal approval for a merger, with House Republicans' move to recess early to avoid a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein files. The author argues these events demonstrate a growing willingness by corporations and political figures to appease the White House, thereby stifling criticism and accountability.</p>

The accusation stems from a recently declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence.

          <p>Columbia University has announced disciplinary actions against dozens of students who participated in a pro-Palestinian protest that involved seizing a campus library in May. The sanctions range from probation and multi-year suspensions to expulsions and the revocation of degrees. A student group claims 80 students were punished, calling it the most suspensions for a single protest in the university's history. The move follows pressure from the Trump administration, which has penalized the university for its handling of campus protests and alleged antisemitism.</p>

          <p>A report from Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile highlights growing concerns about "overtourism" and its impact on local life. A survey found 72 tourist-focused gift shops along the famous street, which residents say have replaced essential businesses like grocers and butchers. While tourism supports over 40,000 jobs in the city, locals argue the focus on visitors is making the area unlivable for families, contributing to a decline in school enrollment. The situation reflects a broader European debate on how to balance a thriving tourism economy with the needs of residents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives will recess early for its summer break, a move Speaker Mike Johnson made to prevent a bipartisan vote on releasing more files related to the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. The decision came as a new bill to force disclosure gained momentum, putting the Speaker in a difficult position between his party members and a White House that has resisted releasing the information. The maneuver highlights the significant political turmoil the Epstein scandal is causing within the Republican party and its ability to paralyze legislative functions.</p>

          <p>A Boston court has dismissed more than 120 criminal cases, including some involving assault, because the defendants could not be assigned a lawyer. The dismissals are the latest consequence of a months-long pay dispute that has led public defenders to stop taking new clients. Citing a protocol that requires dropping cases if a defendant lacks an attorney for 45 days, the judge dismissed the charges. Prosecutors have expressed alarm over the public safety implications, as the crisis highlights systemic issues with funding for public defense in Massachusetts.</p>
