          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported its eighth consecutive month of over 30,000 car deliveries in June, demonstrating resilience amid an intense price war in China's EV market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed results, facing pressure from new models and aggressive pricing from companies like Xiaomi. This competitive landscape, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for its "disorderly" nature, is also impacting Tesla, which has seen its market share and sales in China decline.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 35% on Japanese imports if a trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This represents a significant increase from the current 10% levy and the original 24% tariff proposed during the "Liberation Day" announcement. Trump expressed doubt about reaching a deal, specifically criticizing Japan's policies on U.S. rice imports. Japanese officials have stated they will not make concessions that harm the country's agricultural sector, setting the stage for a tense conclusion to the 90-day negotiation period.

          <p>Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The payment will be directed to Trump's future presidential library, and Paramount will not issue an apology or admit wrongdoing. The settlement, which also requires "60 Minutes" to release future presidential candidate interview transcripts, is seen as a move to resolve a contentious legal battle and smooth the way for Paramount's sale to Skydance Media.

          <p>The jury in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial announced it was deadlocked on a complex racketeering charge after reaching verdicts on four other counts. Legal experts suggest the jury's difficulty with the RICO charge is not surprising, given its legal complexity, which is challenging for laypeople to understand. The prosecution's case involved over 30 witnesses, while the defense rested without calling any, a strategy described as "high-stakes poker." The judge has instructed the jurors to continue deliberating in an attempt to reach a unanimous decision on all five counts against the music mogul.</p>

This announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. An Israeli official indicated readiness for a ceasefire but noted that Hamas's acceptance remains uncertain, as the group continues to demand a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to revoke the status in September, well before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official end date. This ruling prevents the immediate loss of legal status and work permits for Haitians who rely on the program due to ongoing instability in their home country.</p>

This new approach aims to simulate a full-spectrum response to a potential conflict with Beijing, from initial "grey zone" pressure to a full-scale invasion and extended urban warfare. The exercises will incorporate a "whole-of-society resilience" model, including air-raid warnings, mass evacuations, and critical infrastructure protection. The move signals Taipei's growing concern about the need for both military defense and civilian preparedness in the face of a prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government experienced a significant political setback, being forced into a major U-turn on its welfare reform bill after facing a large-scale rebellion from his own Labour MPs. Despite having a substantial majority, the government had to abandon key changes to disability benefit eligibility, leaving its policy in disarray and creating a financial hole. The chaotic episode has been compared to the parliamentary struggles of previous, weaker governments and has led to internal criticism and questions about Starmer's leadership. The event has weakened the Prime Minister and raised the prospect of future tax increases.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, accompanied by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a newly constructed migrant detention facility in the remote Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The facility, surrounded by treacherous swampland, is part of the administration's aggressive immigration crackdown and is intended to deter illegal crossings. Trump praised its rapid construction and noted the security provided by the surrounding environment, suggesting similar centers could be built elsewhere to facilitate mass deportations.

          <p>A coalition of 20 states, led by California, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for sharing private Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security. The lawsuit alleges that the transfer of sensitive information—including names, addresses, and immigration status—violates federal privacy laws like HIPAA. This data, from states that offer state-funded coverage to non-U.S. citizens, could be used to locate migrants for the administration's mass deportation campaign.

          <p>Preliminary government data shows that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to a historic low of just over 6,000 in June. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive immigration policies, including swift deportations and a halt to the release of migrants into the U.S. The numbers represent a stark contrast to the record highs seen under the previous administration. The crackdown has involved deploying troops to the border, increasing interior enforcement, and a messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation, though these tactics have drawn significant criticism.</p>

Musk criticized Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," arguing it would increase the national debt and harm renewable energy by cutting EV tax credits. Trump retorted that Musk could "lose a lot more" than EV mandates, alluding to the billions in federal contracts and subsidies his companies like SpaceX and Tesla receive. This political clash adds to market anxiety, as analysts already expect Tesla to report a 13% year-over-year decline in vehicle deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Parts of England are now officially in a state of drought, with other regions at risk if the current dry weather persists. The UK experienced its sixth-driest spring since 1836, leading to significantly low levels in rivers and reservoirs, particularly in northern England, eastern Scotland, and parts of Wales. Farmers are already feeling the impact on crops, and wildlife is struggling as habitats dry up. While climate change is expected to bring drier summers on average, experts note that rising temperatures also accelerate evaporation, intensifying drought conditions and increasing the need for better water management.</p>
