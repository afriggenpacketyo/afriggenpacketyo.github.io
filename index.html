He even suffered a form of martyrdom, being hit by a tram while apparently deep in thought about his most famous work, the church of Sagrada Família.

            <p>Pakistan has deported over 19,500 Afghans this month, with over 80,000 having left ahead of an April 30 deadline, citing national security concerns and pressure on public services. The deportations have sparked concern from Taliban officials and the UN, with many Afghans born in Pakistan or having never lived in Afghanistan. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with Taliban officials to discuss the issue, while expelled Afghans expressed fears about life under Taliban rule, particularly for girls' education. The deportations highlight the complex challenges of refugee management and regional stability. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration's plan to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections. The proposed "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 policy-focused government employees, allowing them to be more easily removed if they do not advance the President's policy interests. Critics fear this move could lead to increased political influence and reduced job security for career government employees. The White House maintains that the change aims to root out corruption and implement accountability within the federal workforce. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>According to Phillip Inman, the rise of populism is being fueled by wealth, not poverty, as financially secure voters become more tolerant of political risks. This new social contract involves the better-off supporting policies that protect their gains, often at the expense of the less fortunate. The trend is seen in the US and Europe, with voters supporting right-wing candidates who promise tax cuts and reduced regulations. The article suggests that this shift reflects a growing disconnect between the affluent and the rest of society. Optimism score: 40</p>
