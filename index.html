          <p>The article details a severe and increasing crisis of violence against Christians in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo, by Islamic State-affiliated groups. It highlights horrific attacks, including massacres and beheadings, which have displaced millions and resulted in tens of thousands of deaths over the last decade. Human rights organizations describe the situation as an existential threat and ethno-religious cleansing. The White House and State Department have acknowledged the crisis, stating they are working to identify opportunities to promote religious freedom and stop the violence.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, are protesting against the government's plan to expand the military operation into Gaza City. Protesters fear the plan endangers the lives of the remaining hostages and are demanding the government prioritize a deal for their release. The demonstrations reflect a growing divide between the public, many of whom favor a deal to end the war, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration. The plan has also drawn international condemnation and warnings from top UN officials about catastrophic consequences for civilians.</p>

          <p>The Japanese boxing community is in mourning after two boxers, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died from brain hemorrhages sustained in separate fights during the same event in Tokyo. The tragic deaths have sparked an urgent debate over boxing safety in Japan, prompting calls for tighter regulations. In response to the fatalities, the Japan Boxing Commission has announced that certain championship bouts will be shortened from 12 rounds to 10. These incidents highlight the inherent dangers of the sport and have intensified demands for stricter medical protocols globally.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws a parallel between the author's grandmother's experience of starvation in the Warsaw ghetto and the current hunger crisis in Gaza. The author argues that the essential human need for food transcends political and ideological divides, emphasizing that ensuring food and water for all must be a primary moral imperative. The article reflects on how intergenerational trauma shapes perceptions of the conflict and calls for empathy over semantic debates about terms like genocide. It concludes with a plea to prioritize the physiological needs of the most vulnerable, especially starving children in Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that Donald Trump's actions in the first 200 days of his second term demonstrate a clear and accelerating trend toward authoritarianism. It lists examples such as demanding the prosecution of political opponents, firing government statisticians over unfavorable reports, and pursuing a hostile takeover of Washington D.C.'s governance. Critics and political analysts quoted in the article express growing alarm, stating that the administration is systematically demolishing democratic pillars. The piece contrasts this term with his first, noting that Trump and his allies are now more knowledgeable and deliberate in expanding presidential power and undermining institutions.</p>

It details how actions like tariff hikes, cuts to federal agencies like the NIH and FEMA, and attacks on the civil service are causing tangible harm. The authors suggest this growing perception of incompetence is more politically damaging for Trump than his other controversies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts Los Angeles descending into chaos amid the threat of a nuclear attack, has found a renewed cult following. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the movie is noted for its affectionate portrayal of its namesake Wilshire Boulevard neighborhood, featuring landmarks like the La Brea Tar Pits and the former May Co. building. The plot begins as a romance before a mistaken phone call plunges the protagonists into a frantic race for survival against a one-hour countdown to nuclear annihilation. The film's enduring appeal is attributed to its unique, location-specific take on doomsday.</p>

          <p>Cities like Bangkok and Los Angeles are exploring the "sponge city" concept, a nature-based approach to urban water management that uses permeable surfaces and green infrastructure to absorb and clean stormwater. Pioneered by landscape architect Kongjian Yu, the model aims to mitigate flooding and replenish groundwater by retaining and slowing water flow, rather than flushing it away through concrete channels. While China has invested heavily in thousands of such projects, implementation in places like L.A. faces challenges, including high costs and bureaucratic hurdles. Proponents argue it is a crucial, adaptive response to the dual climate threats of extreme rainfall and water scarcity.</p>

This radical adaptation allows a degraded creek and wetland ecosystem to be restored, providing space for it to migrate inland as sea levels rise.

When adjusted for population, California ranked 27th nationally, far behind many Republican-led states. Experts attribute this disparity to the higher degree of cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in red states, which cast a wider enforcement net. While California saw a dramatic percentage increase in arrests, the overall numbers were lower, partly due to sanctuary policies and organized community resistance that made enforcement more difficult for federal agents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new set of genome editing tools, called programmable chromosome engineering (PCE) systems, that can precisely edit large DNA fragments in higher organisms. This breakthrough makes a decade-old gene editing technique significantly easier to use and more efficient. The technology has the potential to manipulate genomic structural variations, which could open new possibilities for improving crop traits and treating genetic diseases. According to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, this advance may also accelerate the development of artificial chromosomes, a key area in the field of synthetic biology.</p>

          <p>Young people in Shanghai are driving a new trend in the city's nighttime economy, shifting focus from traditional nightlife to live performances. This Gen Z passion for theater has prompted the city government to launch initiatives to support cultural and entertainment activities as part of its "Night Economy 2.0" plan. By optimizing approval processes and enriching neighborhood entertainment, authorities aim to stimulate domestic consumption. This cultural spending is seen as a vital engine for economic growth, especially as China seeks to boost demand-side stimulus to counter deflationary pressures and trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin, key European allies have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace talks must include Ukraine. The leaders of the UK, France, Germany, and others stressed that a diplomatic solution is critical and that international borders must not be changed by force. The show of support comes after Trump suggested a deal could involve "swapping of territories," a proposal Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky strongly rejected. European leaders are concerned about being excluded from negotiations that directly impact their continent's security.</p>

In a post on X, UEFA mourned al-Obeid's death but did not mention the circumstances surrounding it. Salah replied directly, asking UEFA to specify how, where, and why he died. According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was killed by Israeli forces while waiting for humanitarian aid in Gaza.

Despite his rise to stardom, Jota maintained close ties with those who supported him early in his career, such as the woman who cared for him in his youth dormitory at Pacos de Ferreira. Teammates and mentors describe him as an ordinary person in a world of superstars, who valued honesty and never forgot where he came from. For his wedding, he asked for donations to local charities instead of gifts, embodying his lifelong gratitude and simplicity.</p>

          <p>Wang Xingxing, the founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, predicts that robotics could experience its own 'ChatGPT moment' within the next two to three years. He defines this moment as the point when a robot can perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new and unfamiliar environment for the first time. Wang believes that while robot hardware is sufficiently advanced, the crucial element of 'AI for embodied intelligence' is still lacking. He suggests that new approaches, such as generating interactive video models for robots to follow, might have a higher probability of success than current methods.</p>

          <p>A small, round metal piece from a bathroom door lock proved to be the crucial piece of evidence in the murder trial of Matthew Ecker, who was convicted of killing fellow nurse Alexandra Pennig. Ecker claimed Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide, and that he broke the door down afterward. However, investigators found the lock piece underneath Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot and fell. This contradicted Ecker's timeline and supported the prosecution's theory that he broke in and then killed her, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles officials are urging residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to stop using water, including flushing toilets, amid a multi-day service outage affecting 9,200 households. The outage began when a critical water control valve broke, and repair efforts have been hampered by residents continuing to use water, which prevents a large reservoir tank from pressurizing. The situation was complicated further when a temporary bypass pipe failed, delaying repairs. Officials have opened distribution centers for bottled water and access to showers as they work to restore the system, a process highly dependent on consumer conservation.</p>

          <p>Northern China, including Beijing, has again been hit by deadly floods during its traditional rainy season, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. The storms that struck in late July were unusual in that they primarily affected the northern part of the capital. This is in contrast to previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the southern areas of the city. The recurring nature of these devastating floods underscores the ongoing challenges the region faces in managing extreme weather events during its summer monsoon season.</p>

The author points to Russia's deployment of new hypersonic missiles and NATO's corresponding buildup of nuclear-capable hardware across Europe as evidence of escalating tensions. Unlike the massive anti-nuclear protests of the 1980s, the current buildup is met with what the author calls an "eerie silence" from the public. The article serves as a stark warning that nuclear weapons are increasingly being viewed as usable, offensive weapons, raising the risk of global catastrophe.</p>
