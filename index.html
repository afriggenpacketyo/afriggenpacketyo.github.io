          <p>The Department of Education has issued a warning to Columbia University's accreditor, alleging violations of federal anti-discrimination laws under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These accusations stem from the university's handling of protests related to the Israel-Hamas war and alleged harassment of Jewish students. The department claims Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly investigate or punish related misconduct. Columbia University has stated it is deeply committed to combating antisemitism and is working with the federal government to address the issue, although the department's move could affect the university's eligibility for federal loans and financial aid.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon expressed uncertainty about whether teaching key episodes of Black history, such as the Tulsa race massacre and the story of Ruby Bridges, would violate the Trump administration's anti-DEI policies. During a House subcommittee hearing, McMahon stated that African American studies are not part of DEI if taught as part of a total history package, providing facts on both sides, but struggled to define what both sides of Black history would entail. She also appeared unfamiliar with the Tulsa race massacre and Ruby Bridges' experiences, leading to criticism from Democratic representatives regarding her knowledge and understanding of critical historical events.</p>

Reddit's chief legal officer stated that AI companies should not be allowed to scrape information without clear limitations on data usage. Anthropic disagrees with the claims and intends to vigorously defend itself, while Reddit has previously entered into licensing agreements with other AI companies like Google and OpenAI for similar data usage.</p>

          <p>Candidates closely linked to Mexicoâ€™s ruling Morena party have secured all positions on the newly transformed Supreme Court, signaling a radical shift in the country's balance of power. The incoming justices, including a new chief justice of Indigenous origin, have strong ties to President Claudia Sheinbaum. Independent observers have criticized the election process, claiming it represents a triumph of politics over justice and a potentially fatal blow to the separation of powers. Critics also point out the scant voter turnout and what they see as multiple irregularities in the vote.</p>

          <p>Cuban students are protesting recent internet data rate hikes, arguing that the discounted access offered by state-run telecommunications firm Etecsa is insufficient. Students at the University of Havana have called for class boycotts in response to the price increases, which have sparked widespread rebuke across the island. The situation remains tense despite some concessions, with students demanding a complete rollback of the price hikes to ensure affordable access to online information. Etecsa capped subsidized mobile data plans at six gigabytes, while additional data costs significantly more than the monthly minimum wage.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed a novel solution to President Trump's efforts to neutralize federal civil service protections. Trump has effectively stripped civil servants of protections against political firings by undermining the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the special counsel's office. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole and safeguard civil service protections.</p>
