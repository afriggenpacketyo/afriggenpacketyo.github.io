          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for Donald Trump, to a lifetime appointment on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a narrow 50-49 vote. The confirmation proceeded despite significant controversy and protests from Democrats over multiple whistleblower allegations of misconduct against Bove during his time at the Justice Department. These allegations included claims that he suggested ignoring court orders and engaged in politically motivated firings of employees perceived as disloyal to the former president. Supporters praised his legal background, while opponents raised serious concerns about his fitness for the federal bench.</p>

          <p>Singapore's central bank has opted to keep its monetary policy unchanged, citing projections for an economic slowdown in the latter half of 2025 after a strong start to the year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore expressed concerns about global trade uncertainties, particularly potential U.S. tariffs, which could negatively impact the nation's heavily export-reliant economy. While second-quarter GDP growth exceeded expectations, officials warned that financial volatility and geopolitical issues pose significant risks to future growth. The central bank stated it is in an appropriate position to respond to emerging risks to price stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude-8.7 earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka peninsula, prompting tsunami warnings for coastal areas in Russia and Japan, with a lower-level watch issued for Hawaii. The quake occurred at a shallow depth, increasing the potential for significant sea level changes, with Japanese authorities warning of waves up to three meters and urging immediate evacuation from coastlines. Russian officials in Kamchatka reported the tremor was the strongest in decades, causing some building damage but no initial reports of injuries. The region is located on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by Jewish students who alleged the university permitted an antisemitic and hostile environment during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The lawsuit claimed protesters blocked Jewish students from accessing parts of campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA acknowledged it had "fallen short" and will fund Jewish community groups and antisemitism-fighting initiatives. This follows a U.S. Department of Justice finding that UCLA was deliberately indifferent to claims of hostility, violating students' civil rights.</p>

In a separate incident, two other Chinese spy ships were spotted sailing through strategic waterways near Japan and Taiwan.

          <p>A zoo in Nuremberg, Germany, has sparked public outrage and protests after it culled 12 healthy Guinea baboons, citing severe overcrowding in their enclosure. The zoo stated that the population had grown beyond its capacity, leading to increased conflict among the animals, and that efforts to re-home them or use contraception had failed. After the culling, the baboons' bodies were fed to the zoo's predators. Animal rights activists, some of whom were arrested for protesting, have condemned the action as illegal and filed a criminal complaint, arguing the zoo's irresponsible breeding policies were to blame.</p>

When a person's core body temperature exceeds 104 degrees, first responders place them in a large plastic bag filled with ice and water to rapidly cool them down en route to the hospital. This method, adapted from military protocols, can cool patients three to five times faster than traditional techniques, significantly reducing the risk of brain damage and organ failure.

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy who recently died from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, are speaking out to raise awareness of the dangers. The infection occurs when contaminated freshwater is forced up the nose, and the family emphasized that they would not have let their son swim in the lake had they known the risk. They are urging for greater public education about the amoeba, which is found in warm freshwater bodies, to prevent similar tragedies. Their goal is to ensure their son's death was not in vain by helping to protect others.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has initiated a process to draft a rule that would bar all law enforcement officers, including federal ICE agents, from concealing their identities with masks or gaiters while on duty. The move is a direct response to recent widespread immigration raids where agents were often masked and refused to identify themselves, creating fear and confusion in the community. While the county sheriff's department already has identification policies, the proposed ordinance faces a likely legal challenge from the federal government on the grounds of constitutional supremacy.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency moves to repeal its foundational "endangerment finding" for greenhouse gases, California may be uniquely positioned to lead a resistance. Experts suggest that because many of California's own robust climate and clean air regulations predate the 2009 federal finding, the state has a strong legal and historical basis to continue its policies. Some analysts even argue that by ceding federal authority to regulate these emissions, the Trump administration could unintentionally open the door for California and other states to implement even stronger state-level climate rules.</p>

Some of the public's design ideas include natural landmarks like the Sycamore Gap tree, animals such as dolphins, and cultural icons like the Angel of the North sculpture.

A new development company, Platform4, will be created to oversee the projects, which will begin in cities like Manchester and Newcastle.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are warning that air travel is becoming bumpier due to climate change, which is increasing the frequency and severity of turbulence. A warmer atmosphere intensifies thunderstorms, which create powerful up- and downdrafts, and also strengthens the jet stream, leading to more "clear-air turbulence" that is invisible to radar. One study projects a potential doubling or tripling of severe turbulence in the coming decades. While aircraft are built to withstand these forces, the trend could lead to more in-flight injuries, higher costs for airlines, and increased anxiety for passengers.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis suggests that tax cuts are losing their political potency in the United States, with recent polling showing majority opposition to the latest Republican tax-cut legislation. The shift may be driven by several factors, including heightened awareness of rising income inequality and a growing public perception that such policies primarily benefit the wealthy. Furthermore, the long-held argument that tax cuts pay for themselves through economic growth has been repeatedly disproven, leading to voter concerns over the national debt. This marks a potential departure from a four-decade political consensus. (not investment advice)</p>
