        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have reaffirmed a fragile ceasefire after several days of deadly border clashes that displaced over 260,000 people. The agreement was tested by initial reports of gunfire, but a subsequent meeting in Shanghai, brokered by China, appeared to calm tensions. Both nations expressed their commitment to the ceasefire and thanked China for its role in de-escalating the conflict. The fighting, which began after a landmine explosion, is the latest flare-up in a long-standing border dispute, with the United States and Malaysia also involved in diplomatic efforts to restore peace and stability to the region.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Far East triggered a tsunami warning for Hawaii, with the first waves arriving relatively small but coinciding with high tide. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported wave heights of up to 4.9 feet in Hilo, leading to some shoreline flooding but no substantial damage. Officials urged residents to move inland and opened shelters as a precaution, warning that the effects of the tsunami, which consists of multiple waves, could last for several hours. Authorities noted that while the initial waves appeared to have peaked, the warning would remain in effect until the threat fully subsides.</p>

          <p>Google has announced its intention to sign the European Union's voluntary code of practice for artificial intelligence, a move that Meta recently declined to make. While endorsing the guidelines to promote access to AI tools in Europe, Google also expressed concerns that the EU's AI Act could potentially slow innovation and harm the continent's competitiveness. In contrast, Meta's global affairs chief had previously criticized the code as an overreach that would "stunt" the industry. The EU's guidelines are designed to help companies comply with the landmark AI Act, focusing on transparency, safety, and security for general-purpose AI models.</p>

          <p>Colombian international winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to German champions Bayern Munich for a fee of £65.5 million. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract, ending his successful three-and-a-half-year tenure at Anfield where he won the FA Cup, EFL Cup, and the Premier League. Diaz was a key player for Liverpool, known for his dribbling ability and goal-scoring, contributing 41 goals in 148 appearances. His departure leaves a significant role to fill on Liverpool's left flank, with players like Cody Gakpo and new signings potentially stepping up next season.</p>

          <p>HSBC reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, a 29% decrease from the previous year and below analyst expectations of $6.99 billion. The shortfall was attributed to impairment charges related to a Chinese bank and lost income from divested businesses. Despite the profit miss, the bank announced a new $3 billion share buyback program. CEO Georges Elhedery highlighted "structural challenges" like trade tariffs and fiscal vulnerabilities creating market uncertainty, but stated the bank is well-positioned to manage the volatility, though future profitability targets could be impacted.

          <p>An essay explores the public mockery directed at New York Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns, whose on-court expressions and mannerisms have been labeled "zesty" and queer-coded online. The article connects this phenomenon to broader societal pressures on men, particularly men of color, to suppress joy and conform to rigid standards of masculinity. It argues that this scrutiny occurs despite Towns' career-best season and his public relationship with Jordyn Woods. The author reflects on how figures like Towns, who refuse to contort themselves into a humorless frame, challenge cultural norms and become targets in debates over gender expression.</p>

This figure places inflation near the bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%-3% target range, strengthening the case for an interest rate cut. The slowdown was driven by a fall in transport costs, which offset price rises in housing and food. While the RBA has held its policy rate steady to confirm the downward trend, analysts now widely expect a 25-basis-point cut at the upcoming August meeting to support a softening economy.

In June, seven out of ten immigrants arrested had no prior criminal convictions, a sharp increase from previous months. This trend suggests that the focus has shifted from violent criminals to include ordinary workers, such as textile employees and car wash staff. Critics and immigration advocates argue this strategy misleads the public and is driven by aggressive arrest quotas rather than a genuine focus on public safety.</p>

However, the article argues that the index is not an accurate barometer of the UK's domestic economy. This is because its constituent companies, such as miners and international banks, derive the vast majority of their earnings overseas. The Footsie's success has been driven by its defensive and cyclical stocks, a weaker pound, and global factors, rather than the health of corporate Britain, which was more accurately reflected in the index's composition decades ago.

          <p>A major 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered extensive tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, Alaska, and the entire U.S. West Coast. Japan also issued alerts, with small initial waves reaching its northern coast. In Hawaii, officials warned of potentially damaging waves up to six feet high, prompting an emergency proclamation and evacuations from coastal areas. The quake is one of the strongest recorded globally in recent years, leading authorities across the Pacific basin, including in New Zealand, to issue urgent warnings for residents to stay away from shorelines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Emil Bove, a former lawyer for Donald Trump, to a lifetime appointment on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a narrow 50-49 vote. The confirmation proceeded despite strong opposition from Democrats and whistleblower complaints regarding Bove's conduct at the Justice Department. Opponents cited his role in defending Trump, his efforts to investigate officials involved in the January 6th prosecutions, and allegations that he suggested ignoring judicial orders. Republicans largely dismissed the complaints, securing another judicial appointment for the Trump administration on a key appellate court.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6 million settlement with Jewish students who sued the university, arguing their civil rights were violated when pro-Palestinian protests blocked their access to campus facilities in 2024. This settlement follows a judge's preliminary injunction against the university and a finding by the U.S. Department of Justice that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" in creating a hostile environment. As part of the agreement, UCLA has committed to ensuring equal campus access for all students and will implement new systemwide guidelines on protests to foster a safer, more inclusive environment.</p>

          <p>A new documentary suggests that missing pages from an autobiography written by Moors murderer Ian Brady may contain crucial clues about the burial site of his final victim, 12-year-old Keith Bennett. The last 200 pages of the manuscript, titled "Black Light," are believed to be with Brady's former solicitor but have not been made public. Bennett's brother is calling for the material to be released to police, hoping it could provide vital information for the long-unsolved case. The documentary also reveals newly rediscovered defense files and photos that raise fresh questions about the original search for the victims.</p>

          <p>A coalition of global civil society organizations has placed the United States on a watchlist over concerns about the deteriorating health of its civic freedoms under the Trump administration. The report, released by the non-profit Civicus, cites the deployment of military forces to quell protests, growing restrictions on journalists, and the aggressive targeting of anti-war advocates. The U.S. civic space has been rated as "narrowed," indicating that while rights are generally permitted, violations and harassment of critics occur. The group warned that these actions set a dangerous precedent and represent a significant slide towards authoritarianism.</p>
