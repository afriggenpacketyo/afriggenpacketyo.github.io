          <p>The City Parks Foundation canceled R&B singer Kehlani's scheduled SummerStage concert in Central Park after concerns raised by Mayor Eric Adams' administration due to the singer's pro-Palestinian stance and potential security risks. First Deputy Mayor Randy M. Mastro cited the controversy surrounding a previous canceled Cornell University performance, where officials explicitly mentioned Kehlani's anti-Israel views, as well as the security demands of the Central Park event. The foundation emphasized the importance of safety and security for guests and artists, while PEN America criticized the cancellation as a "cowardly" act. Kehlani, an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in the Gaza conflict, responded unfazed on social media, focusing on their upcoming album and Los Angeles performance.</p>

          <p>Michael Rogers, the FDA's top official overseeing drug and food safety inspections, abruptly retired after three decades with the agency, reportedly due to frustration with new FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary's policies. Rogers' tenure included overseeing food inspections during the infant formula crisis in 2022 and the subsequent reorganization of the FDA's inspections office in 2024. Makary's plans to expand foreign surprise inspections while cutting trip lengths and reducing staff have raised concerns among officials about the potential impact on oversight quality and employee morale. Officials warned that these changes could lead to increased flight costs, perpetual jet lag for inspectors, and ultimately, compromised oversight.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris attended the 2025 Met Gala, marking her first public appearance since her 2024 presidential defeat, where she emphasized the intertwining of art and politics. Harris, wearing an Off-White gown designed by IB Kamara, highlighted art's power to capture the mood and language of people, influencing culture, policies, and politics. She recently delivered a major speech in San Francisco, criticizing President Trump's economic agenda and suggesting she is considering a political comeback, potentially as California's governor in 2026 or a presidential candidate in 2028. Sources indicate she is weighing a gubernatorial bid, a third presidential run, or not seeking elected office.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is facing significant delays and cancellations due to air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction. The FAA has issued ground delays and stops, with some arriving flights delayed up to six hours. A shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia TRACON facility, which oversees Newark's airspace, is a major contributing factor. Equipment outages and staff trauma leave have exacerbated the problems, leading United Airlines to cancel 35 daily flights from Newark. Lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA and the ongoing issues, while the Transportation Secretary plans to release details of a new plan to revamp the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested steep tariffs on movies produced overseas. Newsom aims to partner with the Trump administration to strengthen domestic production, building on California's existing state program. This proposal comes in response to Trump's call for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the United States, which caused confusion and concern in Hollywood. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal, aiming to re-shore American jobs in the industry.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has begun terminating grants to arts organizations following President Trump's proposed budget, which calls for the agency's shutdown. The NEA, a major funder of arts and arts education, is reportedly withdrawing federal funding from various organizations, citing updated grant policies and priorities. The NEA aims to focus funding on projects that align with the President's vision, including initiatives supporting HBCUs, Hispanic Serving Institutions, American independence celebrations, AI competency, houses of worship, disaster recovery, skilled trade jobs, military and veterans, Tribal communities, D.C. safety and beauty, and Asian American economic development.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas, known as Starbase, is progressing toward becoming an official city. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by local voters, primarily SpaceX employees. This move has drawn both support and criticism, with concerns raised about Musk's potential control over the area and the authority to close a nearby beach and state park for launches. SpaceX aims to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 annually, and the creation of a company town has prompted debates about balancing economic development with public access and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contested State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts to throw out thousands of votes. The ruling favored Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, confirming her victory by 734 votes over Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin. The judge determined that failing to count the challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of the voters. Griffin has been given seven days to appeal the ruling, which could potentially end a nearly six-month-long election dispute.</p>
