          <p>Ahead of Japan's House of Councillors election, the main opposition party proposed a one-year elimination of the consumption tax on food items.  This move aims to address rising inflation and the potential economic impact of higher US tariffs.  The proposal includes plans to find alternative revenue sources and potentially extend the tax cut based on economic conditions.  Prime Minister Ishiba has so far rejected altering the consumption tax rate.</p>
