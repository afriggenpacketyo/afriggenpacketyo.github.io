          <p>Three Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies were killed when a grenade they had recovered unexpectedly detonated at a training facility. Officials confirmed the explosive was one of two taken from a Santa Monica garage, with the deputies believing they were inert. A major search is now underway for the second grenade, which authorities believe also reached the facility but remains unaccounted for. The department has altered its policies to treat all recovered devices as live and has temporarily suspended its bomb squad operations, relying on LAPD for assistance.</p>

          <p>Despite Tesla's plans to expand its robotaxi service, California regulators have clarified that the company is not authorized to operate autonomous passenger vehicles on public roads. According to the California Public Utilities Commission, Tesla's current permit only allows for a private car service with human drivers, similar to a traditional limousine or taxi company. The company can test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver present but cannot charge fees for such rides. This regulatory stance complicates Tesla's ambitions for a fully autonomous ride-hailing network in the state.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a dramatic plunge shortly after takeoff to avoid a potential collision with a private jet. The maneuver, triggered by onboard traffic alerts, caused two flight attendants to sustain injuries and startled passengers, who described the experience as terrifying. The flight landed safely in Las Vegas, and the Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into the near-miss incident. This event marks at least the second near-collision in U.S. airspace within a week, raising concerns about aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly condemned Major League Soccer's decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was enforced because the players missed the MLS All-Star game, a penalty stipulated by league rules for unexcused absences. Mas labeled the punishment as "draconian," arguing that the club made the decision for the players to rest and questioning the logic of the rule. MLS Commissioner Don Garber defended the enforcement of the long-standing policy but acknowledged that the league would reevaluate it in the future.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has surrendered to a federal prison in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. The disgraced Republican was convicted for fabricating his background to defraud donors and misusing campaign funds for personal luxury expenses, including Botox and items from Hermès. Federal prosecutors stated he "made a mockery of our election system" to enrich himself. Following his sentencing, Santos appealed to former President Trump for a future pardon, though the White House has not commented on any potential clemency request.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a key hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. The conflict began when Rebecca Dowdeswell attempted to re-register the trademark for her salon, "nkd," a name she has used for 15 years. L'Oréal objected, claiming it would cause consumer confusion with its "Naked" line of products under the Urban Decay brand. Despite having spent over £30,000 in legal fees, Dowdeswell remains determined to fight the opposition, stating there has been no evidence of confusion during her years of operation.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found that at least 245 18-year-old soldiers have been killed in Russia's war in Ukraine, despite official promises not to send young conscripts to the front lines.

Attracted by significant cash bonuses and patriotic propaganda in schools, these young men are enlisting voluntarily. The report highlights how Russia's education system prepares students for military service, with recruiters actively visiting schools to enlist recent graduates for the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing a significant boom in insects like ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, has contributed to this surge, while the warm, dry conditions have been ideal for butterflies. However, experts express concern that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian populations next year by drying up wetland breeding grounds. This year's bumper season for some species contrasts with the longer-term trend of declining flying insect populations in the UK.</p>

          <p>An Illinois federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The suit, filed in February, argued that the city's policies unlawfully hindered federal immigration enforcement by limiting cooperation between local police and federal agents. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins sided with the city, affirming its right to establish such policies. Chicago's mayor, Brandon Johnson, praised the decision, stating that the city is safer when its police force can focus on local needs rather than being compelled to participate in a "reckless and inhumane immigration agenda."</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been reduced by half in the last five years due to disease. The disease was spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a rescue effort, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd. After veterinary checks, the animals were relocated over 200 miles to an isolated, disease-free mountain range. Recent observations have confirmed the success of the mission, with sightings of healthy sheep and newborn lambs, signaling new hope for the native species.</p>

          <p>Gregg Wallace, the recently dismissed host of MasterChef, has issued an apology to anyone he may have offended but has denied the most serious allegations against him. Following an investigation that upheld 45 claims about his behavior, Wallace stated, "I'm not a groper, a sex pest or a flasher." He acknowledged that his humor, which he attributed to his background, may have been inappropriate but insisted that incidents were not malicious. Wallace also defended his former co-host, John Torode, who was also fired over a racism claim, stating Torode is "not a racist."</p>

          <h2>Nutritional Value of Aid Boxes in Gaza Raises Concerns Among Experts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Gaza faces a starvation crisis, aid experts are raising concerns about the nutritional content of food boxes distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). An analysis of the GHF's provided list shows the boxes primarily contain dried goods like pasta and lentils, which require scarce water and fuel to prepare. While providing sufficient calories for survival, experts say the diet is critically deficient in essential vitamins and minerals, which could lead to "hidden hunger" and diseases like scurvy and anemia. The aid also lacks suitable foods for young children, a key vulnerability in a population facing widespread malnutrition.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions to pay down the national debt via the mobile payment app Venmo. The long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program has been updated to include the popular, youth-friendly platform alongside more traditional methods like PayPal and credit cards. With the national debt currently exceeding $36 trillion, the initiative offers a direct, albeit small-scale, way for citizens to contribute. Since 1996, Americans have voluntarily donated over $67 million, a figure that highlights patriotic generosity but barely makes a dent in the nation's massive financial obligations.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common criticism, some sociologists and psychologists argue that reality television has had a positive impact on society over the past 25 years. The genre has often featured more demographic diversity than other media, exposing viewers to different lifestyles and perspectives, which can foster greater social understanding. Shows have sparked national conversations on complex topics like coercive control, racism, and disability awareness, as seen with Pete Bennett's appearance on Big Brother. While the welfare of contestants remains a serious concern, the article suggests that by reflecting and sometimes shaping social norms, reality TV can serve as a valuable tool for public discourse.</p>

The trip mixes official business with personal interests, as Trump is scheduled to meet with UK and EU leaders while also attending the opening of a new golf course at one of his resorts.

The Texas legislators traveled to Sacramento to discuss their state's special session, called by the governor at President Trump's urging, which aims to gerrymander districts to favor the GOP in the 2026 midterms. Newsom has threatened to counter this by pushing for California to redraw its own maps to benefit Democrats, a move that would upend the state's nonpartisan redistricting process.

          <p>A global craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing significant supply shortages and driving up prices. Fueled by social media trends and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, demand for the tea has skyrocketed, with some cafes reporting that a month's supply now lasts only a few days. The surge in demand is compounded by poor harvests in Japan due to record heatwaves and a shortage of farmers. This has led retailers to limit purchases and has pushed prices up by around 30% this year, impacting both consumers and businesses that rely on the popular ingredient.</p>

          <p>An expert from Refugees International warns that Gaza is on the brink of a mass starvation crisis that will be difficult to reverse once it begins. After more than 21 months of war and restricted aid, the Palestinian population is extremely vulnerable, and a complete blockade imposed since March has exhausted all remaining coping mechanisms. The limited aid provided by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is described as insufficient and dangerous to access. The expert argues that a famine will lead to widespread death not just from hunger, but from preventable diseases that weakened bodies cannot fight, stressing the urgent need for large-scale, professional humanitarian intervention.</p>

The move triggered widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback from lawmakers, including 10 Republican senators who urged the administration to release the critical funding.
