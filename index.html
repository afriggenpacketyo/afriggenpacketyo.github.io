          <p>President Trump is actively seeking a nuclear deal with Iran, despite resistance from U.S. conservatives who demand the dismantling of Iran's nuclear program. Trump aims to secure a deal to enhance regional safety, aligning with Gulf Arab states' desires for a negotiated settlement. However, significant disagreements remain regarding uranium enrichment, with Iran insisting on its right to civilian enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Steve Witkoff is leading the American negotiating efforts, exploring creative solutions to bridge the gaps between both sides' demands. The article highlights potential compromises, such as phased sanctions relief and long-term enrichment freezes, to achieve a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>
