          <p>The UN has sounded an alarm over an "unprecedented" hunger crisis in northern Nigeria, where millions, including a large number of children, face acute malnutrition. Protracted insecurity from armed groups like Boko Haram and bandits has displaced farmers and disrupted agriculture, crippling the region's ability to produce food. Despite being the nation's traditional breadbasket, systemic governance failures, violence, and dwindling international aid have exacerbated the situation, leading to soaring food prices and a dire humanitarian emergency.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant offer for RB Leipzig's 22-year-old striker, Benjamin Sesko, with a total package valued at approximately £74 million. The bid includes a substantial guaranteed payment, signaling the club's serious intent to acquire the Slovenian international. The article notes that Newcastle is also interested in the player, but Manchester United believes their valuation is appropriate and that Sesko is keen on a move to Old Trafford, potentially making way by allowing Rasmus Hojlund to leave.</p>

          <p>Senator Tammy Duckworth is pressing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for answers regarding the safety and realism of its 90-second aircraft evacuation standard. Citing recent incidents where evacuations took significantly longer and passengers retrieved carry-on bags, she questions if current rules reflect real-world emergencies. Duckworth's letter to the new FAA administrator seeks data on recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated tests to ensure standards are adequate for all passengers, including those with disabilities.</p>

Governor Greg Abbott has ordered state troopers to locate and return the absent Democrats to the chamber to establish a quorum. The proposed electoral map would significantly favor Republicans in future congressional elections, prompting Democrats to stay in Illinois until the special legislative session ends, despite facing daily fines and threats of bribery charges.</p>

China sees the forum as a means to stabilize its continental flank, particularly its tense border with India, while India navigates a cautious path to maintain its strategic autonomy while engaging with the other two powers.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new car sales experienced a significant downturn in July in both the U.K. and Germany, with declines of nearly 60% and 55% respectively compared to the previous year. This extends a period of struggle for the U.S. automaker in Europe, where it faces stiff competition from Chinese EV manufacturers. In stark contrast, Chinese competitor BYD saw its sales skyrocket in both markets, highlighting a shifting landscape for electric vehicles and continued challenges for Tesla amid tariff costs and reputational issues.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed mathematician Terence Tao has revealed that his lab at UCLA is struggling to support graduate students and research due to delays and cuts in federal funding under the Trump administration. The disruption to his National Science Foundation (NSF) grant has left him with minimal resources, highlighting a broader issue affecting top universities across the United States. This situation contrasts sharply with China's efforts to attract global scientific talent, raising concerns about the long-term competitiveness of U.S. research and innovation.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a late-summer rise in COVID-19 infections, indicated by wastewater data and emergency room visits, as the Trump administration plans to restrict fall booster vaccine eligibility. Experts express concern that limiting updated shots to older and high-risk groups, instead of the broader population, could weaken collective immunity and lead to more severe future waves. While current variants have immune-evading properties, existing vaccines and antivirals like Paxlovid remain effective tools for mitigating severe disease.</p>

His attorneys argue the device could activate during the lethal injection, potentially causing unnecessary pain and prolonging the execution in a torturous manner. Although a lower court initially agreed to require the device's deactivation, the state's supreme court overturned the order, leaving uncertainty about the procedure as the execution, the state's second since 2020, approaches.</p>

          <p>On its 100th anniversary, Virginia Woolf's novel "Mrs. Dalloway" is examined as an enduring exploration of the midlife crisis, a theme Woolf herself was contemplating at age 40. The protagonist, Clarissa Dalloway, navigates a single day in London while grappling with her past choices, her present identity, and the formlessness of being "over fifty." Through its stream-of-consciousness style, the novel intertwines past and present, capturing the existential fears and profound realizations that define this transformative stage of life, ultimately finding joy in the present moment.</p>

          <p>The recent shutdown of the U.S.-funded Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program has created a critical void in global health data, halting nearly 40 years of standardized information collection from over 90 countries.

While philanthropic organizations are providing emergency stopgap funding to rescue some surveys, the global health community faces the long-term challenge of building a new, sustainable, and country-led system for this crucial data.</p>

Body camera footage captured Hollman saying "I can't breathe" before becoming unresponsive, but the officer's attorney argued his actions did not cause the death, which was attributed to medical complications and resistance.</p>

The proposal comes after ceasefire talks with Hamas broke down and would be condemned by many of Israel's allies, who are pushing for a diplomatic resolution and humanitarian relief for Gaza's displaced population.</p>
