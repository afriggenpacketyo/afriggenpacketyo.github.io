        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals a surprising trend in New York City's real estate market, where over one-third of Manhattan condos sold between July 2024 and June 2025 were at a nominal loss. This "lost decade" for Manhattan condo prices contrasts sharply with national home price increases, with factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration cited as potential causes. The analysis suggests that when accounting for inflation and transaction costs, the actual losses for sellers are even more significant, though the luxury market of properties over $10 million has remained profitable. This article highlights the unique stability and sideways movement of the market, diverging from broader national trends. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that a new Los Angeles art exhibit, titled 'Monuments,' represents a barbaric desecration rather than a respectful historical debate on Confederate statues. The author contends that the show, which displays removed statues covered in graffiti or physically altered, is a form of "carnivalesque retribution" aimed at mocking those who believe in preserving historical monuments. The piece draws a parallel to the Nazi's 1937 Degenerate Art Exhibit, characterizing the L.A. show as a mean-spirited act of ritual humiliation. The author concludes by framing the issue as a fight between those who want to celebrate history and those who seek to desecrate it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly has decisively won Ireland's presidential election with over 64% of the vote, defeating the governing coalition's candidates. A 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway, Connolly ran on a platform of peace and neutrality and was backed by several left-wing parties, including Sinn Fein. Her campaign was noted for its strong criticism of EU military spending and the roles of the US, UK, and France in the Gaza war, positioning her at odds with the current center-right government. The election saw a low turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, which analysts interpret as a sign of widespread voter dissatisfaction with all major political parties over issues like immigration and housing.</p>

          <p>In-person early voting has begun for two significant off-year elections: the New York City mayor's race and the New Jersey gubernatorial contest. New Yorkers are choosing between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo, in a race highlighting deep divisions within the Democratic party. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli faces Democrat Mikie Sherrill to succeed the term-limited incumbent. These elections are viewed as potential bellwethers for national political trends, focusing on issues like affordability, cost of living, and the ideological direction of the Democratic party ahead of future national contests.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan, signaling his deep and direct involvement in shaping national policy. According to state media, Xi played a "decisive role" and poured significant effort into the document's formulation, which was informed by his extensive inspection tours across China throughout the year. The framework underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee before being presented to the Central Committee for deliberation. This hands-on approach underscores Xi's consolidation of power and his personal imprint on China's long-term strategic and economic direction.</p>

She also used the interview to criticize former rival Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the justice system and shown himself unable to endure criticism.

Although Powell's win was not a landslide, it places her in a senior, directly elected role within the party.

A significant factor is Berkshire's decision to sell off a large portion of its Apple stock, reducing its stake by 69% since late 2023. This move has resulted in approximately $50 billion in potential profits being left "on the table" as Apple's stock price has soared to new record highs.

          <p>The NHS is urging parents in England to get their children vaccinated against influenza during the half-term break due to an early and rising number of flu cases, particularly among children. Health officials warn that the virus can spread rapidly in schools and cause serious illness, emphasizing that vaccination is the most effective protection. Most children are offered a nasal spray vaccine, which is available through schools, GP surgeries, and pharmacies. The campaign aims to increase vaccination rates to mitigate the impact of the flu season, which officials believe has not yet reached its peak.</p>

          <h2>Olympian Abby Wambach Advises Parents to Skip Kids' Sports Practices to Foster Internal Motivation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices, suggesting it helps kids become more resilient and internally motivated. In a recent interview, the former soccer star argued that a parent's presence can cause children to "outsource their motivation," making them either nervous or overly focused on impressing. By allowing children to play without parental supervision, they are more free to take risks, make mistakes, and develop self-starting qualities. Wambach also recommended that during games, parents should de-emphasize winning and instead praise acts of leadership and good sportsmanship.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks have resulted in at least four deaths and twenty injuries across Ukraine, with significant damage reported in Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukrainian officials stated that air defense systems intercepted a majority of the incoming threats, including 50 of 62 drones and four of nine missiles. Following the assault, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy renewed his urgent appeal for more Western air defense systems, specifically U.S. Patriots, to protect Ukrainian cities from such attacks. The strikes occurred as Zelenskyy was engaging with European leaders to secure further military aid and bolster pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques President Trump's recent decision to demolish the 123-year-old East Wing of the White House to build a new, $300 million ballroom. The author argues that the move, carried out without submitted plans or public input, is an example of the president acting on personal whim, regardless of historical preservation, norms, or laws. The project is being funded by Trump and corporate donors, which the author suggests would be viewed as corruption in other countries. The column posits that the demolition is not just about ego but may also signal Trump's intentions to remain in power beyond constitutional term limits, reflecting a broader pattern of testing institutional checks and balances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a significant, 80% decline in the number of active serial killers in the U.S. since the 1970s, public fascination with them remains high, fueled by true-crime entertainment and social media speculation. This article explores this paradox, noting recent unsubstantiated rumors of serial killers in cities like Austin and Boston. Experts attribute the decline in serial killings to factors like the disappearance of hitchhiking culture, the advent of cell phones, advances in DNA technology, and increased law enforcement cooperation. However, the societal need for "monsters" to define moral boundaries persists, ensuring that the figure of the serial killer continues to captivate the public imagination, even as the threat itself has waned.</p>

          <p>Over 170 years after the original Gold Rush, Californians are once again finding gold in the state's rivers, with some prospectors earning significant income from their finds. One man, Manny Goza, reported paying off his house with gold he panned from the Bear River. This renewed interest is fueled by low water levels and a more than 50% increase in gold prices over the past year, prompting financial experts like Ray Dalio and Jeffrey Gundlach to recommend gold as a portfolio diversifier. For those not inclined to pan for gold themselves, the article suggests alternative investment avenues such as gold IRAs and real estate crowdfunding platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant disconnect is emerging in the U.S. economy, where massive spending on artificial intelligence by tech giants is boosting GDP growth, while many other sectors struggle. Companies like Nvidia and Alphabet are driving stock market highs, but small businesses in retail, construction, and hospitality are grappling with higher costs from tariffs and reduced consumer spending. This economic duality is reflected in market performance, with a few AI-linked tech stocks responsible for the S&P 500's gains, while consumer-focused sectors lag. The article highlights that for many businesses, the AI boom is a distant headline as they focus on managing costs and navigating a challenging economic landscape.</p>

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confiscated tens of thousands of empty pens, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide pens.

Fluor's 39% holding in the small modular nuclear reactor company represents over 60% of its market capitalization, yet its core business is valued at a steep discount compared to its peers. Starboard is pushing for a separation of the NuScale asset, suggesting options like a tax-free spinoff or an open-market sale, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback. This move could significantly rerate Fluor's stock, with Starboard's analysis suggesting a potential upside of over 200%. (not investment advice)</p>
