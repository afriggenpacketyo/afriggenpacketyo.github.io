        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of Modelo beer, reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that fell short of analyst expectations. The company attributed the weaker performance to the financial impact of U.S. tariffs on aluminum, which increased its production costs. Despite the quarterly miss, Constellation expressed confidence by reiterating its full-year financial forecast for fiscal 2026. The news caused the company's shares to dip slightly in extended trading, continuing a downward trend for the year fueled by concerns over trade duties.</p>

Citing unpersuadable opinions on the racketeering count, the judge, with consent from both legal teams, declined to accept the partial verdict.

          <p>In a Fox News opinion article, legal analyst Jonathan Turley argues that New York City Democratic mayoral primary winner Zohran Mamdani shows signs of being a 'hardcore Marxist.' The piece disputes a PolitiFact rating that called such claims false, citing a speech where Mamdani mentioned the 'end goal of seizing the means of production' as a core belief. Turley suggests that while the label 'communist' might be debatable, Mamdani's stated opposition to capitalism and his political rhetoric point toward a Marxist ideology that should concern New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed the Republican-led tax and spending package, known as the 'big, beautiful bill,' by a slim 51-50 margin, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. The legislation, a key priority for President Trump, extends tax cuts, increases spending on defense and border security, and is partially offset by cuts to social programs. Three Republican senatorsâ€”Susan Collins, Rand Paul, and Thom Tillisâ€”voted against the measure, which the CBO estimates will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The British government successfully passed its welfare benefits bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to quell a rebellion within the Labour party. Fearing a defeat, ministers agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) until after a review, effectively gutting one of the bill's core measures. This U-turn has been described as a 'shambles' by some MPs and undermines the authority of party leadership. The changes also create a multi-billion-pound hole in the chancellor's spending plans, raising questions about future tax increases.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant jump after a punitive tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the final Senate version of the GOP's major spending bill. The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China and could have cost the industry $7 billion. While the removal was a relief for the sector, industry groups noted the bill is still harmful overall, as it accelerates the phase-out of crucial investment and production tax credits that have supported the growth of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has dismissed its case against Navy Federal Credit Union, relieving the institution of a prior order to refund $80 million to military service members and pay a $15 million fine.

This move is the latest in a series of actions by the Trump-appointed leadership of the CFPB to withdraw or end enforcement actions that were initiated under the previous administration, raising concerns among consumer advocates about the agency's direction.</p>

According to the Congressional Budget Office, these changes could cause nearly 12 million people to lose their health insurance over the next decade. The cuts stem primarily from a new national work requirement for beneficiaries and restrictions on how states can fund their share of the program. Health care advocates warn that this loss of funding will not only impact individuals but also threaten the financial viability of many rural hospitals.</p>

          <p>A beachgoer in Walton County, Florida, discovered a large package containing nearly $500,000 worth of cocaine that had washed ashore. The 25 kilos of narcotics were wrapped in distinctive packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The local sheriff's office confiscated the drugs and reminded the public not to touch such packages, as their contents can be harmful. The discovery is part of a recurring trend in Florida, where large quantities of illicit drugs frequently wash up along the state's extensive coastline.</p>

          <p>British number one Jack Draper has advanced to the second round of Wimbledon after his opponent, Sebastian Baez, retired from their match due to an injury. Draper was in firm control, leading 6-2 6-2 2-1, when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could no longer continue after slipping on the baseline. The commanding performance marks a positive start for Draper, who is seen as the host nation's best hope for success following the recent retirement of three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray. He will face former runner-up Marin Cilic next.</p>
