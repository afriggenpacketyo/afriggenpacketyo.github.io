          <p>Advanced Micro Devices reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with earnings per share falling short of analyst predictions even as overall revenue surpassed estimates. The company's stock declined following the announcement. AMD provided a positive sales forecast for the current quarter, driven by strong demand for its AI and gaming chips. However, the company is navigating challenges from U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips to China, which impacted its revenue and gross margin. The report also highlighted significant growth in its Client and Gaming segment, boosted by its latest Ryzen desktop processors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has canceled approximately $500 million in funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects. The terminated projects included research on COVID-19, influenza, and a bird flu vaccine from companies like Pfizer and Moderna. Kennedy stated that the department determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a claim that has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts. Critics argue the decision is not based on scientific evidence and could leave the nation more vulnerable to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling follows a lawsuit from 20 states arguing that the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated that redirecting the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters like flooding. The BRIC program was designed to fund local infrastructure projects to protect against natural hazards, and its termination has been contested by state officials.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer Rory McIlroy has opted to miss the FedEx St. Jude Championship, the first event of the PGA Tour's postseason playoffs. His absence has raised concerns among tour organizers, with one official expressing he was "very concerned" by the decision. Due to their high point totals, McIlroy and top-seeded Scottie Scheffler are already mathematically secure for later playoff rounds, regardless of their participation in the initial event. The situation has prompted discussions about potential rule changes to ensure top players compete in all playoff tournaments, though some peers believe it will not become a widespread trend.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court to remove Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office. Abbott accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout where dozens of Democrats fled the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led redistricting plan. The governor claims their absence constitutes an abandonment of their duties, while Wu defends the action as a fulfillment of his oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map." This legal maneuver escalates the political standoff over the redrawing of congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced a partnership with Indiana's prison system to add 1,000 detention beds at the Miami correctional facility. The move is part of a broader expansion of immigration detention funded by a significant increase in ICE's budget under the Trump administration. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem dubbed the facility the "Speedway Slammer," stating it would house the "worst of the worst," a claim that has drawn skepticism. Civil rights groups have previously raised alarms about inhumane conditions at the maximum-security prison, which will now be used to hold immigration detainees.</p>

          <p>A major copper mining project in Afghanistan's Logar province, backed by China's state-owned Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC), is reportedly making substantial progress toward beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was awarded to MCC in 2008 but has faced significant delays. Challenges have included security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological relics, and unexploded landmines. The Taliban government has since approved a switch to underground mining, a more expensive method intended to better preserve the historical artifacts at the site.</p>

The court found that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws that protect migrants from being returned to places where they face persecution or torture. This decision effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, undoing a key policy of the second Trump administration that had been credited with a sharp drop in illegal border crossings.

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has begun rolling out its "Families on the Fly" program, which introduces dedicated security screening lanes for travelers with children at select U.S. airports. John Wayne Airport in Orange County is among the first to implement the new system, which is designed to provide a less stressful experience for families. These lanes, which do not require TSA PreCheck, often have shorter wait times and allow parents to navigate the screening process without feeling rushed by other passengers. The program is part of a broader effort to improve the airport experience for families.</p>

          <p>A new study based on two decades of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park reveals the significant importance of female relationships in gorilla society. The research shows that when a female mountain gorilla moves to a new group, she will preferentially seek out and join another female she already knows, even if they have been separated for many years. This behavior highlights that these same-sex social bonds are a key factor in their dispersal decisions, alongside avoiding inbreeding. The findings provide new insights into the evolutionary roots of social movement and reframe the understanding of female-female relationships among great apes.</p>

It also discusses the difficulty of communicating vast amounts of data and uncertainty in a concise format for television or apps. The piece looks toward the future, where artificial intelligence and a focus on "impact-based" forecasting may provide more detailed and useful predictions for the public.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they were "irresponsible" for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog stated that in one image, styling and shadows made a model look "gaunt," while another's pose emphasized her "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, reflecting ongoing scrutiny of body image representation in the fashion industry.</p>

          <p>One of the UK's largest debt advisory services, Money Wellness, is urging the government to establish a statutory school clothing grant for low-income families in England. Unlike Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, where support is standardized, only about one-fifth of English councils offer dedicated uniform grants, creating a "postcode lottery." With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary school children, many families face significant financial strain. The call for consistent national support aims to ensure no child is disadvantaged based on where they live, especially as household bills continue to rise.</p>

Niesr recommends a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes" to create a financial buffer and reassure investors.
