        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data reveals that U.S. inflation held steady at an annual rate of 2.6% in July, with core inflation slightly increasing to 2.9%. Despite this persistence, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, although many Americans are becoming more cautious with discretionary purchases due to rising costs for essentials. While the impact of recent tariffs on prices appears minimal so far, analysts expect them to contribute to future inflation. The report is widely interpreted as keeping the Federal Reserve on track to potentially lower interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal court hearing concluded without a ruling on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's request for a temporary restraining order against President Trump's attempt to fire her. Cook's lawsuit challenges the legality of her removal, which Trump based on unsubstantiated mortgage fraud allegations from an ally, a move her lawyer described as a "smear campaign." The Department of Justice argued the president has discretion to determine cause for removal. The case raises significant questions about the president's power to remove a Fed governor and could ultimately set a precedent regarding the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his college class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The palladium ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector at Cedar Beach, New York. Instead of selling it for its scrap value, the finder used the engravings to track down the original owner, Al DiStefano, now 77. With the help of a fellow Fordham University alumna, the ring was successfully returned, serving as a heartwarming story of honesty and connection across decades.</p>

Longtime cast member Heidi Gardner is leaving after eight seasons, along with Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim. Additionally, writer Celeste Yim is also exiting the show. Producer Lorne Michaels indicated that after focusing on stability for the 50th anniversary, it was time to reinvent the show for its upcoming 51st season.

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian Authority and PLO officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was due to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and pursue legal cases against Israel, which he claims undermines peace negotiations. This move is unusual for a UN host country and comes as several allied nations, including France and the UK, plan to push for the recognition of a Palestinian state.

The unique fossil findings from Morocco challenge previous theories about ankylosaur evolution, which suggested their armor developed gradually over time.

The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order to block her dismissal while the case proceeds.

The election follows a lawsuit filed by Black residents challenging the town's history of "hand-me-down governance," where mayors appointed their successors without a vote.

Having successfully toured with a more stripped-down, originals-focused show, he is now returning to his classic format with more band members, costumes, and video screens.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to cut $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress had previously allocated, using a rarely attempted budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission." This tactic involves requesting to claw back approved funds so late in the fiscal year that they expire before Congress is required to vote on the request. The proposed cuts target programs at USAID and the State Department, including funding for international peacekeeping and democracy promotion. The move is expected to face legal challenges and has drawn bipartisan criticism for circumventing Congress's constitutional power of the purse.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Japan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for stable and amicable relations between India and China, stating that collaboration between the two Asian powers is crucial for regional and global prosperity. He emphasized that strong bilateral ties are essential for shaping a multipolar Asia and world. This statement signals a potential warming of relations with Beijing, which contrasts with India's recent efforts to position itself as a strategic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region. The comments come as New Delhi navigates its complex relationships with both Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>An immigrant father from Uganda shares his emotional experience of watching his son start kindergarten in a well-resourced public school in Maryland. He contrasts his son's modern classroom with his own first day of school in a dirt-floor "church school" in rural Uganda, highlighting the vast difference in opportunities. The author reflects on his journey to the U.S., the generosity of the American family who adopted him, and the profound gratitude he feels for being able to provide his son with an education he once only dreamed of. The experience underscores the sacrifices made and the hope for all children to have similar opportunities.</p>

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates remaining high, seniors have several alternative options to tap into their record-high home equity without altering their existing low-rate mortgages. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners 62 and older, which converts equity into payments for the senior and only requires repayment upon death or sale of the home. Other viable methods include home equity loans, which offer fixed rates that have recently declined, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide flexible borrowing with initial interest-only payments, though they typically have variable rates.

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology dropped 15% after the company's second-quarter data center revenue and its forecast for the current quarter both failed to meet analyst expectations. While overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, fueled by strong AI demand, sales in its key data center segment fell slightly short of projections. The company's third-quarter revenue guidance of $2.06 billion was also below consensus estimates. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the flat sequential forecast to the non-linear growth in its custom AI chip business, though some investors expressed concern about the lack of clarity on new customers.

He argued that such a concept is outdated and does not account for the realities of modern drone warfare, which has already created a 'dead zone' along the front lines. Zelensky asserted that any such deal would be unacceptable if it required Ukraine to cede territory.

          <p>Amid a leadership crisis at the CDC, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn widespread criticism for making several questionable health claims. Following a school shooting in Minneapolis, he suggested a link between psychiatric drugs and gun violence, and in a separate instance, claimed he could identify children with "mitochondrial challenges" just by looking at them. These remarks have been condemned by medical experts and lawmakers as unscientific. The controversy is compounded by revelations from a former CDC official that Kennedy has not been briefed by agency experts on key public health topics.</p>

While the Guard's duties have often been mundane, such as landscaping, their armed presence has chilled daily life, particularly in immigrant communities. The move is viewed by critics as a potential test case for using the military as a domestic police force, raising concerns about authoritarianism.

Rybakina broke Raducanu's serve four times and hit 23 winners in a dominant performance that lasted just 62 minutes.

The case stems from a 2019 crash in Florida where a driver using Enhanced Autopilot became distracted, causing his Model S to accelerate through an intersection and kill a 22-year-old woman. In its appeal, Tesla argues that the vehicle had no design defects and that the crash was caused entirely by the driver's recklessness.

Disagreements among scattered family members, lack of interest from younger generations, and the financial complexities of maintaining the properties are driving the sales. These legacy ranches are in high demand from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, who seek privacy, open space, and a connection to the American West.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by attempting to end the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics. The ruling provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who fled their country's political and economic crisis and were granted permission to live and work in the United States.</p>
