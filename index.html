          <p>Chinese state media suggests that upgraded versions of the YJ-21 and DF-17 hypersonic missiles may be featured in an upcoming military parade in Beijing. A key highlight could be an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which a military commentator noted could be fired from bombers outside enemy air defense zones. This development points towards a versatile family of land, sea, and air-launched hypersonic weapons, enhancing China's strategic strike capabilities, though the missile's service status remains unconfirmed.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has strongly condemned a New York Times article about Orville Etoria, a Jamaican national convicted of murder who was deported by the Trump administration. DHS labeled the article a "disgusting sob story" for a criminal, arguing it downplayed the severity of his crimes which also included armed robbery. The agency reaffirmed its commitment to deporting criminal non-citizens, highlighting a stark difference in perspective on immigration enforcement and media portrayal of deportees.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has used advanced facial recognition technology to analyze a photo of a corpse found in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011, suggesting a "high probability" that it is the revered Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr. Sadr, an influential Iranian-Lebanese leader, mysteriously disappeared during a trip to Libya in 1978, sparking decades of speculation. The analysis, which indicated the body had a damaged skull, supports the theory that he was killed, potentially on the orders of then-leader Muammar Gaddafi, potentially solving a nearly 50-year-old mystery.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights a growing intellectual trend of comparing contemporary Western nations, particularly Britain, to the Soviet Union in the 1980s. The comparison centers on a perceived political rigidity, fear of questioning outdated dogma, and a managerial class that seems to be ignoring impending necessary changes. The author argues that while the historical parallel may not be exact, the mere decline of the West could have serious global consequences, making such warnings worthy of attention.</p>

While a modernization committee is reviewing these issues and some changes have been made, Tidball emphasizes the need for Parliament to better reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities and become a more inclusive space.</p>

The couple wore custom Louis Vuitton designs for the occasion, with Moretz in a non-traditional baby blue gown and Harrison in a white dress. The wedding celebration was designed to reflect their shared interests, including activities like fishing, horseback riding, and poker. The two have been in a relationship since 2018 and announced their engagement earlier this year.</p>

          <h2>New Dating of Ancient Greek Skull Reshapes Understanding of Human Evolution</h2>

          <p>A comprehensive new study has determined that the famous Petralona cranium, a human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, is at least 286,000 years old. This precise dating, achieved using advanced uranium-series techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of conflicting estimates. The finding strengthens the theory that the skull belonged to Homo heidelbergensis, a species that likely coexisted with early Neanderthals, providing a crucial piece of the complex, branching puzzle of European human prehistory.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across large parts of the UK, potentially as far south as the Midlands. This rare opportunity is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which is causing heightened solar activity. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the phenomenon could offer a memorable display for sky-watchers, with the best viewing chances expected on Monday and Tuesday nights.</p>

          <p>The successful transfers of Alexander Isak to Liverpool and Yoane Wissa to Newcastle, both of whom refused to train to force their moves, have intensified the debate around player power in football. While some commentators have labeled the players' actions "despicable," others argue that clubs often act without loyalty and that players are simply looking after their own interests. The situation is contrasted with the case of Marc Guehi, whose professionalism was praised but whose desired move to Liverpool ultimately collapsed, raising questions about the effectiveness of different tactics.</p>

          <p>Despite setting new age-related records at the US Open, questions remain about Novak Djokovic's physical ability to endure the tournament's demands. The 38-year-old has reached the quarter-finals of all four Grand Slams this year but has been visibly hampered by various physical issues, including in his previous major tournaments. While his serving has been excellent, his path to a potential 25th Grand Slam title will depend heavily on whether his aging body can withstand the strain of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents like his next challenger, Taylor Fritz.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's repeated threats to punish Russia over its continued aggression in Ukraine, analysts believe strategic considerations are preventing stronger sanctions. One key factor is a desire to avoid pushing Russia into a deeper alliance with China, which could grant Beijing greater access to energy resources and military technology. Another is Trump's potential ambition to be seen as a peace-broker, holding back on punitive measures in the hope of bringing both sides to the negotiating table, a delay that has reportedly frustrated Ukrainian officials.</p>
