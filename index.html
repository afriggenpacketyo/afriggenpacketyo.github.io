          <p>South Sudan's Vice President Riek Machar has been formally charged with treason and crimes against humanity, following a deadly attack on a military base in Nasir in March that resulted in over 250 soldier deaths. Under house arrest since the incident, these charges further destabilize the tenuous power-sharing agreement between Machar and President Salva Kiir, a partnership established under a 2018 peace deal that was never fully implemented. This legal action reopens deep divisions within the nation, which previously experienced a five-year civil war claiming 400,000 lives. Machar's spokesman labels the charges a "political witch hunt," while the Justice Minister asserts a commitment to holding perpetrators accountable regardless of their position.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen suspected Russian drones entered Polish airspace, prompting a joint NATO interception and marking the first time NATO militaries fired shots during the Ukraine war in allied territory. Polish authorities, including Deputy Prime Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, are treating this as a deliberate provocation, not an accident, given the sheer number of incursions. Prime Minister Donald Tusk emphasized the gravity, stating it brings Poland closest to open conflict since World War II. The incident, amid a massive Russian attack on Ukraine, raises concerns about probing NATO defenses and potential spillover into a broader conflict involving human casualties. Poland has invoked NATO's Article 4 for consultations, reinforcing the serious implications of these repeated violations of sovereign airspace.</p>

          <p>A close friend and political commentator, Brilyn Hollyhand, revealed that conservative activist Charlie Kirk displayed "no fear" ahead of his assassination at Utah Valley University. Hollyhand, who communicated with Kirk shortly before the event, described him as energetic and excited about his "American Comeback Tour," despite past threats that his security team had informed him of. This article emphasizes Kirk's unwavering commitment to engaging in public debate and organizing large-scale events, showcasing his determination even in the face of potential danger. President Donald Trump later paid tribute to Kirk, declaring him a "martyr for truth and freedom" and highlighting the significant void left by his death within the conservative movement, particularly among young voters he inspired.</p>

          <p>Trump's tariffs are increasingly impacting consumer prices, with a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report showing price increases across various tariff-sensitive items like apparel, video products, motor vehicle parts, and groceries. Economists, including Luke Tilley of Wilmington Trust, note these increases, though seemingly minor individually, contribute to inflation nearing 3%, which is above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This situation presents a stagflationary challenge for the Fed, as consumers cut back spending due to higher prices, and the labor market shows fragility, with unemployment claims hitting their highest level since October 2021. The article suggests that despite claims tariffs wouldn't raise inflation, their effects are now clearly visible, potentially jeopardizing economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

While Mandelson expressed deep regret for "foolishly" relying on Epstein's assurances, opposition leaders, including Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, criticize Starmer for initially backing him and for his handling of the situation.

Menendez tearfully addressed the court, blaming her husband for putting her in an illegal position, stating she was "wrong about him."

          <p>A federal judge has declined to grant a preliminary injunction, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with cutting over $1 billion in National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants. These widespread and chaotic cuts, overseen by the "department of government efficiency" led by Elon Musk, specifically targeted grants mandated to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). A coalition of scientific organizations argued these terminations were arbitrary, capricious, and violated legal procedures and the separation of powers. This article highlights a significant blow to scientific research and DEI initiatives, with the coalition vowing to continue fighting these "unlawful" actions that they believe undermine the NSF's crucial role in American innovation and national defense.</p>

          <p>The inflation-adjusted median monthly cost of homeownership in the U.S. has risen to $2,035 in 2024, marking a nearly 4% increase from the previous year, according to new Census Bureau data. This comprehensive figure encompasses monthly mortgage and insurance payments, property taxes, utilities, and various other fees. Rising mortgage rates, increased insurance premiums, and higher homeowners association (HOA) or condo fees are identified as the primary drivers behind this significant surge. This article highlights the growing financial burden on homeowners, exacerbated by rising electricity costs driven by the expanding power requirements of artificial intelligence and data centers, making homeownership increasingly challenging beyond just the initial purchase price.

          <p>Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has lost his latest bid in a New Zealand court to avoid extradition to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload. Dotcom had sought a judicial review of an August 2024 official decision to surrender him, arguing it was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. However, Justice Christine Grice dismissed his arguments, upholding the extradition decision. This article details the ongoing 13-year legal battle, highlighting the persistent efforts by US prosecutors to bring Dotcom to trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering, and racketeering, stemming from the 2012 raid on his mansion and the shutdown of Megaupload.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the assassination of Charlie Kirk as a stark warning about escalating political violence in America. The author expresses relief at the generally non-sociopathic public reaction, contrasting it with the "glee" seen after other recent acts of violence. The piece argues that ubiquitous exposure to gruesome images can desensitize, but Kirk's high-definition murder might serve as a visceral reminder of violence's reality. It emphasizes the need for bipartisan reflection on the human cost of political division, urging a focus on the shared humanity rather than speculative motives, even as details about the killer's alleged "transgender and anti-fascist" writings emerge.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the influential and often controversial conservative activist, has died at 31 after being assassinated by a sniper at a speaking event at Utah Valley University. As the founder of Turning Point USA, Kirk wielded significant influence, particularly among young conservatives, and was a close ally of President Donald Trump, who hailed him as a "martyr for truth." This article details his rapid rise, his role in galvanizing youth for the Republican party, and his often polarizing views on topics like gender, race, gun control, and climate change, including his advocacy for the "great replacement theory." Despite his critics, Kirk was a key figure in the newly resurgent US nativism movement, leaving a complex and deeply divisive legacy in American politics.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is purchasing 50 shares of Honeywell, increasing its weighting to 2.25%, in anticipation of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and a potential economic pickup. Honeywell shares have lagged recently, partly due to "spin purgatory" related to its complex breakup plan, which includes spinning off its Solstice Advanced Materials business in Q4 and separating its aerospace division in late 2026. Separately, the Trust would trim its Broadcom position, which has surged nearly 20% after strong earnings and a new OpenAI customer, to manage portfolio size and lock in gains.

          <p>The European Union has finally captured President Trump's attention on China policy, but at the cost of an "impossible" demand: imposing 100% tariffs on China and India for their purchases of Russian energy.

This article highlights the difficult position the EU faces, as discussions begin on jointly imposing "secondary sanctions" on companies from China and other third countries for buying Russian oil and gas.

The author, a Jewish writer, reflects on Kirk's surprising observance of the Jewish Sabbath and the universal human need for rituals like shiva to process grief, even for figures with whom one profoundly disagreed. The piece condemns the choice to resolve grievances with violence rather than argument or democratic participation, emphasizing that such acts should terrify anyone believing in peaceful coexistence. It calls for acknowledging shared humanity and the messiness of grief, transcending political tribes, and understanding mourning as an obligation to the broader community, even when opposing someone's ideas.</p>

          <p>This fact-check article debunks widespread fake news and Russian disinformation circulating online after Polish armed forces shot down Russian drones that violated national airspace. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticized Russian propaganda directly targeting Poland's security, while pro-Kremlin media falsely claimed no evidence of downed drones or suggested Ukrainian provocation. The article meticulously identifies and refutes several viral videos, including those misrepresenting "Arma 3" video game footage as real drone attacks and misdated drone videos. It confirms that at least three crash sites of the 19 drones were found in eastern Poland, with another discovered hundreds of kilometers away in Mniszkow, highlighting the ongoing information warfare surrounding the incident.</p>

          <p>A global "prison economy" thrives behind bars, with governments spending hundreds of billions annually to incarcerate over 11.5 million people, while facing a severe overcrowding crisis in 155 countries. Private corporations profit significantly from prison management and services, often criticized for incentivizing inmate numbers over rehabilitation, as seen in Brazil's pay-per-prisoner schemes. Inside, organized crime syndicates run vast contraband empires, dealing drugs and phones at exorbitant markups, sometimes even imposing social order — outlawing prison sexual assault, theft, and extortion. Meanwhile, inmates develop informal marketplaces where necessities like instant noodles become currency, and prison labor pays mere cents per hour. This article exposes the complex financial ecosystems of incarceration, from private sector gains and gang operations to inmate hustles and the low wages of prison labor.</p>
