          <p>HSBC reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, a 29% decrease from the previous year and below analyst expectations. The shortfall was attributed to impairment charges and lost income from disposed businesses, leading to a nearly 3% drop in its Hong Kong-listed shares. In response to the results, the bank announced a $3 billion share buyback, while also warning of muted lending demand for the rest of the year due to global economic uncertainty and trade disruptions.

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel agrees to a ceasefire and takes steps to end the war in Gaza. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the move is intended to "affect the situation on the ground" and alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a reward for terrorism, and has sparked debate among UK political parties.</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, significantly beating analyst forecasts and doubling its profit year-over-year. The strong performance was fueled by a 25% revenue increase in its investment bank's global markets unit amid high market volatility. Despite this, the bank faces challenges, including new Swiss regulatory proposals for higher capital requirements and concerns over net interest income due to Switzerland's 0% interest rates.

          <p>British newspapers have offered varied reactions to the government's announcement on potentially recognizing a Palestinian state. The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail highlighted Israeli claims that the move rewards Hamas, while The Guardian noted the UK's conditions also include Hamas releasing hostages and disarming. The Times labeled it "gesture diplomacy," questioning its practical impact on the Gaza crisis, whereas the Daily Mirror supported it as an acknowledgment of Palestinian rights.</p>

The analysis concludes that while the Footsie's performance is notable, it should not be misinterpreted as a sign of robust UK corporate or economic health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>EPA Announces Plan to Revoke Landmark 2009 Finding on Greenhouse Gas Dangers</h2>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, claiming it would save Americans billions by repealing emissions standards for vehicles and other sources. The decision has been met with fierce criticism from environmental groups and scientists, who call it "criminal negligence" and vow legal challenges, citing the overwhelming scientific evidence of climate change's threat to public health.</p>

Despite the cautious outlook, Singapore's GDP grew 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, beating expectations and avoiding a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

While the RBA held rates steady in its last meeting to confirm the inflation trend, analysts now anticipate a 25-basis-point cut at the upcoming August meeting. (not investment advice)</p>
