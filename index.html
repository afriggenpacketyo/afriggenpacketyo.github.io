          <p>An explosion at an American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI, resulting in one death and several injuries. A suspect, 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus, has been identified as a person-of-interest, with writings indicating opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The explosion, caused by a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, damaged nearby buildings and prompted evacuations, but the clinic's IVF lab remains intact, and the facility is expected to reopen soon. The investigation is ongoing, with the FBI assuring the public that there is no outstanding threat.</p>

          <p>At least 27 people have died across Missouri and Kentucky due to severe storms and tornadoes that swept through the midwestern US. Kentucky's governor reported 18 deaths in his state, with a mass casualty event occurring in Laurel County, while Missouri reported seven deaths, including five in St. Louis. The storms, part of a larger weather system, spawned over two dozen tornadoes, left hundreds of thousands without power, and brought a heatwave to Texas. There are concerns that staffing cuts at the National Weather Service may have affected the ability to provide adequate warnings, though the Kentucky governor stated alerts were properly issued in his state.</p>

This occurred hours after Russia launched its largest drone attack on Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, targeting Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk regions. The intensified diplomacy precedes a planned phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, with both sides agreeing to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war.

          <p>The UK's strawberry season is experiencing a "stonking start" due to warm days and cool nights, resulting in sweeter than usual fruit. Growers report a "really good crop" with strawberries of good size and exceptional sweetness, attributed to lower night temperatures allowing the fruit to concentrate energy into natural sugars. Despite drought warnings, farmers have irrigation systems in place, though rain would still be welcomed. This contrasts with the delayed ripening experienced in 2024 due to a wet winter, with the warmer weather leading to increased production and lush-sweet tasting fruit.</p>

          <h2>Democratic Governors Consider Scaling Back Health Care for Unauthorized Immigrants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic governors in California and Minnesota are proposing to curb health insurance coverage for unauthorized immigrants due to budget constraints. California's Governor Newsom wants to freeze new enrollments and charge a monthly premium for unauthorized adults on Medi-Cal, while Minnesota is considering stripping state health insurance coverage for adult immigrants without authorization. These proposals have faced opposition from lawmakers and advocates who argue for maintaining coverage, citing the potential for increased emergency room usage if people lack regular care. The debates highlight the challenges states face in balancing budget priorities with providing healthcare access to vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Bryan Woolis, who died in Walthamstow, London, after being hit by a car in 2015, has been identified ten years after his death. Inspector Nik Dodsworth of South Yorkshire Police uncovered Woolis's identity by working on the case in his spare time, after seeing an appeal from Locate International. Woolis's sister, who had not been in close contact with him for years, experienced grief upon learning of his death, and had previously heard rumors of his passing but could not confirm them. Locate International is now working to secure a new headstone for Woolis's grave with the correct spelling of his name.</p>
