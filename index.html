          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has voiced his disgust following a BBC report exposing serious misconduct within the Metropolitan Police, including allegations of sexism, racism, and excessive force. The report has prompted an urgent investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct and pledges from Met Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley to dismiss officers guilty of gross misconduct. The revelations have damaged public trust and led to widespread condemnation from political figures and former officers, who expressed shame and called for immediate, significant reforms to restore confidence in the force.</p>

          <p>A 20-story residential building in the Bronx experienced a partial collapse after a suspected boiler room explosion, leaving a large hole in the structure's corner. Despite the extensive damage, which sent debris raining onto the street, officials reported no injuries or loss of life. Mayor Eric Adams stated that an investigation is underway, with a preliminary theory suggesting the blast occurred while the heating system was being activated for the season. Residents from 38 apartments have been evacuated, and inspections are ongoing to ensure the building's structural integrity.</p>

The Arizona Department of Public Safety reported that the driver was speeding over 100 mph and driving the wrong way before the vehicle flipped multiple times. A blood test revealed the teen's blood alcohol concentration was more than twice the legal limit for an adult. Both children were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, and the driver is expected to face DUI and other related charges.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle struck a disabled semi-truck near Lompoc, California, resulting in four injuries and a significant fuel spill. The truck driver sustained major injuries, while three train passengers had minor injuries. The collision caused the truck to spill approximately 3,600 gallons of diesel fuel, prompting a response from the Santa Barbara County Fire Department. The 218 passengers and crew on the train remained safe as the train stayed upright, and they were later transported by bus to their destinations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order stating that any armed attack on Qatar will be treated as a threat to the security of the United States. The order pledges that the U.S. will take all necessary measures, including military action, to defend the Gulf nation. This unprecedented security guarantee comes after Israel conducted a missile strike in Qatar's capital, Doha, targeting Hamas leaders, an action for which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later expressed regret. The order strengthens the U.S.-Qatar defense partnership, as Qatar hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government has entered a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the October 1 deadline. The impasse stems from a stalemate between Republicans and Democrats over including an extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits in the funding measure. As a result, non-essential government functions have ceased, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed without pay. This marks the first shutdown in nearly seven years, highlighting deep partisan divisions on fiscal and healthcare policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Huntington Beach, California, is actively opposing the state's "sanctuary" policies by declaring itself a "non-sanctuary" city. Led by Mayor Pat Burns, a supporter of President Trump, the city council unanimously approved the initiative, which encourages local police cooperation with federal immigration enforcement agents like ICE. While California state law restricts such cooperation, the city's declaration serves as a strong political statement against state and in favor of federal immigration policies. This move places Huntington Beach at the forefront of a nationwide debate over local versus state control on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>An attorney has alleged that the U.S. government deported at least two of his clients to Iran without due process, placing them at risk of persecution. The asylum seekers, who had entered the U.S. at the southern border, reportedly disappeared from the ICE detainee system before being removed without any notification to their legal counsel. One of the men is a Christian convert whose pregnant wife remains in the U.S. The deportations follow a recent announcement by an Iranian official about the impending return of about 120 Iranian nationals from the U.S.</p>

After Dillon Gabriel was promoted to starter, Sanders pantomimed answers without speaking, a move seen as a creative way to avoid controversy or fines. The gesture follows critical comments from analyst Rex Ryan about Sanders' earlier remarks suggesting he was capable of starting in the league.

A career 42.9% three-point shooter, LaRavia is focused on complementing stars like Luka Doncic by spacing the floor and bringing energy on defense.

          <p>The Tennessee Supreme Court has scheduled the 2026 execution of Christa Gail Pike, who would be the first woman executed in the state in over two centuries. Pike was 18 in 1995 when she was convicted of the brutal murder of a 19-year-old romantic rival, Colleen Slemmer. The crime was noted for its extreme violence, which included beating, stabbing, and carving a pentagram into the victim's chest. Pike's attorneys argue her sentence should be commuted to life, citing her young age and undiagnosed mental illness at the time of the crime.</p>

However, Cramer cautioned that while these stocks remain a good place to invest, the most significant gains for the year may have already occurred.

          <p>A University of Cambridge nutrition expert has debunked several common myths surrounding the health and use of different cooking oils. Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are not unhealthy; they are low in saturated fats and can help reduce disease risk when used in place of butter or lard. Modern margarines are also a healthy option, as harmful trans fats have been removed from their formulation. While extra virgin olive oil is beneficial, its low smoke point makes it unsuitable for deep frying, for which vegetable or sunflower oil is better suited.</p>
