          <p>King Charles III is hosting French President Emmanuel Macron for a three-day state visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, aimed at revitalizing the relationship between the two nations. The visit includes significant pageantry and high-level talks on defense, migration, and continued support for Ukraine, signaling a diplomatic reset after years of tension. Analysts note the King's active role in diplomacy and the strategic importance of the UK-France partnership in the face of European instability. The summit is expected to address contentious issues like migrant returns while reinforcing shared security interests.</p>

          <p>Following a market downturn after the announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against panic selling, suggesting the announced figures are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a final policy. He posits that the Trump administration's primary goal is to increase US exports, and that these tariff threats could be reduced or postponed. Cramer noted that while the market remains overbought and could see more selling, many do not believe the tariffs will be implemented as announced, potentially lessening their impact on inflation and Federal Reserve decisions.

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a socialist, is receiving surprising financial backing from several wealthy individuals and millionaires, including venture capitalists and business owners. These supporters have publicly stated they are in favor of his proposals to increase taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs, believing they should pay their "fair share" for beneficial policies. The article notes that despite his radical agenda, Mamdani has assured business leaders he is not against private enterprise and recognizes the need for private housing supply.</p>

          <p>In a report to a United Nations working group, the government of El Salvador has asserted that the United States holds legal jurisdiction and responsibility for over 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This claim contradicts the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the individuals because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants, primarily from Venezuela, were deported under the Alien Enemies Act as part of a deal to house them in El Salvador. The ACLU, representing the detainees, states this new information confirms the US controls their fate and was not previously disclosed by the government.</p>

          <p>Flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 104 deaths, with dozens still missing, particularly from a youth summer camp on the Guadalupe River. A confluence of weather factors, including moisture from a former tropical storm, caused the river to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes, catching residents and campers by surprise in the middle of the night. This article explains the meteorological causes of the "100-year-flood" and notes the ongoing massive search and rescue operations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic flooding in central Texas was caused by an extreme rainfall event, with some areas receiving over 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This article details the preliminary rainfall totals, which show a massive deluge concentrated in the Guadalupe River basin. Meteorologists explain that the river flooded so rapidly because the storm system stalled over the area, dumping more rain than forecasted onto the two main forks of the river, which then converged with devastating force. The region, known as "flash flood alley," is naturally susceptible to such events due to its geography and soil composition.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old man armed with an assault rifle was shot and killed by federal agents after he opened fire on a U.S. border patrol facility in McAllen, Texas, injuring one police officer. The shooter, identified as Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired dozens of rounds at the building and at agents. Hours earlier, his father had reported him to police as a missing person with psychological issues and weapons. The motive for the attack is under investigation by the FBI, which found additional ammunition and weaponry in the shooter's vehicle.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a second nationwide test of its mobile phone emergency alert system, scheduled for 3 p.m. on September 7th. The test will cause compatible smartphones to vibrate and sound a siren for 10 seconds, displaying a test message. This follows a 2023 test that revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving the alert. The system is designed for imminent life-threatening situations like extreme weather or terror attacks and has already been used successfully in several regional emergencies, including for a bomb disposal evacuation in Plymouth.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Questions Economic Advisor's Claim That Medicaid Cuts Won't Reduce Coverage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 17:29:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the claims of National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, who asserted that the Trump administration's plan to cut Medicaid spending by $800 billion will not cause anyone to lose health insurance. This contradicts the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projection that 8 million people will lose coverage. The article argues Hassett's defense, which relies on discrediting past CBO forecasts, is flawed and ignores real-world data from state-level work requirements. It also points to Hassett's own history of highly inaccurate economic predictions, suggesting his optimism is a political tool rather than a sound forecast.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood early Monday resulted in three fatalities and nine other people being injured, including two juveniles who are expected to survive. Police responded to reports of gunfire and found a chaotic scene with dozens of shell casings, suggesting a possible exchange of fire. Commissioner Kevin Bethel noted that nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence were recovered and that a switch, a device that makes a firearm automatic, may have been used. One person was taken into custody with a weapon, but police believe multiple shooters remain at large.</p>

          <p>California, along with a coalition of 17 other states, has filed a legal challenge against recent federal immigration raids in Los Angeles, arguing they are unconstitutional. The states' filing supports a lawsuit accusing the government of conducting "suspicionless" stops, with masked agents detaining people based on their appearance, which has created a culture of fear. California Attorney General Rob Bonta condemned the raids as cruel attacks on immigrant communities. The move adds significant legal weight to the opposition against the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda and its enforcement tactics in so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>This article explores the tension between human officiating and technological aids in sports, highlighted by a recent incident at Wimbledon where the electronic line-calling system failed. Despite technology like Hawk-Eye and VAR being demonstrably more accurate than the human eye, controversies persist, fueling debate about their reliability and place in sports. Experts suggest our unease stems from a strong innate sense of fairness, where a technically correct call might not feel like a fair one, and a lack of perceived human control over the machines. The piece concludes that the ideal solution involves finding the right intersection between human oversight and technological precision.</p>

          <p>A federal jury acquitted music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs of the most serious charges against him, including sex trafficking and racketeering, which could have resulted in a life sentence. His lawyer reported that Combs received a standing ovation from fellow inmates upon returning to jail, viewing the verdict as a rare victory against the government. Combs was, however, convicted on lesser charges related to prostitution and remains incarcerated pending sentencing. The defense strategy involved acknowledging Combs's domestic abuse and drug problems while arguing these issues did not constitute federal sex trafficking crimes.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, the oldest restaurant in Los Angeles and a claimant to the invention of the French dip sandwich, is permanently closing after 116 years in operation. The owner cited a combination of factors crippling independent restaurants, including the pandemic's lingering effects, rising costs, high rent, and local crime. Founded in 1908, the downtown landmark has been a cherished part of the city's history. The closure has been met with an outpouring of support from patrons, but also serves as a stark warning about the challenges facing historic, family-owned businesses in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. publicly praised Mom's Meals, a company providing taxpayer-funded meals to Medicaid and Medicare enrollees, as a solution for a healthier America. However, an analysis of the company's menu reveals that many of its offerings are ultraprocessed foods, containing chemical additives and high levels of sodium, sugar, or fat. This appears to contradict Kennedy's frequent criticism of such foods for making people sick. A company spokesperson defended the meals as a "healthy alternative," while a food policy expert noted they are loaded with the very additives that define them as ultraprocessed.</p>
