        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized an agreement to establish the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, granting the U.S. rights to Ukrainian rare earth minerals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that this deal sends a clear message to Russia about the Trump Administration's commitment to a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine. The partnership aims to unlock Ukraine's growth assets, mobilize American talent and capital, and improve Ukraine's investment climate to accelerate economic recovery. While both sides were prepared to sign earlier, a last-minute request from the U.S. to sign the minerals agreement and the investment fund document simultaneously caused a brief snag, highlighting the complexities of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) is facing significant disruption following a ransomware attack that has paused online orders for nearly a week and caused shortages in some stores. The attack, attributed to the "DragonForce" ransomware group, has led to a 6.5% drop in M&S's share price, wiping off over half a billion pounds from the company's value. While suppliers report minimal impact so far, the retailer is working to resolve technical issues affecting product availability, with uncertainty surrounding when online orders will resume.

However, the company lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. Despite this, Eli Lilly maintained its sales guidance for the year, which includes existing tariffs but excludes planned levies on pharmaceuticals. CEO Dave Ricks mentioned the potential impact of tariffs, but also noted the investments in U.S. manufacturing already occurring in response to the threat of tariffs.</p>

          <h2>HELOC or Home Equity Loan: Which is Easier to Qualify For?</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts weigh in on whether it is easier to qualify for a HELOC or a home equity loan, concluding that a HELOC may be easier due to its interest rates. HELOCs are usually based on the prime rate plus a margin and an interest-only payment versus a home equity loan that is a fixed rate. Some HELOC lenders offer more flexibility when it comes to your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Borrowers should choose their lending solution based on their needs and consider how they plan to use the funds, how they want to repay them and whether they prefer fixed or flexible terms.

          <p>This article examines whether pronatalist policies, aimed at boosting birth rates, benefit children. It argues that financial support for parents, such as expanded child tax credits, can directly improve children's well-being. While a world with more children could lead to greater tolerance and child-friendly environments, the author also notes that lower fertility rates can result in increased resources per child. Ultimately, policies that prioritize children's needs, such as access to food, housing, healthcare, and education, are deemed most important.</p>
