          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 02:58:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally announced new tariffs on nearly 70 countries, set to take effect in early August. The duties, ranging from 10% to over 40%, are based on U.S. trade deficits with each nation and represent a significant escalation of the administration's trade policy. While some allies like the EU and Japan secured lower rates through negotiations, Canada faces a steep 35% tariff, and extensions have been granted for deals with Mexico and China. This move aims to boost domestic manufacturing but has been criticized by economists for creating economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, significantly surpassing analyst expectations. This remarkable growth is primarily attributed to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units in its first month. The company's operating profit also beat forecasts, and its share price has climbed approximately 40% this year. Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million Switch 2 units by the end of the fiscal year, signaling strong momentum for the gaming giant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court ruling could allow millions of motorists to claim compensation for mis-sold car finance agreements. The case centers on whether hidden commission payments made to car dealers, which incentivized higher interest rates for customers, were unlawful. A decision upholding an earlier ruling could lead to billions of pounds in payouts, with major lenders already setting aside substantial funds. The outcome is highly anticipated as it could reshape the consumer lending landscape and have significant economic repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive wave of Russian drone and missile attacks on Kyiv has resulted in at least 28 deaths, including three children, and left over 150 people wounded. The barrage, one of the largest in recent times, destroyed parts of an apartment block and caused widespread damage across the Ukrainian capital. These strikes occurred despite a deadline from U.S. President Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face tougher sanctions. Meanwhile, Russia claimed to have captured the strategic town of Chasiv Yar, a claim disputed by Ukrainian officials.</p>

In Southeast Asia, most ASEAN countries now face tariffs around 19-20%, though Laos and Myanmar were hit with a high 40% rate.

          <p>Several Asian countries have issued official statements reacting to the newly announced U.S. tariff schedule, revealing a range of outcomes from recent negotiations. Cambodia and Thailand expressed relief after their high proposed tariffs were significantly reduced to 19%, which they believe will maintain their economic competitiveness. Taiwan's president called its 20% rate "temporary" pending further talks, while allies Japan and Australia welcomed their relatively lower rates. In contrast, India, which did not secure a deal, faces a 25% tariff and is pursuing a broader trade agreement with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The goal is to devalue the horns on the black market and increase the risk of arrest for poachers and traffickers.

          <p>Dustin Ronald Alba, an Oxnard man convicted of being a serial sexual assailant, has been sentenced to 111 years to life in prison. Prosecutors stated that Alba used dating apps and social media to meet his victims, and then used his physical size to overpower and assault them. The investigation uncovered five victims between 2012 and 2020 after one woman reported an assault to the police. The district attorney's office highlighted the profound harm caused by Alba's violence and expressed hope that the sentence would help the victims heal.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's increasing use of its emergency docket, which handles urgent appeals. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh argued that the rise in emergency requests is a direct result of presidents from both parties relying more on executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock. He stated that the court has implemented internal changes to handle these cases properly and suggested that as long as presidents push the limits of their power, the judiciary will inevitably be drawn in to respond.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as a cybersecurity director under President Biden, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded. The reversal by the Secretary of the Army came shortly after a pro-Trump activist highlighted the hire on social media, accusing Easterly of being a "holdover" who undermined the Trump administration. In a statement, Easterly lamented that the opportunity was a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." The incident reflects ongoing political polarization affecting appointments within government and military institutions.</p>

The judge also found that the government failed to conduct an objective review of the current unsafe conditions in the immigrants' home countries.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that U.S. criticism of countries like Australia for "freeloading" on American medical research is misplaced. The author contends that the United States' exorbitant healthcare costs and poor health outcomes are problems of its own making, rooted in a dysfunctional system. The article suggests the U.S. could learn from Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) to control drug prices. It concludes that Australia should treat the U.S. as a tough trading partner and resist bullying tactics on issues like pharmaceutical pricing.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, posted an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, slightly ahead of analyst estimates. While AWS remains the market leader, it faces growing competition from Microsoft and Google, both of which reported higher cloud growth rates. The report highlights the intense investment by all three tech giants in artificial intelligence to capture booming demand. Amazon's CEO noted that the company is still facing supply shortages, particularly for power, needed to meet this rising demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article offers a detailed perspective on how Thailand managed the recent U.S. tariff announcements, a process marked by "shock, chaos, and negotiations." Initially facing a punishing 36% levy, Thai officials scrambled to negotiate a reduction to 19%, a deal that went down to the wire. The process was complicated by domestic politics, particularly the need to protect Thailand's powerful agriculture sector from U.S. demands for market access. Thai manufacturers, while relieved, remain concerned about vague and potentially damaging rules regarding the trans-shipment of Chinese components.</p>

The new movie updates the concept, with Lohan's character now a mother herself, leading to a "quadruple body-swapping" scenario. Curtis, who initiated the idea for the sequel, emphasized the film's timely themes of empathy and understanding in a divided world.</p>
