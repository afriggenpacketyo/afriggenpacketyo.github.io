          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may lead to a reduction of 1,700 roles globally by 2027, as part of CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy to revive the brand. These measures, including cost-cutting across procurement and real estate, are estimated to save £60 million, adding to the £40 million already announced in November. The company's sales fell less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, down 6%, and shares jumped 8.5% following the announcement. Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future despite a difficult macroeconomic backdrop and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading but ultimately rose after the company announced a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded estimates, coming in at 203.6 billion yen. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of the shares to Sony Group shareholders through dividends.

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has ruled that the Trump administration can use the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) to deport Venezuelan citizens identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. This decision allows deportations to proceed, provided individuals receive at least 21 days' notice in English and Spanish and an opportunity to object. The ruling stems from a case involving a Venezuelan national who denies gang membership but was targeted for deportation under Trump's proclamation declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization. Another judge in Texas temporarily blocked the administration from using the AEA in that region.</p>

          <p>Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to stop funding already approved for green energy projects and threatened to repeal parts of the IRA. The article discusses the potential impact of Trump's policies, including tariffs, on the renewable energy sector in the United States, noting that tariffs on Southeast Asia could significantly affect solar energy development. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), hostility towards clean technology from the administration is causing uncertainty and project cancellations. While clean energy is expected to grow, the pace may be slower, and the US risks isolating itself in the global transition to cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>A new book by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson reveals that Joe Biden's physical deterioration was so severe in 2023 and 2024 that advisers privately discussed the possibility he'd need to use a wheelchair if he won re-election. The book also details the White House's efforts to conceal the reality of Biden's condition, at the risk of his own health, while he faced a tough reelection bid against Donald Trump. Biden aides believed it was politically untenable to have Biden use a wheelchair amid his re-election campaign. His White House doctor Kevin O'Connor, pleading for more rest time, would tell the staff, "I’m trying to keep him alive, and you’re trying to kill him."</p>

The song, which includes references to Nazi slogans and imagery, has been banned on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, but remains on X, where it has garnered millions of views. In Germany, the public display or dissemination of Nazi symbols and slogans is illegal under Section 86a of the German criminal code, punishable by imprisonment or a fine.

He was arrested in August at a Riyadh airport while trying to travel to Manchester, England, with his family, and was accused of violating terrorism and anti-cyber crime laws.

Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritized over other qualifications, making the hiring process selective. This talent crunch is exacerbated by competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds. As family offices are often looking to combine roles such as a chief investment officer cum CFO, it can be difficult to find one professional who is both willing and capable to cover all these areas.

The decision, by Judge Michael V.

The brothers tried unsuccessfully to appeal their convictions for many years, and they had said that over time, their hopes of being released had diminished. The brothers said they burst into the den of their Beverly Hills mansion on a Sunday evening in 1989 and killed their parents with shotguns because they had endured years of sexual abuse from their father.</p>

          <h2>Iran Proposes Joint Nuclear Enrichment Venture with Arab Countries and American Investment</h2>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington’s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to four Iranian officials familiar with the plan. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, proposed the idea to an American special envoy, Steve Witkoff, when the two men held direct and indirect talks in Oman on Sunday. The proposal entails the establishment of a three-country nuclear consortium in which Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade, beneath that needed for nuclear weapons, and then ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use. A deal that would allow Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67 percent would bear similarity to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a slight decline in April, falling from record-high prices earlier in the year, according to government data. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs decreased to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. Despite this drop, egg prices remain significantly higher than the previous year, with the April average being 79% higher than the same month a year ago. The persistent outbreak of bird flu continues to impact the supply of egg-laying hens, but fewer outbreaks in recent weeks have helped stabilize the situation.</p>

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risks posed by Chinese-made power inverters after unexplained communication equipment was discovered inside some devices. These rogue components, including cellular radios, provide undocumented communication channels that could bypass firewalls and destabilize power grids. The concern is that these devices could be used to remotely switch off inverters or change their settings, potentially causing widespread blackouts. As U.S.-China tensions escalate, there's growing scrutiny over China's role in strategic infrastructure and potential security vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Safety concerns have been raised at HMP Five Wells in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, a prison now housing a high number of sex offenders. Reports indicate a rise in violence and self-harm since the integration of sex offenders with the general inmate population. Former inmates and family members have described attacks, bullying, and easy access to drugs within the prison. The BBC has seen videos recorded on prisoners' mobile phones, which show fist fights and drug taking inside the jail. The prison was initially touted as a "smart" prison with rehabilitation programs, but some claim it is failing to live up to its ambitions.</p>

She detailed Mr. Combs’s alleged orchestration of the freak-offs down to dictating the color of her nails (white or white french tips) and which sex acts she performed, demanding she reapply baby oil every five minutes until she was “glistening,” and paying male escorts less if they failed to perform to his standards. Ventura testified that over time the sex sessions grew more elaborately staged, with Mr. Combs specifying that they be lit by candles or colored lights similar to what was used on music videos.</p>
