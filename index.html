          <p>Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, stated that several countries are ready to supply Iran with nuclear warheads following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Medvedev did not name specific countries but noted Russia's historical support for Iran's nuclear program and willingness to mediate peace talks. The U.S. launched strikes targeting Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, involving over 125 aircraft, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine. Russia's Foreign Ministry condemned the strikes as a violation of international law, while Iran cautioned that the U.S. would suffer consequences for its involvement. The U.S. Secretary of Defense reported that the U.S. would collaborate with regional allies to ensure force protection after the strikes. </p>

Syrian Information Minister Hamza Mostafa condemned the act as a terrorist attack, while Church Bishop Moussa Khoury reported that the attacker also threw a grenade.

          <p>During a lunch meeting between President Trump and Steve Bannon, the president had already approved a plan for the U.S. to potentially attack an Iranian nuclear facility, sources told ABC News. Bannon, however, advised against the strike, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence, the effectiveness of bunker-buster bombs, and the risk to U.S. troops in the Middle East. A White House official claims that President Trump had already decided to postpone the strike before the lunch with Bannon. The discussion highlights the internal deliberations within the Trump administration regarding the appropriate response to Iran's nuclear program. </p>

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran reserves the right to defend itself, raising concerns about potential escalation. Vance stated that the U.S. desires peace but insists on Iran not possessing a nuclear weapons program, which he believes the recent actions have achieved. </p>

          <p>A rare June heatwave is affecting tens of millions of people across the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, with numerous heat advisories in effect. Temperatures are soaring, with heat indices expected to reach or exceed 100Â°F in many areas, prompting health departments to declare heat emergencies. The extreme heat has led to event cancellations, adjustments to outdoor activities, and warnings for athletes and outdoor workers. Meteorologists attribute the heatwave to a "heat dome," a large area of high pressure trapping heat and humidity, with the unusual aspect being its widespread impact across the eastern part of the country. </p>

Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight dip, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains, and Egypt's EGX30 performed strongly. Analysts suggest that the Gulf region's call for peaceful resolutions and distancing from Israeli aggression has helped insulate it from significant market impacts. The removal of the Iranian threat is expected to positively impact the market in the mid-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States entered the Israel-Iran conflict by bombing key Iranian nuclear enrichment sites, marking a significant escalation in the Middle East. President Trump confirmed the attacks on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, using B-2 Spirit bombers and bunker-busting warheads. While Trump claimed the sites were "obliterated," the extent of damage is still being verified, with some analysts suggesting enriched uranium may have been moved beforehand.

The advisory notes that U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple Iranian-backed plots since 2020 and warns that Iranian leadership calling for retaliatory violence could increase the likelihood of violence.

          <h2>Five Phrases to Avoid When Talking to Children, and What to Say Instead</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that threats, bribes, and harsh consequences can hinder cooperation. Instead, using language that respects a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries fosters a desire to cooperate. Phrases like "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" trigger a child's defense mechanisms. The alternative phrases focus on explaining decisions, giving agency, acknowledging emotions, and inviting problem-solving, which promote trust, emotional safety, and cooperation. </p>

          <p>Iran's parliament approved a measure endorsing the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil transportation route, following U.S. airstrikes. The decision, which ultimately rests with Iran's Supreme National Security Council, could significantly impact global fuel costs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned against closing the strait, calling it a "suicidal move" that would provoke international opposition. The move comes amid heightened tensions following the U.S. strikes and warnings of potential retaliation from Tehran. </p>
