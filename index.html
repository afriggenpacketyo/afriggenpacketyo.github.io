          <p>Former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is scheduled to testify before a U.S. House committee about confronting China's economic coercion. This comes after his government's 2020 call for a COVID-19 origin investigation led to Chinese tariffs on Australian goods. The hearing, which will also feature former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel, occurs as Morrison's successor, Anthony Albanese, works to repair relations with Beijing. The testimony highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions and strategies among Pacific allies regarding China's economic influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to legitimize their use for payments and is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry, which heavily supported pro-crypto candidates. Proponents believe this will strengthen the dollar's global status and expand its reach, while critics raise concerns about potential money laundering and the lack of prohibitions on foreign issuers. This could significantly grow the stablecoin market, which is currently valued at over $260 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Study Suggests Chemotherapy May Inadvertently Promote Cancer Metastasis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:00:09 EDT</div>

          <p>A new study from China indicates that chemotherapy, while treating primary tumors, might inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially accelerating the spread of cancer to other organs. The research focused on breast cancer, offering a possible explanation for why metastasis can occur even after successful initial treatment. The scientific team also identified drugs that could inhibit this process in mice, leading to the launch of a clinical trial for human breast cancer patients. These findings could lead to improved cancer treatment strategies by addressing the unintended consequences of chemotherapy.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence has stated it will not provide compensation to thousands of Afghans whose personal details were leaked in a February 2022 data breach but were not evacuated to Britain. The MoD plans to "robustly defend" against legal action, citing an independent review that found it unlikely individuals would be targeted solely for being on the leaked list. This decision has drawn criticism, as many of the more than 19,000 individuals whose data was exposed fear retribution from the Taliban. The leak occurred when an official improperly emailed a spreadsheet of relocation applicants.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle tag and adhere to a curfew amid an investigation into an alleged coup plot. The judge also banned him from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. This legal action comes as the U.S. Trump administration exerts pressure, revoking visas for Brazilian judicial officials and threatening tariffs to support its ally. Bolsonaro, who denies the accusations of trying to prevent President Lula da Silva from taking office, could face decades in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom, including London, are under an amber weather warning for severe thunderstorms and torrential rain expected over the weekend. The Met Office predicts that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to a high risk of dangerous flash flooding. This severe weather follows a recent heatwave that left the ground parched and less able to absorb water, exacerbating the flood risk.

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could significantly enhance China's electromagnetic weapon capabilities. The concept involves cross-stacking two rail guns to nearly double the force, allowing it to fire heavier projectiles at extreme speeds. This innovation aims to overcome the power limitations of the current naval railgun, which was first seen on a ship in 2018 but is considered too weak for some military applications. The new design could fire 30kg shells at Mach 7, representing a major potential advancement in military technology.</p>

The BIS warns that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of these assets could complicate anti-money-laundering efforts and other regulatory requirements.

          <p>In a recent interview, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Todd Lyons, confirmed the agency plans to use data from programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants in the country illegally. He also defended the practice of allowing ICE agents to wear masks during arrest operations, citing an over 800% increase in attacks on officers and the need to protect their safety. While acknowledging concerns that imposters could exploit the practice, Lyons stated he would permit it as a safety tool for his personnel amid the administration's large-scale deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, a provincial police commissioner in South Africa, has gained public admiration for accusing the national Police Minister of having ties to organized crime. He alleged that his boss shut down an elite unit after it uncovered a powerful drug cartel, sparking a public outcry and the trending hashtag #HandsoffNhlanhlaMkhwanazi. This is not the first time the general has challenged his political superiors, having previously suspended a police chief allied with former President Jacob Zuma.

          <p>Shares of fintech company Block, founded by Jack Dorsey, surged more than 10% in extended trading after it was announced the company will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, whose acquisition by Chevron was recently completed. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index funds must purchase shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down 14% for the year, Block's addition reflects the growing market capitalization of technology firms within the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring a nonimmigrant visa. This fee, part of the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is in addition to existing visa application costs. The provision states that travelers may be able to have the fee reimbursed after their visa expires, provided they comply with all visa conditions, such as not working without authorization or overstaying. However, details on implementation remain scant, and the Congressional Budget Office expects few travelers will ultimately seek or receive reimbursement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) for President Trump, medical experts have clarified the nature of the common condition. CVI occurs when veins, typically in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling. The White House physician described the president's case as benign and common in older adults, with no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. Treatment often involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, with minimally invasive procedures available for more serious cases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has asked a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein case, a move directed by President Trump. This occurred as Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal over a story about a sexually suggestive letter he allegedly sent to Epstein in 2003. The dual actions aim to manage a growing controversy among Trump's supporters who have demanded more transparency on the Epstein case. A judge must approve the release of the transcripts, a process that could be lengthy due to necessary redactions.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its next phase: a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract defense, aerospace, robotics, and energy companies, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO pitched the idea as restoring the "designed in California, made in California" model. This announcement follows an earlier proposal for a shipbuilding hub, as the group continues to seek county approval for its large-scale development on rural farmland.</p>

The previous system involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising the work of more technical staff in China, an arrangement critics warned could create cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

The decision has prompted discussion about the challenges facing nightly topical shows, including competition from online creators and shifting audience viewing habits.

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case remains a powerful and unifying issue within Donald Trump's MAGA base, serving as a symbol for a corrupt "deep state" they believe controls government institutions. Conspiracy theories about a secret "client list" and the nature of Epstein's death have been fueled for years by online influencers and right-wing media. This deep-seated belief system has recently put pressure on the Trump administration itself, after it initially indicated no new files would be released.
