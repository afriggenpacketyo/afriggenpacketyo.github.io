          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly stated he would "never" have appointed Peter Mandelson as his US ambassador had he been aware of the full details of Mandelson's relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The statement follows Starmer's decision to dismiss Lord Mandelson, which occurred just one day after he had offered public support for the peer. The controversy escalated after emails reported by Bloomberg revealed supportive messages Mandelson sent to Epstein in 2008, following Epstein's guilty plea, raising serious questions about the government's vetting process for high-level diplomatic posts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is escalating pressure on European NATO allies, demanding a complete cessation of Russian energy purchases as a precondition for imposing new U.S. sanctions on Moscow. He specifically criticized nations like Hungary and France for their continued reliance on Russian oil and gas, asserting that Europe is not doing enough to counter Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Trump emphasized that while he is prepared to enact significant sanctions, this action is contingent on European nations first strengthening their own punitive measures and ending their energy trade relationship with Russia.</p>

          <p>American Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from the world championships semi-final after officials ruled he engaged in "jostling" on the home straight. Hocker, who was boxed in, made forceful contact with Germany’s Robert Farken while pushing through a small gap to finish second. World Athletics regulations define the infraction as physical contact that results in an unfair advantage or causes harm. Despite Hocker's explanation that he tried to navigate the tight space as cleanly as possible, the US team's subsequent appeal against the disqualification was rejected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has proposed that publicly traded companies should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a move he argues would save money and promote a greater focus on long-term corporate strategy. The suggestion, which would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, echoes concerns from business leaders like Warren Buffett about the market's unhealthy fixation on short-term profits. However, proponents of the current system argue that quarterly reporting provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors, and that less frequent updates could introduce more market uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The FBI has confirmed that DNA evidence from the scene of Charlie Kirk's killing positively matches the suspect in custody, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. FBI Director Kash Patel announced that DNA was recovered from a towel wrapped around the firearm and a screwdriver found on the roof from which the shot was fired. Investigators also found forensic evidence of a destroyed note written by the suspect, which reportedly stated an intention to "take out" the conservative influencer.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has defended a recent airstrike targeting Hamas leaders in Qatar, asserting that they will not have immunity "wherever they are." Speaking alongside U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Netanyahu stated that every nation has the right to defend itself beyond its borders and that Israel conducted the operation independently. The strike, which targeted a close U.S. ally, has drawn international condemnation and created diplomatic tensions, even as Netanyahu insists that Israel has "no better ally" than the United States.</p>

          <p>A violent attack at a pool hall in Santo Domingo, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of seven people and left four others wounded.

This incident marks the second deadly attack on a pool hall in the city in less than a month, highlighting the escalating wave of gang-related violence in the country. Ecuador has become a significant transit point for drug trafficking, leading to a surge in violent crime linked to international cartels.</p>

This assessment contrasts with the views of many Wall Street analysts who have yet to see significant price hikes materialize from the levies.

Furthermore, gold is seen as a reliable hedge against the depreciating value of the U.S. dollar and serves as a low-risk diversifier in an uncertain economic climate.

Key recommendations include getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from various lenders, and promptly locking in a favorable rate. Experts caution against assuming one's current lender will offer the best deal or trying to time the market by waiting for rates to fall further. They also stress the importance of not overextending one's budget, even if qualifying for a larger loan, to maintain financial stability.</p>

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are experiencing confusion and frustration as their loans are transferred to new servicing companies, often with little direct notification. One borrower reported her loans were moved from Nelnet to a new servicer, Central Research, Inc., and placed in an administrative forbearance without her request. Experts advise that while these transfers can be disruptive, borrowers should verify the change through official channels and be cautious about making payments during the transition to avoid processing errors. It is also recommended to check credit reports afterward to ensure no payments were incorrectly marked as late.</p>

          <p>U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced their highest weekly inflows since mid-July, attracting approximately $2.3 billion in a single week. This surge in investment, led by major funds from BlackRock and Fidelity, suggests a significant renewal of investor confidence in the cryptocurrency. Analysts attribute this "clear demand impulse" to growing expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut and the increasing integration of Bitcoin into institutional investment portfolios. The strong performance has reinforced optimism for a potential uptrend in the digital asset market heading into the final quarter of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Danny Kruger has become the first sitting Conservative MP to defect to Reform UK, a significant blow to Tory leader Kemi Badenoch. Kruger, who served as a shadow work and pensions minister, announced his decision alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, declaring that the Conservative Party is "over" as a national political force. He criticized his former party for what he termed a "rule of failure," citing bigger government and higher taxes. The defection highlights the growing challenge Reform UK poses to the Conservatives by attracting traditional right-wing voters and political figures.</p>

          <p>The watermelon has become a powerful symbol of Palestinian identity and protest, largely due to its colors mirroring the Palestinian flag: red, green, black, and white. Its use as a political statement dates back to the 1980s, when Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in the occupied territories. Palestinian artists began using images of the watermelon to subtly represent national identity and circumvent the prohibition. In the current era, the symbol has gained global recognition, used by activists and on social media to express solidarity and navigate content moderation.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers found that 21% of Americans feel it will take a "miracle" for them to retire securely, reflecting widespread anxiety about financial futures. Key concerns cited by respondents include insufficient savings, the impact of inflation, and potential cuts to government benefits like Social Security. Financial experts counter this pessimism by emphasizing that a secure retirement is achievable not through miracles, but through disciplined planning. They advise individuals to start saving early, remain consistent, and develop a comprehensive financial plan, potentially with the help of a professional advisor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump faced widespread ridicule after making a wildly inaccurate claim while defending a U.S. military strike on a boat from Venezuela. When asked about the incident, Trump stated, "the fact that 300 million people died last year from drugs... That’s what’s illegal." Social media users and critics quickly pointed out that the entire U.S. population is only around 340 million people, and official estimates for drug overdose deaths are approximately 75,000 annually. The comment was widely circulated as an example of the president's tendency to make exaggerated or false statements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ambitious promises from companies like Tesla and Figure, the widespread deployment of humanoid robots faces significant practical and economic challenges. Industry experts point to major obstacles, including the current limitations of AI to perform robustly in real-world environments and surprisingly basic issues like short battery life, which would make large-scale factory use impractical. Furthermore, there is a lack of clear demand for a general-purpose humanoid robot that would justify the high cost of replacing existing, highly specialized automation. These hurdles suggest the vision of a multitrillion-dollar humanoid market remains a distant prospect.</p>

          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI tools in their application process, career experts caution that over-reliance can be detrimental. AI is prone to "hallucinating" or fabricating information to fit a job description, and AI-generated applications often lack the authentic voice that helps candidates stand out. Recruiters report receiving numerous applications with identical structures and even accidental inclusions of AI prompts. Experts recommend using AI to polish a self-written draft rather than for initial creation, and always proofreading carefully to avoid embarrassing errors that could ruin a candidate's chances.</p>

This characterization could potentially undermine the Trump administration's claims that she committed mortgage fraud by simultaneously declaring two properties as her primary residence. President Trump has been seeking to fire Cook "for cause" based on these allegations. Cook has sued to block her dismissal and secured a temporary injunction, though the administration is appealing the ruling ahead of a key Fed meeting on interest rates.</p>

They argue that such a move is a political stunt that fails to address the root causes of violence, such as poverty and decades of disinvestment. Instead of a militarized presence, which they say leads to over-policing and harassment, organizers are calling for investment in community-based support services and proven violence prevention programs. They contend that the White House is politicizing their communities' pain rather than offering serious, sustainable solutions.</p>
