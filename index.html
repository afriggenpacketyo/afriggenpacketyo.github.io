          <h2>Oldest Pterosaur in North America Discovered in Arizona</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paleontologists have identified North America's oldest known pterosaur from a fossilized jawbone discovered in Arizona's Petrified Forest National Park. The flying reptile, named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, was approximately the size of a small seagull and lived around 209 million years ago. This significant finding, detailed in a Smithsonian-led study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, helps to fill a crucial gap in the fossil record from the late Triassic period. The discovery provides invaluable new insights into the evolution of pterosaurs, which were the first vertebrates after insects to develop powered flight, and the ecosystem they inhabited before a major extinction event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 76,000 immigrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, with the change taking effect in early September. This humanitarian policy, first granted in 1999 following the devastation of Hurricane Mitch, has provided work permits and protection from deportation for many who have lived in the U.S. for decades. The Department of Homeland Security justified the decision by stating that conditions in the home countries have improved enough to make the status unnecessary. The move is part of a broader administration effort to curtail such programs and has drawn sharp criticism for potentially separating long-established families.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Announces New Tariffs on Seven Countries, Effective August 1</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 14:54:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to impose steep new tariffs on imports from seven countries, including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa, starting August 1. The rates will range from 25% to 40%, depending on the country, as part of a "reciprocal" trade strategy aimed at correcting persistent U.S. trade deficits. The announcement, which came ahead of a previous deadline for numerous trade negotiations, caused U.S. financial markets to fall amid concerns of escalating global trade friction. The administration has warned the targeted nations against imposing retaliatory duties, stating that any such action would result in further increases to the U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced its worst first-half performance since 1973, declining 10.7% against global currencies, and now faces ongoing headwinds that could impact investors. Factors contributing to the significant decline include policy volatility, swelling national debt and deficits, and the potential for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters, its prolonged slide has fueled concerns about the long-term stability of American assets and the future of dollar hegemony. Analysts are divided, with some predicting further decline while others believe fears are overblown, citing the dollar's deep-seated advantages in the global financial system.

          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods, which have killed at least 95 people, are raising critical questions about the effectiveness of emergency warnings and the accuracy of weather forecasts. While the National Weather Service issued 22 warnings for the area, some residents reported not receiving them or underestimating their severity, and local officials noted their county lacked a dedicated warning system due to cost. The tragedy has sparked an intense debate over whether federal budget and staffing cuts at the National Weather Service may have compromised its ability to effectively coordinate with local emergency managers and communicate the extreme danger to the public.</p>

In response, Trump asserted on social media that Musk had gone "off the rails," suggesting his anger stemmed from the elimination of EV tax breaks. Musk's continued attacks signal a significant rift that could pose political challenges for Trump in future elections.</p>

          <p>The United States is scheduled to remove the Syrian Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations, according to a State Department memo. The group, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, was instrumental in the recent overthrow of the Assad regime, and its leader now serves as Syria's interim president. This major policy shift is part of a broader effort by Western nations to reset relations with Syria and support its path toward stability. It follows the lifting of some U.S. and U.K. sanctions, though concerns remain about the new government's operations and recent attacks on minority groups.</p>

          <p>El Gato Night Market, a popular destination for Latino cuisine in Los Angeles, is slowly recovering after a two-week shutdown prompted by widespread fears of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. The market, which hosts dozens of immigrant vendors, saw a significant drop in both vendors and customers upon reopening, highlighting the community's vulnerability. The situation underscores the difficult balance vendors face between ensuring their safety and maintaining their primary source of income. Organizers and vendors express hope that customers will return, emphasizing the market's role as a vital cultural and economic hub for the city's diverse population.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced temporary border checks with Germany, a move that experts fear signals the continuing erosion of the European Union's Schengen border-free travel area. The action was a tit-for-tat response to Germany's own recently enhanced controls, reflecting a broader European trend toward prioritizing national security and migration control over open borders. While legally permissible as a temporary measure, the proliferation of such checks by countries like France and Austria is straining the system. Analysts warn that a return to permanent internal borders would carry significant economic costs and undermine a key symbol of European integration.</p>

          <p>A recent New York Times news story about mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's college application has drawn sharp criticism for its perceived lack of newsworthiness and potential bias. The story, which focused on how Mamdani identified his race, was based on hacked information from a controversial source. This article argues that the publication, combined with a pre-primary editorial advising against ranking Mamdani, suggests the Times may be actively working against his candidacy. The incident raises broader questions about journalistic ethics and whether the paper is maintaining neutrality in its news coverage of the high-stakes New York City election.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Christian girls' summer camp on the Guadalupe River in Texas, was devastated when a sudden and massive flood swept through early on the Fourth of July.

At least 27 campers and counselors from the camp are confirmed dead.

          <p>A Justice Department attorney has stated that the Trump administration plans to take steps to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he is released from criminal custody in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador earlier this year in violation of a court order, was recently brought back to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. His potential release from pre-trial detention could happen as soon as next week. The government's stated intention to remove him before his criminal trial unfolds adds another layer of complexity to a case already marked by conflicting statements and legal challenges.</p>

          <p>As the UK braces for its third heatwave in four weeks, farmers are issuing stark warnings that wildfires are a "disaster waiting to happen" on tinder-dry land. Following the warmest and driest spring in decades, the risk is particularly high in upland areas where, some argue, the incentivized removal of grazing animals has led to a dangerous buildup of dry vegetation. The National Farmers' Union has called for urgent collaboration between the government, fire services, and farmers to review land management practices and improve prevention. The warning comes as the cost of farm fires in the UK has already seen a significant increase.</p>
