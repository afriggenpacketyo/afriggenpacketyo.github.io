          <p>This article provides a detailed fact-check of several recent economic claims made by President Trump, comparing his assertions to federal data and expert analysis. It scrutinizes statements on energy costs, gasoline prices, grocery bills, and mortgage rates, revealing a mixture of accurate, misleading, and incorrect information. While gas prices and mortgage rates have seen some decline, the analysis confirms that costs for electricity and most groceries have continued to rise, contrary to the president's claims. Economists cited in the article also dispute the assertion that inflation has been defeated, pointing to ongoing price pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Republican member of the South Carolina state house, RJ May, has formally agreed to plead guilty to federal charges related to the distribution of child sexual abuse material. Prosecutors revealed that May used the online alias “joebidennnn69” to exchange hundreds of explicit files involving toddlers and young children on a social media network. A prominent member of the conservative Freedom Caucus before his resignation, May now faces a lengthy prison sentence of five to twenty years for each of the five counts. The plea agreement also mandates that he register as a sex offender for life.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data suggests that a resilient stock market is bolstering consumer spending, potentially keeping the U.S. economy from entering a recession. Despite negative consumer sentiment surveys, spending and income figures for August were stronger than anticipated, supported by a 'wealth effect' from Wall Street's record highs. However, economists warn this stability could be precarious, as the benefits of market growth are concentrated among the top 10% of earners who own the vast majority of stocks. A significant market downturn could quickly reverse these trends and trigger a recession, especially with stagnant job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The gubernatorial race in New Jersey is intensifying, with affordability taking center stage as the key campaign issue. Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli is criticizing his Democratic opponent, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, for not ruling out a potential increase to the state's sales tax during a recent debate. While Sherrill later stated a tax hike was "off the table," Ciattarelli's campaign has framed her initial hesitation as a sign of fiscal irresponsibility. Both candidates are attempting to position themselves as the best choice to address New Jersey's rising cost of living, including significant utility rate hikes.</p>

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning its factory-based construction method as a viable solution to the nationwide housing affordability crisis. The company claims its process can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional on-site building. This innovative approach was recently demonstrated in Lahaina, Maui, where the company produced 82 homes in two months for wildfire victims, marking the first time FEMA has used modular homes for temporary housing. By manufacturing homes indoors, the company avoids weather delays and labor shortages, aiming to make homeownership more attainable for essential workers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has drawn criticism for advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol, linking its active ingredient, acetaminophen, to autism without scientific consensus. During a press conference, Trump suggested women should "tough it out" and only use the pain reliever sparingly, a stance that medical experts quickly condemned as irresponsible and potentially dangerous. Experts highlighted that an untreated fever during pregnancy can pose risks to the baby, and there is no established causative link between acetaminophen and autism. The comments are seen as another instance of the administration promoting unsubstantiated health guidance and contributing to the shaming of mothers.</p>

          <p>Nearly nine months after the destructive Eaton fire, residents of Altadena are grappling with the slow and arduous process of rebuilding their community, leading to widespread frustration and emotional exhaustion. While some homeowners are committed to resurrecting their properties, many are reconsidering due to the prospect of living in a construction zone for years, ongoing battles with insurance companies, and concerns about contamination. The gap between insurance payouts and rebuilding costs, averaging around $300,000, presents a major hurdle. This has created uncertainty about the future character of the beloved community as residents weigh financial and emotional tolls.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece revisits the 1977 case of a neo-Nazi group's planned march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors, to reflect on the modern debate over free speech. The ACLU's defense of the group's right to march, despite the offensive nature of their message, established a crucial legal precedent that the First Amendment protects even hateful speech. The author interviews the ACLU lawyer from the case, David Goldberger, who reflects on the personal pain the case caused but stands by the principle that free speech cannot be denied simply because it is offensive. The article connects this historical event to contemporary conflicts over expression.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements to Congress may face significant legal challenges due to President Trump's public animosity toward him. Legal experts argue that Trump's years of railing against Comey and his recent comments cheering the indictment provide strong evidence for a defense motion to dismiss the case on grounds of selective or vindictive prosecution. The case is further complicated by the recent installation of a Trump ally with no prosecutorial experience to lead the U.S. Attorney's office handling the case, and reports that career prosecutors had initially recommended against filing charges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new policy imposing a $100,000 fee for all new H-1B visa applications, a dramatic increase from the previous cost. The H-1B program is widely used by high-skill foreign professionals in sectors like technology, finance, and medicine. The administration's stated goal is to encourage companies to hire American workers and to use the revenue to reduce taxes and debt. However, economists warn that this move could harm the U.S. economy by constraining innovation, discouraging top global talent from coming to the U.S., and prompting companies to offshore jobs rather than hire domestically.</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are monitoring Hurricane Humberto, a major storm in the Atlantic, for a potential interaction with a nearby developing system that could produce a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two storms get close enough to become entangled around a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While this outcome is considered unlikely, the possibility adds a layer of unpredictability to the storm's forecast. The stronger storm, Humberto, would likely dominate the interaction, but both systems are being watched for potential impacts on the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new book, "107 Days," suggests the memoir details the steep challenges of her presidential campaign without fully acknowledging her own strategic failures. The book reportedly criticizes her running mate, Tim Walz, for his debate performance and reveals her preference for Pete Buttigieg, whom she felt she couldn't select. The analysis argues that the memoir avoids grappling with policy weaknesses on issues like immigration and inflation, and fails to address the role of identity politics in her defeat. The reviewer concludes that while Harris faced a difficult situation, the book does not demonstrate sufficient self-awareness about her campaign's shortcomings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, prominent figures in the Trump administration and the Christian right have increasingly framed the political landscape as a "spiritual war" against demonic evil. This rhetoric is closely associated with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a charismatic Christian movement that believes in combating demonic forces to bring society under God's dominion. Leaders within this movement have called Kirk the "first martyr of the third Great Awakening," casting his killing as a satanic act against God's anointed political agenda. This language is mobilizing followers who view Donald Trump as a divinely appointed leader.</p>

          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries from vehicles and backup power systems. In many low- and middle-income countries, used batteries are processed in unsafe, unregulated operations where lead dust contaminates surrounding communities, soil, and water. This exposure causes irreversible neurological damage and other severe health issues. Experts argue that the solution lies not in new technology but in policy changes, such as tax incentives and extended producer responsibility laws, which have proven successful in countries like Brazil.</p>

The policy would initially target convicted criminals and later expand to include individuals whose asylum applications have been rejected and who are reliant on social benefits. Germany has not deported anyone to Syria since 2012, but the government is now seeking to repatriate certain individuals following the fall of the Assad regime. The plan also includes establishing more systematic deportations to Afghanistan, a move criticized by human rights groups.</p>

Reeves has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the positive economic impact of such a deal into its forecasts, which could reduce the need for future tax hikes or spending cuts. The proposed scheme, which would allow young people aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK or EU for a few years, has faced criticism for being a partial return to freedom of movement.</p>

By brazenly admitting to controversial actions, such as his recent public pressure on the Justice Department to prosecute his political opponents, Trump projects an image of authenticity to his supporters. This approach, combined with the sheer volume of controversies, creates a constant state of crisis that diminishes the impact of any single event.

          <p>In response to Donald Trump's second term and low party approval ratings, many Democrats are shifting their communication style to be angrier, more direct, and frequently more profane. This change is part of a broader effort to appear more authentic and relatable, moving away from carefully polished talking points to a more combative, gut-level approach. From members of Congress using explicit language on social media to state leaders vowing to "punch back," the party is embracing a tougher tone to energize its base and fight back against what they see as an authoritarian slide. The strategy aims to combat perceptions of weakness and better compete in a media environment that rewards outrage.</p>
