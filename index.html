          <p>Elon Musk announced his impending departure from his role as a "special government employee" overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) within the Trump administration. Musk stated his mission to reduce wasteful spending has been successful, claiming to have cut around $160 billion, although some reports dispute this figure. His departure comes after criticisms of a budget bill backed by Trump, which Musk believes undermines DOGE's work. Musk's focus will now shift back to his companies, particularly Tesla, after some investors expressed concerns about his divided attention. The White House intends to make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through congressional action. </p>

          <p>An Argentine court declared a mistrial in the homicide case against the medical team of the late soccer superstar Diego Maradona. The ruling came after one of the court's judges recused herself due to ethical conflicts arising from her appearance in a television documentary about the case. Prosecutors argued that the judge's involvement in the documentary created a conflict that tainted the trial. Maradona's death in November 2020 at the age of 60 shocked the nation and led to investigations into the medical care he received. </p>

TD Cowen downgraded Starbucks due to concerns about labor investments and deteriorating value perceptions, but Cramer remains optimistic about Niccol's leadership and the company's potential for recovery.

          <p>A Swiss Alpine village, Blatten, was largely destroyed after a massive glacier carrying rock and debris detached and roared down the mountainside. Authorities had evacuated the entire village of 300 people prior to the event, but one person is reported missing. The collapse of the Birch Glacier has blocked a local river, forming a lake and posing a risk of torrential lava flow if the river overflows. Scientists attribute the glacier's unusual advance and subsequent collapse to climate change and increasingly frequent rockfalls. </p>

However, U.S. export controls are limiting Nvidia's sales in China, a market CEO Jensen Huang estimates could be worth $50 billion. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue.

          <p>The daughter of Juliana Leon, who died during the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, is suing seven oil and gas companies for wrongful death. The lawsuit alleges that the companies failed to warn the public about the dangers of planet-warming emissions and obscured the scientific consensus on global warming. This is the first wrongful death case targeting fossil fuel companies over their role in global warming, representing a major escalation in climate change litigation. The suit claims the companies knew for decades their products would dangerously alter the planet's atmosphere but continued production and suppressed public awareness. </p>

The letter begins with a poem by Palestinian poet Hiba Abu Nada, who was killed in an Israeli airstrike. Signatories include prominent writers such as Ian McEwan, Jeanette Winterson, and Zadie Smith. The letter calls for an end to the collective silence and inaction following tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths since October 7, 2023, and denounces antisemitism and anti-Jewish prejudice. </p>

The film struggles to balance the story of a young martial arts student becoming the teacher with the arrival of martial arts legends. Despite the charms of star Ben Wang, the movie is divided in its storytelling aims and relies on familiar tropes. The pacing is breakneck, and the fight sequences are frenetic, making it a less enjoyable experience overall. </p>

International students are critical to universities' finances and enhance campuses academically, but President Trump has suggested fewer admission slots should be set aside for them.
