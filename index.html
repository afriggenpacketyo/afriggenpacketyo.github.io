          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a sophisticated, family-operated drug trafficking ring in the UK. Deborah Mason recruited her children and other relatives to distribute cocaine worth up to £80 million across England, using the proceeds to fund a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. The gang communicated via encrypted apps and operated for seven months under police surveillance before their arrest, with other family members also receiving lengthy prison sentences for their roles.</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced plans to send a new military force to southern Syria to stop deadly clashes between Bedouin and Druze communities near Suweida, where over 700 people have reportedly been killed. The move comes amid accusations that government troops previously deployed to the area committed extrajudicial killings against Druze civilians, prompting Israeli airstrikes. A potential ceasefire brokered by the U.S., Turkey, and Jordan has been reported, as the UN raises alarms about widespread human rights violations and calls for accountability for the violence.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man from Cardiff has spoken about the severe physical and mental toll of being attacked by three dogs, an ordeal that left him with nightmares and unable to work. This personal account highlights a broader trend, as new data reveals a significant increase in dog attacks across England and Wales, with thousands requiring medical treatment annually. Survivors and medical experts emphasize the long-term consequences, including the need for reconstructive surgery and psychological support, as police forces report a 4% rise in recorded offenses in 2024.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese medical experts has developed a new method to produce personalized CAR-T cell therapies directly inside the human body, potentially making the treatment for blood cancers and other diseases more accessible and affordable. This innovative gene therapy approach is reportedly easier to program and could drastically reduce the cost from over one million yuan per treatment. The researchers successfully used this in-vivo technique to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, a significant advance published in the peer-reviewed journal The Lancet.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom, including London, are under an amber weather warning for dangerous flash flooding, with forecasters predicting that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours. The Met Office has cautioned that the recent heatwave has left the ground dry and hard, increasing the risk of fast-flowing surface water that could disrupt transport, cause power outages, and flood homes. This severe weather event follows a period of drought that led to hosepipe bans, and the intense rainfall is unlikely to alleviate long-term water shortages.</p>

          <p>The CEO of US tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave after a video of him embracing a woman at a Coldplay concert went viral and sparked online rumors of an affair. The clip showed the pair quickly hiding their faces when they appeared on the stadium's large screen, prompting a comment from the band's lead singer. The company has launched a formal investigation, stating that its leaders are expected to set a high standard of conduct and has appointed a co-founder as interim CEO while the inquiry proceeds.</p>

          <h2>California's Workplace Safety Agency Critically Understaffed, State Audit Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 21:51:52 EDT</div>

          <p>A California state audit has revealed that the Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is suffering from critical understaffing, impairing its ability to protect the state's 19 million workers. With a 32% vacancy rate last year, the agency has reportedly closed complaint and accident cases without conducting on-site inspections and has documented cases poorly. Labor advocates and the state auditor argue that this chronic understaffing has crippled enforcement of safety standards, leaving workers vulnerable, especially as new climate-related hazards like extreme heat emerge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit alleges the newspaper knowingly published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a sexually suggestive birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, complete with a crude drawing. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter, labeling the story as fake news and an attempt to link him to the disgraced financier, as he faces increasing pressure to release government files on the Epstein investigation.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man on Long Island has died from severe injuries sustained after being pulled into an active MRI machine. According to police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders after hearing a relative scream during a scan. The powerful magnetic force of the machine violently pulled the chain and the man towards it, causing fatal injuries. The incident serves as a tragic reminder of the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI technology, which can turn metallic objects into dangerous projectiles.</p>

The announcement comes as Israeli intelligence officials reportedly visited Washington to discuss potential relocation plans for Palestinians remaining in Gaza with third-party countries.</p>
