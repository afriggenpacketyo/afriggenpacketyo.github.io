The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned, but later canceled, immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area. The driver fled after the shooting but later returned and abandoned the vehicle, which had multiple bullet holes. The FBI is leading the investigation into the confrontation, which escalated tensions at a protest that had earlier seen authorities use smoke grenades and flash bangs.</p>

          <p>India's largest private refiner, Reliance Industries, is reportedly stopping its purchases of Russian crude oil following new U.S. sanctions against Russian firms Rosneft and Lukoil. This move could significantly impact Reliance's profit margins, as discounted Russian crude constitutes over half of its current supply. While alternative sources from the Middle East or the Americas are available, they are unlikely to be as inexpensive. The decision highlights the complex economic and geopolitical pressures India faces in navigating its energy needs amid international sanctions on Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A survey of family offices, which manage the wealth of ultra-high-net-worth families, reveals a cautious investment stance following the announcement of new tariffs. Many now see cash and liquid assets as the safest bet for returns, a shift from previous optimism for growth equities. Respondents expressed concerns about the potential depreciation of the U.S. dollar and lowered their portfolio return expectations for the upcoming year. This move towards liquidity is seen as a defensive strategy to mitigate risk while also preparing to capitalize on future market opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review: Bruce Springsteen Biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' Falls Short of Capturing Album's Spirit</h2>

          <p>This review critiques the new Bruce Springsteen biopic, "Deliver Me From Nowhere," arguing that it reduces the artistic complexity of his 1982 album *Nebraska* to a simple story of paternal conflict. The film focuses heavily on Springsteen's troubled relationship with his father as the sole inspiration for the album's dark, stripped-down songs. The author contends that this autobiographical framing overlooks the album's broader engagement with American musical traditions and iconography. The article suggests the movie misses the opportunity to explore the full artistic and cultural depth of one of Springsteen's most influential works.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has controversially demolished the historic East Wing of the White House to clear the site for a planned $300 million ballroom. The rapid demolition, conducted during a government shutdown, has raised legal and ethical questions, as it proceeded without the typical review from federal commissions. The project is reportedly being funded by private donations from major corporations and wealthy individuals, a model that critics argue creates potential conflicts of interest. This move is part of a series of changes President Trump has made to the White House aesthetic.</p>

This commentary argues that Ohtani's ability to excel in both roles is a rare and celebrated feat in modern baseball.

          <p>Philip Pullman's new trilogy, *The Book of Dust*, a companion to his famous *His Dark Materials* series, delves into the concept of dangerous books and ideas. The article connects this theme to the real-world controversy and banning campaigns that targeted Pullman's original work for its anti-religious themes. In the new series, the central conflict involves characters who become estranged from their souls after falling under the influence of books preaching moral relativism. This narrative serves as Pullman's commentary on modern culture wars, suggesting that while ideas can be dangerous, the solution is not censorship but engagement with better stories.</p>
