            <p>President Trump has implemented substantial tariffs against numerous U.S. trading partners, including a significant 104% tariff on China, effective Wednesday. Trump defends these tariffs as reciprocal measures to rectify long-standing trade imbalances, asserting they will stimulate negotiations and boost the U.S. economy. However, the announcement has triggered significant stock market losses, reflecting investor apprehension about the potential economic repercussions of these trade policies. Businesses are now weighing the impacts of these changes. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The small country of Liechtenstein is facing significant economic challenges due to President Trump's imposition of 37% tariffs on its exports to the U.S. These tariffs, nearly double those applied to its European neighbors, target Liechtenstein's high-quality products such as power tools and dental fillings. The country's leaders express confusion and concern over the disproportionate impact, especially given Liechtenstein's limited global influence and peaceful, stable business environment. Some fear the tariffs pose a greater crisis than the COVID-19 pandemic due to the uncertainty surrounding future trade decisions.</p>

These funding pauses include grants and contracts with federal departments like health, education, and defense. The move follows similar actions against other universities and is part of a broader crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus protests.</p>
