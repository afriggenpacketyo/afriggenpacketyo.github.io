          <p>At least five people were killed in overnight Russian drone and missile strikes in and around Kyiv, Ukraine, with officials describing the attacks as "massive." The strikes caused scores of injuries and fires in residential areas, damaging six of Kyiv's ten districts and destroying the entrance of a high-rise residential building in the Shevchenkivskyi district. A 68-year-old woman was also killed in the broader Kyiv region due to the aerial bombardment. The strikes occurred a day after Ukraine's commander-in-chief vowed to increase strikes on Russia, though there was no immediate comment from Russia regarding the attack. The aftermath involves rescue workers assisting people from damaged structures amidst ongoing fires.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, driven by U.S. pressure amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East. The proposed 5% target includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some member states are on track, others still fall short of the existing 2% threshold, leading to potential clashes with the U.S. over commitment levels. European aerospace and defense companies emphasize the need for concrete government procurement to scale up production capabilities, as pledges alone are insufficient to address defense needs.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at lowering energy costs for businesses and stimulating economic growth. A key component is the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will cut energy costs for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green energy levies. The strategy also includes measures to expedite grid connections for new factories, upskill British workers, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has hailed the plan as a turning point for Britain's economy, supporting key industries and creating over one million new jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth following its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown resilience, even outgrowing all G7 nations in 2024. However, as 2026 approaches, the economic outlook is shifting, with high inflation, soaring interest rates, and labor shortages plaguing the country. While some analysts predict a mild downturn with rising unemployment, others suggest the economy is on the verge of recession due to declining oil and gas revenues and reduced spending on infrastructure. Although the economy's ability to grow and diversify in the coming years may be affected, Russia's military capabilities are not expected to be seriously impeded in the short term.

          <h2>NHS Ketamine Clinic Proposed for Treatment-Resistant Depression</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a ketamine clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy. This follows the opening of a private clinic offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The aim is to provide an additional option for patients who do not respond well to traditional treatments, although caution is advised due to potential risks associated with ketamine misuse.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained calm, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained. The MSCI World index saw only a slight decline, and safe havens traded mixed, indicating a limited market reaction. Analysts suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, diminishing the immediate nuclear threat. Traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, but the overall impact on global markets is not seen as a systemic risk.

The family is calling for clearer rules for e-bike usage, highlighting the lack of regulation and the potential dangers posed to pedestrians. The government is considering new offenses and penalties for dangerous cycling, and trauma surgeons are reporting a spike in e-bike-related injuries.</p>

          <p>Western leaders are facing criticism for their feeble response to the escalating conflict between the U.S., Israel, and Iran, with their actions viewed as dissonant with the gravity of the moment. Despite public anger and alarm, mainstream liberal parties are seen as inert, failing to challenge the root causes of the conflict. They are accused of deferring to Israel and the U.S. while ignoring international and human rights laws. The leaders' calls for diplomacy are viewed as hollow, as they continue to support a status quo that perpetuates violence and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, faces significant challenges as NATO sets ambitious goals, including increased defense spending and troop numbers. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, achieving NATO's target of 5% of GDP for defense spending is debated within the coalition government. Experts emphasize the need for increased investment in the armed forces due to the threat posed by Russia, but questions remain about how Germany will recruit tens of thousands of additional soldiers. The potential withdrawal of U.S. troops from Europe could further increase pressure on Germany to bolster its military capabilities.</p>

While some countries are hesitant, the alliance is trying to balance these concerns with the need to present a united front against potential threats, with the summit deliberately planned as a brief exchange to not bore Trump.</p>

Preliminary results based on first-choice votes will be available shortly after polls close, but the ranked choice tabulations will not begin until July 1.
