          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is urging Wall Street to adopt a more optimistic view of Apple, citing stronger-than-expected early demand for the new iPhone 17 models. He argues that positive remarks from CEO Tim Cook and strong pre-order numbers in key markets suggest that analysts' current estimates are too conservative. Cramer's bullish position contrasts with some analysts who have pointed to potentially weaker demand based on preorder lead times, but he insists that the early sales data indicates a breakout moment for the company's stock.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times and Penguin Random House, citing procedural violations. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday sharply criticized the complaint as an improper use of the legal system, calling it a "megaphone for public relations" rather than a legitimate legal document. The judge did not rule on the merits of the defamation claim, giving Trump's legal team 28 days to refile the lawsuit in a manner that conforms to civil procedure rules.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated he does not believe President Donald Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary impact on the U.S. economy, placing him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee. Miran, who recently dissented from a rate decision by advocating for a larger cut, argued there is no material evidence of tariffs driving up prices in a way that would require a monetary policy response. He also predicted stronger economic growth in the second half of the year and suggested that immigration policies would have a disinflationary effect. (not investment advice)</p>

If approved, the change would be optional, letting companies decide their reporting frequency, though critics worry it could reduce transparency for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated a legal battle over passport policy to the Supreme Court, seeking to enforce its rule that requires passports to reflect an individual's "biological sex at birth." This action aims to overturn a lower court's injunction that currently allows transgender and nonbinary Americans to self-select an "M," "F," or "X" gender marker. The administration argues that the policy is a lawful exercise of foreign policy authority, while opponents contend it is discriminatory and unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>This opinion article criticizes Silicon Valley's latest solution to the loneliness epidemic: AI-powered companions. The author argues that the tech industry is attempting to sell a cure for a social sickness that its own products, such as addictive social media and isolating entertainment platforms, helped create. The piece contends that replacing genuine human interaction with simulated friendships fails to address the root cause of the problem and is akin to a polluter selling water purifiers instead of stopping the pollution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities have revealed that the suspect in the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk was motivated by a belief that Kirk was spreading hatred. According to prosecutors, the suspect, Tyler Robinson, expressed this sentiment in text messages to his roommate, stating, "Some hate can't be negotiated out." Robinson's mother also told police that her son had become more politically left-wing and focused on pro-gay and trans rights issues over the past year, providing insight into his state of mind before the attack.</p>

          <p>Leading late-night television hosts, including Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, have publicly criticized ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel and his show. The suspension followed pressure related to Kimmel's comments about President Donald Trump's reaction to the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Colbert labeled the network's action as "blatant censorship," while Stewart used satire to mock the idea of a "government-approved" show, sparking a wider debate about free speech and media independence.</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is making a strategic push to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade that was lost during recent years of severe drought. To lure carriers back, the canal plans to reinstate a preferred booking system for LNG tankers and is developing a new pipeline project, called the Interoceanic Energy Corridor, to transport natural gas liquids and free up canal slots. These moves are aimed at making the route more reliable and flexible for energy shippers who had shifted to longer, alternative sea routes. (not investment advice)</p>
