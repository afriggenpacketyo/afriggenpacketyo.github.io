        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged, a move that follows the monetary easing measures implemented last month aimed at stimulating economic growth. The 1-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0%, while the 5-year LPR stays at 3.5%, aligning with market expectations. This decision comes after Chinese authorities reduced lending rates for the first time since October in response to trade tensions with Washington, and some analysts suggest a restrained approach to further monetary easing, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. Despite recent volatility in the forex market, Chinese officials express confidence in their ability to manage it, while the PBOC aims to expand the international use of the digital yuan.

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, along with other protected lands commemorating significant moments in American civil rights history, is at risk of being sold for parts due to a legal opinion released by the Justice Department. This opinion grants presidents the authority to revoke or shrink certain national monuments, potentially impacting the preservation of historical sites. Proposed budget cuts for the National Park Service could also force the closure of over 300 park sites, including the Emmett Till monument, which consists of sites in Mississippi and Illinois that tell the story of Emmett Till's lynching. Advocates are working to expand the monument, emphasizing the importance of learning from the past to prevent future tragedies, while the White House maintains that it is keeping parks ready for peak season and restoring truth to American history.</p>

          <p>President Trump marked Juneteenth with a post on Truth Social, asserting that the United States has "too many non-working holidays" that are costing the country billions of dollars. While the post didn't explicitly mention Juneteenth, it suggested a need for change to "MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" Juneteenth, a federal holiday since 2021, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., and while government offices, banks, and stock exchanges are generally closed, private businesses aren't required to close. Although Trump honored Juneteenth during his first term, his recent remarks contrast with the bipartisan support that led to its recognition as a federal holiday.</p>

          <p>Wyndham Clark has admitted to and expressed regret for his outburst in the locker room after missing the cut at the 2025 U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club. The golfer acknowledged making a mistake and apologized for his actions, which included damaging locker doors, and he hopes to move forward and focus on the rest of the year. Clark's last nine months have been largely disappointing, with only one top 10 finish, but he began the Travelers Championship with a strong opening round.

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a surge of 101.7% year-over-year. This follows significant increases in April and March, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate prices of this staple food. Japan's core inflation rate has also climbed to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, with rice prices significantly contributing to this inflation. While the central bank held rates steady, it acknowledges the pressure from rising food prices and the potential impact of geopolitical tensions on energy prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks the first time these bonds, typically designated for revenue-generating construction projects, will be used to cover government arrears. The proceeds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing the completion of ongoing construction, clearing obligations, and reducing fiscal risk. While this move is seen as a step in the right direction, some experts caution that the allocated sum may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt.</p>

The judge deemed the policy arbitrary and capricious, lacking specificity in how states should cooperate and noting that Congress did not authorize the Secretary of Transportation to impose immigration enforcement conditions on transportation funds.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers stated they denied ICE agents access to the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, but ICE countered that its agents were never there, adding to anxiety in the city. Homeland security presence follows heightened immigration enforcement actions in LA, with rumors circulating that the stadium, which has a large Latino fanbase, might be a target. Local journalists reported seeing DHS vehicles and masked officers near the stadium, while protesters gathered at Dodger Stadium soon after. The Dodgers have faced criticism for not speaking up for LA's immigrant community, and they plan to announce plans for helping affected communities.</p>

          <p>According to a national security expert, a U.S. attack on Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The facility is built deep inside a mountain, and the exact nature of its protective concrete and metal is not fully known. While an attack would cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it, and Iran could resume its program relatively easily. Continued military strikes are not a good option, and the best solution is to get Iran to agree to roll back and end its capabilities.</p>

Dissidents report receiving threatening messages and phone calls, and their relatives in Belarus are being visited by authorities.

          <p>A deadly listeria outbreak has led to a voluntary recall of ready-to-eat chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Kroger and Walmart. The outbreak, linked to products made by FreshRealm, Inc., has resulted in 17 illnesses, three deaths, and one fetal loss. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service is investigating the outbreak and urges consumers not to consume the recalled products. FreshRealm initiated the recall out of an abundance of caution, though they have not received any direct reports of illness associated with the product.</p>

          <p>The editor of BBC Breakfast, Richard Frediani, is taking an extended period of leave after allegations about his behaviour were reported in the media. An HR adviser from consultancy firm PwC is also supporting the corporation as it looks into the culture of the BBC One morning programme. The BBC said it takes "all complaints about conduct at work extremely seriously and will not tolerate behaviour that is not in line with our values".</p>
