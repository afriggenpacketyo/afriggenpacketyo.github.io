          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 19:52:15 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes reciprocal 15% tariffs on exports and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. The agreement is also set to open Japan's markets to American products like cars, trucks, and rice, with the administration claiming it will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. This development comes after threats of a higher 25% tariff, leading some economists to view the 15% rate as a relief. The deal addresses a key economic relationship, as automotive exports are a cornerstone of Japan's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary "Prince of Darkness" who defined the heavy metal genre with his band Black Sabbath, has died at the age of 76. His family confirmed his passing, stating he was surrounded by loved ones. Osbourne, who had publicly battled Parkinson's disease and other health issues, was a transformative figure in music, known for his menacing stage persona and later as a beloved, doting father on the reality show "The Osbournes."

The author suggests these actions, championed by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, reflect a view that women are a distraction and that their promotions were part of a "woke" agenda. This trend, the author contends, sends a chilling message to the over 225,000 women serving in uniform that their advancement is limited.

Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in profit from their primary home sale from taxation. Proponents, like the National Association of Realtors, argue the current tax creates a "stay-put penalty" that locks older homeowners in place and restricts housing inventory.

          <p>China's ambitious "Qianfan" satellite internet project, envisioned as a rival to SpaceX's Starlink, may be encountering significant delays. The company leading the project is required by international regulations to deploy a substantial portion of its planned 15,000-satellite constellation within a set timeframe to retain its allocated radio frequencies. However, according to an industry engineer, a severe shortage of rockets is hindering China's manufacturing and launch capacity. This bottleneck could jeopardize the project's goal of providing global direct-to-phone internet services by 2030.</p>

          <p>More than 120 criminal cases in Boston, including some involving assault, were dismissed on Tuesday because the defendants could not be provided with a court-appointed attorney. The dismissals are the latest consequence of a months-long work stoppage by public defenders over a pay dispute with the state of Massachusetts. Citing a legal protocol, the judge was forced to drop the charges after defendants went 45 days without legal representation. This highlights a growing crisis in the state's justice system, raising concerns about both public safety and the constitutional right to counsel.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has determined the probable cause of the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola.

These factors, combined with turbulent downdrafts, likely resulted in the pilot losing control of the aircraft in the remote Alaskan terrain. Peltola was the sole occupant of the plane.</p>
