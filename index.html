          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was released from the hospital after receiving treatment for an inflammation of the inner ear, which caused him to experience vertigo. Hospital officials in Brasilia stated that imaging and blood tests came back normal, and the 79-year-old president is now resting at the official presidential residence. Lula, who is expected to run for reelection next year, has a history of medical issues, including a past bout with throat cancer.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is encouraging doctors in England to vote against industrial action in an upcoming ballot, emphasizing the need to work with the government to improve the NHS. Resident doctors are considering strikes due to concerns that a 5.4% average pay rise is insufficient to address past below-inflation pay awards. Streeting, who previously agreed to a 22% pay rise over two years, argues that strikes would hinder progress in the NHS.</p>
