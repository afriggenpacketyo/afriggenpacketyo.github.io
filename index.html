          <p>A New York Times article reports that a group of migrants, including those from Vietnam, Cuba, and Mexico, are stuck in Djibouti due to a legal dispute over their deportation. President Trump confirmed their location after a federal judge in Boston found their initial deportation from Texas violated an order requiring reasonable notice before deportation to a non-native country. A lawyer for the migrants expressed concern for their health and welfare, especially regarding access to food, water, and humane treatment. The judge ordered that the individuals have access to counsel in Djibouti, while Trump criticized the judge's decision and urged the Supreme Court to intervene.</p>

          <p>According to a Los Angeles Times article, Justin Halstenberg was convicted of igniting the Line fire, which burned 44,000 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains and injured six firefighters. Halstenberg was found guilty of aggravated arson and possession of flammable materials and faces a maximum life sentence. Prosecutors presented evidence showing he deliberately started three fires within an hour, with the third becoming the Line fire, which forced the evacuation of over 11,000 residents. The article also notes that Halstenberg's mother defended him, claiming he did not start the fire, but prosecutors argued he had practiced starting fires previously.</p>

The Johnsons have secured housing in Peru and filed a congressional inquiry, seeking accountability and policy reform. Amanda Johnson argues that vaccination status should not be a barrier to travel for military dependents, especially when the host country has no such requirements.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that the Trump administration is threatening to bar international students from Harvard, revoking the university's access to the SEVIS database. This action, which would affect over a quarter of Harvard's student body, is seen as retaliation for Harvard's refusal to comply with demands to change its hiring, admissions, and curriculum practices. The move has caused fear and confusion among international students, who worry about their degrees, visas, and future employment prospects. The article highlights the potential devastation to the university's identity and culture, as well as its financial stability, should international enrollment be halted.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explains how the Trump administration is attempting to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students by revoking its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). This database is essential for managing and tracking international student enrollment, and without access, Harvard would be unable to log students into the system, effectively making them deportable. The article notes that this action is a significant escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to align with its agenda. Legal experts suggest Harvard is likely to challenge the termination in federal court, arguing it is retaliatory and exceeds the administration's authority.</p>

Experts are closely monitoring the variant, which is dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. Preliminary data suggests it may be more transmissible due to its ability to bind to human cells.

The administration argues that the agreement incentivizes unauthorized border crossings and hinders the government's ability to detain and remove families. Critics argue that ending these protections is unconscionable, especially given the ongoing detention and separation of children from their families. The move follows other actions targeting children, including family detention and policies making it difficult for family members to take custody of unaccompanied children.</p>

The increase has the central bank considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates based on price trends, while also monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. Economists expect core inflation to ease in coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. The article notes that U.S. tariffs could lead to lower food prices, while government subsidies for electricity and gas will also create downward pressure on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
