          <p>A former FBI agent, who was pardoned by President Trump after being charged for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, has been appointed to the Justice Department's "Weaponization Working Group." Jared Wise was on trial for allegedly encouraging rioters to attack police before receiving the pardon. His new role involves serving as an investigator and counselor, an appointment that has drawn scrutiny given his past actions and charges. The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 35% on Japan if a new trade agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. This would be a significant increase from the current 10% levy most Japanese exports face. The threat comes as negotiations stall, with Trump expressing doubt that a deal can be made and criticizing Japan's policies on US rice imports. Japan's government has stated it will not make concessions that could harm its agricultural sector, heightening tensions between the two allied nations.</p>

          <p>Protesters gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim in Orange County to oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes over $1 trillion in cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. Activists, including nurses and healthcare advocates, argue these cuts would be devastating for the millions of Californians who rely on these services.

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the "Quad," have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. This move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the market for minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. The joint statement emphasized concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before the previously established deadline of February 2026. The Brooklyn-based judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The White House has stated its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic shift for the company's contract chip manufacturing business. The potential change involves deprioritizing external sales of its 18A process technology, which has struggled to attract new customers amid production delays. Instead, the company may focus resources on its next-generation 14A process to better compete with rival TSMC for major clients like Apple and Nvidia. This move would represent a departure from the previous CEO's strategy and could involve a substantial financial write-off for the billions invested in 18A development.</p>

The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive deportation policies, which include empowering officials to swiftly deport migrants without asylum hearings and halting nearly all migrant releases into the U.S. The numbers represent a stark contrast to the record-high levels of crossings seen under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel has agreed to the conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Hamas. He urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is the best they will get and that the situation will only worsen otherwise. The president did not provide specific details of the proposal, which he said would be delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt. There has been no public confirmation from either Israel or Hamas regarding the agreement, which comes after previous ceasefire efforts have failed to end the 21-month conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature spending proposal, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," has generated significant controversy due to its vast scope and political implications. The 940-page bill extends tax cuts from 2017, provides small business support, and allocates massive funding for defense and border security. However, it also implements major cuts to social welfare programs like Medicaid and is projected to add trillions to the national debt, sparking criticism from figures like Elon Musk. The legislation passed the House and Senate by razor-thin margins, highlighting deep divisions even within the Republican party.</p>

The subpoenas compel the schools to provide a wide range of records and communications, which will inform potential legislative reforms to address anticompetitive practices in higher education.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, often called "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, known as "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's community was heavily affected by PFAS waste from manufacturer 3M, which contaminated local groundwater.

Analysts warn that export growth is likely to slow or even contract due to several factors. These include a payback effect from front-loaded orders earlier in the year and an anticipated slowdown in U.S. consumer spending. Despite these emerging pressure points, many economists believe China can still achieve its annual GDP growth target of approximately 5%, though the path forward appears difficult.</p>
