          <p>The article discusses the changing role of tech stocks, particularly Apple, as a safe haven during market volatility. Apple's recent underperformance compared to its sector and the broader market raises questions about the tech sector's reliability as a safe investment. Investors are now diversifying into broader market funds and traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Experts suggest that the market is becoming more accepting of volatility, and investors are using traditional hedging strategies with fixed income ETFs, while some believe geopolitical events present buying opportunities in tech, particularly AI-related stocks.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties. The market's reaction suggests investors are hopeful for a de-escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The price of U.S. crude oil fell by over 7%, reaching its lowest level since Israel's bombing of Iran began earlier in June. Some analysts believe President Trump's strategy of escalating tensions has successfully created an opportunity for de-escalation.</p>

The mission's success relied heavily on keeping Iran in the dark, using decoy bombers and stealth technology, and pilots had to conduct multiple midair refuelings.

          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to proscribe Palestine Action under anti-terror law, effectively branding the group a terrorist organization. The decision follows an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and spray-painted military planes red. Cooper stated that Palestine Action has a "long history of unacceptable criminal damage" and that the government will not tolerate those who put national security at risk. Palestine Action has called the government's action "unhinged" and maintains that their actions target companies arming Israel's alleged genocide.</p>

          <p>Colombian police have arrested four people suspected of murdering Italian scientist Alessandro Coatti, whose dismembered remains were found in Santa Marta. Coatti was reportedly lured to an abandoned house through a dating app, where he was robbed and killed. Police received a tip-off after offering a reward for information, leading them to a house with traces of blood. Coatti, who worked for Britain's Royal Society of Biology, was described by colleagues as a respected and dedicated scientist.</p>

          <p>Florida officials have requested the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce a new immigration law that criminalizes unlawful entry into Florida. The state is challenging a federal judge's decision that deemed the law likely unconstitutional. Florida's Attorney General argues that the law is necessary to protect the state's citizens from the harms of illegal immigration. The law has faced legal challenges from migrants and advocacy groups, who argue it is preempted by federal law and violates the Constitution.</p>

          <p>US regulators are expected to weigh one of the most dramatic rollbacks of bank capital rules since the 2008 financial crisis. The change that the Federal Reserve will consider would affect the so-called enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), a rule that calls for the largest US banks to hold additional minimum capital based solely on their size. The largest and most important US lenders currently must keep those eSLR ratios at 5%. The proposal being considered by regulators would lower that requirement by 1.5 percentage points, according to a Bloomberg report. (not investment advice)</p>
