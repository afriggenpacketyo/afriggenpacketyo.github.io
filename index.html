        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, accusing him of employing "mafioso" tactics in the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz condemned Carr's explicit threats to ABC over Kimmel's controversial monologue regarding the slain conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, labeling them "dangerous as hell" and reminiscent of a mobster's intimidation. Despite personally being "thrilled" by Kimmel's firing, the Texas Republican warned that government intervention in media content to silence critics could ultimately harm conservative interests by setting a dangerous precedent. This incident underscores a growing national debate over free speech, media regulation, and the appropriate limits of the FCC's authority, with President Trump notably disagreeing with Cruz's assessment of Carr's actions.</p>

          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has voiced concerns that the US's waning interest in regional relations and its weakening partnership with India are undermining American-led alliances in Asia. This erosion, particularly within the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) involving Australia, India, Japan, and the United States, creates strategic openings for China. The researcher specifically cited President Trump's decreased engagement with the Quad framework and the deteriorating US-India partnership, highlighted by Trump's decision not to attend a summit in New Delhi. From Japan's perspective, these developments are potentially dangerous for maintaining regional balance against China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced ordering a third lethal kinetic strike against a vessel in the Caribbean, which he claimed was trafficking illicit narcotics. The strike, the second this week, reportedly killed three individuals whom Trump referred to as "narcoterrorists." The administration justifies these actions by categorizing drug cartels as terrorist organizations, allowing for military force to prevent imminent attacks. Critics, however, question the legal basis for these strikes, raising concerns about potential war crimes and the shift from traditional law enforcement methods.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has revealed extensive fraud on Walmart's online marketplace, where third-party sellers have been found selling counterfeit and potentially dangerous products, sometimes by impersonating legitimate businesses.

The article details instances of identity theft and pressure on Walmart's vetting team to approve sellers for growth.

          <p>This article explains the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) function and its authority regarding broadcast licenses, particularly in the context of President Trump's suggestions to revoke licenses from critical TV networks. The FCC, established in 1934, primarily regulates local TV and radio stations, ensuring they operate in the "public interest." While it does not directly oversee national networks, its power over local affiliates and corporate mergers can be significant.

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a "productive" phone call with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, claiming Xi approved a deal for TikTok's US operations to be sold to American investors. China's state news agency, however, offered a more cautious statement, welcoming negotiations without confirming a deal. The potential agreement aims to allow TikTok to continue operating in the US, using algorithm technology licensed from ByteDance, but concerns about Chinese Communist Party influence persist among US lawmakers. Trump emphasized the app's "tremendous value" and its role in his 2024 campaign.</p>

Critics argue her detention reflects misplaced priorities in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, which targets individuals without criminal convictions.

          <p>Evans Kibet, a Kenyan athlete captured in Ukraine, claims he was tricked into joining the Russian army after being offered a sports agent trip to Russia, then forced to sign papers he didn't understand. The 36-year-old aspiring long-distance runner, now a prisoner-of-war, expressed fears for his life if repatriated to Russia and a desperate desire to return to his family in Kenya. Ukrainian officials confirm he is among foreign recruits, noting some are deceived, while others join voluntarily. Kibet's family and the Kenyan authorities are now seeking his repatriation.</p>

The memorial, to be located in central London's St James's Park, will also feature a bridge, new gardens, and a statue of Prince Philip, with its final design revealed in 2026. Jennings, known for depicting other royals, expressed his elation at the commission and his intent to consider public sentiment in the design.

While organizers emphasize cultural exchange, Ukrainian officials condemn it as "hostile propaganda" designed to divert attention from the war.

Several protesters were arrested, and videos showed agents in riot gear using force, which critics, including Illinois's lieutenant governor, condemned as a "violent abuse of power."

This shift, which could reduce vaccine uptake, comes after HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, replaced all committee members and fired the CDC chief. The panel also made changes to MMRV vaccine recommendations and delayed a vote on the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, despite scientific consensus on its safety and effectiveness.

          <p>UCLA has enacted new campus protest rules, some of which align with Trump administration demands to crack down on demonstrators, following threats to its research funding. The guidelines formalize bans on unauthorized overnight encampments and mask-wearing during policy violations, policies cited by the government after a pro-Palestinian encampment. While the university maintains its commitment to content-neutral enforcement, some rules reflect federal pressure. However, other policies expand free speech zones and allow preapproved overnight events, differing from the administration's broader prohibitions. Student leaders express concern about the rules' breadth and potential for discretionary enforcement.</p>
