        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has signaled that President Trump's self-imposed July deadlines for finalizing trade deals are not absolute. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the dates are "not critical" and could be extended, providing more time for negotiations with the European Union and other countries. This represents a softening of the administration's previous stance, which had threatened significant tariffs if agreements were not reached. The president retains the option to impose reciprocal tariffs if he believes it would be advantageous for the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key procedural ruling has complicated Republican efforts to pass President Trump's tax and immigration bill, which relies heavily on Medicaid cuts to fund its tax reductions. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough rejected a provision that would cap federal Medicaid funding collected by states, a move that significantly impacts the bill's budget calculations. Despite frustration and accusations of partisanship from some members, mainstream Senate Republicans have stated they will not overrule the parliamentarian, a rare procedural move. They will instead attempt to rework the legislation to comply with Senate rules, potentially delaying its passage past the July Fourth deadline.</p>

          <p>Following the approval of the merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon Steel, President Donald Trump has personally acquired unprecedented veto power over the American company's key operations. This authority is enabled by a "golden share" arrangement, detailed in a corporate charter filed with the SEC, which was a condition of the national security agreement allowing the merger. Trump can block decisions such as closing production sites, moving headquarters, or cutting employee salaries. After Trump leaves office, this veto power will transfer to the Treasury and Commerce Departments, ensuring continued government oversight.</p>

He criticized President Trump's policies on trade and immigration while sidestepping questions about a potential 2028 presidential run.

This transition reflects a broader trend in the tech industry, where companies are leveraging AI to enhance efficiency and cut costs, which has also led to workforce reductions at Salesforce and other firms.

The decision has been met with shock and condemnation from global health experts and philanthropists, including Bill Gates, who warned of "devastating consequences" and millions of preventable deaths. Gavi, which has helped vaccinate over a billion children in low-income countries, had been expecting a $1.6 billion commitment from the U.S. for 2026-2030. Experts called the move a "travesty and a nightmare" that will undermine global health efforts.</p>

China has become a primary investor in Brazil's energy sector, particularly in clean technologies like wind and solar.

The review highlights a focus on new projects at the expense of core data quality and a reluctance at senior levels to address difficult news.

          <p>Sae Joon Park, a 55-year-old U.S. Army veteran who earned a Purple Heart for being wounded in combat, has voluntarily deported himself to South Korea after living in the United States for nearly 50 years. Park, a legal permanent resident, says past legal troubles stemming from a drug addiction used to cope with PTSD made him a target of the Trump administration's immigration policies. Despite his honorable military service, a past conviction prevented him from obtaining citizenship and led to a removal order. He chose to leave voluntarily rather than be detained and deported by ICE.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable underdog story, 21-year-old British tennis player Oliver Tarvet has qualified for the main singles draw at Wimbledon. Ranked 719th in the world, Tarvet, who plays on the U.S. collegiate circuit for the University of San Diego, defeated a much higher-ranked opponent in the final qualifying round. His victory contributes to the largest contingent of British players in the Wimbledon singles draw in 41 years. Due to amateur athlete rules, Tarvet will only be able to claim a small fraction of the Â£66,000 prize money for reaching the first round.</p>

          <h2>Senator Warren Investigates Oil Companies' Lobbying for Tax Break in GOP Bill</h2>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers are demanding answers from oil companies ConocoPhillips and Ovintiv about their lobbying efforts to secure a major tax break in the Republican reconciliation bill. The provision, worth an estimated $1.1 billion, would exempt fossil fuel companies from the 15% corporate alternative minimum tax established in 2022. The senators sent letters pressing the companies for details on their lobbying expenditures and the financial benefits they would receive. Warren condemned the proposal as an insulting handout to Big Oil while the bill simultaneously cuts clean energy incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Proposed $5 Million 'Trump Card' Visa Faces Legal and Market Hurdles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 12:36:00 EDT</div>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal for a $5 million "Trump Card" to grant residency to wealthy foreigners is facing significant legal and practical challenges, according to immigration attorneys. While the plan has generated tens of thousands of inquiries, key obstacles remain, including the need for congressional approval to alter existing visa programs and the tax code. A major hurdle is the plan to exempt cardholders from taxes on their worldwide income, a benefit not available to U.S. citizens. Experts also question the market size, suggesting actual demand will be far lower than White House projections. (not investment advice)</p>
