          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans, possibly with inside assistance, leading to a manhunt and internal investigation. The inmates, including four charged with second-degree murder, broke through a cell wall and escaped through a loading dock, abandoning their uniforms nearby. Sheriff Susan Hutson suggested the escape was facilitated by defective locks and doors, as well as potential assistance from within the department, leading to the suspension of three employees. The escape prompted criticism from officials and a reward offer for information leading to the capture of the remaining escapees. This New York Times article provides a comprehensive overview of the incident, including the security failures and the ongoing search efforts.</p>

          <p>This article from DW examines the upcoming presidential election in Poland and its potential impact on the pro-European, center-left government led by Donald Tusk. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party. The outcome will determine whether Tusk can advance his reform plans, which have been hindered by the current president's vetoes and referrals to the constitutional court.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing visibility to drop to zero in some areas and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the region. The storm, fueled by high winds over dry farmlands, forced drivers to pull over and temporarily halted flights at Midway International Airport. Residents described the experience as surreal, with dirt filling the air and coating surfaces. The skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed, highlighting the event's brief but intense impact.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores how Trump's tariffs are impacting ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, a city that relies on the U.S. market for its weapons industry. The tariffs have stalled expansion plans and risk scaring off American customers, threatening the livelihood of over 2,000 local residents. The mayor of Gorazde expresses concern that the U.S. has abandoned its faith in free trade as a path to peace. The article also highlights the contrasting views of Bosnia's trade minister, who supports Trump's policies and shows little interest in saving the gun companies.</p>
