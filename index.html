          <p>NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe is facing a $50 million civil lawsuit alleging sexual assault and threats by a woman with whom he had a relationship. The lawsuit claims Sharpe used physical force, inflicted emotional distress, and recorded sexual encounters without consent.

          <p>A proposed amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill in the UK could impose life sentences on cyclists who cause death by dangerous cycling. The current law, dating back to 1861, allows for a maximum imprisonment of two years for cycling offenders. The proposed change aims to align cycling offenses with driving offenses, potentially leading to stricter penalties, including five years in jail and fines for serious injury or death caused by dangerous cycling. The government estimates that cyclists caused four of the 1,600 deaths on UK roads last year.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new carnivorous caterpillar on Oahu, Hawaii, dubbed the "bone collector," that adorns its silk case with the body parts of its prey. This unique behavior may serve as camouflage, allowing the caterpillar to feed on insects trapped in spiderwebs without being detected. Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare, and this species, dating back at least 6 million years, is found in an isolated mountain forest. Researchers emphasize the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique lineage.</p>

Accusations of misogyny and unpopularity in eastern Germany further contribute to his challenges. His business background was initially seen as an asset, but recent populist statements on immigration have not helped him surpass the AfD.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk secured a major legal victory that restricts compounding pharmacies from marketing cheaper, unapproved versions of Wegovy and Ozempic. A federal judge rejected a bid by compounding pharmacies to continue making copies of the drugs, upholding the FDA's determination that semaglutide is no longer in short supply. This decision allows the FDA to pursue pharmacies making compounded versions, protecting patient safety and Novo Nordisk's market position. Eli Lilly has pursued similar legal actions regarding its drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro.</p>

Despite attempts to project calm, officials privately speculate about power dynamics within the administration and the impact of tariffs. While some hope for moderation, the influence of bond markets, rather than moral persuasion, may ultimately sway Trump's decisions. The IMF and World Bank are adjusting their rhetoric to align with the administration's concerns about currency depreciation and domestic demand.</p>

The proposed cuts in funding for autism research and support further exacerbate concerns about the administration's approach to neurodiversity.</p>
