        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Testimony in the negligent homicide trial of seven health care professionals involved in Diego Maradona's care revealed the soccer legend was considered a "high-risk" and "very difficult" patient. Doctors stated Maradona was experiencing withdrawal symptoms and required significant care following brain surgery in November 2020. The trial has highlighted disagreements among medical staff regarding his treatment and discharge from the hospital, with some suggesting he should have been admitted to a rehabilitation center. Evidence also indicated clinical visits occurred less frequently than recommended, raising questions about the adequacy of his at-home care after his release from the hospital.</p>

          <p>Faustin Nsabumukunzi, a Rwandan beekeeper living in the Hamptons, was arrested and charged with immigration fraud for allegedly concealing his participation in the Rwandan genocide. Prosecutors claim Nsabumukunzi directed ethnic majority Hutus to kill minority Tutsis, personally assaulted Tutsis, and ordered the disposal of Tutsi bodies, referring to them with derogatory terms. He is accused of lying about his involvement in the genocide when seeking refugee status and later applying for permanent residency and citizenship in the United States. If convicted, he faces up to 30 years in prison and potential deportation to Rwanda, where he has been sought for nearly two decades.</p>

          <p>During initial face-to-face talks, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent did not pressure his Japanese counterpart to prop up the yen amidst ongoing tariff negotiations. Both countries reaffirmed the G7 agreement that exchange rates should be market-determined, and excessive currency volatility would hurt economic stability. Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato expressed his regret over Trump's tariffs and urged a review of protectionist measures, which the IMF warned could slow global economic growth. The two countries continue to negotiate tariffs and discuss currency issues, while Japan has made it clear that it has no intention to discuss tariff issues concurrently with security arrangements.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select two-way Colorado star Travis Hunter, highlighting the draft's unpredictability. The draft saw a focus on offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the first twelve picks being linemen. This year's draft is considered less talent-laden than the previous year, with only one quarterback being selected in the first 12 picks. Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders's draft position was a major point of interest.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funds to sanctuary cities and counties. The judge declared portions of Trump's executive orders unconstitutional, stating that withholding funding causes irreparable harm in the form of budgetary uncertainty and undermines trust between cities and their communities. The ruling prohibits the federal government from taking any action to withhold, freeze, or condition federal funds and requires written notice of the order to all federal departments and agencies. The plaintiffs argued the orders were an overreach and attempted to force cities to participate in mass deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, called for a "coalition" of countries to address the tariff war initiated by the U.S. President Donald Trump. During a visit to Beijing, Cassis emphasized China's role as an important advocate for a multilateral world, noting that Trump's tariffs have created uncertainty for all countries, including those closer to the United States. He highlighted that Switzerland, with its small and open economy, is significantly impacted by the protectionist measures and that a trade war is detrimental to all parties involved, including the U.S.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests China could enhance its soft power in Africa by adopting an NGO model similar to Western nations. While China has invested heavily in infrastructure, its government-to-government approach lacks grassroots engagement and community ties. Western nations have cultivated a vast NGO ecosystem that provides social services and builds community relationships, projecting an image of compassion. As more Chinese companies and workers move to Africa, a narrative of China as a neocolonial power has emerged, highlighting cultural clashes and social isolation, which an NGO model could help mitigate by building human connections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the deadly attacks on Kyiv, Ukraine, amid renewed efforts to end the war on terms favorable to Russia. Trump's remarks came after an attack that killed 12 people and injured at least 90. Closer to home, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempts to change voting requirements, which advocates argued would disenfranchise millions. Trump had promised to end the war in 24 hours during his election campaign, but an agreement has yet to be reached.</p>

          <p>An open letter signed by over 170 organizations warns Prime Minister Keir Starmer that supported housing, which assists vulnerable individuals in living independently, is in crisis. The letter cites service closures due to cuts in council funding and rising costs, leading to a shortfall of approximately 325,000 places. Signatories such as Refuge, Age UK, and the National Housing Federation are calling for increased long-term funding of at least £1.6 billion per year for councils and for supported homes to be included in the government's housing plans. The government acknowledges the vital role of supported housing and plans to invest £2 billion in social and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly had an unsecured internet connection installed in his Pentagon office to bypass security protocols and use the Signal messaging app on a personal computer. This "dirty line" allowed him to access websites blocked by the Pentagon's secure networks, raising concerns about potential hacking and surveillance risks. This follows reports that Hegseth shared sensitive military information about strikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen on a private Signal group chat. Hegseth has denied using Signal on his government computer, but the incidents have drawn criticism and comparisons to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server.</p>

Recent firings within the Pentagon suggest Hegseth is attempting to regain control and address leaks, but the reactions to these firings highlight ongoing tensions regarding Iran.

          <p>U.S. authorities are reportedly conducting a criminal antitrust investigation into TP-Link Systems Inc, focusing on pricing strategies and potential national security risks associated with the company's growing market share. The investigation is examining whether TP-Link engaged in predatory pricing that could harm other router companies without national security concerns. There have been past concerns that Beijing could exploit Chinese-origin routers for cyber attacks. TP-Link Systems claims it has split from and is no longer affiliated with TP-Link Technologies Co. in China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration experienced a series of legal setbacks in federal courts across the country, affecting issues ranging from education policy and voting rights to congestion pricing. Judges blocked the government from withholding federal funds to schools with DEI programs and from requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote. The administration is also facing scrutiny over immigration policies, including a probe into alleged violations of court orders during deportations. In New York, DOJ lawyers inadvertently revealed shortcomings in their plan to implement congestion pricing.</p>

The administration is described as operating at a tremendous tempo, taking the initiative in various spheres. The author compares the administration's vitality to that of Franklin D. Roosevelt's in 1933. The driving forces behind this initiative are attributed to powerful human desires such as resentment, the desire for power, and the desire for retribution.</p>

          <p>Despite promises of significant taxpayer savings, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is now projected to save taxpayers only $150 billion, a fraction of the initial pledges. Errors and obfuscations in DOGE's claims of savings, along with the costs incurred through firings, agency lockouts, and legal battles, are contributing to the shortfall. Estimates suggest that firings, re-hirings, lost productivity, and paid leave could cost upwards of $135 billion this fiscal year, potentially negating the promised savings.</p>
