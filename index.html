          <p>Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion semiconductor deal with Samsung Electronics, running until 2033. The contract is for Samsung to produce Tesla's next-generation AI chips, starting with the AI6 chip at a new facility in Texas. Musk emphasized the strategic importance of the deal, which he suggested could grow even larger, and noted his personal involvement in maximizing manufacturing efficiency. Samsung's shares rose following the announcement, which is seen as a significant boost for its foundry business as it competes with industry leaders like TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that the starvation crisis in Gaza, which has led to the deaths of numerous children, is a man-made and deliberate outcome of Israel's prolonged siege. The author criticizes the international community, including the EU and UK, for what they describe as hollow statements and performative gestures that fail to hold Israel accountable. The piece argues that measures like "tactical pauses" are insufficient and that only sustained public pressure for meaningful actions, such as sanctions and embargoes, can address the escalating humanitarian catastrophe. The author contends that without real consequences, the cycle of violence and suffering will continue.</p>

          <p>Following the English women's football team's victory in the Euro 2025 final, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to declare a national bank holiday. While a homecoming parade is scheduled, the government appears to be following the precedent set after the team's 2022 win. This decision comes despite previous suggestions from Prime Minister Keir Starmer that such a victory should be celebrated with a day off. The potential economic cost of a bank holiday, estimated to be over £800 million, is likely a significant factor in the government's position.</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has alleged that he was forced to dispose of hundreds of bodies over nearly two decades. In a police complaint, he claims many of the victims, including underage girls, showed signs of sexual assault and murder, but temple supervisors covered up the crimes and threatened him into silence. The whistleblower's confession has prompted the Karnataka government to form a Special Investigation Team to probe the allegations. The case has also led families of individuals who disappeared or died mysteriously near the temple to demand their cases be reopened.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the renowned 1,500-year-old Shaolin Temple in China, is under criminal investigation for multiple serious allegations. The charges include embezzlement, engaging in "improper relationships with multiple women," and fathering children. Known as the "CEO monk" for commercializing the temple, Shi has been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association, which stated his actions have severely damaged Buddhism's reputation. This is not the first time he has faced such accusations, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015, but the current probe appears more severe.</p>

Following a high-rise fire in June, inspections have intensified, leaving many workers who earn only a few hundred dollars a month scrambling for shelter.

While the EU avoided a threatened 30% rate, the agreed-upon tariff is still a major concession and higher than the 10% rate secured by the UK. In return, the EU has reportedly agreed to open its markets to certain American exports and make substantial investments in US energy and arms. This deal removes economic uncertainty for a sluggish European economy but demonstrates President Trump's aggressive, deal-making approach to renegotiating global trade relationships.

The model predicts that while the U.S. will import more from the UK, France, and Spain, it will import significantly less from China, Canada, and Mexico. Consequently, China is expected to pivot its trade relationships towards countries like Russia and Vietnam. Experts explain that as the U.S. imposes tariffs, other nations will naturally rewire their trade away from America, altering global supply chains and economic partnerships.

          <p>The Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen has implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy applies to universities, hospitals, and companies, stating that individuals should not be punished or have their careers hindered if a project fails due to reasonable circumstances like unforeseen technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct or abuse of power. The goal is to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and pursue ambitious scientific achievements without the fear of reprisal for non-malicious failures, fostering a more risk-tolerant innovation environment.</p>

          <p>The far-right Sanseito party's recent surge in Japanese elections, where it grew from one to 15 seats, is being analyzed as a major shift in the country's typically stable politics. The party's "Japanese First" slogan resonates with a public frustrated by inflation, stagnant wages, and a weak yen. This discontent is compounded by a sense of "over-tourism," where a record influx of foreign visitors is blamed for disruptive behavior. Analysts suggest the party, influenced by Trump-style populism, has successfully channeled economic anxiety and cultural friction into a political movement that challenges the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, a key author of Project 2025 and the White House budget director, stated that President Trump's recent criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the conservative blueprint's call for a major Fed overhaul. On "Face the Nation," Vought claimed he didn't even know what the Project 2025 chapter on the Fed contained, despite the project's detailed proposal to limit the central bank's mandate to the sole objective of stable money. Vought insisted the administration's focus is on what it sees as the Fed's fiscal mismanagement and its reluctance to lower rates compared to other countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan effort to force a House vote on releasing federal files related to Jeffrey Epstein is creating a rift within the Republican party. Co-sponsors Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) are criticizing Speaker Mike Johnson for what they see as blocking the vote. Johnson has called the measure "reckless," claiming it lacks protections for innocent victims, an argument Massie refutes as a "straw man," insisting their bill was carefully crafted to redact victims' names. Massie warned that failing to hold the vote could become a political liability for the GOP, as it breaks a promise to their base.</p>

Boebert explained the event stemmed from a "miscommunication on monitoring" her grandson and noted that her son has been working to get his life on track.

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has officially rejected any diplomatic engagement with South Korea's new liberal government. In a statement, she asserted that Seoul's "blind trust" in its alliance with the United States makes it no different from its conservative predecessors. This marks North Korea's first official response to President Lee Jae Myung's administration, which had made efforts to improve ties. The rebuff signals that Pyongyang, currently focused on its growing partnership with Russia, sees no value in resuming dialogue with Seoul or Washington in the near future.</p>

In contrast, Germany's powerful BDI federation of industries sharply criticized the agreement as an "inadequate compromise," calling the 15% tariff rate a "disastrous signal" with expected negative consequences.

A review of the band's show at Dodger Stadium highlights the group's enduring appeal, which has reached a new peak years into their reunion. The concert featured the album's theatrical concept, updated with a satirical take on political authoritarianism, but the real power lay in the strength of the songs themselves. The band's blend of emo drama, punk energy, and frank lyrics on identity continues to resonate deeply with a multi-generational audience, solidifying their influence on modern rock and pop.</p>
