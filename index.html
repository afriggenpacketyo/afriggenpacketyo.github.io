          <p>An aid agency reports that Sudanese people are resorting to eating leaves and charcoal to survive after fleeing an attack on a displaced persons camp near El-Fasher. The Norwegian Refugee Council highlights horrific stories, including people dying of thirst during the 40km journey to Tawila and reports of sexual assault and death along the way. El-Fasher is the last city in Darfur under army control, and the recent attack by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the Zamzam camp has exacerbated the already dire humanitarian crisis, with Tawila struggling to provide food and water to the influx of refugees.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos is in court for sentencing after pleading guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors are seeking an 87-month prison sentence, while Santos' lawyers are requesting 24 months, with Santos claiming he has accepted responsibility and lost his seat, reputation, and livelihood due to the case. He was ousted from Congress after a House Ethics Committee report detailed his misconduct, including false financial disclosures, forging a Baruch College diploma, and creating a fake nonprofit. As part of his plea deal, Santos agreed to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates might not translate into lower borrowing costs for consumers. Economists argue that Trump's attacks on the Fed's independence and his tariff policies could actually keep long-term interest rates higher due to market concerns about inflation. A less independent Fed could lead to higher borrowing costs as investors demand higher yields to own Treasury securities. (not investment advice)</p>
