          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the company's new "NVLink Fusion" program at Computex 2025, allowing customers to integrate non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's NVLink technology. This move expands NVLink's accessibility, previously exclusive to Nvidia chips, enabling semi-custom AI infrastructure development. Partners like MediaTek and Qualcomm Technologies will be able to combine their CPUs with Nvidia's GPUs in AI data centers, potentially capturing a larger share of the ASIC-based data center market. According to analysts, this signifies Nvidia's strategic plans to dominate the data center landscape, offering a more flexible AI infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republicans are implementing policies that undermine women's rights and economic independence, such as cutting childcare funding and considering the repeal of tax credits for daycare. These actions are part of a broader effort to encourage women to embrace traditional domestic roles and leave the workforce. The New York Times reported the White House is exploring ways to incentivize "parents" to stay home, but this disproportionately affects women due to cultural expectations and wage inequalities. Critics argue that the solution is to invest in high-quality childcare, enabling women to participate fully in public life.</p>

          <p>US advocacy groups are campaigning against Republican proposals to cut Medicaid and Obamacare, which could leave millions without health insurance. The House bill proposes significant savings from Medicaid by adding work requirements, a change expected to affect low-income, disabled, and elderly Americans. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr defended the proposal, stating Medicaid is for poor children, mothers, and the disabled, while advocacy groups argue most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so. Critics highlight that work requirements add administrative burdens without effectively pushing people into the workforce.</p>

The layoffs impact approximately 100 staff members and trainees, disrupting their careers.

The author notes that spaces encouraging stillness, such as spas and temples, often remove us from our routines through shifts in temperature, vibrant colors, or an absence of sound.

          <p>New research indicates that just five minutes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise daily can improve cognitive performance in older adults aged 65 to 80. The study, published in Age & Ageing, found that activities like running, swimming, and brisk walking enhance information processing, focus, multitasking, and short-term memory. Researchers emphasize that transitioning from minimal physical activity to even a few minutes of daily movement yields the most significant cognitive gains. The study also suggests prioritizing exercise over sleep when time is limited, as increased moderate-to-vigorous activity shows more benefits for cognitive outcomes.</p>

          <p>The article draws a parallel between the U.S.'s rejection of Jewish refugees aboard the St. Louis during the Holocaust and the Trump administration's plans to send migrants to Libya and Rwanda. The author argues that sending migrants to countries with documented human rights abuses, such as Libya, violates international treaties and U.S. law prohibiting the return of refugees to places where their lives are threatened. The author urges vocal opposition to policies that undermine refugee protection norms and emphasizes the importance of upholding the principles established after World War II to protect those fleeing persecution.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to cut federal funding for K-12 education in Maine after Gov. Janet Mills refused to follow an executive order regarding transgender athletes, putting hundreds of millions of dollars at risk. Maine schools rely heavily on federal dollars to support programs for low-income students, students with disabilities, and English language learners. Federal funds help pay for free school meals, special education, mental health services, and after-school programs, which are essential for students in rural districts with limited local tax bases.

The results highlight a divided electorate, with far-right candidates securing a combined 21.15%.

          <p>Despite promising a major ground offensive in Gaza, Israel's military has yet to launch a significant advance, leading analysts to believe it's a negotiating tactic amid cease-fire talks. The increased bombardment of Gaza is seen as pressure on Hamas to compromise on hostage releases in exchange for a truce. This strategy reflects tensions within the Israeli government, balancing pressure from right-wing allies seeking permanent control of Gaza with military concerns about a long-term occupation. The resumption of aid deliveries to Gaza, amid pressure from the Trump administration, also reflects efforts to balance competing interests.</p>
