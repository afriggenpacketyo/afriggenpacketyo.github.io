        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its disbandment after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a decision welcomed by Turkish government and opposition parties alike. This move could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, especially for the pro-Kurdish DEM party. Political experts suggest that the peace process with the PKK and the legal situation surrounding jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu will be critical factors in the coming years. However, uncertainties remain regarding the surrender of weapons, potential resistance within the PKK, and the fate of PKK members, making the future of Turkish politics unpredictable. </p>

          <p>Russia has released its delegation list for upcoming peace talks with Ukraine in Turkey, notably excluding President Putin, signaling he won't directly engage with President Zelensky at this time. President Trump initially considered attending but will instead send Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing scheduling conflicts. Zelensky has expressed readiness for negotiations but insists on strong Western sanctions if Putin rejects the meeting. The Russian delegation will be led by Vladimir Medinsky, a hard-line Putin aide, while the closed-door talks are set to begin early Thursday, focusing on ending the largest land war in Europe since World War II. </p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has implemented stringent immigration measures, tightening citizenship requirements and facilitating the deportation of migrants. The new decree mandates that immigrants spend two years in Argentina or make a significant investment to obtain a passport, and requires proof of income and clean criminal records for permanent residency. Foreigners will now be charged for public healthcare and education, and must hold health insurance, which is a significant shift from the previous open-access policies. Critics worry these rules challenge Argentina's long-standing tradition of openness, while the government insists they are necessary to address "chaos and abuse". </p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, driven by pharmaceutical exports like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic, is projected to moderate in growth, but is expected to be largely unaffected by potential U.S. tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry, according to the IMF. The fund noted that most Danish drug products are neither produced nor do they pass through the country, relying instead on a "merchanting and processing" system. While the U.S. remains a key trading partner, only a small fraction of Danish exports are produced within the country, limiting the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy. </p>

This move supplements the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April, prompted by a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average cost of private school education in the UK has risen by 22.6% in the last year, exceeding government estimates, following the introduction of VAT on fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decrease in private school enrollment as a result, but notes that the full impact remains uncertain. Parents are already withdrawing their children from private schools due to rising costs, and some schools have reduced their fees, excluding VAT, to mitigate the impact. The ISC attributes the fee increase to a combination of national insurance changes, the end of charitable business rates relief, and the imposition of VAT. </p>
