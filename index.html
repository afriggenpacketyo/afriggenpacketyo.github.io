          <h2>Japan's Overall Exports Rebound as Asia Shipments Grow, Despite Continued Decline to U.S.</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:46:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports rebounded by 4.2% year-on-year in September, breaking a four-month streak of declines, largely fueled by strong growth in shipments to Asia. Despite this, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, fell by 13.3%, with auto shipments particularly impacted, even after a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. The data emerges as Sanae Takaichi takes office as Japan's first female prime minister, with her proposed loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus expected to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive globally. Overall economic resilience is noted, with second-quarter GDP revised upward, suggesting better-than-expected performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A White House official stated there are no immediate plans for a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, despite Trump's earlier announcement of a potential summit in Budapest. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had a "productive call," but a future in-person meeting between them is deemed unnecessary. Trump himself later indicated he didn't want a "wasted meeting," suggesting a lack of readiness for a substantive outcome. This development follows previous discussions where Trump had proposed a ceasefire in Ukraine along current battle lines, a stance that has met with conflicting views and complexities from both Ukrainian and European leaders.</p>

          <h2>Experts Debunk Common Haircare Myths, Emphasizing Scalp Health Over Quick Fixes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, advising against cold water rinses for shine and clarifying that no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends; only a haircut can. They stress that hair won't "self-clean" and requires regular washing to prevent oil and debris buildup, which can worsen scalp conditions like dandruff. Furthermore, dry shampoo is acceptable for single-day use between washes but should not replace regular washing, as overuse can lead to an itchy, flaky scalp. The article emphasizes that focusing on scalp health, similar to facial skincare, is crucial for overall hair well-being.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military announced a successful strike on the Bryansk Chemical Plant in Russia using UK-made Storm Shadow missiles, penetrating Russian air defenses. Kyiv described the plant as a "key facility" in Russia's military-industrial complex, producing gunpowder, explosives, and rocket fuel components for ammunition used against Ukraine. This attack comes as UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and other European leaders pledged to increase pressure on Russia's economy and defense industry until Russia is ready for peace. The strike also follows a White House meeting where President Trump indicated reluctance to supply Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine, highlighting ongoing debates over military aid and peace talks.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner, visiting Israel, expressed cautious optimism that the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire is progressing better than anticipated, despite recent violence. Vance acknowledged difficulties in recovering all hostage remains, with two more bodies returned to Israel for identification. The peace deal has seen 165 Palestinian bodies returned to Gaza and all 20 living Israeli hostages released. However, the long-term viability of President Trump's peace plan remains uncertain, with critics like Alon Pinkas questioning Netanyahu's commitment and predicting a resumption of Israeli operations. Vance emphasized no American troops would be deployed in Gaza, while Trump warned Hamas against breaching the deal.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial concerning the wrongful death of his late teammate, Tyler Skaggs, who died from an overdose in 2019. Trout stated he loved Skaggs like a brother and never witnessed signs of his drug use, nor was he aware that former communications director Eric Kay allegedly supplied opioids to players. While Trout acknowledged seeing Kay act "wired" and suspected drug use, he did not know the specifics. The lawsuit, brought by Skaggs' family, alleges the Angels were reckless in allowing Kay, an admitted drug dealer and addict, access to players. Kay was convicted in 2022 for providing the fentanyl-laced pill that killed Skaggs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's ability to broker a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release is contrasted with his stalled efforts to end the war in Ukraine, highlighting differences in diplomatic leverage. In Gaza, Trump's strong ties with Israel and Arab nations, coupled with a controversial strike on Hamas negotiators, gave him unique influence over Netanyahu. Conversely, in Ukraine, Trump has less leverage, vacillating between pressuring Putin and Zelensky, and his face-to-face meetings have yielded little progress. Analysts suggest Putin may be using Trump's desire for a deal to his advantage, delaying decisions on critical aid. This article concludes that ending the Ukraine war has proven more complex than Trump initially promised.</p>

This research, published in the Lancet, emphasizes the importance of tailoring antidepressant prescriptions to individual patient needs and existing health conditions, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, to improve health outcomes and treatment adherence.</p>

          <p>UK supermarket prices, exemplified by a 134% rise in orange juice since 2020, are skyrocketing due to a "perfect storm" of global factors.

Additional pressures include new packaging regulations and the impact of trade wars and Brexit, which have led to tariffs and supply chain complexities. While some commodity prices may recover, the market's concentration among large producers and the faster transmission of upward price shocks suggest that elevated grocery bills might persist, potentially exposing the UK to long-term food price volatility.</p>

          <p>A criminologist, Alain Bauer, predicts that French authorities will likely apprehend the thieves who audaciousy stole royal crown jewels from the Louvre Museum, but the national treasures themselves are probably lost forever. The Sunday daylight heist, which occurred without injury, left significant DNA evidence, including on a discarded empress's crown. Police also recovered tools used by the criminals, who accessed an upper-floor window. The stolen jewels, priceless historically, are estimated at 88 million euros ($102 million), but would be broken up for black market sale. The theft, the most spectacular since the Mona Lisa in 1911, highlights extensive security vulnerabilities at the museum.</p>

Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau estimates the stolen items' worth at 88 million euros ($102 million), excluding their historical value. Experts note that if privately insured, the claim would be paid, but without such coverage, neither the museum nor the government will receive private insurance payments.

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta lauded striker Viktor Gyokeres after he ended a seven-game goal drought with two goals in a 4-0 Champions League win against Atletico Madrid. Gyokeres, a £64m signing, had been praised for his overall impact despite not scoring, and Arteta believes these goals could ignite a prolific spell. Having played more than anticipated due to a teammate's injury, Gyokeres' persistence was rewarded. His teammates' visible happiness and the manager's comments underscore his positive influence, making Arsenal a "much better team" and "much more unpredictable" through his physical play, pressing, and ball-holding abilities.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Attorney General, Kris Mayes, is suing House Speaker Mike Johnson to compel the swearing-in of Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who won a special congressional election in September. Johnson has delayed seating Grijalva, citing the government shutdown, but Mayes argues this disenfranchises Arizona's 7th district. Grijalva believes the delay is to prevent her from signing a discharge petition that would force a vote on releasing the Epstein files, which currently needs one more signature. Her presence could tip the scales on this significant issue, highlighting a legislative dispute that intertwines government function, representation, and accountability for high-profile matters.</p>

          <p>La Liga has announced the cancellation of plans to stage the Villarreal-Barcelona match in Miami this December, citing "uncertainty" and critical responses within Spain. The Spanish top flight expressed regret, stating that holding official matches abroad is crucial for global growth and revenue generation, especially given the dominance of leagues like the Premier League. The decision follows player protests and complaints from Real Madrid, arguing the move "distorts the competition." Uefa had reluctantly approved the match, but the timing of La Liga's announcement during a Champions League game drew strong criticism from Villarreal's manager, Marcelino, for its "absolute lack of respect."</p>

This incident highlights the fragility of the modern internet, which is heavily reliant on a few massive cloud providers like Amazon, controlling an estimated 30% of the global market. The article explains that while cloud computing offers accessibility and cost savings, it centralizes potential points of failure. This dependence means that issues with a single company's infrastructure can disrupt essential services worldwide, underscoring the immense influence these "digital landowners" wield over daily life.</p>

Trump stated he would personally pay for significant portions and that anonymous donors would contribute over $20 million. Ethics experts, like former White House lawyer Richard Painter, view the funding model as an "ethics nightmare," suggesting it could amount to "pay-to-play" for access to the administration. A dinner for potential donors included executives from major tech and finance companies, with a pledge form hinting at "recognition" for contributions. While the White House insists the renovation won't cost taxpayers and will benefit future administrations, critics remain concerned about potential influence-peddling.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions and aggressive rhetoric from some US officials, analysts suggest President Trump's direct control over his administration could make him a "unique guard rail" for US-China relations. His focus on leader-to-leader diplomacy with Xi Jinping, coupled with his ability to temper the more hawkish elements of his team, is seen as potentially stabilizing. International relations professor Zhiqun Zhu notes that Trump "calls the shots," making personal engagement crucial. While acknowledging structural competition between the two powers, this perspective suggests that Trump's centralized decision-making and pragmatic approach might prevent further escalation, offering a distinct dynamic in a fraught relationship.</p>

This follows an earlier White House official announcement that there were "no plans" for an immediate meeting, despite Trump's previous suggestion of a Budapest summit.

          <p>A Schroders study reveals that 90% of working Americans plan to ignore the common financial advice of waiting until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which would maximize their monthly payments. While 70% understand the trade-offs, 44% expect to file before full retirement age (67), and only 10% plan to wait until 70. This disconnect is attributed to retirees needing immediate income and concerns about Social Security's future solvency, despite benefits still being paid even if trust funds are depleted. Many Americans also lack understanding of Social Security's role in retirement, highlighting a significant gap between financial advice and real-world financial realities. (not investment advice)</p>

The company recorded a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, an impact not included in its prior forecast. Despite the earnings miss, revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, record ad sales, and strategic content expansion, including with "KPop Demon Hunters." While revising its full-year operating margin forecast due to the tax issue, Netflix anticipates continued revenue growth for the fourth quarter, signaling overall business resilience.
