          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of declining same-store sales, some Wall Street analysts are expressing cautious optimism about Starbucks' recovery efforts. They point to improving customer traffic, particularly among non-rewards members, and an aggressive innovation agenda under CEO Brian Niccol as promising signs. However, the company's stock performance indicates that many investors remain hesitant as the turnaround takes longer than initially anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

While the initial threat prompted evacuations, the resulting waves in these areas were smaller than feared, leading to a sense of relief. The summary includes personal accounts from residents in Hawaii who heeded official advice to move to higher ground, providing a human-interest perspective on the event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared a new 25% tariff on all goods imported from India, set to begin on August 1st.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, marking a significant rebound from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of 2025. This growth was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports, a volatile metric influenced by the Trump administration's trade tariffs. However, underlying data, such as final sales to private domestic purchasers, suggest that core demand is weakening, indicating the headline figure may overstate the economy's true strength.

          <p>Even American households earning over $150,000 are increasingly falling behind on credit card and auto loan payments, with delinquency rates for this group more than doubling since 2023. This trend suggests that broad economic pressures, including a weaker white-collar job market and high living costs, are impacting a wider segment of the population. The data from VantageScore indicates a notable financial strain on a group that has historically been more resilient to economic shocks. (not investment advice)</p>
