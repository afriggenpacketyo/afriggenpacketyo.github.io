          <p>A man is in custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The attack, which appeared to be random, occurred near the checkout area and was carried out with a folding knife. Six of the victims are in critical condition, with the remaining five in serious condition. Officials praised citizens who intervened to apprehend the suspect and assist the injured, and the FBI is now assisting local law enforcement with the ongoing investigation into the brutal act of violence.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian government, a move that deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This development raises fears of a permanent division of the nation and undermines diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict. The war has already displaced up to 13 million people and killed an estimated 150,000, pushing large parts of the population toward famine.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. Prosecutors argued she killed him to ensure sole custody of their child, while the defense claimed self-defense stemming from a history of abuse. The trial detailed their turbulent relationship, which included a custody battle and numerous allegations from both sides. Benefield was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison, with the verdict bringing a sense of justice to her late husband's family.</p>

          <p>With England's women's team in the Euro 2025 final, fans are experiencing intense emotional and physical reactions, from anxiety to elation. Psychology experts explain that these responses are driven by hormonal surges, including adrenaline and cortisol, especially during high-stakes moments. To manage the stress, experts advise getting good rest, having a clear match-day plan, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. They also emphasize reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, collective experience that allows for a rare and healthy expression of emotion.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Experiences Unusually Cold Summer, Its Chillest in Decades</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While not record-breaking, the persistent cool temperatures have been a notable feature of the season in the Bay Area. Forecasters expect the cool, drizzly conditions to continue, warning that the region's hottest weather often arrives later in August and September.</p>

The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 stated the vote was prompted by the company's alleged unfair labor practices, including surveillance and discrimination against union members. While the authorization does not trigger an immediate walkout, it strengthens the union's position ahead of contract negotiations. The move follows layoffs earlier this year, which the company attributed to inflation and rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

While Israel stated combat operations would continue, the decision to airdrop supplies marks a shift in its approach to the humanitarian crisis.

          <p>A large-scale effort to recall 24 opposition lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, ensuring the China-friendly KMT party and its allies will retain their majority in the legislature. Campaigners had accused the lawmakers of undermining national security and initiated the recall to break the political gridlock that has stymied President William Lai's agenda. The opposition, which has blocked budgets and appointments, framed the recall as a politically motivated stunt. The result means the current state of tense, divided government on the self-governing island is set to continue.</p>
