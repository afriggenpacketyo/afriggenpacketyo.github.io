          <p>A recent report from the Social Security Board of Trustees indicates that the trust fund responsible for paying retirement benefits may be depleted by 2033, which is unchanged from last year's projections; at that point, only 77% of scheduled benefits will be payable. The combined trust funds, including disability insurance, are expected to last until 2034, a year earlier than previously estimated, at which point 81% of combined benefits will be payable. The report considers the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners, but excludes the potential impacts of new tax proposals, tariffs, and deportations. Disability insurance is expected to be able to pay full benefits through at least 2099. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is ending specialized suicide prevention services for LGBTQ+ youth on the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, effective July 17. Mental health advocates express concern that this decision could negatively impact a high-risk group, as the specialized service provided counselors with specific training and shared experiences to better support LGBTQ+ youth in crisis. While SAMHSA states that all 988 Lifeline callers will still receive culturally competent crisis counseling, advocates argue that the tailored support offered by the LGBTQ+ youth service is crucial and saves lives. Senator Tammy Baldwin has vowed to fight for continued funding for suicide prevention for LGBTQ+ children.</p>

Despite anticipating a rise in inflation, the central bank still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, consistent with its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and improvements in sentiment, but also noted that tariffs could increase inflation and slow economic growth.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are predicting a possible resurgence of spotted lanternflies this summer, following a previous decline in their population, based on rising egg mass counts in Pennsylvania. While not dangerous to humans or animals, these invasive insects pose a significant threat to plants and crops, potentially affecting forest ecosystems, agricultural production, and cultural resources. The lanternflies feed on over 70 plant species and excrete a substance that promotes harmful mold growth. Humans can unknowingly transport the pest to new areas by way of hard surfaces like vehicles, firewood, bricks, and stones where the insects lay their eggs, thus it is important to be vigilant.</p>

          <p>Destroying Iran's nuclear program is a difficult task due to the fortified nature of facilities like the Fordo plant, built inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete. The U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber needed to penetrate such sites, but multiple bombing rounds and potential ground deployment would be required. Military experts suggest that even with successful strikes, the extent of damage remains uncertain, and Iran could retaliate against U.S. assets in the region. While the GBU-57 would have a psychological impact, it may not completely halt Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection, for HIV prevention, marking a significant milestone in efforts to curb the HIV epidemic. Clinical trial data indicates the injection provides near-complete protection against HIV infection, offering a more convenient alternative to daily pills. The drug, marketed as Yeztugo, has an annual list price of $28,218 in the U.S., and Gilead Sciences is taking steps to broaden access, but high costs and potential cuts to foreign aid could limit its reach. The drug's efficacy was demonstrated in clinical trials, with one showing 100% effectiveness among cisgender women.</p>

Read maintained her innocence, with her defense arguing she was framed, and expressed gratitude to her supporters after the verdict.

This dilemma has exposed divisions among Trump's supporters, with some expressing doubt about Iran's nuclear plans and others advocating for U.S. involvement.

          <p>During a White House visit, President Trump engaged the Juventus football squad in an awkward discussion about transgender women in sports, questioning their views on whether a woman could make their team. The exchange occurred amid increasing hostility towards trans people in the U.S., coinciding with the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors. Trump's comments highlight the ongoing debate and political tensions surrounding transgender rights in the country.</p>

          <p>Experts in radiation hazards suggest that a U.S. strike on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, a suspected underground nuclear weapons site, would pose a limited risk of widespread contamination. The facility primarily processes uranium isotopes in the form of uranium hexafluoride gas, which is heavy and unlikely to travel far. Although there are concerns about the gas reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, the underground location and the design of bunker busters would likely inhibit any significant environmental release. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iranian facilities.</p>
