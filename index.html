          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent survivor of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual assault ring, has died at the age of 41. Giuffre alleged that she was trafficked to Prince Andrew and other powerful figures as a teenager, bringing the issue of sexual assault to the forefront of public discourse. Her family confirmed that she died by suicide after struggling with lifelong abuse. Giuffre's lawsuit against Prince Andrew was settled out of court in 2022, and Ghislaine Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for her role in the sex-trafficking scheme. The family remembers her as a fierce warrior against sexual assault and trafficking.</p>

          <p>FBI agents arrested Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan for allegedly obstructing immigration agents by helping an undocumented immigrant evade arrest in her courtroom. This arrest marks an escalation in the Trump administration's conflict with local authorities over immigration enforcement. The administration has been pressuring local officials to cooperate with federal deportation efforts, and this action sends a strong message. The arrest of Judge Dugan follows rising tensions between the Trump administration and the judiciary, particularly concerning immigration cases and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order that would have canceled collective bargaining rights for most federal workers. U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman issued the injunction following a lawsuit from the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), which argued the order was unconstitutional and would significantly weaken the union. The order exempted several agencies, including the Departments of Justice, State, and Defense, from bargaining requirements, affecting approximately 75% of federal workers represented by unions. This action is part of the administration's broader efforts to reduce the size of the federal government and make it easier to discipline and fire employees.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a Trump administration peace plan, which had been criticized for being too lenient towards Russia. The Ukrainian plan includes provisions for no restrictions on the size of the Ukrainian military and a US-backed "European security contingent" to guarantee security. The plan also suggests using frozen Russian assets to repair war damage in Ukraine, while omitting demands for regaining all territories or joining NATO. President Zelensky had planned to attend Pope Francis' funeral, but his attendance depends on the situation in Ukraine due to recent Russian attacks.</p>

In experiments, 70-80% of volunteers exposed to the sound experienced alleviation of symptoms while riding on a swing, simulator, or car.</p>

          <h2>California's License Plates to Change Sequence Due to Shortage</h2>

          <p>California is set to launch a new license plate sequence for newly registered vehicles starting next year due to the state running out of its current combination of numbers and letters. The new sequence will be three numerals followed by three letters and one numeral (e.g., "000AAA0"). The state expects to exhaust the current sequence sooner than anticipated, partly due to an increase in new car registrations amid fears of rising prices due to potential trade wars. A recent report indicates new vehicle registrations increased significantly in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claims that Russia and Ukraine are "very close to a deal" following talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy insists that "real pressure on Russia is needed" for an unconditional ceasefire. Reports suggest that Ukraine would be expected to concede land annexed by Russia under a US peace proposal. The US plan also reportedly rules out Ukraine's membership in NATO.</p>

The agency is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants, and leases from previous administrations, and tackling fraud. While Doge publishes a running total of estimated savings, less than 40% is broken down into individual savings, and some accounting errors have been highlighted.</p>
