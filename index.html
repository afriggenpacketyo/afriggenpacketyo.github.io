          <p>South Korean AI chip developer Rebellions has secured a new investment from Samsung as it pursues a larger funding round of up to $200 million. The startup, which resulted from a merger with Sapeon, aims to challenge Nvidia in the AI inference chip market. This funding will support the development and large-scale production of its next-generation 'Rebel' chip, which Samsung will manufacture using its advanced 4-nanometer process. The move is part of Rebellions' broader strategy to go public and expand its global presence, representing a potential strategic win for Samsung's foundry business.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, passenger volumes at Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport and Shenzhen's Baoan Airport surpassed their pre-pandemic highs, indicating a strong recovery in the region. Guangzhou handled over 40 million passengers, a 9.2% year-on-year increase, while Shenzhen served nearly 32.6 million, up 10.8%. This growth, attributed to vibrant business activity and tourism, contrasts with Hong Kong International Airport, which remains below its 2019 traffic levels despite a significant year-on-year increase. The trend highlights shifting aviation dynamics within China's Greater Bay Area.</p>

          <p>Severe floods and heavy rains have devastated northern China, resulting in at least 30 deaths in Beijing and the evacuation of over 80,000 people. An additional eight fatalities were reported from a landslide in Chengde city. The disaster has damaged roads, cut power to numerous villages, and prompted President Xi Jinping to call for all-out rescue efforts. This event is part of a broader pattern of extreme weather affecting China this summer, which has included record heatwaves and other floods, causing billions of yuan in economic losses.</p>

          <p>A global food security initiative, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), has issued a stark warning that the 'worst-case scenario of famine' is currently unfolding in Gaza. Backed by the UN and other NGOs, the group states that mounting evidence points to widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease driving an increase in hunger-related deaths. The warning highlights that critical data thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have been breached in the Gaza Strip. The situation is being monitored as a developing crisis.</p>

          <p>Following significant Israeli military action and under pressure from a new Lebanese government, Hezbollah's extensive financial network is facing unprecedented challenges. The group, which has historically relied on both Iranian funding and a global shadow economy, has seen its leadership and infrastructure weakened. Lebanon's new administration is taking steps to assert control, such as cracking down on Hezbollah-linked financial entities and securing ports of entry. Analysts believe this presents a critical window of opportunity for the U.S. and the international community to dismantle the group's financial power.</p>

          <p>UK utility firm Anglian Water will invest £62.8 million to address failures in its wastewater management after an investigation by the regulator Ofwat found a 'serious breach'. The probe uncovered excessive sewage spills from storm overflows, leading to the enforcement action. Instead of a £57.1 million fine, the company agreed to fund £57 million in improvements to its wastewater treatment works and contribute £5.8 million to a community environmental fund. The company acknowledged its shortcomings and stated it has allocated £1 billion to halve spills by 2030, a plan funded by future increases in customer bills.</p>

          <p>The recent handsy and flirtatious behavior between 'Fantastic Four' stars Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby is part of a common Hollywood trend where co-stars use public displays of affection to generate buzz for their films. While Pascal has attributed his physical touch to a coping mechanism for anxiety, public relations experts suggest such actions are often a calculated tactic to build interest and drive ticket sales. This strategy has been employed by other famous pairs, including Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey. Experts note that while it can be effective, the tactic risks backfiring if the behavior is perceived as inappropriate or inauthentic.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is signaling a harsher stance toward recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, urging them to self-deport. This comes amid recent moves to strip DACA recipients, known as Dreamers, of benefits like access to the federal healthcare marketplace. In a statement, a DHS official asserted that DACA does not confer legal status and that recipients are not automatically protected from deportation. This new rhetoric creates further uncertainty for the roughly 525,000 individuals in the program, as immigrant advocates warn that DACA protections are being systematically weakened.</p>

          <p>President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, has intensified, with Trump seeking to compel the 94-year-old media mogul to give an immediate deposition.

Trump's legal team is citing Murdoch's advanced age and health issues as reasons for an accelerated deposition.

Chronic malnutrition, especially in children and developing fetuses, can stunt physical and cognitive growth and is linked to lifelong health problems like diabetes and heart disease. Research into epigenetics, such as studies on the Dutch Hunger Winter, suggests that the trauma of starvation can alter gene expression, meaning these health risks could be passed down to descendants.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent EU-US trade agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods imported to the US, could inadvertently benefit the United Kingdom. With the UK facing a lower 10% tariff rate, its exports to the US become relatively cheaper, potentially boosting trade as American firms and consumers may favor British products over those from the EU. Some experts suggest this could incentivize EU companies to shift manufacturing to the UK to avoid the higher levy. While the actual impact remains to be seen, the tariff differential presents a potential competitive advantage for the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuelans who were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious Cecot prison are sharing accounts of their 125-day ordeal. The men, recently freed in a prisoner swap, describe being held in what guards called a 'cemetery of the living dead,' where they endured beatings, psychological abuse, and inhumane conditions. Many were targeted by the Trump administration's anti-immigrant campaign, labeled as terrorists without evidence, and flown to the maximum-security facility. Their testimonies provide a disturbing glimpse into the human cost of both El Salvador's anti-gang crackdown and U.S. deportation policies.</p>

          <p>In Nigeria's northern Zamfara state, kidnappers have killed at least 35 of the 56 people they abducted from a village in March, despite having received ransom payments. A local official reported that the victims, mostly young people, were 'slaughtered like rams' after a ransom was paid and 18 other hostages were released. This brutal act highlights the escalating crisis of kidnapping-for-ransom by criminal gangs, known as bandits, in the region. The Zamfara government condemned the killings as 'barbaric and cowardly' and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food price inflation in the UK rose for the sixth consecutive month, reaching 4% in the year to July, according to the British Retail Consortium. The increase was primarily driven by rising prices for staple goods like meat and tea, which have been affected by tighter global supplies and higher wholesale costs. Fresh food inflation remained steady, but the cost of cupboard goods increased to 5.1%. This trend contributes to the pressure on household budgets, with one report suggesting grocery bills could rise by £275 this year, compounding broader inflationary pressures in the UK economy.</p>

          <p>Automaker Stellantis reported a first-half net loss of 2.3 billion euros, a sharp reversal from a 5.6 billion euro profit in the same period last year. Despite the loss, the company reinstated its financial guidance for the second half of 2025, expecting a gradual recovery with increased revenues and improved cash flow. The new CEO, Antonio Filosa, acknowledged that 2025 is a 'tough year' and stated the leadership team will make the 'tough decisions' necessary to restore profitable growth.

Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased market volatility related to U.S. tariff policies, which boosted trading income.

As global power dynamics shift, the experts believe China must lead in shaping international norms in emerging fields.
