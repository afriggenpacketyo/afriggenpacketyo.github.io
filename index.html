          <p>The Texas National Guard and local officials are actively engaged in extensive recovery efforts in Kerrville following devastating floods that have left approximately 100 people unaccounted for. International support has arrived, with a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic, including sixteen civilians and four cadaver dogs, joining the operation. This collaboration underscores a robust, long-standing partnership between the Texas National Guard and the Czech Republic, which has seen reciprocal aid during previous flood events. The Guard's efforts have already resulted in over 500 rescues, including 130 children from a summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors tragically lost their lives, with additional support from other states like Arkansas, Arizona, and North Dakota.</p>

          <p>Used electric vehicle batteries are being repurposed to power artificial intelligence data centers, offering a renewable energy solution to the AI industry's growing electricity demands. Crusoe, an AI cloud platform, is utilizing these batteries from Redwood Materials in Nevada to keep its data centers running day and night, addressing the struggle for reliable and fast power access. This innovative approach helps sidestep the environmental impact of traditional gas-fired plants, with Redwood Materials recovering significant gigawatt hours of lithium-ion batteries annually. The company, founded by former Tesla CTO JB Straubel, believes this modular system can be widely scaled, providing a sustainable alternative for energy storage.</p>

          <p>Trading for Japan's Seven & i Holdings was suspended after Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its substantial $47 billion offer to acquire the retail giant. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i as the reason for pulling its bid, expressing disappointment over the inability to advance a proposal that they believed would maximize value for all stakeholders. Seven & i, the parent company of 7-Eleven, had previously rejected a lower offer and maintained that the revised bid still "grossly undervalues" the company. This development highlights a significant breakdown in negotiations, leaving the future of a potential merger between the two convenience store powerhouses uncertain.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son were successfully rescued after becoming lost in a remote California forest, thanks to the mother's quick thinking and handwritten notes. The Calaveras County Volunteer Search and Rescue Team, aided by a location-sharing app and air support, located the pair's vehicle after following a series of notes left at intersections. Despite challenges with cell and radio signals in the thick forest, rescuers used amateur radio to coordinate the operation. The family had become disoriented after their GPS diverted them onto remote backroads, but their survival skills, including the son's use of a whistle, and informing someone of their itinerary proved crucial for their safe return.</p>

Newsom accused the president of using the Guard to appear "tough" and terrorize immigrant communities, rather than addressing violent crime, and harming local businesses. He also suggested Trump's efforts to redraw congressional districts in Texas for Republican gain could prompt California to similar action for Democrats. The governor emphasized his commitment to proactive measures against what he perceives as the administration's "rule of cruelty," signaling a strong political stance.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been lifted, following a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake that initially prompted a warning. The seismic event, occurring about 50 miles south of Sand Point, led to evacuations in coastal towns like Seward, though experts quickly noted that large, widespread waves were not expected due to the earthquake's shallow depth. Multiple aftershocks were reported near Sand Point, and the U.S. Coast Guard temporarily evacuated personnel at its Kodiak base before standing down. This incident highlights Alaska's location along the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," recalling the region's history of major seismic events.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed a crucial bipartisan bill designed to prevent thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure, addressing a crisis caused by the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) previous program cancellations. The new legislation allows veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move those missed payments to the end of their loan term, effectively making their loans current. This fix comes after the VA abruptly ended a Biden-era homeowner assistance program, leaving many veterans vulnerable, and aims to restore stability to the VA's home loan program, which has faced significant self-inflicted challenges. The measure is widely supported by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry.</p>

The president confirmed discussing the "concept of firing him," citing Powell's handling of interest rates and alleged mismanagement of the Fed headquarters renovation. The potential removal of a Fed chair is legally untested, as federal law requires "for cause" dismissal, and such an action could severely impact financial markets. Trump's ongoing dissatisfaction with Powell, whom he appointed but now criticizes as "Mr. Too Late" and a "total stiff," stems from differing views on interest rate policies and economic growth.</p>

          <p>Lesotho, a small mountain kingdom in Southern Africa, has declared a two-year state of disaster following severe threats of unprecedented U.S. tariffs. This drastic measure highlights the profound economic vulnerability of smaller nations to international trade policies and the anticipated negative impact on their stability. The declaration signifies a critical national emergency, indicating the country expects significant economic fallout and will likely implement specific governmental responses to mitigate the crisis. This situation underscores the far-reaching and often disproportionate consequences that protectionist trade policies can have on developing economies, potentially disrupting their entire socio-economic fabric.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from corn syrup to real cane sugar in its flagship drinks sold in the U.S., a move he championed due to health concerns raised by his Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. While Coca-Cola's spokesperson offered a non-committal response, Trump expressed confidence in the "very good move." This change, if fully implemented, would align U.S. products with those sold in many other countries. However, the Corn Refiners Association warns this shift could negatively impact American corn farmers, manufacturing jobs, and increase foreign sugar imports, with no proven nutritional benefit.</p>

          <p>The average cost for summer holiday clubs in Britain has surged to £1,076 per child for the six-week school break, according to new figures from the children's charity Coram. This significant expense, which can rival the cost of a family holiday, is burdening parents, particularly those with two full-time working parents who rely on childcare. Prices vary by region, with some areas seeing increases of up to 13% year-on-year, driven by high demand and a scarcity of more affordable council-run activities. The report highlights a critical gap in childcare provision, especially for older children and those with special educational needs, posing a challenge for family finances and work-life balance.</p>

          <p>Thousands of flat owners are preparing a legal claim seeking millions in compensation, alleging that freeholders of their apartment blocks received "secret" commission fees from insurance companies. These commissions were reportedly added to the leaseholders' service charges without their knowledge, inflating insurance costs, especially since the Grenfell Tower fire. Lawyers suggest each flat owner could be owed up to £2,000, plus interest and tax. While the accused companies deny wrongdoing, the Financial Conduct Authority previously found commission rates as high as 62%, and new regulations now require disclosure. This class action lawsuit highlights concerns about transparency and fairness in property management and insurance practices.</p>

          <p>An op-ed argues that Emil Bove, President Trump's nominee for a lifetime seat on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, is unqualified and should be rejected by the Senate. Bove, formerly Trump's personal lawyer and Justice Department enforcer, is criticized for alleged bullying behavior, engineering the dropping of bribery charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and reportedly advocating disregard for court orders. Eighty former federal and state judges have written to the Senate Judiciary Committee, asserting that Bove's record of "abusing power, and disregarding the law itself disqualifies him."

The recall involves vehicles equipped with 1.5L engines. As an interim safety measure, dealers will update the engine control software to detect a cracked injector, disable the high-pressure fuel pump, and reduce ignition source temperatures, though this is not a permanent fix. Owners will be notified in August and again when a final remedy is available. This expands on previous recalls for the same issue, adding to Ford's substantial list of vehicle recalls this year.</p>

For example, contributing an additional $300 annually to reach a full employer match on a $60,000 salary could lead to over $150,000 in additional savings over a career. This "free money" from employer matches is presented as one of the most effective ways to save for retirement, emphasizing that consistent contributions and utilizing available perks can substantially grow savings over time.

          <p>A group of Liberal Democrat MPs has urged Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy to intervene in what they call UEFA's "disgraceful" decision to demote Crystal Palace from the Europa League. The club, which won the FA Cup, was moved to the lower-tier Conference League due to breaching multi-club ownership rules, as American businessman John Textor owns stakes in both Palace and Lyon, which also qualified for the Europa League. The MPs expressed "deep concern" over the "highly unusual and severe punishment," questioning the fairness and transparency of football governance, especially since Palace missed UEFA's March 1, 2025 deadline for ownership restructuring. This situation is seen as heartbreaking for fans and potentially undermines the club's achievement.</p>
