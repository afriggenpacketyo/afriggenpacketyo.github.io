          <p>Delta Air Lines has restored its 2025 profit outlook, causing its stock to surge by 10% as its summer travel forecast surpassed expectations. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, overall demand has stabilized. Despite reducing its full-year earnings forecast from earlier predictions, the airline's third-quarter guidance and strong performance in premium cabin sales have bolstered investor confidence. The company will continue upgrading its premium products and make surgical capacity cuts after the peak summer season to adapt to current travel trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a historic 2024 Tour de France where he won the green jersey, Eritrean cyclist Biniam Girmay is facing a more challenging season this year. Despite a strong second-place finish in the opening stage, his performance has been hampered by a knee injury. Girmay, who remains the sole African rider in this year's tour, continues to aim for a stage win while acknowledging the immense pressure and his role as a representative for his continent.

          <p>Police in south Belfast have declared a major incident over a large bonfire constructed for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations. The structure poses a significant risk to a nearby electricity substation that supplies power to two major hospitals, prompting Belfast City Council to request police assistance for its removal. The situation has escalated tensions, with loyalist activists threatening legal action to prevent the bonfire's dismantlement. Health officials have contingency plans, including backup generators, to ensure hospital operations are not disrupted, but the event highlights deep-seated political and cultural divisions.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturer Nvidia briefly reached a market valuation of $4 trillion, a milestone driven by intense investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The company's stock surge highlights its dominant position in the AI sector, which has attracted massive investments from other tech giants like Microsoft and Google. Despite challenges from new competitors and the impact of U.S. tariffs on chip sales to China, Nvidia has demonstrated remarkable resilience, reporting nearly $19 billion in quarterly earnings. The company's success has been a significant factor in the broader stock market's recovery from an earlier downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has issued a stark warning that the nation faces a rising and unpredictable threat from Iran, urging the government to adopt a more comprehensive counter-strategy. The report highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 assassination or kidnapping plots against UK-based individuals, primarily regime opponents and Jewish or Israeli interests, since early 2022. The committee accuses the government of focusing too heavily on Iran's nuclear program at the expense of other dangers like espionage and cyber attacks. It calls for increased resources and a long-term approach to counter Iran's well-resourced and risk-tolerant intelligence services.</p>

The change, intended to cut costs amid declining letter volumes, will see second-class mail delivered on alternating weekdays. While Royal Mail welcomed the move as necessary for financial sustainability, it has drawn criticism from consumer groups and some businesses who fear a decline in service reliability and an increased reliance on more expensive first-class mail. First-class deliveries will continue six days a week, but with slightly relaxed next-day delivery targets.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled her right to a fair hearing was violated by a Swiss court. The case stems from her long-running legal battle against World Athletics regulations that require athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD) to lower their testosterone levels to compete in certain female events. While the ECHR found procedural flaws in the Swiss legal process, it deemed her discrimination complaints inadmissible. The ruling does not immediately overturn the athletic regulations but allows her case to potentially return to the Swiss federal court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a massive $75 billion funding increase for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), signaling a significant escalation of its immigration enforcement agenda. The allocation, the largest since 2003, will dramatically expand detention capacity from 41,500 to 116,000 beds and provide a blank check for enforcement and deportation activities. Critics and civil liberties advocates express alarm that the funding will fuel indiscriminate tactics that undermine due process and target non-criminal immigrants. While logistical hurdles may slow the administration's goal of deporting one million people annually, the new resources empower ICE to pursue its aggressive policies on an unprecedented scale.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California politics, drawing comparisons to its use in New York City. Proponents argue RCV could reduce election costs by eliminating runoffs, increase diversity, and discourage negative campaigning. In California's nonpartisan, top-two primary system, RCV could potentially eliminate primaries altogether in many local races and give underrepresented parties a better chance in state contests. The author suggests that the system's introduction could lead to unpredictable strategic realignments, possibly fostering more centrist outcomes or, conversely, pushing candidates toward more extreme positions to capture second-choice votes.</p>

The review praises the book for its dark, laugh-out-loud humor that tackles the grim realities of economic precarity and the racial wealth gap, which disproportionately affects Black graduates.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's recent tour of South Carolina is widely interpreted as an early move to build connections for a potential 2028 presidential run. While Newsom framed the visit as an effort to help Democrats in the Deep South, his presence in the crucial early primary state drew national attention and energized local party members. He touted his record of resisting the Trump administration and criticized national Democrats for neglecting rural communities. Despite facing criticism for California's high cost of living and social issues, Newsom's trip demonstrated his potential to mobilize the party's grassroots and act as a leading voice of opposition.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is currently investigating more than 80 complaints of officer misconduct stemming from last month's widespread protests against federal immigration raids. Over half of the 86 incidents under review involve allegations of excessive force, including the use of 40-mm "less-lethal" projectiles. The department's response has been heavily criticized as indiscriminate and has led to lawsuits from protesters and press advocacy groups. This investigation is seen by observers as a significant test of the LAPD's commitment to reform and its willingness to hold officers accountable for controversial crowd control tactics.</p>

          <p>A new UC Berkeley poll indicates an overwhelming majority of California voters, across all political, demographic, and geographic lines, believe American democracy is under threat. The survey found that 64% of voters feel democracy is under attack, while another 26% believe it is being tested. While Democrats were the most fearful, a significant number of Republicans and independent voters also expressed deep unease about the nation's political health. Experts suggest these concerns are rooted in recent political upheaval, including claims of election fraud and the perceived weaponization of government agencies, leading to a dangerously polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 100th anniversary of the Scopes "Monkey Trial," this opinion piece argues that the cultural battle between science and religious fundamentalism is far from over. The 1925 trial, which pitted lawyer Clarence Darrow against politician William Jennings Bryan over the teaching of evolution, was seen by many as a victory for science and modernism. However, the author details the subsequent rise of creationism, "intelligent design," and ongoing attacks on science and public education by the religious right. The article concludes that the core conflicts of the Scopes trial continue to shape American society, with democracy and public education still at stake.</p>

          <p>This opinion article praises the expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) included in the recently signed federal spending bill, calling it a rare piece of good, bipartisan policy. The author argues that HSAs, which are triple tax-advantaged, promote individual responsibility and help reduce healthcare costs. The new legislation expands HSA eligibility to millions more Americans, including those on certain Affordable Care Act plans, and allows funds to be used for direct primary care memberships. While celebrating this as a popular and smart reform, the author suggests more work is needed, such as fully delinking HSAs from high-deductible plans.</p>

The article dismisses claims that questioning government preparedness politicizes tragedy, asserting it is a necessary function of accountability.

Officials report that the debris removal process is months ahead of schedule, with over 9,000 properties cleared by federal contractors, though concerns about soil contamination persist. Investigations into the cause of the fires are ongoing, with one theory suggesting the Palisades fire was a rekindling of a previously contained blaze.

          <p>Years before a catastrophic flood killed over 90 people, officials in Kerr County, Texas, knew they needed a flood warning system but struggled to fund it. Their application for federal FEMA grants was denied by the state, and a state-level program would have required the county to cover 95% of the cost. This local struggle highlights a national problem, now exacerbated by the Trump administration's decision to freeze or cancel billions in federal disaster preparedness funding, shifting the financial burden to states.

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, meteorological experts have clarified why a similar catastrophic event is highly unlikely along Florida's St. Johns River. The primary difference is topography; Texas Hill Country's steep terrain and thin soil contribute to rapid runoff, creating "Flash Flood Alley." In contrast, Florida is exceptionally flat, and the St. Johns River has a minimal elevation drop, making it one of the slowest-moving rivers in the world. While Florida faces significant flooding risks from slow-moving hurricanes and storm surges, the sudden, violent nature of the Texas flash flood is not a threat.</p>
