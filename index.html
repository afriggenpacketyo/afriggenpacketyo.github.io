        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, are protesting against the government's plan to expand its military operation. Demonstrators fear the strategy endangers the hostages and are calling for a deal to secure their release, with some soldiers publicly refusing to serve. This internal pressure adds to international criticism and highlights a significant divide between the public, which polls suggest favors a deal, and Prime Minister Netanyahu's administration, which insists the military plan will help free the captives. The movement includes calls for a general strike and reflects deep-seated opposition to a full reoccupation of Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Japanese boxing community is in mourning after two fighters, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died from brain injuries sustained in separate bouts during the same event in Tokyo. Both boxers suffered subdural hematomas and passed away after undergoing emergency surgery. The tragic deaths have prompted the Japan Boxing Commission to shorten championship title bouts from 12 to 10 rounds. This incident has intensified the global debate on boxing safety, with advocates calling for stricter regulations, including mandatory post-fight scans and concussion protocols.</p>

          <p>Drawing on her grandmother's experience of surviving starvation in the Warsaw ghetto, the author presents a personal and impassioned argument for prioritizing humanitarian aid in Gaza. The article frames the crisis through Maslow's hierarchy of needs, asserting that the basic physiological need for food must supersede ideological and security concerns. It critiques the Israeli government's blockade and aid distribution system, which has led to widespread hunger and civilian deaths. The author calls for collective grief and imagination to guide a future where both Palestinians and Israelis can live free from hunger and violence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. permanent resident and Vietnamese entrepreneur, Luu Anh Tuan, has been imprisoned in Vietnam on what his advocates claim are manipulated charges, allegedly orchestrated to thwart the transfer of his rare earth separation technology to the United States. The arrest is viewed as part of China's broader strategy to maintain its dominant control over the global supply of rare earth elements, which are critical for everything from smartphones to defense systems. This case highlights the intense geopolitical struggle over these vital resources, as China tightens export controls and the U.S. seeks to develop its own independent supply chain.</p>

          <p>More than 200 days into a hypothetical second term, critics argue that Donald Trump's actions are accelerating the United States toward authoritarianism. The article points to a series of moves, including calls to prosecute political opponents, the firing of a government statistician over a weak jobs report, and efforts to exert federal control over Washington D.C., as evidence of a systematic dismantling of democratic norms. Unlike his first term, Trump and his allies are now seen as more strategically effective in expanding presidential power and undermining institutions. This trend has led prominent commentators to warn that the country is now led by an authoritarian figure.</p>

Recent polls show a sharp decline in public confidence in his ability to govern effectively, with many Americans feeling his policies have personally hurt them, particularly regarding the economy. The article details the negative impacts of his administration's policies, from tariffs raising consumer costs to cuts at agencies like the NIH and FEMA, which compromise public health and disaster response. The authors suggest Democrats' best strategy is to humanize these failures, framing the administration as inept and reckless.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing a significant economic and cultural transformation driven by a boom in artificial intelligence, often described as a new "gold rush." The surge in AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic is revitalizing the city's downtown, increasing demand for office space and infusing a sense of optimism after the post-pandemic downturn. However, this frenzy is also accompanied by anxiety over the high cost of living, potential job displacement, and the broader societal impacts of the technology. The city has become a hub for AI development, with venture capital funding soaring. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which portrays a frantic 24-hour period in Los Angeles as residents flee an impending nuclear strike, is experiencing a resurgence in popularity. Recently restored and re-released, the movie has been attracting sold-out crowds, with many praising it as a quintessential L.A. apocalypse story. The film's appeal lies in its authentic depiction of the city's Miracle Mile district and its blend of romance with sudden, overwhelming chaos. Though a box office disappointment upon its initial release, its unique tone and focus on love at the end of the world have cemented its status as a cult classic.</p>

          <p>A collection of short stories by authors Steph Cha, Ivy Pochoda, and Jonathan Lethem imagines life in a future Los Angeles shaped by climate change, economic disparity, and technological shifts. The vignettes explore themes of survival and community through diverse characters, including a deli worker stealing prohibitively expensive ham and a formerly unhoused person leading the new Skid Row Neighborhood Council in a depopulated city. These speculative tales paint a vivid, often melancholic, picture of adaptation and memory in a transformed Southern California, exploring what it means to live in such a changed world.</p>

          <p>Amid the confusion and limitations of recycling, the reuse movement is gaining traction as a more effective way to combat the waste crisis. A recent pilot program in Petaluma, California, demonstrated the viability of a city-wide system for reusable food and beverage containers, backed by major corporations like Starbucks and McDonald's. The program successfully encouraged consumers to return reusable cups without a deposit, relying on community pride, and achieved a return rate that surpassed the "environmental break-even point." This success suggests that scalable reuse systems could significantly reduce the vast number of single-use items that end up in landfills.</p>

          <p>As Los Angeles confronts the dual challenges of extreme flooding and water scarcity, urban planners are looking to the "sponge city" model, successfully implemented in cities like Bangkok and across China. This approach uses green infrastructure, such as parks and wetlands, to absorb, clean, and store stormwater rather than flushing it away through concrete channels. Proponents argue this method not only mitigates flood risk but also replenishes groundwater, creates recreational spaces, and is more cost-effective than traditional "gray" infrastructure. While L.A. has initiated programs to increase its permeability, progress has been slow due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs.</p>

          <p>Despite California being a symbolic center of resistance to the Trump administration's immigration policies, federal data shows Texas and Florida had significantly more ICE arrests in early 2025. An analysis reveals that Texas led with over 26,000 arrests, compared to California's 8,460, largely due to stronger cooperation between local law enforcement and federal agents in Republican-led states. While California saw a dramatic percentage increase in arrests, its "sanctuary" policies forced ICE to conduct more visible and controversial community raids rather than relying on transfers from local jails. This suggests that state-level cooperation is a key factor in the intensity of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Officials Urge Residents to Stop Water Use Amid Major Outage</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, are pleading with thousands of residents in Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all water usage, including flushing toilets, to aid in critical repairs. A major water control valve broke on Tuesday, causing a multi-day outage and a boil water advisory just as a heatwave hit the region. Although some service has been restored, officials warn that continued consumption is depleting pressure in the system and delaying the complex, underground repair work. The restoration effort was further complicated when a temporary bypass pipe failed.</p>

          <p>Deadly floods have once again struck Beijing, marking the fifth major flooding event in northern China since 2012. The rainy season, which typically occurs in July and August, has brought severe storms to the region. This year's disaster is noted as being unusual because it primarily affected the northern parts of the capital. In contrast, previous severe floods in 2016 and 2023 were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring nature of these extreme weather events highlights an ongoing environmental and infrastructural challenge for the country.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set to make his home debut, but his first weeks at the club have been overshadowed by significant off-pitch issues. The club has been embroiled in a dispute with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen over his registration status, a move linked to the club's financial struggles which initially threatened the registration of new players like Rashford. Additionally, major delays in the reconstruction of the Nou Camp stadium mean his debut will be at the small training ground stadium. Despite the chaos, Rashford has impressed in pre-season and looks poised to take on a key role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary expresses alarm over the escalating global nuclear arms race and the conspicuous absence of the widespread public protest that characterized the Cold War. The formal collapse of the INF treaty, Russia's nuclear threats over Ukraine, and the U.S. buildup of nuclear-capable systems in Europe are creating a profoundly dangerous environment. The author argues that nuclear weapons are increasingly viewed as usable, offensive tools rather than mere deterrents, raising the risk of catastrophic conflict. The piece calls for a revival of the anti-nuclear movement to challenge the madness of a world hurtling toward potential extinction.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist provides a first-person account of going undercover to expose a violent migrant-smuggling gang in northern France, an investigation which has led to an arrest in the UK. Posing as a Syrian refugee, the reporter describes the nerve-wracking process of building a cover story, navigating the smugglers' shadowy world, and secretly recording a meeting with a senior gang member in a forest camp. The account details the constant risk, the psychological pressure of maintaining a false identity, and the meticulous planning required to gather evidence against the dangerous criminal network.</p>

          <p>Female refugees in Germany face a threefold disadvantage in the job market due to their gender, immigrant status, and refugee experience, resulting in much lower employment rates than their male counterparts. Many arrive with young children and face a shortage of childcare, making it difficult to attend language courses or work, a challenge also faced by recent Ukrainian arrivals. Various nonprofit and publicly funded projects are working to address these obstacles through tailored counseling, job fairs, and mentoring programs. These initiatives, often staffed by women with their own refugee backgrounds, aim to help individuals find meaningful work.</p>
