        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swedish automaker Volvo Cars saw its share price rise by more than 10% after its second-quarter operating profit exceeded analyst predictions, despite a significant year-on-year drop. The company, owned by China's Geely Holding, cited a challenging automotive market and a one-off impairment charge for the profit decline. In response to U.S. tariffs, Volvo is adjusting its U.S. strategy by adding its popular XC60 SUV to its South Carolina production line while phasing out some sedans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, reaching a record high that surpassed market expectations. This surge is largely attributed to the strong and sustained demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company also provided a positive outlook, forecasting significant revenue growth for the remainder of the year, although it acknowledged potential risks from U.S. tariff policies.

This comes as current U.S. negotiators review the previous agreement, in which China did not fully meet its purchase commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Civil rights and environmental organizations, including the NAACP, have filed an appeal against a permit allowing Elon Musk's xAI to operate natural gas-burning turbines for its supercomputer facility in Memphis. The groups argue that the Shelby County Health Department improperly issued the permit and ignored residents' complaints about pollution disproportionately affecting nearby majority-Black communities. They contend the turbines were miscategorized to avoid stricter regulations under the Clean Air Act, a claim xAI has dismissed as a "baseless, politically driven appeal."</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has removed the party whip from four of its Members of Parliament, effectively expelling them from the parliamentary party, for voting against the government's welfare bill. Additionally, three other Labour MPs were stripped of their unpaid trade envoy roles for the same reason. This disciplinary action is seen by some as an attempt by the leadership to enforce authority and deter future rebellions, while critics within the party have described the move as "petty" and "vindictive."</p>

          <p>The rise of AI-generated music, exemplified by the viral success of synthetic acts like "The Velvet Sundown" on Spotify, is creating significant anxiety within the music industry. While AI tools have long been used in production, new platforms allow for the easy creation of entire songs, raising concerns about copyright infringement, market saturation, and the devaluation of human artistry. Major record labels have filed lawsuits against AI music platforms, and artists are calling for regulations requiring consent, credit, and compensation for using their work to train AI models.</p>
