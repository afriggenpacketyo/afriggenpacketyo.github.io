          <p>President Trump escalated trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on EU goods and a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S. He claimed the EU has been difficult to deal with and that trade negotiations have stalled, and he has been complaining about Apple's shift in production to India. The announcement rattled global markets, causing stock futures to sink and European markets to fall. Trump believes the EU proposals have not been of the same quality as those from other trading partners, hoping the tariffs will incentivize the EU to negotiate more favorably.

          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies. The judge stated that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates and that the President cannot initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without Congressional partnership. The Trump administration has requested an emergency pause from the Supreme Court, arguing that the order impedes the Executive Branch's ability to reduce the federal workforce. The judge's injunction relates to an executive order signed by President Trump on February 11, which aimed to transform the Federal bureaucracy through large-scale reductions in force.</p>

          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration, alleging the decision to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students violates the First Amendment and Due Process Clause. The administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with demands for information on student visa holders, citing an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students and the promotion of pro-Hamas sympathies. Harvard President Alan Gerber refuted these claims, stating the university did respond to the Department's requests as required by law. The lawsuit accuses the administration of waging a retaliatory attack because the university supports policies the administration opposes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a severe heat wave in 2023, scientists discovered that clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea shrank in size. The researchers measured 134 clownfish monthly and found that most of them got shorter by a few millimeters, suggesting it's an adaptation to help them survive hotter ocean temperatures. The study, published in Science Advances, indicates that being small has advantages in a hot climate, potentially helping clownfish meet their energy requirements. The fish that shrank had a much higher chance of survival, adding complexity to the understanding of how marine life adapts to climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched an operation where ICE prosecutors are asking immigration judges to terminate court cases of certain migrants. This allows ICE agents to arrest those individuals and place them in a more rapid deportation process known as "expedited removal." This process can be applied to unauthorized migrants who entered the U.S. with the government's permission at legal entry points, potentially targeting nearly 1 million migrants who entered under a Biden administration program. Immigration lawyers are advising clients against missing their hearings, despite ICE's efforts, as failure to appear could lead to deportation orders.</p>

The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, boosts military and border security spending, and makes cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates it will add $3.8 trillion to the federal debt and decrease resources for the lowest-income Americans while increasing resources for the highest earners.

          <p>Stocks tumbled in early trading after President Trump threatened new tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 458 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 declined 1.2%. Trump urged Apple to manufacture iPhones in the U.S., threatening a 25% tariff if they failed to do so, and he also proposed a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union. The market dip erased some gains made in recent weeks as Trump rolled back some levies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump said that Apple will have to pay a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones made outside the United States. Trump has long expected Apple to manufacture and build iPhones in the U.S., rather than in India or elsewhere. Shares of Apple fell about 2% following the announcement. Some Wall Street analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. would raise the price of the Apple smartphone by at least 25%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a downturn after President Trump announced steep tariffs on goods from the European Union and targeted Apple with a tax on foreign-made iPhones. The S&P 500 fell by more than 1 percent, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index also saw a decline. Trump cited stalled trade negotiations with the EU and demanded that iPhones sold in the United States be manufactured domestically. The news reversed a recent trend of market gains and raised concerns about escalating trade wars.</p>

          <p>Three independent analyses have challenged a recent claim by astronomers that they might have found signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b. The initial data suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a molecule produced by life on Earth, but the new analyses found no compelling evidence for it. The critics argue that the new mid-infrared observations were much weaker than those in near-infrared, which could fool researchers with faint noise masquerading as a real signal of dimethyl sulfide. However, other researchers plan to present new observations of the planet that could dispel much of the confusion.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee indicated that President Trump's latest tariff threats have complicated policy and likely delayed changes to interest rates. Goolsbee said the Fed will likely be on hold as it evaluates the impact of the ever-changing trade policy on inflation and employment. He expressed optimism that the longer-run trajectory is towards solid economic growth but acknowledged the uncertainty caused by the trade policy. Goolsbee emphasized the importance of assessing the impacts on prices before committing to any course of action.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would significantly hinder the growth of electric vehicles by repealing key subsidies. The bill would eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for electric vehicle purchases, and funding for charging stations. The measure would also impose a new annual fee on electric vehicle owners. Critics argue the bill would raise prices for car buyers, slow electric vehicle adoption, and benefit China's dominance in the electric vehicle supply chain.</p>
