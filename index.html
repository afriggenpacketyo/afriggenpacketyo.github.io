          <p>Approximately 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site often viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The visit, which occurs annually, has historically caused diplomatic friction with China and South Korea due to the shrine honoring wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals. Despite the controversy, the cross-party group maintains that they visit to honor those who laid the foundation for Japan's post-war peace and prosperity. This year's visit follows Prime Minister Ishiba's ritual offering to the shrine, though he is not expected to attend in person.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 00:04:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The declining value of the U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, offering some relief while also posing potential risks. A weaker dollar can alleviate debt burdens for emerging markets with dollar-denominated debts and ease inflationary pressures by making imports cheaper, potentially allowing for interest rate cuts to stimulate growth. However, it also complicates export competitiveness and could provoke retaliatory trade measures from the U.S., forcing central banks to carefully balance the benefits and drawbacks of currency devaluation. Many central banks are hesitant to devalue their currency for fear of stoking price growth and inflation staying above their targets.</p>

          <p>Over 100 U.S. university presidents have signed a statement denouncing the Trump administration's "unprecedented government overreach and political interference" in higher education. This unified front opposes the administration's campaign against academic independence, marked by funding cuts and demands for institutional autonomy. The statement follows Harvard University's lawsuit against the government over threats to its funding, triggered by claims of inadequate protection for Jewish students from pro-Palestinian protests.

          <p>The Trump administration faces a legal challenge regarding the abrupt termination of student visas, with a federal judge granting a temporary restraining order to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), potentially leading to deportations. The plaintiffs argue that this action coerces students into abandoning their studies and self-deporting, despite not violating their visa status, with a hearing scheduled for further review.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's tariffs on Chinese goods, now cumulatively at 145%, are significantly impacting dropshipping businesses that rely on sourcing products from China. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further intensifies the pressure, with many products being stopped at the borders for inspection. Dropshippers are experiencing decreased revenue, increased prices, and difficulties in shipping goods to the U.S., leading some to shift their focus to the European market. The cumulative effect is creating turbulence in the cross-border e-commerce sector, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

The team also revealed significant differences in the structure and cell types of macaque and rodent claustrums, which could provide clues to help investigate the evolutionary mechanism behind consciousness.</p>
