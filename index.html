          <p>In Blackwood, New Jersey, an 18-year-old girl escaped a home where she was allegedly imprisoned and sexually assaulted by her stepfather for seven years, according to a New York Times article. The girl reported being locked in a dog crate and chained in a bathroom. Her mother and stepfather face charges including assault, kidnapping, and sexual assault. A neighbor recounted the teenager's harrowing story, highlighting the hidden nature of the abuse. The case has drawn parallels to another recent incident of long-term imprisonment in Connecticut and has prompted scrutiny of home-schooling practices.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates escaped from a New Orleans jail after breaking through a cell wall, prompting a manhunt and an investigation into potential assistance from jail workers, according to a New York Times article. The inmates were seen on surveillance video leaving the jail in civilian clothes before scaling a wall and crossing an interstate. Officials are investigating security failures, including defective locks and inoperable cameras. The escape has led to criticism of the Sheriff’s Office and calls for accountability.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service after he shared and then deleted a social media post that Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against US President Donald Trump, according to a BBC article. Comey voluntarily participated in the questioning for about an hour at the law enforcement agency's Washington DC headquarters and was not held in custody. It comes a day after he posted on Instagram a photo of seashells that spelled the numbers "8647". Trump said Comey was calling for him to be killed.</p>
