          <p>A 33-year-old Irish swimwear entrepreneur, Martha Nolan-O’Slatarra, was found dead on a yacht at the Montauk Yacht Club, sparking a homicide investigation by Suffolk County Police. While an initial autopsy revealed no signs of trauma, authorities are awaiting toxicology results to determine the cause of death. Nolan, who ran a successful bikini brand, was discovered after a man on a neighboring boat frantically sought help. Her family in Ireland has expressed profound shock and is awaiting more information from the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers were wounded when one stepped on a landmine along the border with Cambodia, escalating tensions just days after a ceasefire agreement. One soldier sustained a severe leg injury in the incident in Sisaket province. Thailand's army accused Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention by using concealed weapons, a claim Cambodia denies, stating it has not laid new mines and is committed to demining efforts from past conflicts. The event complicates peaceful resolution efforts following recent deadly clashes between the two nations over disputed border temples.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested at least 365 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals simultaneously display signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action." Membership or support for the group is now a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The mass arrests occurred as police moved through the seated protesters, with some being carried away after refusing to move.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any peace deal that involves ceding territory to Russia, responding to suggestions made by U.S. President Donald Trump. Zelenskyy emphasized that Ukraine's territorial integrity is non-negotiable and that any negotiations to end the war must include Kyiv's participation to be considered legitimate. His statement comes as a summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is planned in Alaska, raising concerns in Ukraine and Europe about potential agreements being made without their input.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel has caused a significant rift within his own conservative CDU/CSU political alliance. Some party members have fiercely criticized the move, viewing it as a departure from Germany's long-standing policy and special responsibility towards Israel. However, the decision has also received support from other conservatives and coalition partner, the Social Democrats, who argue it was an inevitable response to the Israeli government's recent actions in Gaza. The internal debate highlights deep divisions over Germany's foreign policy and its historical commitments.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer, 33-year-old David Rose, was killed during a shooting incident near the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta. The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, also died at the scene from what authorities say may have been a self-inflicted gunshot. The attack targeted four CDC buildings, and while the motive is unconfirmed, investigators are reportedly exploring a theory that the shooter believed he was ill from a COVID-19 vaccine. Officer Rose was a former Marine and leaves behind a wife and children.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than our planet. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which exploded in the atmosphere in June, creating a sonic boom heard across the region. The analysis suggests the meteorite originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter approximately 470 million years ago. This is the 27th meteorite ever recovered in Georgia.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of how partisan gerrymandering became a dominant force in American politics, tracing its modern roots to the Republican "Redmap" project in 2010. Following the 2008 election, Republican strategists targeted key state legislative races to gain control of the redistricting process after the census. This strategy, executed with advanced mapping software, successfully created durable GOP majorities in Congress and statehouses for a decade, often in states where Democrats won more overall votes. The article details how this has entrenched conservative policies and insulated lawmakers from public opinion, setting the stage for today's escalating redistricting battles.</p>

This shift reflects a growing sentiment within the party that they must fight fire with fire to counter what they see as an authoritarian, anti-democratic effort to rig elections.

          <p>Developers have spent $104 million to convert the abandoned 19th-century St. John's College campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood into a luxury apartment building named The Hartby. The project involved renovating the historic structure, which had been deteriorating for decades, into 205 apartments while preserving original details like exposed brick. Of the units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with market-rate rents ranging from $3,130 to $6,950 per month. The developers secured a 99-year ground lease from the adjacent church, which will receive income from the property and regain ownership at the end of the lease.</p>

          <p>Several German cities have offered to take in and treat seriously ill or traumatized children from Gaza, but the federal government is showing reluctance to support the initiative. The Interior and Foreign Ministries have cited security concerns and logistical challenges, stating that the focus should remain on providing aid locally. Conservative politicians have expressed fears that such a program could trigger a new wave of immigration through family reunification. This hesitation contrasts with the more open stance of their center-left coalition partners and the actions of other European countries like Italy and Spain, which have already accepted injured children.</p>

          <p>According to nutrition experts, certain foods can provide essential nutrients to support skin health and promote a youthful appearance. Foods rich in isoflavones, like edamame and tofu, may help reduce wrinkles and dryness. Sweet potatoes and tomatoes are packed with carotenoids and vitamin C, which protect against sun damage and promote collagen production. Other recommended foods include kefir for its probiotic benefits that improve skin hydration, pumpkin seeds for their zinc content that aids in wound healing, and salmon for its inflammation-reducing omega-3 fatty acids. Orange juice is also highlighted for its high vitamin C and hydration properties.</p>

          <p>William P. Bengen, the financial planner who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has updated his guidance based on more sophisticated research. His new analysis suggests that a more diversified portfolio, including small-company and international stocks, can support a higher initial withdrawal rate, now closer to 4.7%. Bengen notes that inflation is the greatest threat to retirees and suggests strategies like annual rebalancing and a rising equity glide path to enhance portfolio longevity. He now recommends a starting withdrawal rate of around 5.25% to 5.5% for today's retirees. (not investment advice)</p>
