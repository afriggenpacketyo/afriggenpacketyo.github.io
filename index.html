          <p>President Trump delivered the commencement address at West Point, highlighting his administration's efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in military academies. Trump's speech followed the disbanding of several student clubs and the removal of books related to diversity from U.S. Naval Academy libraries. Critics, including former West Point teachers, argue these actions undermine the values and education of the academies. Trump also referenced his previous appearance in 2020, addressing questions about his health after a slow walk down a ramp, dismissing concerns as related to a slippery surface.</p>

          <p>England defeated Zimbabwe by an innings and 45 runs in a one-off Test match, thanks to Shoaib Bashir's impressive six-wicket haul. Bashir's performance helped dismiss Zimbabwe for 255 in their second innings at Trent Bridge. Despite the victory, England's seam bowling lacked penetration on a lifeless surface, allowing Sean Williams to score 88 runs. Harry Brook took a spectacular catch, and Bashir became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 Test wickets, marking his third five-wicket haul before age 22.</p>

Aymond expressed concern for the survivors and a desire to expedite negotiations. The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy in 2020, and the proposed settlement of $240 million has faced pushback from some claimants. Attorneys representing about 200 survivors criticized the settlement plan, while others involved in the negotiations said they still need more time to finalize the details before a vote.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office reported a record number of Americans seeking residency in the UK, with over 6,000 applications in the year leading up to March. The surge in applications is attributed to the polarized political climate in the United States, with many pointing to Donald Trump's second presidency. While British authorities aim to reduce immigration, the increase in US applications highlights concerns among Americans about the political landscape. Most applications are from individuals eligible through spousal or family links.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the United States' next-generation fighter jets and "loyal wingmen" drones could help counter China's fleet size advantage in the Indo-Pacific. The US Air Force recently unveiled the YFQ-42A unmanned combat aerial vehicle, part of the collaborative combat aircraft program (CCA). General David Allvin emphasized the cost-effectiveness and lethality of these uncrewed fighters. The program aims to develop drones to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions, with production expected to begin in 2026.</p>
