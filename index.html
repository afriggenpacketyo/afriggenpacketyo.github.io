          <p>Seraphine, the maternity fashion retailer famously worn by the Princess of Wales during her pregnancies, has ceased trading and entered administration, resulting in the redundancy of most of its 95 staff. Consultancy firm Interpath confirmed the appointment of administrators, attributing the downfall to "trading challenges" and "fragile consumer confidence." Despite a popularity surge from royal endorsement and a London Stock Exchange listing in 2021, the company struggled economically, leading to this difficult decision. Administrators are now exploring options for the business and its brand assets, hoping to rescue it by selling it or its parts, otherwise it will be closed down.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas over the Fourth of July weekend, resulting in at least 104 fatalities, including numerous campers and counselors from Camp Mystic. The Guadalupe River experienced an unprecedented rise of 26 feet in just 45 minutes, exacerbated by intense rainfall from Tropical Storm Barry's remnants and the region's flash flood-prone geography. Officials are under scrutiny regarding the adequacy and timeliness of emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts before the sudden deluge. This tragic event has initiated a massive, ongoing search and recovery effort, prompting a major disaster declaration and raising concerns about future preparedness.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from revoking Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. This ruling partially freezes a provision of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" signed by President Trump, which aimed to cut federal Medicaid dollars from groups providing abortions, even though federal funds already cannot cover abortions except in specific cases. Planned Parenthood argued the provision was an attempt to penalize them and would severely limit patient access to non-abortion services like cancer screenings, given that over half their patients rely on Medicaid. The White House maintains its position against federal funding for elective abortion.</p>

The visit, involving ceremonial events at Windsor and Westminster, seeks to strengthen partnerships in trade, diplomacy, and defense, especially concerning issues like military backing for Ukraine and illegal migration across the Channel. King Charles's active role in diplomacy, including his fluency in French and past engagements with European leaders, is highlighted as crucial in resetting ties. This engagement reflects a mutual strategic necessity and a new willingness to address long-standing divisions, despite lingering mistrust from Brexit negotiations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors against major selling, suggesting President Trump's new tariffs on 14 countries, effective August 1, may not be "meaningful" in the long term. Cramer views these tariffs as a negotiation tactic, noting the administration's history of postponing or reducing such measures, and believes the president's true goal is to boost U.S. exports. Despite stocks sinking post-announcement, he doubts their significant impact on inflation or Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, though he concedes they could be problematic if they are the final figures. He highlighted that the market remains overbought, but the overall game plan for manufacturers is export-focused. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of federal officers and National Guard troops were deployed to Los Angeles' MacArthur Park, a historic immigrant neighborhood, in a sweeping show of force denounced by local leaders as an "intimidation tactic" and "political stunt."

Activists and residents, who have documented increased raids, viewed the operation as a demonstration of escalation rather than effective enforcement.

          <p>Tesla shares fell 6.8%, wiping $79 billion off the company's value, due to investor concern over Elon Musk's launch of a new U.S. political party, the "America party."

This political engagement adds to existing consumer backlash stemming from his strong support for Trump, leading to a "broader sense of exhaustion" among shareholders who wish he would remain apolitical during this crucial period for the electric carmaker's brand and financial stability.</p>

It highlights instances such as the halted weapons shipments to Ukraine, the review of the AUKUS security pact, and the apparent unilateral actions of lower-level officials like Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby. The piece argues that President Trump's interest in foreign policy is "capricious and episodic," leading to a policy void filled by inexperienced appointees. This dysfunction is likened to authoritarian states, where major decisions are few and everything else falls to functionaries, raising concerns about national security.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which killed over 100 people, were triggered by exceptionally heavy rainfall over the Fourth of July weekend. Preliminary data indicates rainfall totals ranged from over 6 inches to more than 20 inches in some areas like Bertram and Liberty Hill, leading to rapid and devastating water surges. The Guadalupe River, near San Antonio, notably rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the predawn hours of Friday. This rapid flooding is attributed to the Texas Hill Country's unique dry, packed soil, which causes rain to run off quickly, and the convergence of multiple weather factors including remnant moisture from Tropical Storm Barry. Forecasters anticipate additional rainfall, maintaining flood watches for the hard-hit region.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced new tariff rates on multiple countries, including Japan and South Korea, citing "unsustainable Trade Deficits" with the U.S., with these levies set to begin on August 1. Simultaneously, a previously announced pause on "reciprocal" tariffs has been extended until the same date. This move comes as few trade deals have been reached during the initial 90-day pause, suggesting Trump aims to force negotiations. However, the future of these tariffs remains uncertain due to Trump's unpredictable trade policy and a pending court case challenging their legality. The article notes that a drastic dip in markets previously spooked Trump into backing down, indicating potential for further shifts in policy.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Ban Misconduct and Discrimination NDAs in Workplaces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 17:44:24 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, expected to become law later this year, will void confidentiality agreements preventing workers from speaking about such allegations. This significant move, championed by campaigners like Zelda Perkins who famously broke her NDA with Harvey Weinstein, aims to curb the widespread misuse of NDAs to cover up criminality and abuse of power. The change aligns the UK with countries like Ireland and the U.S. Employment rights minister Justin Madders called the practice "appalling," stating the amendment will empower workers and promote accountability and transparency in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters marched in Mexico City, some holding "gringo go home" signs, to denounce gentrification and the influx of foreigners, particularly Americans, whom they blame for soaring rents and displacement of locals. The July 4th protest, advertised as against "American imperialism," saw instances of vandalism of storefronts and harassment of tourists. While condemning the vandalism, Mexico City's President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged the legitimate complaints about gentrification as a phenomenon that needs addressing. Analysts, however, suggest rising housing costs predate the pandemic influx and are more broadly due to high construction costs and inadequate housing policies, rather than solely foreign arrivals, adding complexity to the issue.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki volcano erupted twice, sending volcanic ash up to 11 miles high and causing dozens of flight cancellations between Bali and other international destinations. While no casualties were immediately reported, the volcano has been at the highest alert level since June, with an exclusion zone expanded to 4.3 miles. The eruption generated avalanches of searing gas clouds and lava flows, indicating significant magma movement within the crater. Authorities urged the public to stay clear of the danger zone and warned of potential lava floods from heavy rain. This event highlights Indonesia's frequent seismic activity along the "Ring of Fire," with a previous major eruption in November 2024 killing nine people.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey Coast Guard rescue swimmer, Scott Ruskan, is being lauded as a hero for his pivotal role in saving over 165 individuals from the deadly Texas floods. On his first mission, Ruskan navigated severe weather to reach Camp Mystic, where hundreds were trapped, and established a triage center on the ground. He and his team performed crucial airlifts, as bridges and roadways were impassable for other rescue methods. Ruskan comforted traumatized children and credited his crew, while his family expressed immense pride in his dedication to saving lives, highlighting the profound impact of individual bravery during the disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the wake of the fatal Texas floods, a debate has emerged regarding whether Trump administration cuts to the National Weather Service (NWS) workforce impacted the disaster. While the NWS did experience a reduction of 600 staff from 4,200, and proposed budget cuts for 2026, experts suggest immediate staffing levels for the Texas event were adequate. However, some climate scientists question if communication and coordination with local emergency services were suboptimal due to missing key positions like a "warning coordinating meteorologist." This article examines the complex interplay between budget decisions, staffing, and the effectiveness of disaster preparedness and response.</p>

Hours before the attack, Mosqueda's father had informed police that his son, who had psychological issues, was carrying weapons. The motive remains under investigation by the FBI, with authorities confirming no ongoing public threat, though it's unknown if others were involved.

Dimitrov, the Bulgarian 19th seed, clutched his right pectoral muscle after serving an ace, leading to a tearful exit and a standing ovation from the crowd. Sinner, a three-time major winner, expressed profound sadness for his friend, acknowledging it was "not the end we wanted to see." This unfortunate event marks Dimitrov's fifth consecutive Grand Slam retirement due to injury. Sinner himself sustained an elbow injury earlier in the match and will undergo an MRI scan, casting a shadow on his own tournament prospects despite the advancement.</p>

Compatible smartphones on 4G or 5G networks will vibrate and emit a siren sound for 10 seconds, even if set to silent. Intended for imminent dangers like extreme weather or terror attacks, the system's previous 2023 test revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving or receiving multiple alerts. The Cabinet Office aims to address these problems and ensure public familiarity with the system, which has proven "invaluable" in regional deployments, such as for Storm Eowyn and a World War Two bomb evacuation in Plymouth.

          <p>This article critiques Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, for his assertion that the Trump administration's "Big, Beautiful Bill" will not cause anyone to lose Medicaid coverage, despite the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projecting 8 million Americans will be kicked off. Hassett attempts to discredit the CBO by citing past "errors," specifically regarding Obamacare work requirements, though the bill he referenced never became law. The article highlights Hassett's history of overly optimistic economic predictions, including his 1999 book "Dow 36,000" and a flawed 2020 COVID-19 death projection. It questions the administration's reliance on such figures and the underlying goal of saving money by reducing coverage.</p>

Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel reported that officers, who had previously responded to incidents in the same block over the weekend, rushed back after hearing gunfire. Nearly 140 pieces of ballistic evidence were recovered, and investigators suspect a switch making a gun automatic was involved, with multiple shooters remaining at large. This incident contributes to a violent Fourth of July weekend in the city, which saw six homicides and numerous shootings, though the city's overall homicide rate is down year-over-year.

The states argue that masked and unidentified ICE and CBP agents are conducting "suspicionless" stops, violating residents' rights and creating a "chilling effect" that extends beyond undocumented individuals to U.S. citizens. This approach has "shattered rhythms of everyday life" and impeded local law enforcement, according to the filing.
