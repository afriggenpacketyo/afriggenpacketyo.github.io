          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security will continue to get their monthly checks even if the U.S. government shuts down on October 1. This is because the benefits are classified as mandatory spending, which Congress has already approved without an expiration date. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget requires annual approval, and a shutdown could disrupt other services like benefit verifications, earnings corrections, and Medicare card replacements as some staff are furloughed. The agency's contingency plan indicates that nearly 90% of its workforce would remain on the job.</p>

          <p>Brandon Stanton, the creator of the popular photography project "Humans of New York," has opened up about his personal history, including a past battle with Adderall addiction that led to him flunking out of college. After getting clean and later being fired from a finance job, Stanton found a new sense of purpose by picking up a camera, which eventually led to his ambitious project to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers. His work has since evolved into a massive platform for connection and philanthropy, raising over $20 million for various causes and individuals featured in his stories. His upcoming book, "Dear New York," will donate all proceeds to charity.</p>

          <p>Following their 15-13 victory over the United States in the Ryder Cup, European players celebrated by playfully taunting former President Donald Trump, who is an avid golf fan and was present at the event. The team was recorded singing "Are you watching Donald Trump?" after Rory McIlroy received a text from him. Trump responded good-naturedly on social media, congratulating the team on their win. The celebration continued on the team bus, with Shane Lowry leading chants, echoing the spirited festivities from their previous victory in Rome two years prior and highlighting the camaraderie among the European players.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariffs set to begin on October 1, including a 50% levy on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture. Industry analysts predict these new taxes will inevitably lead to higher prices for consumers, potentially deterring home renovation projects and disproportionately affecting low-income households who rely on more affordable imported goods. Retailers and manufacturers are now facing increased uncertainty, with some U.S. companies reconsidering product line expansions due to the unpredictable costs. The administration has justified the tariffs as a measure to protect national security and domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, has unveiled a plan to invest $165 million in legal defense services for immigrants as a key part of his platform to "Trump-proof" the city. The proposal aims to significantly increase funding for programs that provide legal representation to New Yorkers at risk of deportation, though it does not specify eligibility criteria between legal and undocumented immigrants. Mamdani's plan is part of a broader vision to establish New York as the nation's strongest sanctuary city by ending cooperation with ICE and protecting immigrants' personal data.

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man accused of killing conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, appeared in court remotely and requested a preliminary hearing. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, charging him with aggravated murder, and have presented text messages and DNA evidence they claim link him to the September 10 shooting at Utah Valley University. According to prosecutors, Robinson left a note for his roommate stating he had an opportunity to kill Kirk and was "going to take it," allegedly motivated by Kirk's rhetoric. The assassination has been framed by some Republicans, including former President Trump, as a political martyrdom, galvanizing right-wing movements.</p>

While single-sex facilities are now mandatory, schools are also permitted to offer gender-neutral toilets to accommodate transgender pupils. The updated guidance marks a change from previous advice that allowed transgender students to use the facilities aligning with their gender identity, and it also removes language suggesting they should participate in sex-segregated PE classes based on identity.</p>

This approach helps bridge the gap between intention and execution, a common hurdle for many savers. While manual reminders like calendar alerts can be effective, experts suggest that automating savings deposits generally yields better results. The article also highlights that people are most motivated to set new goals during "fresh starts," such as the beginning of a new year, a new week, or after a birthday, as these moments provide a psychological boost in optimism.</p>

Workers are encouraged to meticulously track expenses, contact lenders about potential hardship assistance, and research unemployment benefits and health insurance options.

This policy aims to reform the settlement process and is positioned as a clear alternative to the stance of Reform UK, which advocates for abolishing the status entirely.

          <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported construction materials, including kitchen cabinets, furniture, and heavy trucks, are expected to exacerbate the ongoing U.S. housing crisis. These levies will add to existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have already increased the cost of building a new home by thousands of dollars. Experts warn that by making construction more expensive, the tariffs will price more families out of the market, reduce the supply of new homes, and indirectly drive up rental costs. This policy appears to conflict with the administration's stated goal of making housing more affordable.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has indicated that the government is facing difficult financial decisions, hinting at the possibility of further tax rises in the November Budget. In a speech at the Labour party conference, she pledged to keep taxes, inflation, and interest rates as low as possible but warned that choices have been made harder by global events and long-term economic damage. Economists have suggested that tax increases or spending cuts will be necessary for the chancellor to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. Reeves also criticized the previous Conservative government for its economic management, which she claimed sent mortgage costs spiraling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has escalated tensions with Kyiv by declaring that Ukraine is not a sovereign nation, arguing that it is financially dependent on the West for funds and weapons. His comments came as he dismissed Ukrainian accusations that Hungarian reconnaissance drones had violated its airspace, a claim his foreign minister called delusional. Orban, who has maintained closer ties with Russia than most EU leaders, made the remarks during a podcast interview. The diplomatic row deepened as Hungary announced it was blocking access to 12 Ukrainian news sites in retaliation for a similar move by Kyiv against Hungarian portals.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government faces another potential shutdown, a look back reveals that funding lapses have occurred 14 times since 1980. Before then, agencies often continued operations during funding gaps, but legal opinions in the early 1980s established that they lacked the authority to do so. The longest shutdown in U.S. history was a 34-day partial closure in late 2018 and early 2019 over a dispute about border wall funding, which resulted in an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses. These events, once rare, have become more frequent over the past decade as partisan budget fights have intensified in Washington.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent public statements linking Tylenol (acetaminophen) to an increased risk of autism have given a boost to ongoing product liability lawsuits against its manufacturer, Kenvue. One law firm reported receiving over a thousand new inquiries from potential clients following the announcement. Lawyers are now using the administration's attention on the issue, including its citation of a specific scientific expert, as new ammunition in their appeal of a case that was previously dismissed by a judge. While legal experts are skeptical that the president's remarks will sway the court without new scientific data, the development creates a significant public relations challenge for the drugmaker.</p>

After finding that the man who created the images had likely broken no laws because the content was not distributed, the women teamed up with a state senator to propose new legislation. The bill would fine AI companies $500,000 for every nonconsensual deepfake generated in the state, aiming to hold the technology platforms accountable.

The inquiry, which is examining the pandemic's impact on children, also heard that the subsequent school closures in January 2021 were described by Williamson as a "panicked decision" that did not prioritize children's interests, a characterization disputed by then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a homeowner with a $300,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $1,824. This represents a significant saving compared to earlier this year when rates were higher; for instance, it is about $180 less per month than the payment would have been in January when rates averaged 7.04%. The lower rates have spurred an increase in both new mortgage applications and refinancing activity as borrowers look to capitalize on the reduced costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation before the fiscal year begins on October 1, forcing federal agencies to cease all non-essential operations. Essential services, such as national security, law enforcement, and air traffic control, continue to function, but employees in these roles work without immediate pay. Other federal workers are furloughed, and services like national parks and some customer service functions at agencies are curtailed or closed. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare continue to send payments, but administrative services can face delays, impacting new enrollments and other support functions.</p>
