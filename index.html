          <p>The NHL's first semi-remotely conducted draft has drawn criticism from some league veterans, including Kings GM Ken Holland, for its lack of energy and personal connection. The new format involved top prospects in a Los Angeles theater while team executives made selections from their home cities via video link. The event was marked by technical glitches and an awkward, slow pace, which some felt detracted from the celebratory moment for the young players. The change was a departure from the traditional, single-venue event where all parties were present.</p>
