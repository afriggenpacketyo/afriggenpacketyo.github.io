          <h2>Kimbal Musk Criticizes Brother-Advisor Elon's Tariffs as Harmful to Consumers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, publicly criticized President Trump's tariff policies, calling them a permanent tax on American consumers via social media platform X. He argued that even if tariffs bring jobs back to the U.S., prices will remain high due to inefficiencies in domestic production. This comes amid reports of strain in Elon Musk's relationship with the Trump administration due to the negative impact of tariffs on Tesla's stock. Kimbal Musk has also donated to anti-Trump political action committees, further highlighting the differing political views within the Musk family.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have expressed concerns about President Trump's tariff policies, warning of the risks for American consumers and the economy. Cruz stated that tariffs are taxes on consumers and hopes they are short-lived, while Paul criticized Trump's argument of a national emergency regarding trade deficits. Despite these concerns, there are limited signs of widespread cracks in overall GOP support for Trump, although some senators are working on bipartisan legislation to require congressional approval for new tariffs. Trump has vowed to veto any such bill.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson and Representative Anna Paulina Luna have reached an agreement to allow new parents to vote remotely through vote pairing. This deal resolves a standoff that paralyzed the House and threatened to delay a vote on President Trump's agenda. Luna had introduced a discharge petition to bypass leadership and force a vote on a bill allowing new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after childbirth. The agreement allows the entire conference to use vote pairing in cases of inability to vote, such as new parents or emergencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews several long-term care insurance providers, highlighting their strengths in areas like comparing multiple providers (GoldenCare), offering discounts (Northwestern Mutual), serving seniors (New York Life), policy customization (Mutual of Omaha), and overall offerings (Nationwide). Long-term care insurance is crucial for covering expenses not typically covered by Medicare, such as nursing homes and in-home care. The cost of long-term care insurance varies based on age, coverage amount, and health status, with premiums increasing with age and pre-existing conditions. Alternatives to traditional long-term care insurance include hybrid life insurance policies and self-funding.</p>

          <p>The husband of Lumberton Township, New Jersey, Mayor Gina LaPlaca, who was arrested for allegedly driving under the influence with their toddler son, defended his wife and downplayed the significance of the incident. He argued that Lumberton is a small town and requested privacy for his wife as she seeks treatment for addiction. The mayor has faced calls for resignation, including from New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, but has not yet stepped down. LaPlaca faces multiple charges, including endangering a child and driving while intoxicated, and is due in court later this month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As bonds regain popularity amidst market volatility driven by President Trump's tariffs, investors are increasingly favoring actively managed bond strategies over indexed bond funds. This shift is due to the belief that active managers can outperform in the fixed-income market with more consistency than active stock managers. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, the benchmark for many passive bond ETFs, is seen as flawed and "uninvestable" by some bond managers. Active management allows for deviation from this outdated index and access to a broader range of bond market opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The bishops had previously sued the Trump administration over the funding halt but lost the case in federal court. The announcement did not specify whether the cuts would lead to layoffs, but the bishops have asked for prayers for impacted staff and refugees.</p>

          <p>U.S. oil prices fell sharply on Monday, extending last week's losses due to concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. U.S. crude oil closed at its lowest level since 2021, while Brent also experienced significant declines. The decision by OPEC+ to increase production hikes has further contributed to the downward pressure on oil prices. While Trump touted the lower oil prices, worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher prices for businesses, potentially slowing down economic activity and reducing demand for oil.</p>

          <p>The market is swinging as economists cite recession risks. The S&P 500 initially fell into a bear market before rebounding on reports of a potential tariff freeze. Investors have criticized Trump's tariffs, fearing they will hinder economic growth and increase inflation. The near-term future of equity prices depends on Trump's decisions.</p>

          <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that many CEOs believe the U.S. is likely in a recession, citing concerns within the airline industry. He also expressed concerns that President Trump's tariff policies could increase inflation and hinder the Federal Reserve's ability to cut interest rates. Fink believes the market's expectation of multiple rate cuts by the Fed this year is unlikely, and he worries about potentially elevated inflation. BlackRock, a major asset management firm, manages over $11 trillion in assets.</p>

          <p>Obina Christopher Ezeoke, jailed for life for murdering a mother and her nephew, won a European human rights claim due to the excessive length of his trial process. He faced five trials before conviction, with delays caused by judge illness, hung juries, and the Covid pandemic. The European Court of Human Rights ruled the five-year process breached his right to a fair hearing within a reasonable time. However, his appeal for immediate release was rejected, and he received no compensation.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced significant volatility, fluctuating between losses and gains, as investors reacted to President Trump's tariff policies. Goldman Sachs economists have raised the odds of a recession due to the combination of tariffs, policy uncertainty, and declining confidence. Overseas stock markets also suffered steep losses. The near-term future of equity prices depends heavily on Trump's decisions, with the possibility of tariff relief potentially turning sentiment around quickly.</p>

          <p>John Mulaney's new Netflix talk show, "Everybody's Live With John Mulaney," experiments with the late-night format by prioritizing comedy over traditional talk-show conventions. Mulaney incorporates absurdist sketches, conversations with celebrity guests and experts on random topics, and live calls from viewers, all while maintaining a loose and unpredictable atmosphere. The show draws inspiration from classic talk shows like The Merv Griffin Show and The Tomorrow Show, focusing on creating a unique and entertaining experience for the audience. By emphasizing humor over topicality, Mulaney challenges the conventional structure of late-night television.</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield rose above 4% despite President Trump's tariffs sparking fears of an economic slowdown. The 10-year Treasury yield's move higher comes even as traders raised their expectations for lower Federal Reserve rates on expectations for a weaker economy. The tariffs have stoked fears of a global trade war, as countries respond with their own tariffs on the U.S. Investors are reeling from the effects of the Trump tariffs unveiled last week, which hit more than 180 countries and set a baseline tariff of 10% across the board.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the US Supreme Court to block a lower court order requiring the return of a man deported to El Salvador. The administration argues that the Maryland judge lacked authority and US officials cannot compel El Salvador to return the man. The government claims the man was deported due to an "administrative error", but also alleges he is a member of the MS-13 gang. A federal judge ruled the government must bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back, but the administration argues the deadline is "arbitrary and impossible".</p>

Despite the admission of an "administrative error," the administration maintains that the man is a member of MS-13 and should not be on the streets of America. The official also addressed concerns about students facing deportation for criticizing Israel, asserting that visa holders are subject to a different set of rules.</p>
