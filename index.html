          <p>Chicago Cubs legend and Baseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg has passed away at the age of 65 following a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered as a hero to a generation of fans, Sandberg's career spanned 16 seasons, where he was celebrated for his integrity, grit, and competitive spirit. The ten-time All-Star and nine-time Gold Glove winner was not only a dominant force on the field but also served as a team ambassador and minor league manager after his retirement.

          <p>A gunman wearing body armor killed four people, including an off-duty NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before being found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident, which occurred at 345 Park Avenue, prompted a massive police response and a lockdown, with employees inside describing harrowing moments of barricading themselves in conference rooms. The motive for the attack is currently under investigation, and authorities have confirmed the shooter acted alone. The building houses several prominent corporate headquarters, including the NFL and Blackstone, though no connection to them has been established.</p>

          <p>Israel has permitted more humanitarian aid into Gaza following international pressure over images of widespread hunger, but the United Nations reports it is merely a fraction of what is required. Despite aid convoys and airdrops, the situation remains desperate, with the U.N. warning that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and the death toll from hunger is rising. The agency is calling for the opening of all crossings to allow at least 500-600 trucks of essential supplies daily to avert a deeper starvation crisis. The aid increase comes amid continued fighting, with Israel announcing daily tactical pauses to facilitate distribution.</p>

          <p>Intense rainstorms battering northern China have resulted in the deaths of at least 30 people on the outskirts of Beijing. The severe weather has prompted the evacuation of over 80,000 residents from the Chinese capital. According to state media reports, the fatalities occurred in the hilly, outlying districts of Miyun and Yanqing, which are located far from the city's downtown area. The situation is ongoing as authorities continue to manage the impact of the heavy rainfall and flooding in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a memo affirming the rights of federal employees to express their religious beliefs at work, including attempting to persuade colleagues about their faith. The guidance from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can engage in such discussions, display religious items, and invite coworkers to services, provided the expression is not harassing and ceases if requested. This policy, which builds on Clinton-era guidelines, is part of a broader push for religious expression under the Trump administration. The move has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who argue it unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing in the workplace.</p>

This follows a weekend call with French and German leaders and a presentation of the plan to U.S. President Donald Trump, aiming to provide immediate relief and a pathway to a two-state solution. The initiative comes amid renewed pressure on the UK government to recognize Palestinian statehood, a move supported by over half of Labour's backbench MPs.

Carville believes that concentrating on this simple, high-impact economic contrast is the most effective strategy for the upcoming elections.

          <p>School districts across the United States are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the abrupt discontinuation of federal grants by the Trump administration. Citing concerns over diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Department of Education suspended millions in funding, leaving many mental health staffers in danger of losing their jobs. A CBS News analysis reveals a severe nationwide shortage of school counselors, particularly in rural areas, which will be exacerbated by these cuts. Sixteen states are now suing the department, arguing the loss of these resources poses a significant safety and wellness issue for students.</p>

The move has drawn criticism from some policy experts and Democratic Senator Andy Kim, who called it a "deeply concerning break with bipartisan precedent."

Residents on fixed incomes, who receive minimal benefits, rely heavily on local food pantries to survive. Food banks like Golden Harvest are now bracing for a surge in demand as federal budget cuts reduce SNAP benefits by billions over the next decade. The strain is compounded by the USDA's recent termination of programs that helped food banks source food from local producers, increasing reliance on community donations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that President Trump's recent trade agreement with the European Union failed to generate a market rally because investors are preoccupied with more immediate concerns. He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on this week's major tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and forthcoming employment data. According to Cramer, investors may have developed "tariff ennui," as the pattern of threatening high tariffs followed by a negotiated deal has become predictable. Until these other major economic events pass, trade policy is unlikely to be a primary market driver. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is currently reviewing the legality of aggressive U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics in Southern California, with judges questioning the constitutionality of the agency's "roving patrols." The case challenges sweeps where agents allegedly detained individuals based on race or location without reasonable suspicion, a practice a lower court has already blocked. The Justice Department argues the injunction is an overreach of judicial authority, while civil rights groups contend it is necessary to prevent 4th Amendment violations. The appellate court's decision could set a major precedent for immigration enforcement and potentially lead to a Supreme Court showdown.</p>

          <p>A court in Bogotá has found former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe guilty of witness tampering and fraud, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been criminally convicted. The 73-year-old was found to have bribed witnesses to provide false testimony in a separate investigation into his alleged ties to right-wing paramilitary groups. The case, which originated in 2012, has been highly politicized and represents a significant moment in Colombia's efforts to reckon with its violent past. Uribe, who has consistently maintained his innocence, faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic suggests that President Donald Trump's primary source of information is television news, which heavily influences his policy decisions and public statements. This reliance was evident in his recent comments on the Gaza hunger crisis, which he acknowledged only after seeing compelling images on TV, despite having access to extensive intelligence. This media-centric approach makes the president highly susceptible to manipulation and narrows his understanding of complex issues. Critics express concern that this tendency, combined with a distrust of expert advice, poses significant risks, especially in an age of sophisticated misinformation.</p>

While the team's offensive struggles are a concern, preventing runs is seen as a key to their potential postseason success, especially with a strong starting rotation shaping up. Minnesota Twins center fielder Harrison Bader has emerged as a prime target, valued for his premium defense and solid offensive production. Such a move would aim to bolster an outfield that has struggled defensively, complementing the team's high-powered, but currently underperforming, lineup.</p>

The 2016 case, in which Hogan was awarded $140 million for the publication of a private sex tape, did not set new legal precedent but served as a cultural turning point for media law and privacy. It reinforced the limits of First Amendment protections when dealing with graphic personal content, even if newsworthy. The verdict highlighted the right to privacy in the digital age and has made media outlets more cautious about publishing deeply personal information.</p>
