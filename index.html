This motion comes after a judge denied the DA's request to withdraw a previous motion in favor of reduced sentences. The brothers, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are seeking clemency from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who ordered the risk assessment. The DA argues that the court should have the most current risk assessments before making any resentencing decisions.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has announced it will appeal a judge's order requiring the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, while simultaneously releasing documents allegedly linking him to the MS-13 gang. The documents, based on clothing and a confidential informant, are being questioned by Abrego Garcia's attorneys, who deny his gang affiliation. The case involves the wrongful deportation of Abrego Garcia, who had a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution.</p>

            <p>Grant Shapps, the former UK defence minister, expressed his disgust at Donald Trump's favorable attitude towards Vladimir Putin and Russia. Shapps criticized Trump's description of a Russian missile strike that killed dozens in Ukraine as a "mistake," calling it "weasel language." He argued that Trump's lack of moral clarity is demoralizing for the democratic world and emboldens other autocrats with territorial ambitions. Shapps suggested that Trump's appeasement of Putin could encourage further aggression.</p>
