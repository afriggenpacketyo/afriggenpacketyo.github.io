          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a rally following President Trump's indication of easing trade tensions with China, including a substantial reduction in tariffs. Trump also reassured markets by stating he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Tesla shares jumped after CEO Elon Musk announced a significant reduction in his time dedicated to the Department of Government Efficiency, paving the way for his return to the company. The tech sector, including Meta and Nvidia, also saw considerable gains, contributing to the overall market upswing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Charities in Thailand are implementing significant cuts to food allowances for over 80,000 refugees from Myanmar due to a foreign aid shortfall and rising demand. The US State Department reduced its funding, exacerbating the impact of inflation and a growing refugee population following the 2021 Myanmar coup. Refugees, largely barred from working, depend on these allowances, and the cuts will disproportionately affect those in 'standard households,' leading to potential malnutrition increases. The charities are urging the Thai government to allow refugees to work outside camps to alleviate the crisis.</p>

          <p>Stock futures rose sharply after President Trump clarified that he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and indicated a willingness to de-escalate trade tensions with China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks about a potential de-escalation of the trade war also boosted investor confidence. Tesla shares rose despite a lackluster earnings call, fueled by Elon Musk's announcement of reduced involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency. Positive rhetoric on trade led to a surge in market indices.</p>
