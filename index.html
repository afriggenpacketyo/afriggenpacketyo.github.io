          <p>Federal immigration agents conducting a raid at a farm in Southern California clashed with protesters, leading to at least one detention. The agents, who were masked, reportedly used crowd control measures like irritants during the confrontation in Ventura County. This incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, which has deployed troops to California and instructed ICE to oversee a large-scale deportation program, sparking fear and criticism from local officials.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is facing bipartisan criticism for spending $430,000 in taxpayer funds on a private law firm to prepare for a congressional hearing. The hearing, led by the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee, focused on "sanctuary city" policies in blue states. Republican lawmakers called the expense exorbitant, while Walz's office defended the cost by describing the hearing as a "planned political stunt" by Republicans. Other Democratic governors have also incurred high legal fees for similar congressional appearances.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six personnel members for their roles in the "operational failure" during the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, last year. A newly released report acknowledged the security lapses that allowed a gunman to fire at the rally, killing an attendee and injuring Trump. The agency stated it is implementing reforms, including improved technology and clearer accountability, to prevent future incidents, while Trump expressed satisfaction with the investigation despite noting mistakes were made.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a faster rate than the overall pace of global warming. This acceleration means that even small increases in global temperatures can lead to significantly longer and more dangerous periods of extreme heat. The research highlights growing risks, particularly in tropical regions, and underscores the urgent need for faster adaptation strategies to protect public health, agriculture, and infrastructure from the escalating threat of prolonged heat events.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a policy change that excludes undocumented children from the federal Head Start preschool program, reversing decades of precedent. The move is part of a broader strategy to make life more difficult for undocumented immigrants and affects at least 12 other programs now reclassified as "federal public benefits." Critics, including the National Head Start Association, warn this will create fear and confusion among all low-income families, not just those directly impacted, and deny vulnerable children access to crucial early education and nutrition.</p>

          <p>Many of Donald Trump's supporters are expressing feelings of betrayal after the FBI announced it found no so-called "client list" in its review of the Jeffrey Epstein files and would not be releasing more documents. For years, Trump and his allies fueled speculation that his administration would unmask a secret ring of elites involved in Epstein's crimes. The FBI's conclusion that no such list exists has splintered parts of the MAGA movement, with some followers now directing their conspiracy theories toward the Trump administration itself.</p>

          <p>According to CDC data, emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. are at their highest level in six years, with a notable spike in the Northeast. Experts attribute the increase to record-high tick populations and a longer tick season caused by climate change-driven warming. Ticks can transmit numerous diseases, including Lyme disease, making prevention critical. Health officials urge the public to use insect repellent, wear protective clothing outdoors, and perform thorough tick checks after returning inside to mitigate the growing public health threat.</p>

          <p>Just days after catastrophic floods killed over 120 people in Kerr County, Texas, it was revealed that officials were scheduled to begin developing a new flood monitoring system in mid-July. The system was intended as a decision-support tool for emergency managers in a region known as "flash flood alley," not a public alert network. The timing highlights the long-standing and unaddressed need for better flood preparedness in the area, as many residents reported receiving emergency alerts late or not at all during the recent disaster.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is compelling former Biden administration aides to testify in a GOP-led congressional investigation by waiving their executive privilege, a legal protection he once warned would do "grave damage" to the presidency. During the Jan. 6 investigation, Trump fought vigorously against then-President Biden's decision to waive privilege for his own aides, arguing it would create a cycle of political retribution. Now, his administration is using the same tactic to probe Biden's health, a move constitutional experts see as a troubling escalation of political weaponization.</p>
