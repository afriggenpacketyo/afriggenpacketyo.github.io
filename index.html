          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing in action in 1944, has been reunited with his personal Zippo lighter. A relative discovered the lighter, inscribed with Musashe's name and hash marks for his 27 missions, in a Facebook post by a Swiss collector. After being contacted by U.S. officials, the collector graciously returned the artifact to the family. The airman's 95-year-old sister, who last saw her brother as a child, was able to hold the memento, fulfilling a long-held wish to have a piece of him home.</p>

          <h2>Trump States Firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is 'Highly Unlikely'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 12:46:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly downplayed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling the action "highly unlikely" despite reports to the contrary. This statement followed a private meeting where Trump reportedly told Republican lawmakers he intended to dismiss Powell, a move they supported. The conflict stems from Trump's persistent criticism of the Fed's interest rate policies, which he claims are politically motivated and harmful to the economy. Despite the president's attacks and alleged drafting of a dismissal letter, Powell has maintained that his removal is not permitted under law.</p>

          <p>A CNBC study has identified the best states for workers in 2025, considering factors like workforce education, STEM job concentration, training programs, and net migration of skilled labor. Texas claimed the top spot due to its large talent pool and high concentration of students in career-focused fields. Florida ranked second, praised for its success in attracting talent and effective worker training programs, while Georgia placed third for its leadership in career and vocational education. The report notes that while the nationwide labor shortage has eased, a skilled workforce remains a critical factor for business location decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a court ruling that blocked a new federal rule to automatically remove medical debt from credit reports, consumers must take personal action to address these financial burdens. This article outlines several effective strategies for individuals seeking to clear medical debt from their credit history. Key methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating a settlement with collection agencies, and applying for financial assistance or forgiveness programs offered by many healthcare providers. Additionally, consumers should verify that any medical collection under $500 has been removed, in accordance with credit bureau policies established in 2023.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, IMAX presents a compelling investment opportunity within the movie industry due to its unique and resilient business model. Unlike traditional theater chains, IMAX primarily sells or leases its high-end theater systems to operators and earns recurring revenue from maintenance. The company has demonstrated strong momentum, reporting its best-ever first quarter and securing agreements for numerous new systems globally. With a growing presence in international markets and partnerships with major studios and streamers for exclusive releases, IMAX appears well-positioned for continued growth.

The budget, which must be unanimously approved by member states, also allocates 35% to climate initiatives and triples funding for migration management.

It also sets new annual and aggregate limits for graduate students and parents borrowing through the Parent PLUS program, while eliminating Grad PLUS loans entirely.

She explains that returning for this project felt right, particularly as it was her first time working with a female director and for a role Dunham wrote specifically for her.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the significant political development of Donald Trump's MAGA base openly rebelling against him regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The uprising was triggered by the Trump Justice Department's conclusion that Epstein died by suicide and that no incriminating "client list" exists, which contradicts long-held conspiracy theories within the movement. For the first time, Trump's attempts to dismiss the issue as a "hoax" have been met with resistance from his most ardent supporters. This situation reveals a deep-seated belief system within MAGA world, where the Epstein case personifies a "deep state" conspiracy they feel Trump has failed to expose.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a strong performance from its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased by 22% to $3.72 billion, with revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. The equities trading desk was a standout, generating $4.3 billion in revenue, a 36% jump from the previous year. This performance reflects a broader Wall Street trend where market volatility, spurred by President Trump's tariff policies, has created a favorable environment for trading in bonds, currencies, and stocks.

          <p>ProPublica climate reporter Abrahm Lustgarten characterizes the recent deadly floods in Texas as a stark preview of future chaos driven by climate change. In an NPR interview, he expressed deep concern over the combination of increasingly common erratic weather events and simultaneous cuts to crucial scientific agencies like FEMA and NOAA. Lustgarten argues that the undermining of science at a time when its guidance is most needed creates an extraordinarily dangerous situation. He suggests that the disaster in Texas should serve as a critical wake-up call for what lies ahead if these trends continue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed that First Lady Melania Trump has influenced his thinking on the war in Ukraine, leading to a wave of positive attention on Ukrainian social media. The president recounted how his wife would point out the contradiction of him having a "nice phone call" with Vladimir Putin shortly before Russia launched more missiles into Ukraine. This insight reportedly contributed to Trump setting a 50-day deadline for a ceasefire. Observers note that the first lady, who grew up in the former Yugoslavia, may have a unique perspective on the threat posed by Russia.</p>

          <p>This article provides a timeline of the Jeffrey Epstein affair, tracing its evolution from his 2019 death to the current political turmoil within the MAGA movement. It recounts key moments, including Trump's initial promotion of conspiracy theories about Epstein's death and his 2024 campaign pledge to declassify related files. The timeline culminates in the recent Justice Department announcement that no "client list" exists, a finding that sparked outrage among Trump's base. This has led to an unprecedented situation where the president is publicly pleading with his supporters to abandon the issue, which they have so far refused to do.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife following a dispute over sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support the allegations, which included misconduct and misgendering. This decision was announced as an employment tribunal, where Peggie claims unlawful discrimination, resumed. The case highlights the ongoing and complex debate over transgender rights and single-sex spaces.</p>

          <p>In a significant reversal, Republican senators have amended a spending cut package to exempt the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) from budget reductions. The initial proposal sought to cut $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, but bipartisan concern prompted lawmakers to protect its funding. The broader rescissions bill still targets $9 billion in cuts, primarily aimed at international aid and public broadcasting. The amendment was welcomed by global health advocates, who had warned that the original cuts posed a huge threat to the lives of people in lower-income countries.</p>

          <p>A Hungarian opposition parliamentarian, Katalin Cseh, has urged U.S. Democrats to study Hungary's democratic backsliding to effectively counter Donald Trump's autocratic tendencies. Speaking at a forum, Cseh warned against an "it can't happen here" mentality, emphasizing that the playbook used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is being emulated by the MAGA movement. She advised Democrats to mobilize immediately for the 2026 midterms, build a broad and inclusive movement, and focus on issues like the cost of living that resonate with voters, rather than purely technical or legalistic arguments against authoritarianism.</p>

The department announced that Matt Buckham, currently the HHS liaison to the White House, will serve as acting chief of staff.
