          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists infiltrated RAF Brize Norton, a key UK airbase, and sprayed red paint on two military planes, leading to condemnation from Prime Minister Keir Starmer and an ongoing investigation. Palestine Action claimed responsibility, asserting they disabled air-to-air refueling tankers to disrupt British military support for Israel. The Ministry of Defence is reviewing security protocols, while RAF engineers assess the damage, expecting minimal operational impact. The group has previously targeted arms companies, and this incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding the UK's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The protesters used repurposed fire extinguishers to spray red paint into the planes' engines.</p>

          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to loan £4.5 billion to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK, marking a significant private capital investment in a project of national interest. The unsecured lending to EDF, the majority owner, is expected to have an interest rate below 7%, although the funds are believed to be specifically for Hinkley Point C. The project, which aims to construct two nuclear reactors, has faced delays and budget increases, especially after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted funding amid government tensions. The first reactor is anticipated to be operational by 2029, powering approximately six million homes and contributing to the UK's nuclear energy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Same-store sales increased by 4.6%, with Olive Garden and LongHorn showing strong performance, while the fine dining segment experienced a decline.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to keep two Michigan coal plants, JH Campbell and Monroe, operational despite their scheduled closures, citing grid reliability concerns. Opponents argue the move lacks support in Michigan, could raise costs for ratepayers, and is ideologically driven, as the plants contribute significantly to the state's greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. Consumers Energy stated they do not need the Campbell plant to meet energy needs, and Michigan's climate law requires 100% clean energy by 2040. Attorney General Dana Nessel has indicated potential legal action, calling Trump's energy emergency "fabricated," and the Sierra Club notes the order will increase costs for ratepayers.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have found major differences in the blood of individuals with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, compared to healthy individuals, suggesting the condition is biological rather than psychological. The study, using data from the UK Biobank, compared 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals and identified consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease. This finding challenges the long-held belief that ME/CFS is primarily psychological and supports the development of a diagnostic blood test, and the research also indicated that ME is a "female bias" condition.</p>

          <p>An expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant may not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs, due to the facility's depth and reinforced structure. Joe Cirincione notes that the exact nature of the facility's defenses is not fully known, and even a successful strike would not eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons capability. He suggests multiple strikes would be needed to damage the facility, and Iran has the knowledge and resources to resume its program elsewhere. His analysis comes as President Trump considers potential military action against Iran, with a decision expected within two weeks.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, a U.S. official suggests that President Trump's two-week window for a decision on military action offers a chance for diplomacy. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in communication, though no meetings are planned. European diplomats are set to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva, but some U.S. officials are skeptical of their potential for success. Trump's move is viewed by some as giving Iran room to "come to their senses."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>States across the U.S. are offering significant tax breaks to attract data centers, resulting in the forfeiture of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, and these incentives benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, with data center investment projected to reach $1 trillion by 2027. Watchdog groups argue that the tradeoffs are questionable, as data centers don't create many jobs but require immense amounts of electricity. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 16 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. The growing number of tax breaks has sparked a debate about whether these corporations should receive such generous incentives. (not investment advice)</p>

The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling that ordered compensation for Masaaki Okawara and Junji Shimada, who were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production. The charges were later withdrawn in July 2021, and Okawara expressed that the apology should have come sooner. The family of a third individual, Shizuo Aishima, who died after falling ill during detention, did not accept the apology.</p>
