            <p>Germany's centrist parties, including the CDU/CSU and SPD, have finalized a coalition agreement, signaling a new government poised to address economic stability and security. Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader, emphasized the coalition's commitment to reform, investment, and European cooperation. Negotiations were challenging, particularly regarding taxes, the budget, and migration policies. The agreement comes as Europe faces potential economic challenges from escalating global trade tensions, specifically tariffs imposed by the United States. Optimism around this new government is high as they hope to strengthen Germany's position in the global economy.</p>

            <p>US stocks experienced mixed and volatile trading as the US imposed 104% tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China, raising tariffs on US goods to 84%.

This instability led to a selloff in US Treasury markets, increasing bond yields and raising concerns about safe-haven assets. The situation reflects a broader market downturn since the initial tariff announcements, with the S&P 500 nearing bear market territory. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The bond market is causing concern on Wall Street as prices are tumbling and yields are spiking, an unusual occurrence during times of growing recession fears. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped significantly, reaching its highest point since February, and the 30-year Treasury yield hit a level not seen since November 2023. Experts suggest that U.S. Treasury markets are losing their traditional haven status due to the implementation of Trump's tariffs, which is further escalating the global trade war.

            <p>Prince Harry's decision to step back from his role as a working royal led to a "unique set of circumstances" regarding his personal security, a government barrister told the Court of Appeal. The Duke of Sussex is appealing a decision to downgrade his police protection at public expense when visiting the UK. The government argues that a flexible approach was appropriate given Harry's changed status. The court is considering whether the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec) acted appropriately in determining his security level.</p>

            <p>Global bond markets experienced volatility as President Trump's tariffs led to a sell-off in U.S. Treasurys, prompting investors to seek safety. Germany bucked the trend, with its 10-year bund trading lower as investors viewed it as an alternative safe haven. Concerns over a move away from the U.S. dollar and the volatile geopolitical climate contributed to the shift. Experts likened the spike in U.S. government borrowing costs to the U.K.'s 2022 "mini budget" crisis, raising concerns about financial accelerators. (not investment advice)</p>
