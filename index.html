          <p>Israel has ordered residents to evacuate parts of Gaza City in preparation for increased military actions, following overnight strikes that resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties. According to Palestinian health officials, dozens were killed in northern Gaza, with children among the dead, as Israel aims to pressure Hamas to release hostages. The Israeli military claims to be targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants while attempting to minimize harm to civilians, but residents report lacking access to announcements due to internet outages. The ongoing conflict has displaced many Gazans multiple times, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and bringing the enclave to the brink of starvation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging the long-standing interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which grants birthright citizenship to anyone born in the United States. This decision follows President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and some temporary foreign residents. The legal challenge is based on a theory popularized by John Eastman, arguing the amendment primarily addresses slavery, not immigration. Legal experts and immigrant advocacy groups contend that birthright citizenship is a fundamental American principle, while proponents of the policy seek to restrict citizenship based on parentage.</p>

          <p>Netflix has announced that its ad-supported tier has reached 94 million monthly active users, marking an increase of over 20 million since November. This growth reflects the company's strategy to incorporate advertising to enhance the profitability of its streaming service, which was first introduced in November 2022. The ad-supported plan costs $7.99 per month, offering a significant discount compared to the least expensive ad-free plan at $17.99 per month. Netflix claims that its ad tier attracts more 18- to 34-year-olds than any U.S. broadcast or cable network.</p>

The Israel-based company sold nearly six million shares at $52 each, exceeding the expected range of $46 to $50, with existing investors selling an additional six million shares. EToro's IPO is being watched closely by Wall Street as a potential sign of renewed interest in IPOs after a period of market correction, with the company's CEO citing stabilization in market volatility as a key factor in the decision to go public.

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, accusing the bank of deceiving customers by failing to inform them about higher interest rates available on its "360 Performance Savings" product. The lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as a high-yield option but then froze its interest rate at 0.3% while offering rates as high as 4.35% on the newer product. The state attorney general's office claims that this practice resulted in New York customers missing out on millions of dollars in interest.

Nye's concept of soft power, which emphasized influence through aid, culture, and human rights promotion, gained prominence in the 1990s and influenced foreign policy circles worldwide. He served in the State Department and Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton and was a critic of Donald Trump's approach to foreign policy. Nye's work challenged the notion that military and economic strength were the only forms of power, advocating for a "smart power" approach that combined hard and soft tactics.</p>

The hearing focused on the department's 2026 budget and quickly shifted to immigration issues, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of breaking the law and making America less safe. Noem defended her department's actions, citing "total operational control" of the southern border and criticizing members of Congress who attempted to access a detention center.

          <p>In light of declining credit card debt balances but persistent concerns about interest rates and inflation, borrowers should consider strategic debt consolidation moves. One option is taking out a new loan at a lower interest rate to pay off existing credit card debt, simplifying payments and reducing interest costs. Borrowers should take the initiative to explore options, shop for lenders to find the most cost-effective solution, and determine the right approach, whether through a debt relief company or independently. Alternatives such as a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan should also be considered to potentially lower interest payments.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is relocating the assembly of the President's Daily Intelligence Brief from the CIA headquarters to her own complex. This decision comes amid President Trump's consideration of whether the Office of the Director of National Intelligence should continue to exist. Gabbard also ordered the National Intelligence Council to relocate to her headquarters as part of an effort to solidify the role of her office. Critics argue that these moves could reduce the ODNI's oversight and create inefficiencies, while officials claim it will offer more timely and actionable intelligence to the president.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan has been charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest, after allegedly helping a Mexican man evade ICE officials through a back door during an arrest attempt. Judge Dugan's defense lawyers argue that she is shielded from prosecution by a legal immunity that protects judges carrying out official acts. The arrest has sparked partisan debate, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of attacking the judicial system and Republicans asserting that no one should be above the law. Judge Dugan has been suspended from the bench pending a hearing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by immigration authorities, concluding that he was unjustly punished for his protected First Amendment speech in support of Palestine. The judge determined that Suri, who had lawful status, was not a flight risk or a danger to the community and should be released on bail. The ACLU argued that Suri was detained based on his views and association with his wife, who had worked with the Gaza foreign ministry. The judge also prohibited the government from redetaining him without a 48-hour notice.</p>

          <p>A Republican plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients is criticized as a thinly veiled attempt to cut health care coverage for millions of Americans. The plan would require able-bodied adults without dependents to prove they are working, volunteering, or in job training to maintain Medicaid benefits, but the Congressional Budget Office estimates it would take coverage from 7.6 million people. Critics argue that the complex reporting demands will cause eligible recipients to lose coverage, and that the savings come from denying coverage to eligible Americans, not from getting people to work.</p>
