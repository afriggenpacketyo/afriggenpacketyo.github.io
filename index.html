          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant decrease in the number of individuals listed as missing following severe flooding earlier in the month. Through extensive follow-up by local, state, and federal agencies, the count dropped from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to verifying that many people initially reported missing were actually safe. The overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was solved using modern consumer technology. Initially, her boyfriend was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit fitness tracker corroborated his alibi, leading to his exoneration. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch, whose location data from Google Dashboard placed him at the crime scene. This technological evidence was crucial in securing Burch's conviction for the murder, highlighting how personal gadgets can play a pivotal role in criminal justice.</p>

          <p>Animal rescue volunteers discovered more than 400 guinea pigs living in deplorable conditions at a residence in South Los Angeles. The animals were found to be overcrowded, lacking proper food and water, and suffering from various medical issues, including open wounds. The Southern California Guinea Pig Rescue group intervened after learning the tenant faced eviction and is now urgently seeking public assistance for adoptions, foster care, and donations. The organization also raised concerns about the initial assessment by city animal services, which reportedly deemed the animals' conditions acceptable.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive six-try win against the US Eagles in a match disrupted by significant weather challenges in Washington D.C. The game experienced long delays due to lightning and was played in highly humid conditions. Despite the interruptions, the English side, composed of many younger players, demonstrated superior precision, leading to a final score of 40-5. The event also highlighted efforts by World Rugby to grow the sport's audience in the United States ahead of future World Cups being hosted there.</p>

The proposal is a response to incidents where attackers were fixated on violence itself rather than a specific terrorist cause.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of rapid growth, interest in learning the Mandarin language appears to be declining in many Western nations, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. University enrollments for Chinese language studies have dropped significantly from their peaks in the last decade. This shift is attributed to a combination of factors, including strained geopolitical relations with China, which has made the country a less attractive destination for work and study. The decline marks a notable reversal from a time when Mandarin was widely promoted as the essential language for the future of global business.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico, citing a violation of a bilateral aviation agreement. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport to a newer, more distant one, which the U.S. claims unfairly benefits Mexican carriers. All Mexican airlines must now seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The administration also threatened to terminate a long-standing partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico, escalating the trade dispute between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's strategy of deporting migrants to third countries, such as Eswatini and South Sudan, is viewed as a significant departure from previous U.S. policy and a tactic based on deterrence. This analysis follows a recent prisoner swap where Venezuelans deported to El Salvador were returned home in exchange for U.S. nationals. Experts suggest these deals are often motivated by money or a desire from smaller nations to curry favor with the U.S. The practice has drawn legal challenges from groups like the ACLU, who argue it violates international obligations against returning people to places where they may face persecution.</p>
