        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the more than $500 million penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the monetary judgment constituted an "excessive fine" that violates the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. While the financial penalty was struck down, the court upheld the injunctive relief designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices. The original lawsuit, filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James, had resulted in Judge Arthur Engoron finding Trump liable for fraudulently overvaluing his assets for years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 11:07:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Science Advances suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. has a minimal impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, finding that killing wolves did not significantly decrease the number of cattle and sheep killed by predators. According to the findings, it would require killing approximately 14 wolves to save a single cow. The study's authors suggest that non-lethal strategies may be more effective management tools for mitigating human-wildlife conflict, a contentious issue in states with rebounding wolf populations.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has revealed her use of GLP-1 weight-loss medications, stating she turned to them after hitting a wall with traditional diet and exercise following the birth of her children. In a new campaign for the telehealth company Ro, Williams, who is now a celebrity ambassador, shared she has lost 31 pounds in eight months. She also addressed the stigma surrounding these drugs, arguing that using them is not an "easy way out" but a form of self-care that requires courage. Williams joins other public figures, like Oprah Winfrey, in openly discussing their use of these popular but controversial medications.</p>

          <p>Actor Glen Powell has publicly stated he will not pursue the iconic role of James Bond, explaining that he believes the character should be played by an authentic British actor. In an interview, the 36-year-old Texan actor expressed that while he could humorously portray a "Jimmy Bond," the role of James Bond itself belongs in the hands of a Brit. This statement comes amidst ongoing speculation about who will next portray the famous spy, a conversation that has included other actors like Pierce Brosnan, who recently joked about a potential return to the franchise under specific circumstances.</p>

This desire means he cannot simply hand Ukraine over to Russia, as a perceived sellout would be rejected by the Nobel committee and European allies, whose cooperation is necessary for any deal to appear legitimate. The analysis argues that despite Trump's perceived affinity for Vladimir Putin, his leverage is weaker than it seems due to Ukraine's military persistence and Europe's coherent support. Ultimately, the outcome remains uncertain, but the author suggests Trump's personal ambitions may prevent a complete betrayal of Ukrainian interests.</p>

The app is designed to serve both existing cable subscribers, who get access included, and cord-cutters who can now purchase ESPN's full suite of channels via streaming. An unlimited plan is available for $29.99 per month, with various bundle options including Disney+ and Hulu. This move marks a major strategic shift for Disney, making its primary linear sports content available for the first time outside the traditional pay-TV ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has reportedly won the race to sign Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze, making a decisive move after rival club Tottenham Hotspur had already agreed to terms. The transfer materialized quickly after an injury concern arose for Arsenal's Kai Havertz, prompting the club to act on its long-standing interest in Eze. A key factor in the decision was Eze's childhood connection to Arsenal, having played in their academy, which reportedly made his choice straightforward once the offer was made. The signing is seen as a major coup for Arsenal, adding a dynamic and creative option to their attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, financial experts suggest that a home equity loan can be a strategic tool for homeowners to save money. One of the primary uses is for debt consolidation, allowing borrowers to pay off high-interest credit card debt with a loan that has a lower, fixed interest rate, potentially saving thousands. Another effective use is financing home improvements that increase the property's value, as the interest on such loans may be tax-deductible. Experts advise, however, that these loans are best for long-term value creation rather than covering daily expenses or luxury purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

For customers with a Clubcard loyalty card, the price of a main, snack, and drink will increase from £3.60 to £3.85, while the price for non-cardholders will rise to £4.25. This follows a price hike in 2022, which ended a decade-long run of the deal costing £3. The move reflects broader food price inflation and the increasing use of loyalty schemes by retailers to compete for customers and gather data. Other supermarkets, such as Sainsbury's, have also recently increased their meal deal prices.</p>

          <p>A key transportation artery in downtown Des Moines, the Southwest Ninth Street viaduct, will be closed for extensive repairs starting this week and lasting until the end of November. The closure will affect the viaduct from Mulberry to Tuttle streets, as well as the ground-level portion of the street between Cherry Street and West Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway. City officials have established a detour route to help drivers navigate around the construction zone. The project is expected to cause significant traffic disruptions for commuters in the area for the next several months while the necessary repair work is completed.</p>

          <p>The RMT union has announced a seven-day period of rolling strike action across the London Underground, set to begin on Friday, September 5. The union states the walkout is due to the refusal of transport bosses to address concerns over pay, fatigue, extreme shift patterns, and a shorter working week. Different grades of staff, including engineers, station personnel, and train operators, will take industrial action at various times, threatening significant disruption to the city's transport network. Transport for London (TfL) has urged the union to accept its "fair, affordable pay offer" and continue discussions to avoid the strike.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the United Kingdom has fallen to 4.99%, marking the first time it has dipped below the 5% threshold since May 2023. This milestone, along with the average two-year fixed rate also falling, signals a potential turning point in the borrowing market and could boost buyer confidence. The steady decline in borrowing costs over the last year, coupled with wage growth, has slightly improved housing affordability. However, analysts suggest that recent inflation data may limit further significant rate cuts in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

Connolly's case and sentence have sparked a national debate in the UK about free speech and proportionality, with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch arguing her punishment was harsher than that given to some rioters.

The retail giant topped Wall Street's sales estimates but fell short on earnings expectations due to one-time expenses. The company noted that costs from tariffs are rising and that it has had to pass some of those increases on to consumers, though it is also using price rollbacks to maintain its low-price reputation. Despite this, executives reported that consumer spending has remained resilient and consistent, with strong performance in groceries and online sales.</p>

Experts suggest that Beijing's resource constraints and a historical reluctance to enter into such binding security commitments make it an improbable candidate for the role. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov mentioned that Moscow had agreed to a system involving all permanent UN Security Council members, including China. However, China's ambiguous position throughout the conflict and its close ties to Russia mean it is not expected to take a high-profile, formal role in guaranteeing Ukraine's security.</p>

          <p>Following a recent court decision ending a 24-year-old Texas law that granted in-state tuition to undocumented students, thousands are now facing significantly higher education costs and uncertain futures. The policy change, which forces these students to pay much higher out-of-state rates, has led many to disenroll from four-year universities and pivot to more affordable community colleges. This article details the confusion among universities on how to implement the ruling and the potential long-term negative impact on the state's workforce. The original 2001 Texas Dream Act was passed with bipartisan support to bolster the state's economy by educating its long-term residents.</p>

This uptick defied analyst expectations of a slight decline and was attributed to a dip in mortgage rates during the period when contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also rose by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices.

          <p>Financial advisors generally recommend against purchasing annuities for individuals under the age of 50 due to tax penalties for early withdrawals and the long-term growth potential of other investments. Conversely, insurance companies often do not sell annuities to those over 90, as the likelihood of a return on their policy diminishes. For older adults, experts suggest annuities may not be suitable if basic retirement expenses are already covered by other income sources, if there is a need for liquidity, or if the individual has significant health issues. Alternative income strategies include CD ladders and part-time work. (not investment advice)</p>

The review praises the strong performances from Qualley, Aubrey Plaza, and Chris Evans, as well as the sharp dialogue. However, it criticizes the film for feeling shaggy and longer than its 89-minute runtime, describing it as an affectionate in-joke for its creators that doesn't always land with the audience.</p>
