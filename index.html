          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is reportedly phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at several U.S. airports. While the TSA has not made a formal announcement, sources and passenger experiences confirm the change at airports including BWI, LAX, and LaGuardia. This policy shift, which previously only applied to TSA PreCheck members, is part of an effort to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining security. The agency stated it is always exploring innovative ways to improve its processes.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is moving forward with his plan to create a third political party, called the "America Party," and has reportedly been in contact with former presidential candidate Andrew Yang. The conversation focused on Musk's push to challenge the two-party system, potentially by fielding candidates in the upcoming midterm elections. This development follows a public feud between Musk and President Trump over a massive spending bill, which Musk heavily criticized. Yang, who founded his own independent Forward Party, confirmed he is happy to help anyone wanting to move beyond the current political duopoly.</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics has projected a 56% drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling significantly short of analyst expectations. The company is struggling to compete in the high-demand market for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for AI systems developed by industry leader Nvidia. Competitors like SK Hynix have secured key supplier positions with Nvidia, while Samsung has reportedly faced delays in getting its own advanced chips certified. The disappointing earnings forecast reflects these challenges in the AI sector as well as ongoing losses in its chip foundry business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man was stabbed and seriously injured in Colma, California, following a dispute over a place in line for a Pokémon card restock at a GameStop. Police arrested two suspects who allegedly attacked the victim after one of them cut in line. The altercation escalated, with one suspect allegedly striking the victim with a mason jar and the other using the broken glass to stab him. This incident highlights a growing trend of violence associated with the highly profitable Pokémon card resale market, which has prompted some retailers to alter their sales policies for safety.</p>

          <p>An 83-year-old woman was killed after her vehicle was swept away by floodwaters in North Carolina, a result of heavy rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Depression Chantal.

In Chapel Hill, an apartment complex and a shopping center were inundated with water, causing significant damage.

          <p>Roman Starovoit, who was fired from his post as Russia's transport minister by Vladimir Putin, died by suicide just hours later, according to Russian officials. His body was found with a gunshot wound in a car outside Moscow. While the Kremlin gave no reason for his dismissal, Russian media reported that Starovoit was being investigated for embezzlement related to fortifications in the Kursk region, where he was previously governor. The death occurred amid significant air travel disruptions across Russia, which the government attributed to "external interference."</p>

          <p>Seraphine, the high-end maternity fashion retailer famously worn by Catherine, Princess of Wales, has ceased trading and entered administration. The company, which had experienced "trading challenges" and fragile consumer confidence, has made the majority of its 95 staff redundant. Founded in 2002, the brand's popularity soared after being seen on royalty, leading to a stock market listing in 2021 before it was taken private again. Administrators are now exploring options for the business and its assets, marking the end of an era for the prominent maternity brand. (not investment advice)</p>

In his "Feminine Shuttle," he has performed over 1,000 examinations, detecting cancers and other conditions that would otherwise go untreated. His work highlights the devastating impact of the war on Ukraine's healthcare system and the heroic efforts of individuals to fill the void.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to publish the first part of its final report, focusing on the human impact and compensation for victims. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. This initial report from Sir Wyn Williams is expected to be damning and will make recommendations to improve the redress schemes, which have been criticized as inadequate. The second part of the report, which will assign blame for the miscarriage of justice, is not expected until a later date.</p>

Analysts note that shared strategic necessities, particularly in supporting Ukraine and navigating a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy, are driving the neighbors closer. The summit is expected to focus on defense cooperation, migration, and reinforcing a partnership vital for European stability.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting the proposed figures are not final. He argued that the administration's new slate of tariffs is likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a fixed policy, pointing to a history of postponements and reductions. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction to the uncertainty, Cramer believes the ultimate goal is to boost U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. He cautioned against major selling, viewing the tariffs as less impactful on inflation or Fed decisions than some fear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale operation involving federal agents and National Guard troops, some on horseback and in armored vehicles, descended on the MacArthur Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The show of force, which appeared to result in no arrests, was sharply criticized by local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, as a "political stunt" and an "intimidation tactic." The historic immigrant neighborhood was largely empty during the raid, which community leaders characterized as a "reality TV spectacle" designed to provoke fear. This event is part of a recent ramp-up of immigration enforcement actions in the region under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Texas Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism following the state's deadly floods, both for being on vacation in Greece as the disaster unfolded and for his legislative actions. Reports indicate that Cruz was instrumental in adding language to a recent Republican spending bill that cut $150 million from a NOAA fund aimed at improving weather forecasting research and systems. Critics argue these cuts weakened the very systems meant to provide warnings for such events, a charge Cruz denies, calling it "partisan finger pointing." This situation has renewed scrutiny of the senator's priorities and the impact of defunding climate and weather research agencies.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock fell sharply, erasing $79 billion in market value, as investors reacted to Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party. Analysts suggest that Musk's deepening involvement in politics is a significant distraction that shareholders do not want, especially during a crucial period for the company. The move, which followed a public falling out with President Trump, has created concern that Musk's focus will be divided or that his businesses could face political repercussions. This investor anxiety reflects a growing exhaustion with the CEO's ventures outside of his corporate leadership roles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent, seemingly contradictory U.S. foreign policy decisions, such as the temporary halt of Ukrainian aid and a surprise review of the AUKUS security pact, have led to questions about who is directing American defense policy. This analysis from The Atlantic suggests a lack of a coherent process, with President Trump's interest being episodic and key cabinet positions lacking influence. The article posits that in this vacuum, lower-level appointees are able to drive policy according to their own preferences, creating a disjointed and unpredictable approach to critical global issues like the war in Ukraine.</p>

The "Rancho fire" was met with a swift response from multiple fire agencies, including air and ground crews. Officials noted that recent vegetation thinning in the area as part of the city's wildfire mitigation plan helped slow the fire's spread. While no homes were immediately reported damaged, the incident serves as a stark reminder of the wildfire risk in the region, especially from illegal fireworks.</p>
