          <p>A federal judge has postponed the Trump administration's plan to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for around 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling delays the expiration until a November hearing, with the judge criticizing the administration's actions as being based on a "preordained determination" rather than an objective review of country conditions. Most of the affected individuals have resided in the U.S. for over two decades, having been granted TPS due to natural disasters in their home countries. The administration argues that conditions have improved enough for them to return safely.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders' wide receiver Terry McLaurin has reportedly requested a trade following a contract extension dispute. McLaurin, who has surpassed 1,000 receiving yards in his last five seasons, is seeking a deal valued around $32 million annually, aligning him with other top receivers in the league. Despite the trade request, he reported to training camp to avoid fines, though he is currently on the physically unable to perform list with an ankle injury. The Commanders' management has publicly stated their intention to keep the star player on the team.</p>

          <p>An analysis of government data reveals that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests surged by 120% in the initial five months of President Trump's second term compared to the same period in the previous year. Over 109,000 arrests were made, with the majority concentrated in southern and border states like Texas, Florida, and California. The data shows that most arrested individuals were from Latin American or Caribbean countries, reflecting a broader enforcement mandate under the Trump administration. Experts attribute the geographic concentration to local law enforcement cooperation and immigrant population demographics.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Study Reveals Potatoes Evolved from an Ancient Tomato Ancestor Through Hybridization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have determined that the modern potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between a tomato ancestor and a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species from Chile around 9 million years ago. A study published in the journal *Cell* explains that a key gene from the ancient tomato, combined with a gene from the wild potato species, enabled the development of starch-rich tubers. This discovery, based on the analysis of over 500 potato genomes, resolves a long-standing puzzle about the starchy vegetable's evolutionary history. The findings demonstrate how hybridization can spur the emergence of new traits and species.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has exposed China's ongoing practice of purchasing Iranian oil in defiance of U.S. sanctions, utilizing a "dark fleet" of tankers for clandestine ship-to-ship transfers in international waters. These operations, observed off the coast of Malaysia, involve tankers disabling their transponders and obscuring their identities to avoid detection. This illicit trade is a significant source of revenue for Iran, estimated to be as much as $70 billion, which the U.S. fears could fund its nuclear program. Despite new U.S. sanctions, the activity appears to be increasing, with China maintaining that its trade with Iran is legitimate.</p>

This move targets products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and comes after months of escalating trade friction between the two nations. The White House cited Canada's alleged failure to curb the flow of illicit drugs as the reason, though President Trump also linked the decision to Canada's recent recognition of a Palestinian state. Canadian officials have disputed the drug trafficking claims and are coordinating a response to the new levies.</p>

          <p>A woman whose mother died in a car crash is advocating for an overhaul of the UK's "unsafe and inadequate" rules for older drivers. Currently, drivers over 70 must self-declare their fitness to drive when renewing their license every three years, but there is no mandatory testing or upper age limit. Critics, including safety experts and medical professionals, argue this system is insufficient, pointing to underreporting of medical conditions that can impair driving ability. With an aging population, there are growing calls for mandatory medical checks and vision tests to improve road safety for everyone.</p>

This development has sparked anxiety on the island, with analysts suggesting it may be a strategic move by the U.S. to manage trade tensions while negotiating with Beijing.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is considering a special election on November 4 to have voters approve new congressional maps, a move aimed at countering President Trump's efforts to gerrymander Republican-controlled states. Newsom framed the potential action as a direct response to Trump's strategy to retain control of the House of Representatives in the midterm elections. Under the plan, the legislature would create new maps to be voted on, which would remain in effect until 2030, after which the state would revert to its independent redistricting commission system. The governor stated the cost of a special election would be "priceless" to preserve democracy.</p>

          <p>Florida executed Edward Zakrzewski on Thursday for the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, making him the ninth person put to death in the state this year. This number sets a modern-era record for the most executions in Florida within a single year, surpassing the previous high of eight. Zakrzewski, an Air Force veteran, was convicted after killing his family when his wife sought a divorce. Opponents of the execution had highlighted his military service and the non-unanimous jury recommendation for his death sentence, which was 7-5.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by some of their National League rivals. The team addressed needs in their bullpen and outfield by acquiring veteran reliever Brock Stewart from the Minnesota Twins and outfielder Alex Call from the Washington Nationals. The front office expressed confidence in their current roster, suggesting they believe internal improvements from returning injured players will be key for their late-season push. This conservative approach contrasts with last year's more aggressive deadline strategy.</p>

          <p>In response to criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing for its FICO credit scores. Lansing argued that the cost, which he stated is $4.95 for a mortgage score, is a very small part of overall closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. The defense comes after the FHFA head criticized FICO's price hikes and announced that lenders can now use scores from rival VantageScore for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lansing asserted FICO's model is superior and that the new policy raises "safety and soundness concerns." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. Since announcing its closure, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting one last meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses negotiated a temporary extension with the landlord while he actively seeks a new buyer who will respect the landmark's legacy. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted that the restaurant business in L.A. remains challenging due to high costs and post-pandemic demand issues.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration is claiming victory after implementing a new global tariff structure without immediate financial market chaos, the long-term consequences remain uncertain. This analysis suggests that while a full-blown trade war has been averted for now, the policy could still damage the global economy and lead U.S. allies to form new economic alliances. The new regime, established through a series of deals and unilateral decrees, has created more certainty for businesses but at the cost of generally higher tariffs for goods entering the U.S. market. The ultimate impact on American consumers is yet to be fully realized. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colombia's government has reported a significant 43% increase in deforestation in 2024 compared to the previous year, reversing a recent downward trend. The Amazon region was the hardest-hit area, accounting for over 65% of the nearly 114,000 hectares of forest destroyed. Authorities attribute the surge to factors like land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, the cultivation of illicit crops, and wildfires exacerbated by drought. Despite the spike, the overall level of deforestation remains below the 2021 baseline, but the new data is a major setback for conservation efforts.</p>
