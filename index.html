          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is set to unveil its newest military hardware in a significant parade, commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II defeat. This event underscores the PLA's rapid evolution and its ambition to achieve "world-class" military status by 2049, aiming for parity with the US. Despite not engaging in combat for over four decades, the intensity of its exercises and the expansion of its arsenal have garnered global attention. The South China Morning Post is launching a comprehensive databank, "Red Arsenal," to provide a deeper understanding of Beijing's wide-ranging weapon systems and recent military developments.</p>

          <p>Mississippi has declared a public health emergency following a significant rise in its infant mortality rate, which at 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, is nearly double the national average and the highest in over a decade. This crisis is attributed to factors like congenital malformations, premature birth, and low birthweight, with stark racial disparities showing Black infants dying at twice the rate of White infants. State officials plan to expand prenatal services, regionalize obstetric care, and strengthen community health programs, though federal funding cuts threaten crucial data collection and maternal health initiatives. Experts emphasize that structural inequities, rather than just clinical care, are key drivers of these preventable tragedies.</p>

Cramer criticizes "lazy thinking" regarding the "Magnificent Seven" stocks, emphasizing their individual issues and advocating for a focus on housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs as bullish sectors. He suggests industrials like Nucor and Whirlpool, and certain retailers, while cautioning against healthcare and enterprise software due to AI disruption. Cramer anticipates September will bring both rising prices and increased joblessness, advising investors to watch specific catch-up plays and avoid overthinking market rotations.

          <p>Global oil prices have experienced an increase following reports of Ukrainian drone attacks targeting Russian energy sites. These strikes, impacting critical infrastructure, signal a potential escalation in the ongoing conflict and raise concerns about disruptions to global energy supplies.

          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C., likely fewer than 50, have been authorized to carry their assigned service weapons starting Sunday night, following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This move represents an escalation in President Trump's intervention into the city's policing, despite local data indicating a decline in violent crime over the past year and a half. Previously, Guard troops were unarmed, primarily protecting landmarks and assisting with crowd control. The new guidance permits the use of force only as a last resort against imminent threats, raising significant questions about the changing role of the National Guard and the justification for this enhanced militarization in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>Chinese property behemoth Evergrande has been delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a significant milestone in its spectacular collapse under a mountain of debt. Once China's largest real estate firm with a $50 billion valuation, Evergrande's downfall began with Beijing's 2020 rules on developer borrowing, leading to defaults on its $300 billion in liabilities. The company's liquidation, ordered in January 2024, has had a profound impact on China's economy, contributing to a property slump that has suppressed consumer spending and led to widespread layoffs. Experts believe the crisis is far from over, with property prices expected to fall until 2027.</p>

          <h2>Ecuadorian Cartel Victims Face Asylum Challenges and Fear in the US</h2>

          <p>Victims fleeing escalating cartel violence in Ecuador, like Gabriela whose family suffered kidnapping and murder, face significant hurdles and fear while seeking asylum in the United States. Despite fleeing "terror," many applicants find it increasingly difficult to meet strict US asylum criteria, which often don't neatly categorize cartel violence. Under the Trump administration, policies have made asylum claims from gang violence harder, with concerns that even coerced payments to cartels could be seen as "material support." A massive backlog of cases leaves thousands in limbo, often in detention, highlighting a system where victims of severe persecution struggle for protection and live in constant anxiety.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has been associated with over 70 medically recognized miracles in the past 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts rigorous, decade-long investigations into thousands of reported cures. Their criteria demand a severe disease with a dire prognosis, an instantaneous, complete, and lasting cure, and no possible medical explanation. Despite skepticism about historical rigor, analyses affirm the credibility of their conclusions, with four living individuals, including Vittorio Micheli and Sister Bernadette Moriau, having confirmed their continued healing from previously incurable conditions.</p>

          <p>Recently unsealed evidence from the 9/11 attacks, including a 1999 video of Saudi national Omar al-Bayoumi filming the U.S. Capitol and an airplane descent equation, was never shared with FBI field agents or top intelligence officials. Bayoumi, suspected of being a Saudi intelligence operative, allegedly aided two hijackers, a claim he and Saudi Arabia deny. Former FBI and CIA officials, unaware of this "critical evidence" for years, express anger and surprise, believing it could have been crucial for investigations and counterterrorism efforts. This revelation suggests significant intelligence failures and raises questions about other potentially overlooked evidence and the completeness of the 9/11 Commission's findings.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, accuse President Trump of manufacturing a crisis to justify sending federalized National Guard troops into Chicago. They argue Trump is "playing games with the lives of Americans" and abusing his power, noting that crime statistics in Chicago have significantly dropped. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker asserts no state request for federal intervention has been made, deeming any such deployment an illegal "flagrant violation of our constitution." This political clash highlights deep concerns over federal overreach and the militarization of domestic policing in predominantly Democratic cities.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) director, a move that has raised concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the Trump administration. Congressional intelligence leaders were informed of the firing but given no reason, with a Pentagon spokesman stating senior military leaders serve "at the pleasure of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth." This dismissal follows a DIA assessment of strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities that reportedly contradicted President Trump's public claims of complete obliteration. DIA employees expressed surprise and fear that their work is being compromised by political interference, further destabilizing the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>A new human case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite has been identified in Maryland, traced to a person who traveled from Guatemala, marking the first confirmed human case this year in the US. This development intensifies concerns as the screwworm outbreak escalates northward from Central America and southern Mexico, posing a significant threat to livestock and potentially humans. The USDA, criticized for its slow response, is now planning a sterile fly facility in Texas. The lack of transparency from health officials regarding this case has further rattled the beef and cattle futures market, which faces potential economic losses and supply issues.</p>

          <p>A fiery multi-vehicle crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula, California, resulted in four fatalities when a BMW M4, driven recklessly, veered over the concrete median into oncoming traffic. The BMW collided with a Nissan Sentra and immediately burst into flames, killing three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—and the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra. Good Samaritans rescued the 25-year-old BMW driver, who sustained major injuries and is hospitalized, with charges pending. Alcohol has been ruled out as a factor, and the California Highway Patrol is actively investigating the tragic collision.</p>
