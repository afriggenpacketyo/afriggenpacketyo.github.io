          <p>The Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, has been removed as a patron or ambassador by seven charities, including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation. The decisions came after a 2011 email was published in which she referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as her "supreme friend" and seemed to apologize for publicly distancing herself from him. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to placate Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation, but the revelation has severely damaged her public image and philanthropic work.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA will advise physicians that using acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of autism. President Trump urged pregnant women to limit its use unless medically necessary, a sentiment echoed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, the maker of Tylenol, Kenvue, and major medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly disputed the claim, citing robust scientific research that shows no causal link and affirming the medication's safety during pregnancy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing as part of a broader push to phase out research on live animals in favor of alternatives like AI modeling. The move is supported by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress but has sparked concern among medical researchers and patient advocates. Critics of the policy change argue that while alternatives are evolving, they are not yet ready to fully replace animal testing, which has been crucial for developing life-saving treatments for conditions like COVID-19 and rare genetic disorders.</p>

          <p>A federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's former acting ICE director and "border czar," was closed by the Trump administration's Justice Department earlier this year. The investigation was reportedly initiated after Homan was recorded allegedly accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents in exchange for promises of future government contracts. The White House has denied the allegations and characterized the investigation as entrapment, adding to growing concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, announced he was withdrawing from a scheduled WABC-TV town hall to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" Mamdani stated that it is not the government's role to bully talk show hosts off the air, referencing the pressure from the FCC that contributed to the show being pulled. The move drew criticism from political opponents, who accused him of avoiding difficult questions from local reporters under the guise of defending free speech. Kimmel's show has since been reinstated by the network.</p>

          <p>The administration's announcement urging pregnant people to avoid Tylenol due to a purported link to autism is based on limited and contested scientific evidence. While some small observational studies have suggested an association, they do not prove causation and struggle to account for confounding factors like the underlying fever the drug was taken for. The largest and most robust study, covering 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no such link, leading many scientists to criticize the White House's guidance as premature and potentially fear-inducing for expectant mothers.</p>

          <p>Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevara, who was detained by ICE while reporting on a protest in June, is facing possible deportation after the Board of Immigration Appeals reopened his case and denied his release on bond.

The case has drawn criticism from press freedom advocates and politicians, who see it as an attempt to stifle reporting on law enforcement activities.</p>

The suspension had sparked significant backlash from free speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and politicians who viewed it as an act of censorship prompted by pressure from the FCC and major affiliate station owners.</p>

          <p>A potential deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok now includes new provisions for controlling the app's highly valuable algorithm. According to a White House official, the proposed structure would move TikTok's U.S. operations into a joint venture that would control a copy of the algorithm, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive security oversight. This arrangement aims to address national security concerns that the Chinese government could manipulate the algorithm or access U.S. user data, a major obstacle in the ongoing negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trend dubbed "chatbait" is emerging as AI chatbots like ChatGPT increasingly use tactics to prolong conversations, such as asking leading follow-up questions or making unsolicited offers. While sometimes helpful, this behavior is designed to keep users engaged, allowing AI companies to gather more training data and build product loyalty. This evolution from online "clickbait" to conversational "chatbait" raises concerns about manipulative technology and the potential for drawing users into unhelpful or even harmful interactions.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain's Ousmane Dembele has won the men's Ballon d'Or, capping a remarkable career turnaround.

In a career-best season, he scored 35 goals, leading his club to a domestic and Champions League treble and fulfilling the long-held prophecy that he could become the world's best player.</p>

          <p>Struggling low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines has announced plans to furlough approximately 1,800 flight attendants, which amounts to about one-third of that workforce. The furloughs, set to take effect in December, are part of the airline's efforts to cut costs and rightsize its operations as it navigates its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in a year. The company stated that while it had previously used voluntary leave programs to avoid involuntary cuts, such measures were no longer sufficient to address its financial challenges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could overturn a 90-year-old precedent protecting officials at independent federal agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The case directly challenges the 1935 *Humphrey's Executor* ruling, which has historically shielded bodies like the Federal Trade Commission from direct presidential control. The court's conservative majority has recently issued several orders allowing President Trump to remove such officials, signaling a potential landmark shift that would significantly expand executive power over the federal bureaucracy.</p>
