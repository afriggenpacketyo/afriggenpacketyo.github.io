Brown was released on bail and is currently touring the U.K., with his trial scheduled for October 2026.

          <p>The People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's Communist Party, has cautioned against an "addiction" to blind boxes and blind card packs among young people as the summer holiday approaches. The newspaper called for strict identity verification to curb the "out-of-control consumption" of these items by minors, noting that they induce impulsive spending due to the element of gambling involved in obtaining rare items. The warning echoes regulations enacted years ago to prevent online gaming addiction among teenagers. The article highlights how children and teenagers commonly spend significant amounts chasing rare cards, contributing to irrational consumption. </p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 32C in central England. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. A yellow weather warning for storms has been issued for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales for Saturday.

          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily due to a "dismal" performance by supermarkets, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers seeing reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco. Separate figures revealed that government borrowing reached the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993. While some of the decline is attributed to the fading boost from warm weather in April, retailers also noted that inflation prompted consumers to cut back. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the U.S. is at risk of repeating the catastrophic mistakes of the Iraq War by considering military force against Iran. The author contends that the focus on Iran's nuclear program is a distraction, similar to the WMD claims used to justify the Iraq invasion. The piece suggests that Israel's recent attacks on Iran were aimed at preempting a potential diplomatic agreement between the U.S. and Iran, which would have stabilized the region. The author warns that a U.S. war with Iran would be a conflict of unknowable scope and could destabilize the Middle East. </p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have successfully developed and tested artillery-launched drones, overcoming technical hurdles to create drones capable of withstanding the immense forces within a 155mm cannon shell. Live-fire trials confirmed the drones could endure launch forces exceeding 3,000 times their own weight. The advancement centers on a pyrotechnic ejection mechanism that separates the drone from its shell mid-flight without electronic controls. The team claims these drones can reach distances exceeding 10 kilometers in seconds, extend flight range, and significantly save power consumption. </p>

          <p>A review of Amy Bloom's novel "I'll Be Right Here" praises its exquisite prose and unconventional structure, which spans nearly a century and challenges traditional notions of family. The novel follows a group of interconnected characters, including Algerian orphans in Nazi-occupied France and a teenage friendship that evolves into a chosen family. The story also incorporates the famed writer Colette, whom one of the characters serves. The reviewer commends Bloom's ability to render any person, place, or object sublime, and her exploration of love in new and profound ways. </p>

          <p>A review of the musical "Parade" highlights its transformation of the true story of Leo Frank, a man wrongly accused and lynched in 1913, into a powerful theatrical experience. The musical explores themes of antisemitism, systemic bias in the judicial system, and the manipulation of hatred for political gain. The reviewer praises the production's ability to seamlessly integrate historical context and focus on the human figures caught in the tragedy.

          <p>An independent commission is urging the California Legislature to establish a new local authority to oversee and coordinate rebuilding efforts following the destructive fires in Los Angeles County. The proposed Resilient Rebuilding Authority would streamline complex recovery efforts, prioritize the return of residents and businesses, and use tax-increment financing to buy fire-razed lots. The authority would also aim to prevent land speculation and ensure that new homes are affordable for displaced people.

          <p>Credit card interest rates are rising even with the Federal Reserve holding rates steady, with the average APR now just over 20%, according to Bankrate. For new cards, the average APR is up to 24.3%, according to LendingTree. Card issuers are mitigating their exposure against borrowers who may fall behind on payments or default. Consumers carrying a balance from month to month feel the pain of high APRs. (not investment advice)</p>
