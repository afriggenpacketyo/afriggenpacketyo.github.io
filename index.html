          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago to address crime, a move criticized by state and local leaders as an abuse of power. The decision comes as federal agents in the city were involved in a shooting incident with an armed woman who allegedly rammed law enforcement vehicles. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker accused the administration of manufacturing a crisis to justify the military presence. This action is part of a broader, controversial strategy of deploying troops to Democrat-led cities, raising legal and constitutional questions.</p>

          <p>Thomas Skinner, a former contestant on "The Apprentice," has become the first celebrity to be eliminated from the current season of "Strictly Come Dancing." Skinner and his professional partner, Amy Dowden, faced off against former rugby captain Chris Robshaw and his partner Nadiya Bychkova in the dance-off. The judges voted to save Robshaw, ending Skinner's short time on the popular dance competition. Dowden, who has been public about her return to dancing after a cancer diagnosis, praised Skinner for helping her regain her confidence on the dance floor.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced his intention to sue the Trump administration to prevent the deployment of 300 California National Guard members to Portland, Oregon. Newsom described the president's action as a "breathtaking abuse of the law and power," especially following a federal judge's order that temporarily blocked the federalization of Oregon's own National Guard. The governor stated that the administration is ignoring court orders and attacking the rule of law itself. This legal challenge escalates the conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Missouri's governor has signed a new congressional map into law that is expected to give Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House, a move praised by former President Trump. This mid-decade redistricting effort is part of a broader GOP strategy to solidify its House majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, following a similar push in Texas. In response, Democrats in states like California and Maryland are considering their own redistricting measures to counteract these gains. The developments in Missouri and Texas could set off a series of partisan battles over congressional maps in other states, including Ohio, Indiana, and Florida.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the immediate release of hostages from Gaza is the most urgent phase of the peace plan proposed by President Trump. Negotiators are set to meet in Cairo to discuss the logistics of the exchange, which involves Hamas releasing all remaining Israeli hostages for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. Rubio emphasized that the fighting must cease to facilitate the release, which he expects to happen quickly once an agreement is reached. The broader plan aims to establish a Gaza free from Hamas control, a long-term goal that will require significant international support and time to implement.</p>

          <p>At their annual conference, UK Conservatives are invoking the legacy of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, celebrating the 100th anniversary of her birth as the party seeks to regain political momentum. Current leader Kemi Badenoch is reportedly studying Thatcher's early years for inspiration as she confronts poor polling numbers and aims to restore the party's reputation for economic competence. Speakers at the conference suggested that, just as Thatcher targeted unions, today's Tories should focus on reining in government bodies that constrain enterprise. The party is positioning itself as the sole defender of fiscal responsibility against the spending plans of Labour and Reform UK.</p>

          <p>During a U.S. government shutdown, all federal employees are expected to eventually receive back pay, but payment timelines vary significantly. The president and members of Congress continue to be paid on time as their salaries are constitutionally mandated. Employees of agencies funded through non-congressional sources, like the postal service, also receive timely paychecks. However, employees designated as "essential," such as military personnel and air traffic controllers, must work without pay until funding is restored. "Non-essential" federal workers are furloughed, meaning they do not work and are not paid during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, ruled that the president's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts" and that the protests were not disruptive enough to warrant military intervention. The judge warned that the action risked blurring the line between civilian and military authority, infringing on Oregon's sovereignty. The administration has indicated it will appeal the decision, which local and state officials have praised as a victory for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated his belief that hostages held in Gaza will be released "very soon" as mediators prepare for talks in Egypt. This follows Hamas's agreement to parts of a U.S.-led peace plan, including the release of hostages and transferring governance to Palestinian technocrats, though other key issues remain for negotiation. Despite Trump's call for an immediate halt to bombing, Israeli airstrikes have continued in Gaza, with an Israeli spokesperson clarifying that defensive operations will persist.

          <p>Two years after the October 7th attack, Israel has only partially achieved its stated war aims of destroying Hamas and recovering all hostages, with the conflict causing immense devastation in Gaza. While Israel has weakened its regional adversaries like Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, its military conduct has led to widespread international condemnation, genocide accusations at the ICJ, and ICC arrest warrants for its leaders. The war has also spurred increased international recognition of Palestinian statehood and fragmented Israeli society over the conflict's direction. A new U.S.-backed peace plan offers a potential path to a ceasefire, but the deep-seated damage will take decades to heal.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch defended her leadership strategy, stating she will take time to develop sound policies rather than rushing out announcements like her political rivals. Speaking at the party's conference, she acknowledged this patient approach might come at a short-term cost in opinion polls but insisted it would ultimately succeed. Badenoch also detailed a plan to remove 750,000 illegal migrants, which includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to expedite deportations. She asserted that any prospective Conservative MP must support the manifesto commitment to leave the ECHR.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, the stock market has shown resilience, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high last week. Investors appear to be operating under the assumption that the shutdown will be short-lived and will not significantly impact the broader economy or corporate profits. Wall Street's focus remains on key sectors like artificial intelligence, with companies such as Nvidia continuing to perform strongly, and upcoming corporate earnings reports are expected to provide further economic insights in the absence of official government data.

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has indicated that mass layoffs of federal employees will commence if President Trump concludes that shutdown negotiations with Democrats are failing. Hassett stated that the administration is preparing for this possibility but remains hopeful that a resolution can be reached when Congress reconvenes. The government shutdown is now in its fifth day, primarily due to a standoff over Democrats' insistence on extending enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. The administration's threat of permanent layoffs adds a significant new pressure point to the ongoing political stalemate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study using two decades of NASA satellite data reveals that Earth's Northern Hemisphere is absorbing more solar energy than the Southern Hemisphere, causing it to grow darker. This growing energy imbalance is attributed to the loss of reflective surfaces like sea ice and snow cover, as well as a decline in sunlight-scattering aerosols due to cleaner air policies. Scientists warn that this asymmetry could disrupt global wind and ocean currents, which are crucial for redistributing heat around the planet. The trend may intensify warming on northern continents and requires a re-evaluation of climate models that assume hemispheric balance.</p>

          <p>Police in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, used water cannons and pepper spray to disperse anti-government protesters who attempted to storm the presidential palace. The clashes resulted in five arrests and numerous injuries, occurring on the same day as local elections largely boycotted by the opposition. The country has been in a political crisis since the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has since paused EU accession talks, claimed victory in last year's disputed election. Protesters, who accuse the government of aligning with Russian interests, are demanding the release of political prisoners and new parliamentary elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common cause of arguments between couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research shows that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, with a sharp or sarcastic delivery often being interpreted as blame or contempt. Travers advises partners to become self-aware, catch harsh tones in real-time, and use simple "repair moves" like apologizing and rephrasing. He suggests that interrupting a negative cycle by calmly pointing out the tone can prevent arguments from escalating.</p>

Chinese state media reports that over 350 hikers have been rescued from blizzard conditions, with contact established with more than 200 others who remain at a high-altitude camp. The heavy snowfall, which began Friday, caused tents to collapse and blocked access roads, with some hikers suffering from hypothermia. The incident highlights the extreme weather and inherent dangers of the region, which is currently experiencing severe conditions as neighboring Nepal faces deadly landslides from heavy rains.</p>

          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, with fees escalating rapidly as more investment flows into the top leagues in England and the USA. While this growth signifies a healthier financial ecosystem for the sport, experts warn it is widening the competitive and financial gap between the wealthiest leagues and others, like Germany's Bundesliga. The Bundesliga's revenue from broadcasting and sponsorships is significantly lower, making it difficult to compete for top talent. The trend highlights a growing disparity where only a few elite clubs can afford the sport's biggest stars.</p>

          <p>In a bold move, the Democratic party has embraced the politically risky government shutdown as a means to curb what they see as President Trump's overreach and attacks on the constitution. This article suggests the shutdown is not merely a policy dispute but a strategic battle over the separation of powers, with Democrats leveraging their limited power to force concessions on healthcare and fiscal authority. Progressive groups are supporting the strategy, viewing it as a necessary fight to protect democratic institutions.

          <p>Democrats are employing the high-stakes political strategy of a government shutdown in a significant effort to challenge President Trump's actions, which many view as a threat to democratic norms. The party is unified in its demand to include healthcare priorities, such as extending ACA tax credits, in any funding deal, viewing this as their main point of leverage. While Republicans accuse them of sabotage, progressive activists are praising Democratic leaders for taking a firm stand. Early polling suggests the public is more inclined to blame Republicans for the shutdown, but the outcome remains uncertain as the closures continue.</p>

          <p>Research indicates that the widespread, gender-neutral HPV vaccination program in the United States has been so effective that herd immunity against the primary cause of cervical cancer is now a possibility. A long-term study found that vaccination has drastically reduced infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women, who saw a 75% decline in infections. Experts attribute this success to high vaccination rates for both boys and girls. However, they caution that maintaining this community protection is dynamic and depends on sustaining high vaccine uptake to prevent a resurgence of the virus.</p>

          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party has become a record-level spender on social media political ads in the European Union, far outpacing parties in much larger countries. This strategy is now challenged by new political ad bans from platforms like Facebook and Google, forcing Prime Minister Viktor Orban's party to pivot. In response, Fidesz has launched an initiative to recruit online activists, or "digital freedom fighters," to spread its message organically.
