          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent US-China trade talks in Geneva hold both economic and political significance for both countries, potentially initiating a prolonged process toward resolving tariff and trade barrier issues. The apparent progress provides interim political relief for both powers without signaling weakness in the trade war. While the US is under pressure to demonstrate wins, China views negotiations as a strategic process to manage competition, economic resilience, and long-term development goals. China aims to insulate its domestic economy from external shocks while selectively engaging with global markets through resilience-building measures.</p>

          <p>Germany and Israel are commemorating 60 years of diplomatic relations, a milestone overshadowed by the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is visiting Berlin to mark the anniversary with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, acknowledging the historical weight of Nazi Germany's genocide against European Jews. The leaders plan to visit the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial, and Herzog will meet with German and Israeli youth to address rising antisemitism. Despite criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians maintain Israel's right to defend itself following the 2023 Hamas attacks, though they also emphasize the need for Israel to adhere to international law.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the history and regulations surrounding gifts given to US presidents by foreign powers, prompted by reports of a luxury plane potentially being gifted to Donald Trump's administration. Gifts valued over $480 are considered property of the United States and are managed by the White House Gift Unit, often ending up in national archives or presidential libraries. Presidents can retain gifts if they pay fair market value, and foreign leaders often use gifts to strengthen relationships. Ethical concerns arise when gifts could be perceived as bribes or attempts to influence policy, highlighting the balance between diplomatic gestures and potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Following trade talks in Geneva, US and Chinese officials provided differing accounts of the progress made, leaving financial markets and businesses uncertain about the outcome. While the US Trade Representative described the talks as resulting in a "deal," the Chinese Vice Premier for economic policy expressed optimism but stopped short of declaring a done deal. This difference in framing highlights the sensitivities surrounding trade relations between the two largest economies. The negotiations represent a significant attempt to ease tensions after the imposition of heavy tariffs by both countries, which have disrupted trade and negatively impacted the global economy.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing international court charges of crimes against humanity, remains popular at home as the Philippines holds midterm elections. Despite his detention, Duterte is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City. His arrest has divided the Philippines, with some supporting the international investigation and others viewing him as a victim of political persecution. The elections could be pivotal for his daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces an impeachment trial.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at cracking down on federal payments for abortion providers faces opposition from moderate House Republicans. The measure, intended to redirect funds from "big abortion" to federally qualified health centers, could jeopardize the bill's passage due to the GOP's narrow majority. Concerns have been raised that the language is too broad and could face legal challenges, as the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal dollars from going towards abortion services.</p>
