          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed its plan to divide into two distinct publicly traded entities by the middle of 2026, marking a significant shift in the media landscape as consumers increasingly transition from traditional cable to streaming services. The separation will create a streaming and studios company, housing movie properties and HBO Max, alongside a global networks company that includes CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will take the helm of the global networks business, with the aim of optimizing each company's focus and strategic flexibility in the evolving media environment. The move follows similar restructuring efforts by other media giants like Comcast and signals potential consolidation within the industry.</p>

          <p>Following reports suggesting that heavy metal pollution in northern Thai rivers is linked to Chinese mining activities in Myanmar, China's embassy in Thailand stated that it is closely monitoring the situation. The embassy acknowledged comments from the Thai government and emphasized that China requires its companies operating overseas to comply with local laws and regulations. The embassy suggested that Thailand and Myanmar collaborate on scientific investigations into the issue and expressed China's willingness to work with Mekong basin countries to protect the region's ecology and water quality. Thailand's Pollution Control Department had previously reported unsafe levels of heavy metals in sediment samples from rivers in northern Thailand, attributing the contamination to upstream mining operations.</p>

          <p>A new round of trade negotiations between the United States and China is scheduled to occur in London, aimed at resolving the ongoing trade war between the two nations. The US delegation, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, will meet with Chinese representatives like Vice Premier He Lifeng to address tensions that are threatening global economic growth. The talks follow a recent phone call between President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, and will address issues such as Chinese exports of rare earth metals and US access to Chinese products like computer chips. While previous talks in Geneva reduced tariffs, numerous other issues remain unresolved, with both countries accusing each other of breaching previous agreements.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in Los Angeles in response to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, leading President Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard soldiers, a move criticized by California Gov. Gavin Newsom as "inflaming tensions." Federal and local law enforcement used flash bangs, tear gas, and rubber bullets to disperse crowds, while protesters reportedly threw cinderblocks and set cars on fire, resulting in numerous arrests. The protests began peacefully but escalated, with demonstrators expressing solidarity with immigrants and denouncing the raids; Newsom has urged protesters to remain peaceful and not provoke further conflict. ICE reported arresting 118 immigrants during operations in LA last week, intensifying the already fraught situation.</p>

The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the effort, claimed the activists were "kidnapped" and accused Israel of confiscating the ship's cargo, which included baby formula, food, and medical supplies. Israel's Foreign Ministry posted photos and videos of the activists on a smaller vessel, offered food and water, and stated that the passengers would be returned to their home countries, while any aid would be sent to Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA is reportedly planning to eliminate restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from US power plants, claiming they are globally insignificant. However, an analysis indicates that emissions from American fossil-fuel plants contribute 5% of all planet-heating pollution since 1990, making the US power sector the sixth-largest emitter globally. Removing these protections is projected to cause 5,300 deaths in the US from air pollution in 2022 and result in $370 billion in global damages. Experts argue that the administration's move contradicts the Clean Air Act and undermines efforts to address the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>An article explores the irony of Donald Trump's appreciation for Victor Hugo's 'Les MisÃ©rables,' given the musical's themes of compassion for the poor and oppressed, contrasting it with the Trump administration's policies. The author, a Hugo biographer, finds the musical's mass-market appeal to Trump unsurprising, considering his fondness for bombastic 1980s musicals. The author suggests Hugo himself, a champion of freedom and democracy, would likely have been repelled by Trump's demagoguery. The article also notes the appropriation of 'Les MisÃ©rables' by the MAGA movement, highlighting the volatile nature of political buzzwords and the use of left-wing moral discourse by right-wing ideologues.</p>

          <p>Netflix has released 'The Eternaut,' a series based on a popular Argentine comic, which begins with a group of friends on a sailboat witnessing a strange green glow before a toxic snowfall begins to decimate Buenos Aires. The story follows Juan, one of the card players, as he ventures out into the ghostly city in makeshift protective gear to find his daughter amidst the chaos. The series, filmed in Spanish and set in Buenos Aires, brings the original 1957 comic to a modern age, retaining its politically charged themes and emphasizing the need for collective action.

          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. The proposal would expand the ban from 18,000 km2 to 48,000 km2 of the UK's offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, is addressing the issue amid warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life.

Cooper's ally stated she followed the Treasury's timetable for negotiations, while some suggest she would have received a better deal settling earlier. The impasse raises the possibility of the Treasury imposing a settlement on the Home Office; police chiefs have been publicly lobbying for more money. The Home Office argues that police numbers must be maintained to deliver policy commitments on neighbourhood policing, which may not be possible under current spending proposals.</p>

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements experienced a significant decline in value last month, dropping by nearly half compared to the previous year. This decrease is seen as a reflection of Beijing's capacity to quickly leverage its control over the critical-mineral supply chain, particularly in trade negotiations with the United States. In May, China exported rare earth elements worth US$18.7 million, marking a yearly decrease of 48.3 percent; the cumulative amount of exported rare earths in the first five months stood at 24,827 tonnes, 2.3 percent higher than the same period last year.</p>

          <p>The Sean "Diddy" Combs trial has brought to light the concept of coercive control, a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse, though it's not a widely recognized legal term in the US. While the judge blocked testimony specifically about coercive control, the prosecution is focusing on coercion as an individual act, a key element in the charges against Combs, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The trial has revealed an environment of fear, paranoia, and unpredictable outbursts, raising questions about how long-term abuse impacts survivors and their choices. The legal status of coercive control remains murky, with debates about whether codifying it is helpful or harmful.</p>

          <p>A recent jobs report indicates that the US labor market is proving difficult for recent college graduates, with a higher unemployment rate compared to the rest of the economy. The unemployment rate for recent college-educated job seekers aged 22 to 27 reached 5.8% in March, with an increase at about triple the pace of the national average. Factors contributing to this trend include a "no hire, no fire" labor market, where employers are holding onto current workers, and the rise of artificial intelligence, which is impacting entry-level tech jobs.

Imports from the Bahamas, a rarely used trade route for West Coast refiners, hit a record high, indicating the extent of the supply challenges; this trend underscores California's growing reliance on imports due to shrinking refining capacity and increasing regulatory and cost pressures.</p>
