          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris after staff became suspicious that the 'bride' was a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man had reportedly hired the park for a private event, bringing in hundreds of extras to act as guests, with the girl's mother claiming she wanted her daughter to feel like a Disney princess for a day. Authorities confirmed the event was staged and a medical examination showed the girl was unharmed, with four people, including the 'groom' and the girl's mother, taken into custody as police investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident. The staged wedding involved a large sum of money being exchanged for the event, raising questions about the motivations behind the elaborate production.</p>

          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II ground battle between Japan and the United States, which resulted in over 200,000 casualties, including military personnel and residents. A memorial service was held at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki, where 342 names were added to the list of war dead. The Battle of Okinawa heavily impacted the local population, and anti-base sentiment remains strong due to the ongoing presence of U.S. forces and recent alleged sexual assault cases. Japan has been increasing its defense capabilities in the region amid rising tensions with China, causing concern among Okinawans about becoming a front line in future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing heightened uncertainty as the U.S. enters the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions and triple-digit prices. Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, investors are closely monitoring Iran's response, with threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz adding to market jitters. Experts warn of unprecedented supply disruptions, potentially surpassing the oil price shock seen during the Ukraine war, and Western forces may intervene if Iran closes the Strait. The potential closure or harassment of passage through the Strait could lead to oil prices approaching $100 per barrel (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senior officials from the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) held conference calls with governors and law enforcement agencies to discuss the impact of U.S. missile strikes in Iran on the threat environment. The FBI is enhancing its posture and increasing personnel in response to the U.S. military action, although there is no specific intelligence indicating a direct, credible threat against the U.S. homeland. Governors were urged to be vigilant for an increase in cyber activity and to reach out to at-risk infrastructure partners, including Jewish institutions, with concerns raised that Jewish institutions and leaders within the U.S. "should be considered at an elevated risk" for retaliatory violence. DHS officials stated the U.S. strike against Iran "raises the threat environment here in the United States."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department initially posted a message on social media expressing condolences for the "tragic" U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, which was later amended and then deleted. The original post stated the department was closely monitoring the situation with local, state, and federal partners, but the department removed the sentence regarding the U.S. strikes. The department spokesperson stated they were unaware of the initial post, and it remains unclear if anyone was harmed or killed during the operation. Over the weekend, the U.S. military carried out strikes targeting nuclear sites in Iran in Operation Midnight Hammer.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, facing human smuggling charges, can be released on bail, determining the government failed to prove he was a flight risk. However, the ruling may be largely academic, as Abrego Garcia is likely to be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody instead, pending further removal proceedings. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who had been living in Maryland, was previously deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. Prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status across the U.S. between 2016-2025.</p>

          <p>Pentagon officials revealed details about the U.S. operation to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran, describing it as the "largest B-2 operational strike in U.S. history," inflicting "extremely severe damage and destruction" to the targets. Dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, the mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, with others acting as decoys, with U.S. submarine launching Tomahawk cruise missiles against a site in Isfahan. The lead B-2 dropped two "bunker-buster" bombs on the site at Fordo, with a total of 14 dropped on Fordo and Natanz, and Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface-to-air missile systems did not detect the U.S. aircraft. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the attack "an incredible and overwhelming success."</p>

Chinese companies are paying a high price for their investments, facing attacks on mining sites, kidnappings of workers for ransom, and hijackings of Chinese-owned vessels.

Temples, shrines, and historic sites were popular among foreign visitors, while Japanese visitors were more likely to express disappointment due to crowds and public transportation issues.

A parishioner struck the man with their vehicle, and at least two staff members shot at him, killing the attacker, with one staff member, a security guard, shot in the leg by the gunman.

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan faces the potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century, against the backdrop of increasing Sino-U.S. rivalry. Decisions regarding panda loans are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks, and a new loan to Japan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader later this year. The panda has long been a symbol of friendship between the two countries, but some analysts believe that a new panda loan will not have a tangible impact on the Japanese government's diplomatic posture toward China.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that parents who have an easy time getting their children to listen avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that makes children want to cooperate, as traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. The expert recommends reframing common phrases to honor a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, creating conditions where cooperation feels natural and fostering emotional safety and involvement.</p>

          <p>Concerns are growing that surveillance culture is fueling child cyberstalking, with children as young as 10 and 11 being reported to police for suspected offences. Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips emphasizes the need to educate young people about healthy relationships in the digital age, as constant online monitoring is becoming normalized. Cyberstalking is defined as using digital tools to harass, send threats, or spread false information, and can have psychologically damaging effects, with experts believing the "normalisation of digital surveillance" is fueling concerning behaviours.</p>

          <p>The United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, with President Trump calling it a "spectacular military success," with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stopping the nuclear threat. American B-2 Spirit bombers were used to strike Fordo, armed with U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bombs, and about two dozen submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles targeted the Isfahan site. Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained severe damage, with Iran pledging to retaliate, while the U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically to state that regime change is not planned.</p>
