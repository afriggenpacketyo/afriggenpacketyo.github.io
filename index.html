        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bryan Kohberger has agreed to a plea deal in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, accepting a guilty plea on all counts to avoid the death penalty. In exchange, he will receive four consecutive life sentences for the murders plus ten years for burglary, and he will waive all rights to appeal. The agreement was reached after Kohberger's defense team approached prosecutors, who then consulted with the victims' families before making a formal offer. This resolution ensures a conviction and spares the families from a lengthy trial and decades of potential appeals.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that Bryan Kohberger will plead guilty in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students to avoid capital punishment. While officials have not formally confirmed the deal, the family of victim Kaylee Goncalves expressed their outrage on social media, stating they are "beyond furious at the State of Idaho." This development comes as a Pennsylvania judge ruled that three acquaintances of Kohberger must testify for the defense. The plea agreement reportedly sets a hearing for Wednesday, circumventing a trial that was scheduled for August.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded after being shot while responding to a wildfire in Kootenai County, Idaho. Authorities believe the suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, intentionally set the fire to lure first responders into an ambush. Following an exchange of gunfire, a tactical team located Roley's body in a wooded area, with evidence suggesting a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The motive remains under investigation, but Sheriff Robert Norris described the incident as a heinous and intentional attack where the firefighters "did not have a chance."</p>

          <p>Despite receiving over 1.2 million fan votes and being named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was ranked only ninth among guards by her fellow players. The voting process combines fan, media, and player ranks, with fan votes accounting for 50%. While Clark led fan voting, players ranked several others higher, including top-ranked Allisha Gray of the Atlanta Dream. This disparity may reflect Clark's limited playing time this season due to injury, as she has appeared in only nine of her team's 16 games.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a "vote-a-rama," a marathon session of amendment votes, on President Trump's signature domestic policy package, known as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The bill includes increased spending for border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs, and is projected to add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over ten years.

          <p>A coffee boom in China is spreading beyond urban centers into rural areas, creating a new trend of countryside cafes. These establishments often attract social media-savvy consumers with unique natural settings, but some patrons question the long-term viability of this influencer-driven model. China's coffee industry is now valued at approximately US$42 billion, with consumption expected to continue its double-digit growth. This cultural shift is reflected in customs data, which shows a 65.7% average annual growth rate in net coffee imports between 2020 and 2024, signaling a significant change in the nation's traditional tea-drinking habits.</p>

In a series of posts on X, Musk called on members who campaigned on fiscal responsibility to "hang their head in shame" for supporting what he calls the "biggest debt increase in history." The billionaire also floated the idea of forming a new "America Party" if the bill passes.

The Kootenai County Sheriff stated the attack occurred after firefighters asked the homeless suspect to move his vehicle, in which he was living.

Forward Dorian Finney-Smith departed the team, agreeing to a four-year, $53-million contract with the Houston Rockets after opting out of his deal with the Lakers. In response, the Lakers secured forward Jake LaRavia with a two-year, $12-million agreement. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, played for Memphis and Sacramento last season, demonstrating strong three-point shooting ability, which the Lakers hope will fill the void left by Finney-Smith.</p>

The current statutory paternity leave, for instance, pays less than half the National Living Wage, and take-up of shared parental leave is very low.

Conversely, some workers, like firefighters, are excited about a provision to make overtime pay tax-free.

The Justice Department claims Apple has created a "walled garden" that stifles competition and harms consumers.

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is shaping the market by favoring companies with bold, exciting ideas over those focused on traditional strategies like stock buybacks. He argues that companies like Apple are being "punished" for a perceived lack of innovation, while newer firms like Robinhood and Reddit are rewarded for their novel approaches. He suggests the market is currently dominated by "stories" and "ideas" rather than being solely driven by Federal Reserve policy. He believes these younger buyers are focused on the potential for immense future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from UK child health experts suggests that practical and logistical obstacles, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are major reasons for falling childhood vaccination rates. Families face challenges such as difficulty booking GP appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of reminders about when jabs are due. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) highlighted that no childhood vaccine in the UK has met the 95% WHO target since 2022, leading to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. The report calls for better access and information for parents.</p>

          <p>This article provides a deep analysis of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s role as U.S. health secretary, where he has focused on tackling chronic disease while also promoting controversial health theories. While some experts praise his ambition in addressing neglected areas like the impact of processed foods, others are alarmed by his history of questioning vaccine safety and his cuts to the CDC. Kennedy's agenda includes phasing out artificial food dyes and re-evaluating national dietary guidelines. However, his approach has created a deep rift, with critics accusing him of undermining science even as he champions a "Make America Healthy Again" movement.</p>

          <p>Millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills fall by about 7% starting Tuesday, according to the latest price cap from regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of around Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts caution that prices, while lower, remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels and may not decrease much more. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts only a small additional drop in October, warning of "significant uncertainty" in future prices, partly due to potential volatility in the Middle East affecting wholesale costs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade war with China is set to impact July 4th celebrations, as tariffs on Chinese goods are affecting the supply and cost of fireworks. With over 95% of fireworks sold in the U.S. imported from China, a 30% tariff has created supply chain disruptions and is leading to higher prices for consumers. According to the American Pyrotechnics Association, the timing was particularly bad, as many importers halted shipments when even higher tariffs were threatened. Major vendors like Phantom Fireworks confirm that consumers will likely see fewer choices and price increases on some products this year.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Moral Equivalence Between the U.S. and Authoritarian Regimes Serves a Nihilistic Purpose</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent comments in which he appeared to draw a moral equivalence between the actions of the United States and those of China. The author argues this is a recurring theme for Trump, who previously equated the U.S. with Putin's Russia, and that it stems from a lazy nihilism rather than a considered moral position. This rhetorical strategy allows Trump to avoid the responsibilities that come with viewing America as an exceptional leader of the free world. It paints a dark picture of the world where all actors are equally corrupt, a narrative that is poisonous to democracy.</p>

          <h2>Turkish Cartoonist Detained for Caricature Allegedly Depicting Prophet Muhammad</h2>

          <p>A cartoonist for the Turkish satirical magazine Leman was detained by police on Monday over a cartoon that sparked controversy for allegedly depicting the Prophet Muhammad. The chief public prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the cartoon for "openly disparaging religious values," and arrest warrants have also been issued for the magazine's editors. Government ministers condemned the drawing, but the magazine issued a statement saying the cartoon was misunderstood and did not depict the Prophet. It was intended to highlight the suffering of a Muslim man killed in an attack, not to mock religious values.</p>
