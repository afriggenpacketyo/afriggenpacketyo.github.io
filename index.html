            <p>For the first time since its discovery a century ago, scientists have filmed a colossal squid in its natural environment. The 30cm-long juvenile was recorded at a depth of 600m near the South Sandwich Islands during an expedition led by a University of Essex academic. Researchers also captured footage of a glacial glass squid, marking the first sighting of two different squid species on back-to-back expeditions. This highlights how little is known about the ocean's inhabitants and the mysteries that remain to be solved in marine biology.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely anticipated to cut interest rates for the third time this year due to growing global tariff tensions and economic uncertainty in the euro zone. Markets are pricing in a high probability of a quarter-point interest rate cut, which would bring the ECB's deposit facility rate to 2.25%. While the ECB previously signaled a potential pause in monetary easing, recent trade policies have prompted renewed concerns about euro area growth, forcing the central bank to consider further rate cuts to stimulate the economy.</p>

            <p>Nvidia is facing headwinds due to increasing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with new export license requirements for its H20 artificial intelligence chips. This has led to a $5.5 billion charge in Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first quarter, impacting investor confidence and leading to lowered sales estimates. Analysts suggest that export controls, rather than tariffs, pose the main risk for Nvidia, as demand remains price-insensitive but limited by restrictions. The situation is further complicated by the emergence of Chinese AI startups and broader economic concerns related to semiconductor demand. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Consumer spending in the U.S. was stronger than expected in March, with retail sales increasing by 1.4%, surpassing estimates and February's increase.

The organization is particularly concerned about the decoupling of the US and China, with trade between the two countries expected to plunge dramatically.

            <p>The Associated Press (AP) reported that its reporters were blocked from attending an Oval Office event, despite a federal judge ordering the White House to restore the news outlet's access. The White House is also changing the makeup of the press pool, removing a spot designated for news wire services like the AP. The White House Correspondents' Association criticized the changes, stating they appear to be retaliatory for coverage the White House dislikes. The AP had previously sued the White House after being denied access due to its refusal to change its Stylebook to use the name "Gulf of America."</p>

            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has cautioned that student loan borrowers who are late on their payments will experience significant drops in their credit scores. The end of the pandemic-era forbearance on federal student loans has led to an increase in delinquencies, contributing to a decline in the national average credit score. Lower credit scores could result in reduced credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans, and overall lower credit access for millions of borrowers. The situation is exacerbated by rising credit card balances and an uptick in missed payments.</p>

Unlike arguments about fair use or intellectual property, the moral injury framework challenges the narrative that AI innovation is essential to progress.
