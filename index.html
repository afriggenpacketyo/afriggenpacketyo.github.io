          <p>President Trump's intensified attacks on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, criticizing his handling of interest rates, triggered a plunge in US stocks and the dollar. Trump called Powell a "major loser" for not preemptively cutting rates to boost the economy, exacerbating market turmoil already fueled by tariff concerns. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experienced significant drops, while the dollar index fell to its lowest level since 2022. Gold prices surged as investors sought safe-haven assets amid the economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Uber disputes these allegations, stating that cancellations can now be done easily in-app and that they do not sign up or charge consumers without consent.

This decision concludes a year-long trade case brought by American manufacturers accusing their overseas competitors of unfair pricing and subsidies.

This shift reflects growing voter worries about rising prices, energy costs, and the war in Ukraine's impact on natural resources.
