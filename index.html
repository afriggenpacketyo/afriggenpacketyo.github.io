Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed confidence in a victory, which would be the party's first by-election win, bringing their number of MPs to five. Reform is also hoping to gain ground in the Greater Lincolnshire mayoral contest and council elections, while support for the party has been rising nationally.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has closed a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, leading to price increases for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. These Chinese giants previously used the "de minimis" exemption to avoid duties and import taxes on items under $800. The move aims to protect American businesses and prevent the smuggling of illegal goods, particularly synthetic opioids. Packages from mainland China and Hong Kong now face a 120% tax or a flat fee, impacting consumers who have benefited from ultra-low prices.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially eliminated the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed American shoppers to buy goods from China tariff-free, impacting manufacturers and online shoppers alike. This rule, which permitted products up to $800 to bypass tariffs, had fueled a surge of packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The decision, partly motivated by concerns over fentanyl smuggling, will increase prices for American consumers and affect small businesses that relied on the exemption. The new regulations impose tariffs of at least 145 percent on Chinese goods shipped via private carriers.</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff-free threshold for imported goods valued up to $800 has disrupted the e-commerce landscape between the United States and China.

With the new tariffs, American shoppers are facing higher prices, and Chinese exporters are seeking new markets. Factories in southern China have already suspended operations, raising concerns about job losses, as trade tensions intensify.</p>

The rule required major sources of these pollutants to reduce emissions by the maximum achievable amount. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups criticized the move.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry announced it is evaluating an offer from the United States to initiate tariff negotiations. The ministry stressed the need for the US to demonstrate sincerity by correcting wrong practices and canceling unilateral tariffs. The US has imposed high tariffs reaching up to 145% on many Chinese products, prompting retaliatory levies of 125% from Beijing. China insists that dialogue cannot be a cover for coercion and blackmail.</p>
