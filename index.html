          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party is anticipated to experience a decline in seats during Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, a contest viewed as a key indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race, especially as Ishiba navigates a minority government on the national stage. The election outcome could mirror past instances where Tokyo assembly results influenced national political dynamics, potentially impacting Ishiba's leadership. Tomin First no Kai, led by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, is expected to perform well among independent voters, highlighting the appeal of policies focused on quality of life and local concerns. The election encompasses issues like inflation support, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies, reflecting national-level debates.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the UK Prime Minister has cautioned about the potential for escalating tensions in the Middle East and beyond, emphasizing the need for de-escalation and a return to diplomatic negotiations.

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds stressed the UK's stance that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons, citing recent intelligence reports of Iranian-backed plots within the UK. While advocating for peaceful resolution, Reynolds acknowledged Iran's failure to heed diplomatic calls, underscoring the UK's commitment to regional stability and security.</p>

          <p>Reem Raouda, a parenting expert, suggests replacing common phrases that trigger defiance in children with more empathetic and autonomy-respecting language to foster cooperation. Instead of using phrases like "Because I said so," parents should explain their reasoning; instead of threats, offer choices that empower children to meet expectations. Raouda emphasizes that dismissing a child's emotions or assuming intentional difficulty can lead to disconnection, and promotes problem-solving and empathy to build trust and emotional resilience. By creating a safe and respectful environment, parents can encourage children to cooperate naturally, reducing power struggles and promoting healthy emotional development.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, as searches are underway for individuals trapped under collapsed buildings in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that approximately 30 missiles were launched, impacting multiple sites across Israel, and noted that alert sirens did not activate in Haifa despite a missile impact. In response, Israel's military struck dozens of missile and drone sites within Iran, targeting strategic missile command centers and eliminating Iranian soldiers loading missile launchers. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion," Iran has reportedly fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel, resulting in casualties and widespread damage.</p>

The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers flying from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings, and utilizing deception tactics, fighter jets, and Tomahawk cruise missiles. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, warned Iran against retaliatory action, emphasizing that U.S. forces remain on high alert and are prepared to respond to any Iranian attacks.

Spaun acknowledged that the sleepless night may have contributed to his initial struggles, but ultimately, his dedication to his family and his perseverance on the course led to his triumph.

          <p>The US has experienced a series of politically motivated violent incidents, sparking concerns about a new normal in American politics, including attacks on Democratic legislators, violence during protests, and threats against lawmakers. Political scientist Robert Pape describes this as an "era of violent populism," noting increased support for the use of force to achieve political means among both left- and right-leaning Americans. While violence has been committed by individuals from both sides, some experts argue that Republican political leaders bear more responsibility for the current climate due to the normalization of violent rhetoric. Experts suggest that American political leaders must condemn political violence in a bipartisan manner to de-escalate tensions and promote unity.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Florida are facing accusations of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts in the Tampa Bay area, allegedly disenfranchising Black voters to skew election results, with the ACLU arguing that the redistricting process was unconstitutional. The ACLU contends that the state's defense, citing the waters of Tampa Bay as making the new district contiguous, is illogical, pointing out the lack of direct connection between the cities. If the judges rule in favor of the plaintiffs, it would require a redrawing of Florida's 16th and 18th senate districts, potentially impacting minority representation and voting power. The case draws parallels to previous moves by Republican officials in Florida to manipulate voting districts to their advantage by undercutting Black voting power.</p>

          <p>The shooting of an Indiana kidney doctor has sparked discussions about the rise of vigilante violence and the shortcomings of the American healthcare system, particularly the impact of for-profit dialysis clinics on patient care. The prosecutor in the case expressed concern about the growing wave of disturbing vigilante violence, while the author of "How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine" notes the complex emotions surrounding the incident. The article suggests that addressing systemic harm within the medical and insurance professions is crucial to preventing such acts of violence, while emphasizing that violence is never a justifiable response to perceived injustices.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the United States is "not at war with Iran," but rather with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on three of the country's nuclear sites. Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace but insists on preventing Iran from possessing a nuclear weapons program, which he believes President Trump accomplished with the recent strikes. When questioned about potential retaliation from Iran, Vance reiterated the U.S.'s desire for peace and emphasized that the goal is to ensure Iran does not develop nuclear weapons, prompting a response from the Iranian Foreign Minister who stated that Iran reserves all options to defend itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, describing it as a "spectacular military success" aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and stopping the threat posed by the country.

Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, prompting warnings from President Trump against any retaliation, stating that it would be met with force far greater than what was witnessed. The U.S. has alerted Israel ahead of the strikes, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the president for conducting the strikes.</p>
