          <p>American liquor exports hit a record $2.4 billion in 2024, largely driven by concerns over potential tariffs and ongoing global trade disputes. Exports to the EU surged by 39% due to worries about the possible return of a 50% tariff on American whiskey imports in 2025. Although the threat of tariffs has somewhat faded amid ongoing US-EU trade negotiations, uncertainty persists, impacting sales growth for many US distillers. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) reported these findings, highlighting the complex interplay between trade policy and market dynamics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to cut federal funding from sanctuary cities, deeming the policy likely unlawful. Judge William Orrick, who previously issued a similar order in 2017, stated that the president's executive order is likely arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to the Constitution. The challenge was brought by 16 cities and counties, including San Francisco, which argued the policy would cause irreparable harm by creating budgetary uncertainty and undermining trust between local governments and their communities.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores the complex relationship between higher education and happiness, considering factors beyond financial gains. While education can improve life satisfaction through better career outcomes and increased self-esteem, it can also decrease leisure satisfaction and lead to indebtedness. The key to a happier educational experience involves finding a balance between personal interests and practical career prospects, avoiding excessive debt, and recognizing that traditional schooling isn't suitable for everyone. Ultimately, the timing and method of pursuing education play significant roles in its impact on well-being.</p>

          <p>China has launched three astronauts to its permanent space station, Tiangong, to replace the current crew and conduct experiments. The Shenzhou-20 spaceship lifted off from the Gobi Desert, carrying Chen Dong, Chen Zhongrui, and Wang Jie on a six-month mission. The crew will perform maintenance, install protective equipment against space debris, and conduct experiments in physics and medicine. China aims to become a leading celestial power and plans to send a crewed mission to the Moon by 2030.</p>

          <p>Mercury, Venus, and Saturn will be visible to stargazers in a planetary parade just before dawn. The celestial event will be clearest about 45 minutes before sunrise, appearing low in the eastern sky near a crescent moon. Venus and Saturn will be the easiest to spot, while Mercury will be visible to those with a clear horizon. This planetary alignment is one of several to occur this year, offering a treat for astronomy enthusiasts.</p>
