          <p>A CNBC CEO Council flash survey indicates widespread concern among business leaders regarding President Trump's tariff policies. The survey, conducted after Trump's tariff announcement, reveals that a majority (69%) of CEOs expect a recession, with over half anticipating it this year. Additionally, 37% anticipate job cuts. Concerns range from sector-specific cost increases to perplexity over the tariffs' logic and potential boycotts of American brands, leading to uncertainty and economic pessimism. The survey highlights the immediate impact on investment expectations, with CEOs delaying major projects due to the uncertainty surrounding trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets experienced significant volatility following President Trump's tariff announcements, swinging between losses and gains as investors reacted to the potential economic impact. Goldman Sachs economists have raised the odds of a recession to 45% due to the tariffs, policy uncertainty, and declining business confidence. Global markets also suffered steep losses, with major indexes in Asia and Europe plummeting. The near-term future of equity prices hinges heavily on Trump's policy decisions, with potential for rapid shifts based on his actions. (not investment advice)</p>

The virus can also induce "immune amnesia," potentially making survivors susceptible to other diseases.

The UK is also considering changes to taxes on big tech firms as part of any potential trade deal with the United States.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell below $60 a barrel, hitting their lowest level since 2021, driven by concerns that President Trump's tariffs would trigger a recession. Increased production from OPEC+ producers and Saudi Aramco's price cuts further contributed to the decline. While Trump touted the lower oil prices, worries are mounting that tariffs could lead to higher business costs, slowing economic activity and hurting oil demand. JPMorgan has raised its recession odds to 60% following the tariff rollout. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks have declined following President Trump's tariff announcement, but it's difficult to determine if they are cheaper due to the uncertainty surrounding earnings estimates. Investors are less certain about company earnings because of the tariffs' impact and the potential for slower economic growth. Analysts have not yet fully adjusted earnings estimates to reflect these factors, making it challenging to assess whether share prices have fallen more than expected earnings. The recommendation is to remain patient and avoid buying too soon until more information about retaliation from U.S. trading partners becomes available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Business groups and conservative lawyers are preparing a legal challenge to President Trump's tariffs, arguing that he lacks the authority to impose them. The challenge is based on the premise that Congress, not the president, has the power to regulate trade. The lawsuit argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), cited by Trump, does not explicitly authorize tariffs. Legal experts believe the Supreme Court could potentially rule against the administration. (not investment advice)</p>
