          <p>New interim guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council encourages police to consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases. This aims to counter misinformation and enhance public trust, following accusations of withholding details in cases like the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old. Decisions remain with individual forces, balancing transparency with legal and ethical considerations. The Home Office supports this move, seeking greater clarity on information release.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 2024 State Department human rights report significantly altered its approach, softening criticisms of allies like El Salvador and Israel, while increasing scrutiny on Brazil and South Africa. This shift, aligning with "America First" values, reportedly involved a major revamp of the department and omission of LGBTQ+ rights. Human rights groups criticized the report for prioritizing political agendas over factual reporting, accusing it of bias and mischaracterizations. The report also claimed the UK backslid on human rights, citing antisemitic violence and free speech restrictions.</p>

          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and NATO leaders are holding virtual meetings ahead of Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz convened these calls to ensure European and Ukrainian voices are heard, as allies fear being sidelined in peace talks. Trump seeks to assess Putin's intentions for ending the four-year war, having suggested Ukraine might cede territory, a proposal Zelenskyy has categorically rejected. Ukraine insists that any discussions about its future must include its participation.</p>

          <p>Four years after the collapse of property giant China Evergrande Group, millions of Chinese homebuyers remain affected by the resulting $300 billion debt crisis. Many, like Rebecca Wei, are still waiting for their prepaid homes to be completed, or have moved into "barely liveable" properties where developers cut corners. The unfinished projects and substandard deliveries highlight the lingering impact of the crisis on ordinary families who face severe financial losses and inadequate living conditions. This ongoing struggle reflects the deep and persistent challenges within China's housing market.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights severe, under-discussed health threats from climate change to pregnant women and children, especially in impoverished regions. Extreme heat, malnutrition from crop failures, and air pollution contribute to higher rates of preterm birth, infant and maternal death. One billion children globally face extreme risk from these climate impacts, which are projected to worsen with rising emissions. The article emphasizes that while the problems are enormous, immediate actions like urban tree planting, improved data collection, and integrating maternal/child health into climate plans can save lives now.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the 1920s, the Seine River in Paris is now open for public swimming, with designated areas and docks installed. This achievement, promised by city mayors for years, was made possible by massive overflow tanks built for last summer's Olympic Games to contain sewage. The reopening comes as Paris experiences successive heat waves, offering residents and tourists a new way to cool off. The surreal experience allows swimming alongside barge traffic, echoing historical scenes from Impressionist paintings.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will cease all engagement with Czech President Petr Pavel, strongly deploring and firmly opposing his recent birthday visit to the Dalai Lama in India. Beijing lodged serious protests, stating Pavel's action was "provocative" and violated its "one-China political commitment." This marks the first time a sitting Czech president has met the Dalai Lama during his stay in India, escalating diplomatic tensions between China and the Czech Republic. The move underscores China's sensitivity regarding the Dalai Lama and its sovereignty claims.</p>

          <p>France, the UK, and Germany have informed the United Nations of their readiness to trigger "snapback sanctions" on Iran if it fails to re-enter nuclear talks by the end of August 2025. This warning comes two months after a joint US-Israeli bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities, which heightened regional tensions. The snapback mechanism, part of the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA), allows for the automatic reimposition of UN sanctions if Iran significantly breaches the agreement. Iran's uranium enrichment has reached 60% purity, far exceeding the deal's limits, raising international concern.</p>

          <p>UK newspaper headlines focus on two major domestic issues: a "record speed" of migrant arrivals via small boats, with over 50,000 reaching the UK since Sir Keir Starmer became prime minister. This has sparked blame-shifting between political parties and concerns about homelessness. Separately, reports suggest the Treasury is considering tightening inheritance tax rules to raise revenue, drawing criticism from the shadow chancellor. The Daily Express also notes a record eight million people now on universal credit, raising warnings about "broken finances" and accelerating towards a "fiscal cliff edge."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers endured a devastating walk-off loss to the Angels, crumbling in extra innings after Shohei Ohtani's go-ahead home run in the ninth. This fifth consecutive loss against the Angels puts the Dodgers in a first-place tie with the San Diego Padres in the NL West, marking a significant collapse after holding a nine-game lead a month ago. Manager Dave Roberts and players expressed frustration over the team's inability to "stack clean, good, solid baseball games together."

          <p>The state of California is challenging the legality of President Trump's deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, arguing it caused "anxiety and fear" and violated the Posse Comitatus Act. Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit claims the deployment, intended to protect federal property during protests, was an illegal "power grab" that restricted civilian movement and detained individuals. Federal lawyers, however, maintain the deployment was lawful, aimed at protecting personnel, and did not violate the Act. The trial highlights a fundamental dispute over presidential authority in domestic military use.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's susceptibility to Vladimir Putin's deceptive narratives poses a greater threat to Ukraine than military action. The author suggests Putin aims to manipulate Trump into bullying Kyiv towards an unfavorable peace deal, leveraging Trump's desire for a "dealmaker" image. The piece highlights the risk of Trump emerging from the summit echoing Kremlin talking points, which could undermine Western unity and pressure Ukraine into unacceptable territorial concessions. It emphasizes that a true resolution requires sustained military and financial support for Kyiv to hasten Putin's willingness for a genuine ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that thirteen children under 11 have died from falls out of windows in rented or temporary accommodation in England since 2019, deeming these deaths "entirely preventable." The NHS-funded National Child Mortality Database found that faulty or disengaged window locks/restrictors were common factors. A separate housing watchdog report likened the scale of window safety defects in social housing to damp and mould issues. Families expressed terror over unsafe windows, and a Manchester paediatric consultant noted an "unusually high number" of child window fall injuries, prompting calls for urgent repairs and stricter regulations.</p>
