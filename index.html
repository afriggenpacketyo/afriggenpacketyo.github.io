        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At least 19 individuals have died and dozens more were injured in Nepal following clashes between protesters and security forces over a government ban on social media platforms like Facebook and X. Thousands of "Generation Z" demonstrators gathered near parliament in Kathmandu, challenging the government's stated aim to regulate platforms for fake news and hate speech. Police used force, including water cannons and rubber bullets, as protesters breached restricted areas. The government maintains it is not banning social media but enforcing registration laws, while users rely on these platforms for various aspects of daily life.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup team faces a crucial decision for their quarter-final against Scotland, as star full-back Ellie Kildunne is sidelined with concussion symptoms. Head coach John Mitchell must choose between the inexperienced Emma Sing, known for her kicking, and the more seasoned utility back Helena Rowland, who previously started at full-back in the 2022 World Cup. Experts like Ugo Monye and Katy Daley-McLean favor Rowland for her polished performance and defensive strengths in knockout rugby. Kildunne could return for a potential semi-final if she clears the concussion protocol.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party's National Executive Committee has launched a rapid contest to replace Angela Rayner as deputy leader, with nominations opening soon and a winner expected by October 25. Former deputy leader Harriet Harman advocates for a woman from outside London to fill the role, emphasizing the need for a complementary figure to broaden the party's reach. Candidates must secure significant backing from MPs and party affiliates. This unexpected election follows Rayner's departure from government, prompting calls for a balanced leadership and a focus on government priorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence has caused some turbulence, labor economists suggest its overall impact on the workforce remains relatively small, with broader economic uncertainty being a more significant factor in recent job market declines. Experts from Indeed and career coaches note that AI's effects are largely concentrated in the tech industry and on early-career workers in roles prone to automation. However, there's a growing demand for AI skills, indicating a shift towards augmentation rather than wholesale replacement of human labor. Businesses are increasingly using AI for various HR functions, prompting workers to adapt by acquiring new skills.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the elusive street artist Banksy has emerged on the Royal Courts of Justice building in central London, depicting a judge in traditional attire striking a protester. The artwork, quickly covered by security, is seen as a potent commentary, appearing just days after mass arrests at a London protest. Banksy authenticated the piece via Instagram, continuing his pattern of creating works critical of government policy and social issues. This latest piece adds to his history of public art that challenges authority and sparks debate, often in significant locations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's attendance at the US Open men's final was met with a mix of cheers and significant boos, particularly during the national anthem. The article suggests his presence was a deliberate distraction from pressing political and personal issues, contrasting his self-aggrandizing style with the lower-profile appearances of previous presidents like the Obamas and Clintons. The USTA faced criticism for its handling of his visit, including a memo urging broadcasters to avoid showing dissent.

          <p>French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is expected to lose a confidence vote in the National Assembly, jeopardizing his fragile government amidst opposition to planned austerity measures. Bayrou, the fourth Prime Minister in just over a year under President Emmanuel Macron, faces an "impossible parliamentary mathematics" with far-right and hard-left parties united against him. Macron, whose approval ratings are low, has ruled out dissolving parliament or resigning, meaning he will likely need to appoint a new prime minister. This political instability highlights France's domestic challenges and its potential impact on the Eurozone.</p>
