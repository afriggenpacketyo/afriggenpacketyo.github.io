          <h2>FDA Approves Three Natural Food Colors Amid Concerns Over Artificial Dyes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 13:52:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved three natural food colors: Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, in response to growing health concerns about artificial food dyes. This decision follows calls from officials to phase out petroleum-based dyes, though the FDA stopped short of an outright ban, instead accelerating the review of natural alternatives. The approved additives can be used in a variety of foods and beverages, including juices, smoothies, cereals, candies, and frostings, offering manufacturers safer options for achieving desired colors. The approval is viewed as a positive step toward healthier food choices for consumers. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>Cameron Hamilton, the acting administrator of FEMA, was fired after publicly disagreeing with the Trump administration's suggestion to eliminate the agency. Hamilton testified before a House subcommittee that he believed eliminating FEMA would not be in the best interest of the American people, contradicting statements made by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who said Mr. Trump wanted to empower states to respond to disasters with federal support. The firing occurred amidst reviews of FEMA's performance and budget cuts proposed by the administration, raising concerns about disaster relief efforts as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches. His replacement will be David Richardson, who will head the agency in an acting capacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly considered raising taxes on wealthy Americans, while simultaneously suggesting Republicans should oppose such a measure. This deliberation followed Trump's outreach to House Speaker Mike Johnson about including a tax hike on the highest earners in the GOP's tax and spending bill. Trump stated he would "graciously" accept a tax increase for the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but also expressed concern about potential political backlash, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken promise. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that Trump personally wouldn't mind paying more, but negotiations are ongoing, leaving the policy unclear.</p>

          <p>According to a report by Der Spiegel, Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, known as the "Butcher of Lyon," played a significant role in establishing a major South American drug cartel. Living under an alias, Barbie reportedly became a security advisor to drug baron Roberto Suarez in the 1970s, leveraging his expertise in security, military strategy, and secret service work. He also advised Bolivian security services and helped set up a death squad. The article cites a CIA dispatch suggesting Barbie's involvement in the drug trade as early as 1974, and alleges he facilitated collaboration between Suarez and Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar.</p>

          <p>A brief radar outage at an air traffic control facility guiding planes at Newark Liberty International Airport caused further disruptions, intensifying concerns about safety. The 90-second outage affected communications and radar displays, similar to an incident the previous week that also caused significant travel delays. An air traffic controller alerted a pilot to the outage, urging them to pressure the airline to address the issue. These technological problems, coupled with staffing shortages, have made air travel to and from Newark unreliable. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has called for the FAA to reverse a decision that allowed more flights at the airport.</p>

          <p>Two men, Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham, were found guilty of criminal damage for felling the famous Sycamore Gap tree in northern England, a crime that caused widespread sadness and anger. The tree, which stood for 150 years along Hadrian's Wall and was featured in the film "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," was a beloved symbol of the area. Evidence presented during the trial suggested the motive may have been vandalism and a desire to shock. Both men denied involvement, but cellphone data, CCTV footage, and traffic cameras placed them at the scene.</p>

          <p>Vice President Vance stated that the escalating conflict between India and Pakistan is "fundamentally none of our business," signaling a potential shift towards a more hands-off foreign policy. His comments came as both countries engaged in exchanges using drones and projectiles, reaching areas not targeted in decades. While Vance mentioned pursuing de-escalation through diplomatic channels, analysts worry his statement might embolden both sides, especially considering the absence of another power to mediate tensions. The conflict was triggered by a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistani proxies, a claim Pakistan denies.</p>

When tariffs were announced, Carr initially saw an opportunity to gain market share due to World Emblem's exemption under the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, but quickly realized that tariffs on raw materials from China and potential economic recession would negatively impact the company. Despite efforts to expand domestically, the company struggles to attract US-born workers, and faces rising costs in Mexico. The company has had to deal with damaged customer relationships as a result of attempting to pass on the costs of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another 90-second outage of radar and communication systems, raising concerns about the aging air traffic control infrastructure. The outage occurred hours after the Trump administration unveiled a plan to overhaul the outdated technology. This is the second outage in recent weeks, exacerbating existing staffing shortages and causing travel delays. The FAA and airlines are seeking emergency funding from Congress to address the system's urgent needs.</p>

          <p>The South African government has criticized the United States' plan to potentially resettle white Afrikaners as refugees, describing the move as "politically motivated" and undermining South Africa's democracy. This follows President Trump's earlier assertion that Afrikaners are victims of racial discrimination. While South Africa will not block departures, they seek assurances that those selected have been fully vetted and have no pending criminal charges. The South African government maintains that allegations of discrimination against its white minority are unfounded.</p>

The rapper claims the song was removed from Soundcloud and is unavailable on Spotify and Apple Music.

The song includes lyrics about his custody battle with Kim Kardashian and a sampled Hitler speech. Ye's recent attempts to re-enter the media landscape have been tumultuous, including a ban from Twitch and a walk-off from Piers Morgan's talk show.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested lowering tariffs on China from 145% to 80%, ahead of trade negotiations. Analysts believe that this move would not substantially ease expected price increases for goods. Product shortages would also remain a possibility at the lower tariff rate. The tariffs have already prompted warnings from companies about potential price increases for U.S. shoppers. The developments followed a weeks-long back and forth during which the two sides disputed whether they had already started discussing the tariffs.</p>
