          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has cautioned that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and urged Asian nations to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter potential conflict. Hegseth characterized China's ambitions as seeking hegemonic power and warned that Beijing is preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia. China has responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace. The US aims to create a strong deterrent with allies to prevent war, but emphasizes that this requires increased defense investments.</p>

          <p>Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog.

The IAEA report warns that Iran's cooperation has been less than satisfactory, prompting calls for urgent cooperation. Israel has responded, stating the report confirms that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>
