        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump commented on Florida's proposal to end all vaccine mandates for students, calling it a "tough stance." While Florida officials, including the state's Surgeon General, have strongly opposed such requirements, Trump voiced support for certain "amazing" vaccines like the one for polio. He emphasized that vaccines that are proven to work and are not controversial should be utilized to protect public health and prevent the endangerment of others. This positions him in contrast to some elements of the Republican party pushing for complete elimination of vaccine mandates.</p>

The offensive follows the October 7 attacks and threatens to displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.

First responders were called to the scene but were unable to save the man, who was pulled from the water with critical injuries. Police have recovered parts of a surfboard for examination and are working to confirm the victim's identity. In response to the fatal incident, several beaches in the area have been closed to the public while experts work to identify the shark species involved.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the U.S. government its largest single shareholder. This move, converting grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, is a rare instance of direct government investment in a private company outside of a crisis. The primary motivation is to reduce reliance on foreign chip manufacturing, particularly from Taiwan, amid geopolitical tensions with China and the race for AI dominance. While the deal aims to secure national security and supply chains, experts note it carries risks, including potential political pressure on Intel's business decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials in Chicago, Baltimore, and New Orleans are bracing for the potential deployment of National Guard troops, a measure President Trump has suggested to address crime. This follows similar deployments in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., despite data showing crime has decreased in the targeted cities. State and local leaders have shown varied responses, with Democratic governors in Illinois and Maryland preparing legal challenges, while Louisiana's Republican governor has welcomed the support.

          <p>In Mumbai, India, drivers are increasingly replacing standard vehicle horns with much louder, after-market versions to navigate the city's chaotic and noisy traffic. This trend exacerbates the existing noise pollution problem, with average noise levels often exceeding 80 decibels, well above WHO recommendations. Despite laws against excessive honking, enforcement is a low priority for traffic police focused on managing congestion. Experts and activists argue that the belief that louder horns improve road safety is a misconception, contributing to a public health issue that requires better enforcement and civic awareness.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 475 workers, mostly South Korean citizens, at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia for allegedly working illegally on visitor visas. Officials stated the raid was part of an ongoing criminal investigation to protect American jobs, asserting that short-term visas do not authorize employment. The South Korean government has responded by sending diplomats and calling for its citizens' rights to be respected. The incident has raised questions, with an immigration lawyer claiming some of those detained were present for legitimate business meetings permitted under their visa waiver program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research from Oxford Economics, China's current campaign against "involution," or destructive, low-quality price competition, is not expected to be as impactful as the supply-side reforms of 2015. While recent government meetings have signaled a desire to address the issue, analysts believe the current economic environment makes it difficult to implement necessary measures like production capacity cuts or significant demand-side stimulus. The analysis suggests that expectations for a sweeping campaign to resolve China's supply-demand imbalances may be misplaced, indicating a more challenging path ahead for economic rebalancing.

          <h2>Tech Giants Engage in "AI Talent War," Offering Multi-Million Dollar Packages to Specialists</h2>

          <p>A fierce "talent war" has erupted in the artificial intelligence sector, with major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Microsoft offering massive compensation packages to attract a small pool of top AI researchers and engineers. The high demand and limited supply of specialists who can build and train large language models have driven salaries and signing bonuses into the millions. This spending is considered a relatively small investment by companies pouring billions into developing foundational AI models. The intense competition risks leaving startups and traditional industries behind, as they cannot compete with the salaries offered by Big Tech. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured a spot in the U.S. Open final by defeating 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic in a straight-sets semifinal match. The 22-year-old showcased his athleticism and creativity to win 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2, overcoming the 38-year-old tennis legend. Djokovic acknowledged feeling "gassed out" by the end, highlighting the physical challenge of competing against much younger top players in best-of-five-set matches. Alcaraz's victory sets up a highly anticipated final against his main rival, Jannik Sinner, marking the third consecutive Grand Slam final between the world's top two players.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's punitive tariffs and dismissive attitude towards India are forcing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to confront the limits of their perceived "special relationship." The author contends that India's decade-long tilt towards Washington, based on an assumption of partnership, has been met with a harsh reminder that the U.S. often views non-Western nations as clients rather than allies. This breakdown suggests that India must return to a policy of "strategic autonomy," akin to its historical non-alignment, to navigate a world where Western powers are increasingly protectionist. The article posits that Trump's actions are a portent of a new, more hostile global order.</p>

          <p>France is facing significant economic turmoil as its government faces a likely no-confidence vote over proposed budget cuts, exacerbating concerns about the country's massive public debt. With sovereign debt at €3.35 trillion (113% of GDP) and the largest budget deficit in the EU, financial markets are showing nervousness through higher risk premiums on French bonds. Economists warn that while an immediate crisis is not expected, the political deadlock in the eurozone's second-largest economy could destabilize the single currency. The situation highlights the long-standing difficulty for French governments to implement austerity measures amid strong political opposition from both the left and right. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British newspaper front pages are dominated by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and the subsequent cabinet reshuffle by Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Headlines describe the situation as a "Nightmare on Downing Street" and a sign of a government in "meltdown," with commentators suggesting the sweeping changes are a desperate attempt to regain control. The reshuffle is seen as a "big gamble" aimed at countering the rising threat from the Reform UK party. While Rayner's departure is viewed as a "serious blow" to Starmer, some outlets speculate she could become a powerful rival outside the government.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech describing President Donald Trump as a "risk taker" who correctly identified widespread anxieties in Western societies. In the speech, he will draw parallels between the electoral mandates of Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer for "national renewal." The address is seen as a strategic move to solidify the UK-US relationship and counter the influence of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has strong ties to the Trump administration. Mandelson will also frame Brexit as an opportunity that has "freed" Britain to pursue closer ties with the US.</p>
