          <p>The FBI is seeking public assistance in the manhunt for the individual who fatally shot conservative activist Charlie Kirk, releasing photos of a person of interest and offering a $100,000 reward. The assassination occurred at a Utah Valley University event, where Kirk was hit by a single shot from a high-powered rifle fired from a distance. Law enforcement officials have recovered key evidence, including the weapon and forensic imprints, from a wooded area where the suspect, described as appearing to be college-aged, fled after the attack. The ongoing investigation has become a major focus for federal and state authorities, who are analyzing video footage of the suspect.</p>

          <p>New estimates based on August inflation data suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would represent a slight increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025, potentially adding about $54 per month to the average retirement check. The official COLA will be announced in October after September's inflation data is included. Despite the potential increase, the article notes that many retirees express concern that benefit adjustments may not keep pace with rising costs for essentials like Medicare premiums.

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School near Denver, Colorado, resulted in two students being wounded before the 16-year-old suspect, identified as a student at the school, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. One of the victims was reported to be in critical condition following the attack, which took place both inside and outside the school building with a handgun. Law enforcement responded within minutes and secured the scene without firing any shots. The incident prompted a chaotic reunification process for parents and students and has led to school cancellations and renewed community grief over gun violence.</p>

The potential boycott by multiple nations could significantly reduce the number of participants in the popular music competition.

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, is facing questions regarding the purchase of an £885,000 home in his Clacton constituency, which was bought in his partner's name without a mortgage. Critics suggest the arrangement may have been structured to avoid over £44,000 in second-home stamp duty, a charge of hypocrisy given Farage's recent criticism of another politician's tax affairs. Farage has denied any financial involvement, stating his partner, Laure Ferrari, used her own funds from a wealthy family. However, a BBC investigation into French property records has raised doubts about the family's ability to finance such a purchase, increasing pressure on Farage to provide a clearer explanation.</p>

          <p>A former executive at Verily, Alphabet's health tech subsidiary, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging the company improperly used the health data of over 25,000 patients and concealed the violations. The lawsuit claims that the executive, Ryan Sloan, was fired after discovering and reporting breaches of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) to senior management. According to the complaint, an internal investigation confirmed multiple breaches affecting patients in its diabetes program, but Verily delayed notifying clients like Walgreens and Highmark Health to avoid negative publicity and protect contract negotiations.

While prosecutors sought a seven-year sentence, her defense requested a lighter term due to her ongoing cancer treatment. In a tearful address to the court, she took accountability for her actions but claimed she had blindly followed her husband, who she said put her in an illegal position.

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the right-wing political activist who was murdered at age 31, wielded significant influence within the modern conservative movement and the Trump administration. As the founder of Turning Point USA, he mobilized young conservatives on college campuses and became a prominent media personality known for his provocative and often controversial views on social and political issues. Kirk was a staunch ally of President Donald Trump, who called him a "martyr for truth." While supporters viewed him as a champion of free speech, critics condemned his promotion of conspiracy theories and rhetoric that often targeted minority groups, making him a deeply polarizing figure in American politics.</p>

The author argues that such rituals offer a model for finding shared humanity beyond political tribes. Mourning his violent death is presented not as an endorsement of his politics but as a necessary obligation to the broader community and a rejection of political violence itself.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has sacked its ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, after newly released documents revealed a closer relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein than was previously known. The decision came after U.S. lawmakers released emails in which Mandelson referred to Epstein as his "best pal" and suggested his first conviction was wrongful. The British Foreign Office stated this new information made his position untenable, and he was withdrawn with immediate effect. The dismissal creates a diplomatic vacancy at a crucial time, as the U.K. seeks to maintain its relationship with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A French parliamentary commission has recommended a ban on social media access for children under 15 and a "digital curfew" for those aged 15 to 18. The inquiry, which focused on the psychological effects of TikTok, concluded that the platform exposes young users to toxic and addictive content, describing it as a "production line of distress." The recommendations also include banning mobile phones in schools and creating a crime of digital negligence for parents. The move aligns France with other European countries considering stricter regulations on children's social media use, reflecting growing concerns over the mental health impact of these platforms.</p>

          <p>England's Football Association (FA) has charged Chelsea FC with 74 alleged rule breaches related to payments made to agents between 2009 and 2022, during the ownership of Roman Abramovich. The investigation, which focuses on transfers involving players like Eden Hazard and Willian, concerns agents, intermediaries, and third-party investments. The club's new ownership group discovered and self-reported the potentially incomplete financial records to regulators after their 2022 purchase. While sanctions could include fines or a points deduction, the club's cooperation is expected to be a mitigating factor, and Chelsea does not anticipate a sporting sanction.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is the latest event in a disturbing trend of politically motivated violence that has spanned the political spectrum in the United States. The article contextualizes his killing by listing other recent attacks, including those targeting Democratic lawmakers, government buildings, and two attempts on President Trump's life. It notes that while the shooter's specific motive is unknown, Kirk was a provocative and prominent figure in a hyper-polarized environment where many Americans feel their way of life is under threat. The event has intensified the national conversation about political violence and the deep divisions fueling it.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened further attacks inside Qatar if the nation does not expel Hamas's political leadership, escalating tensions with the key U.S. ally. The warning comes after an Israeli strike in Doha targeted a Hamas meeting, an act President Trump stated "will not happen again" after speaking with both leaders. Netanyahu defended the strike, comparing it to the U.S. response after 9/11 and demanding that nations harboring terrorists either expel them or face Israeli action. The attack has been condemned by Qatar and has complicated delicate hostage negotiations, with some officials stating it has killed any hope of a brokered ceasefire.</p>

Tusk emphasized that Poland's political leaders must act as "one fist" against the threat from the east. This unified stance comes as Warsaw closes its border with Belarus ahead of joint Russo-Belarusian military drills, with leaders warning of further provocations and Russian disinformation campaigns.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has released his "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) strategy, a 20-page document with 128 recommendations aimed at tackling chronic disease in children. The plan calls for actions such as investigating vaccine injuries, promoting innovation in sunscreens, and closing loopholes that allow new chemicals into the food supply. While Kennedy touts his early actions as historic, this article suggests the strategy is more effective at describing problems than offering concrete, measurable solutions. Critics note that the plan's success will be difficult to gauge, as it relies on broad research goals and lacks clear metrics for what constitutes a "healthy" America.</p>

Researchers warn that in a worst-case funding scenario, an additional 10 million people could contract TB and 2.2 million could die in high-burden countries. The U.S. is the primary funder for a majority of global TB control programs, supporting everything from screening to treatment distribution.

          <p>Medicare's "3-day rule" is a critical regulation that can significantly impact seniors' healthcare costs after a hospitalization. The rule requires a beneficiary to have a medically necessary inpatient hospital stay of at least three consecutive days before Medicare Part A will cover subsequent care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF). Time spent under "observation status" in a hospital does not count toward this requirement, a distinction that can leave patients with unexpected and substantial bills for their rehabilitation care.
