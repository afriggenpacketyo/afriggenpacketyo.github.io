          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed the report of urinary symptoms, leading doctors to discover a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. The news surfaces nearly a year after Biden withdrew from the 2024 US presidential election due to health concerns and age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest drone bombardments of the war on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv, just before President Trump was expected to speak with President Vladimir Putin. The attack, involving an estimated 273 drones and decoys, resulted in one death and several injuries. Ukrainian officials argue that these relentless bombardments demonstrate Putin's lack of desire for peace. Trump's administration has been criticized for pressuring Ukraine and offering inducements to Moscow, including considering the recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick disclosed that he once spent $5,000 on special milk ordered by Antonio Brown for Tom Brady to maintain a positive relationship between the two players during Brown's brief stint with the New England Patriots.

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer José Alvarado received an 80-game suspension after testing positive for external testosterone under Major League Baseball’s drug-testing program. The positive test was caused by a weight loss drug Alvarado took during the offseason, with Alvarado accepting the suspension and not appealing. Alvarado would lose $4.5m, exactly half his $9m salary this year, as part of a $22m, three-year contract. He would also be ineligible for the postseason.</p>
