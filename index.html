          <p>Authorities have arrested a 20-year-old man for allegedly making a terrorist threat against Utah Valley University, the site of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's recent murder. The suspect, Blake Francis Rogers, reportedly posted a video online claiming he was on an "odyssey" to the university to "kill woke." Rogers allegedly told investigators the video was a joke intended for a small group of people. He now faces a charge of making a threat of terrorism, causing an emergency agency to act, as the threat prompted a significant response from law enforcement.</p>

          <p>ABC has taken "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" off the air for an indefinite period following controversial comments made by the host regarding the murder of Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel suggested that the accused killer, Tyler Robinson, was part of the MAGA movement, prompting backlash. Major broadcast partner Nexstar Media Group also announced it would preempt the show, calling Kimmel's remarks "offensive and insensitive" and not in the public interest at this time. The network's decision reflects the intense political sensitivity surrounding Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has reduced its base interest rate for the first time this year, mirroring a similar 25-basis-point cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. This move is intended to lower borrowing costs to support businesses and ease the financial pressure on mortgage holders in the city. The Fed's decision was prompted by signs of a softening U.S. labor market, as noted by Chairman Jerome Powell. This initial cut is widely seen by market analysts as the beginning of a rate-reduction cycle expected to continue into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Senate testimony, former CDC Director Susan Monarez stated she was fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for refusing to give "blanket approval" to forthcoming vaccine recommendations without scientific review. She raised alarms about Kennedy's agenda, which she fears could weaken vaccine protections and leave the U.S. unprepared for future pandemics. Monarez also testified that Kennedy expressed disdain for CDC employees, calling the agency corrupt and its staff "bought by the pharmaceutical industry."

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is reversing a recent, controversial rebrand after facing intense criticism from customers and a drop in its stock price. The company's attempt to modernize its logo by removing the iconic "Old Timer" image was met with accusations that it was abandoning its American identity. Following the backlash, which included commentary from President Donald Trump, the company quickly pivoted, stating it had listened to its guests and would restore its original branding. The chain is now focusing on innovating its menu and guest experience while embracing its traditional image.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a widely expected quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, bringing its benchmark rate to a target range of 4%-4.25%. Projections from committee members, known as the "dot plot," indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the move as a "risk management" cut aimed at sustaining economic expansion amid signs of a weakening labor market. However, the forecast of a slower pace of cuts in subsequent years created a mixed reaction in financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of the beloved ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's, announced this week that he's resigned from the company he helped create in the late 1970s over an ongoing dispute with its parent company, Unilever. In a public resignation letter, Greenfield said Ben & Jerry's "has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power" by Unilever. The Vermont-based ice cream maker, with its zany packaging and inventive flavors, has long been known for its progressive politics and the company routinely speaks out on social issues.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats in Congress on Wednesday of inserting "partisan political preferences" into the government funding fight, and said they are risking a shutdown if they don't drop their demands. Democrats have zeroed in on the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits as their central demand in negotiations over a bill to fund the government after Sept. 30. It does not contain an extension of the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits, which are currently set to expire at the end of the year, which could cause average ACA plan premiums to increase.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that Democrats will "lose that battle" if they insist on including an extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits in the upcoming government funding bill. With a September 30 deadline looming, Republicans have released a stopgap bill that funds the government through November but omits the ACA subsidies, which are set to expire at year's end. Johnson accused Democrats of risking a shutdown by inserting "unrelated matters" into the funding debate. The standoff sets the stage for a high-stakes negotiation, as millions could face significant health insurance premium increases if the credits lapse.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana immigration judge has ordered the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a pro-Palestinian activist and legal U.S. resident, for failing to disclose certain information on his green card application.

Khalil was arrested as part of a broader Trump administration crackdown on foreign-born pro-Palestinian academics. His lawyers intend to appeal the deportation order but expressed concern that the process would be swift and likely unsuccessful.</p>

The visit has been marked by extraordinary pageantry within the confines of Windsor Castle, largely shielding the president from the public and potential protestors. This raises questions about whether the significant effort and expense will yield tangible diplomatic or economic benefits for Britain. The true return on this investment in soft power diplomacy will become clearer as the business and political discussions of the visit conclude.</p>

During the trial, Ferguson claimed the shooting was an accident, but his son testified that he heard his mother say, "Why don’t you point a real gun at me?" just before the shot was fired.

          <p>A recent analysis of tax legislation passed under President Trump, including the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," argues that the changes are creating a system riddled with loopholes benefiting specific groups at both high and low income levels. The laws provide significant breaks for business owners through pass-through deductions and create new write-offs for tipped workers and those earning overtime, while potentially leaving salaried professionals to bear a larger, more predictable tax burden. This approach is criticized for reducing horizontal equity, meaning families with similar incomes could face vastly different tax bills. (not investment advice)</p>
