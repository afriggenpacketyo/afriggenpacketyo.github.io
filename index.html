          <p>San Diego FC has issued indefinite bans to 33 fans involved in a violent brawl following their match against the LA Galaxy at Snapdragon Stadium. The club prohibits these individuals from attending both home and away matches, collaborating with law enforcement and MLS to enforce these bans, and considering further actions. The club expressed disappointment in the fan behavior, emphasizing its commitment to creating a safe and respectful environment for all attendees. This incident adds to a series of fan behavior issues during San Diego's inaugural season, despite the team's success on the field, as fights also broke out at a game against Los Angeles FC in April.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent tax bill from US President Donald Trump includes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by non-US citizens, which could significantly impact African economies. Remittances are crucial for many African families, often covering essential expenses like food, education, and medical bills. World Bank data indicates that remittance flows into Africa exceeded $92 billion in 2024, with the US being a major source, accounting for at least $12 billion. Experts suggest that migrants may seek unofficial channels to evade the tax, potentially undermining the policy's effectiveness and further squeezing low-income individuals and their families. This measure is seen as part of the Trump administration's broader campaign against illegal migration (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Firefighters are battling the Henderson Fire, which erupted in Pala, prompting evacuation orders in northern San Diego County. The fire, which started near Henderson Road and Pala Mission Road, has charred 183 acres within two hours, rapidly spreading due to steep hillside terrain. Evacuation orders are in effect for surrounding communities, particularly impacting members of the Pala Band of Mission Indians, with a temporary evacuation location set up at the Pala Casino parking lot. The fire is currently 5% contained, with efforts focused on preventing its spread into the hillsides, but Saturday's weather, with high temperatures and wind gusts, could challenge containment efforts.</p>

          <p>An inquest is underway in New South Wales to investigate the Bondi Junction stabbings, seeking to understand how Joel Cauchi, a man with a history of mental illness, was able to kill six people and injure 10 others. The inquiry is scrutinizing Cauchi's interactions with police and mental health professionals in the years leading up to the attacks, examining potential missed opportunities for intervention. The inquest heard that Cauchi had been diagnosed with schizophrenia at 17 and had been on medication for years, but stopped taking it in 2019. The inquiry is also investigating whether Cauchi targeted specific individuals or groups, with a focus on whether the attacks were motivated by hatred towards women.</p>

This action follows an executive order targeting funding for programs at the Smithsonian Institution that contain what Trump considers "divisive, race-centered ideology."

Trevor Hansen pitched well, but gave up two solo home runs, while Ricky Ojeda's availability for the next game is uncertain due to his pitch count.

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, surpassing pre-pandemic levels from 2019, but their travel styles have shifted. The large group tours and shopping sprees are giving way to immersive experiences focused on Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, often repeat visitors, now favor family trips over group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is targeting this market, including opening a social media account on a popular Chinese platform.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator reported progress in talks with U.S. Cabinet members toward a potential tariff deal, possibly by June. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister in charge of economic revitalization, stated that Japan seeks the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports. The discussions included boosting investment and addressing economic security issues, with another round of negotiations planned before the G7 summit. Japan has proposed increased purchases of U.S. corn and soybeans and cooperation in resurrecting U.S. shipbuilding capacity in exchange for tariff elimination.</p>

He also revealed plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%, but later admitted he hasn't seen the final details of the deal yet. The Biden administration previously blocked the sale over national security concerns, but Trump has since reversed that decision.</p>
