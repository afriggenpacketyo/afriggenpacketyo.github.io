          <p>This article argues that the transatlantic relationship between Europe and the United States is undergoing a profound and structural rupture, extending beyond the immediate influence of Donald Trump's presidency. The author, after observing recent developments in Washington, suggests that a return to the past shared sense of kinship is a delusional hope. Instead, the future likely involves a relationship based on fleeting transactions of convenience or, more ominously, a world of clashing empires. Europe's current strategy of appeasement is deemed counterproductive, potentially making the continent vulnerable. The article stresses the imperative for European leaders to accept this new geopolitical reality and actively develop greater strategic autonomy to avoid a diminished global standing.</p>

          <p>China has dedicated nearly 450 billion yuan ($63.2 billion) over the past five years to a strategic mineral exploration initiative, resulting in significant breakthroughs across oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium reserves. This substantial investment, a core component of the nation's 14th five-year planning period, is driven by considerations of supply-chain security and the escalating demand from new technological advancements amidst geopolitical tensions. Chinese geologists have successfully mapped 163 mineral types and identified over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, including a remarkable 300 billion cubic meters of deep coal bed methane in the Ordos Basin. These discoveries are vital for bolstering China's energy independence and optimizing its resource structure.</p>

          <p>Influential conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a prominent ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot at a Utah Valley University event while discussing gun violence. The 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA was struck in the neck by a single bullet, leading to immediate chaos among the estimated 3,000 attendees. Authorities have classified the incident as an assassination and are conducting an extensive manhunt for the shooter, who is suspected of firing from a nearby rooftop. President Trump confirmed Kirk's death hours later, triggering a widespread expression of grief and condemnation of political violence from figures across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung expressed significant concern that South Korean companies would become "very hesitant" to invest in the US after a large immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean nationals, many on various visas or under waiver programs, were detained, prompting Seoul to negotiate with Washington for new visa categories or higher quotas for workers. President Lee indicated that President Trump had intervened, instructing that workers should have the freedom to remain, which delayed their return. The incident has caused "shock" in South Korea, raising questions about its alliance with the US and potential chilling effects on future business activities.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials, who were abruptly fired by FBI Director Kash Patel last month, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging their terminations were politically motivated and illegal. The complaint states that Patel indicated his job depended on removing agents involved in past investigations of President Trump, asserting that "the FBI tried to put the President in jail and he hasn't forgotten it." The lawsuit further details alleged pressure from White House officials, including Stephen Miller, to conduct summary firings, particularly targeting those involved in January 6 investigations. The decorated veteran agents argue that these actions undermine the FBI's integrity and national security, with one former official recounting political loyalty questions during his vetting.</p>

As Kirk debated gun violence under a "prove me wrong" tent, he was mortally wounded, turning him into a martyr for many young conservatives. The article connects this incident to a series of recent political attacks, including attempts on Donald Trump's life and shootings of state legislators.

          <p>A recent Redfin report suggests San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal," specifically reaching mortgage payment-to-income ratios last seen in July 2018. This stabilization is linked to decelerating home-price growth and declining mortgage rates, particularly benefiting tech-driven metros where wage increases surpass the national average. Despite this, the article clarifies that "normal" in San Francisco still translates to a staggering 74% of household income dedicated to mortgages, far exceeding the national average of 30%. The analysis emphasizes that this trend does not equate to affordability, especially for renters, who are experiencing spiking costs driven by the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector.</p>

The decision was made despite existing US tariffs on Ghanaian goods and visa restrictions for Ghanaian citizens, though Mahama noted relations remained positive.

The collected samples, sourced from reddish, clay-rich mudstones, contain organic carbon and tiny specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide.

Trump had cited allegations of mortgage fraud as the reason for Cook's dismissal, which she denies, while her legal team contends it is a pretext to pressure the Fed into cutting interest rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior cancer doctors in England are cautioning that excessive bureaucracy is causing an "unacceptable postcode lottery" for patients attempting to access the latest cancer treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) highlights that cumbersome funding application processes are "stifling innovation," making cutting-edge therapies such as Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR) inconsistently available across different regions. This inequitable situation means some patients are missing out on potentially life-saving treatments. Although NHS England states that all radiotherapy trusts are capable of offering SABR and is committed to expanding its use, the RCR is urging the government to significantly reduce red tape in its upcoming cancer strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris, in excerpts from her forthcoming book "107 Days," sharply criticizes former President Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election, arguing it should not have been "left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition." Harris characterizes the choice as "recklessness" due to the immense stakes involved, and she reflects on her conflicted position regarding advising him against running, fearing it would appear "incredibly self-serving." The article also highlights Harris's profound criticism of Biden's inner circle, alleging they failed to defend her and even contributed to negative narratives. While acknowledging Biden "got tired," she ultimately defends his capacity, stating her loyalty to the country superseded her loyalty to the president.</p>

          <p>History teachers across the US, like Ann Krois in Iowa, are finding innovative ways to teach the defining moments of 9/11 to a generation born after the attacks. Krois emphasizes the importance of understanding the trauma and global unity that followed, drawing on her experience with a program at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. This initiative connects educators with survivors and witnesses, such as retired firefighter Bill Spade, to convey firsthand accounts. The article highlights the commitment of teachers like Chris Theilacker, an Army veteran, to impart lessons of both the global war on terror and the resilience that emerged from the tragedy, advocating for 9/11 education as a national standard.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken offers five science-backed strategies for effectively managing everyday stress, acknowledging it as a normal and often unavoidable aspect of modern life. He advises against the counterproductive act of worrying about stress, as this can intensify its negative impacts, instead promoting acceptance of its presence. Core recommendations include engaging in regular physical exercise, which trains the body to better handle physiological stress responses like cortisol spikes, and prioritizing consistent sleep patterns. The article also stresses the importance of self-care through nutritious eating, dedicating time for relaxation, and practicing mindfulness by intentionally pacing oneself through daily challenges to build resilience.</p>

          <p>China is pursuing a "lean and mean" artificial intelligence strategy, prioritizing practical applications and efficient resource allocation amidst its escalating tech rivalry with the United States. Beijing has initiated a discreet 60.06 billion yuan ($8.42 billion) national AI fund and is rolling out extensive "AI+" plans to integrate the technology across various economic and societal sectors. Chinese officials emphasize leveraging "usable" chips, even if not the most advanced, and focusing on practical use cases rather than solely pursuing human-level artificial general intelligence. This resourceful approach, despite US restrictions on advanced chips, has enabled local companies to develop competitive generative AI models, with state capital increasingly supporting hardware-focused startups.

          <p>A last-minute bill in California proposes electric customers pay an additional $9 billion to shore up the state's $21-billion wildfire fund, extending a monthly surcharge for 10 years beyond 2035. This deal, reached behind closed doors, aims to replenish the fund, which faces depletion from damages like the Eaton fire. Utility shareholders would match this contribution with another $9 billion, bringing the total increase to $18 billion. Consumer advocates express disappointment over increased ratepayer costs but acknowledge provisions like public financing for transmission projects could offer some savings. The bill, introduced days before the legislative session ends, faces criticism for its lack of public debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli missile strike in Doha, targeting senior Hamas officials, has effectively jeopardized a US-brokered peace deal and severely strained relations with indispensable mediator Qatar. The operation, intended to eliminate "terrorist masterminds," occurred precisely as Hamas leaders were convened to consider President Trump's latest hostage release proposal. Qatar vehemently condemned the attack, and US officials, including President Trump, expressed private fury, viewing the strike as potentially "disemboweling" ongoing truce efforts. This incident has cultivated a widespread sense of resignation that peace talks are now over and that relations with Qatar may be irrevocably damaged, raising significant questions about Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategic rationale and the fate of the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Nepal's government has collapsed following a violent uprising, with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli resigning after more than 20 fatalities in anti-government demonstrations sparked by a social media ban. Protesters breached parliament and set fire to politicians' residences, prompting a nationwide curfew and military intervention. This political turmoil, echoing recent instability in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, significantly complicates India's neighborhood diplomacy due to Nepal's profound historical, economic, and strategic ties. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed deep anguish and appealed for peace, as the Himalayan nation's strategic location and open border with India mean its instability directly impacts India's security and regional influence, especially with China vying for influence.</p>

The ongoing dispute with the Unite union shows no immediate resolution, as refuse workers have voted to extend their walkout until next March, despite the council ceasing negotiations.

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett visited Southern California for a book event, coinciding with widespread controversy following her vote in a Supreme Court decision that permits federal immigration agents to detain individuals based on their brown skin or Spanish language. While attendees at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library lauded her as an exemplary figure of faith-driven values and constitutional originalism, the ruling provoked significant outrage in Los Angeles, raising concerns about Fourth Amendment violations. Barrett largely sidestepped her contentious jurisprudence, offering lighthearted anecdotes, but she did discuss the "slippery text" of the Fourth Amendment and presented a hypothetical scenario closely mirroring the recent immigration decision, underscoring its relevance.</p>
