          <p>More than 25 million people in the U.S. Northeast, from Maryland to Maine, are under a severe thunderstorm watch as a weather system moves through the region. The primary threats include damaging wind gusts, with a possibility of isolated large hail and brief tornadoes, particularly in northern New England. Forecasters also warn of potential flash flooding in urban and poor-drainage areas due to slow-moving storms producing torrential rain. The storms are expected to persist into the overnight hours before cooler, fall-like air moves in for the latter half of the weekend.</p>

          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning led the Longhorns to a 38-7 victory over San Jose State, accounting for five touchdowns in a strong statistical performance. Despite throwing for 295 yards and four touchdowns while also rushing for another, Manning expressed dissatisfaction with his play, calling it "not very good." He pointed to the team's overall "sloppy" execution, which included two turnovers and a low third-down conversion rate, as areas needing improvement. This game marked a significant rebound from his challenging season debut against Ohio State the previous week.</p>

          <p>The BBC has confirmed that Jamie Borthwick, who played Jay Brown on the long-running soap opera 'EastEnders' for 19 years, will not be returning to the show. His dismissal follows a suspension earlier this year for using a slur against people with disabilities on the set of 'Strictly Come Dancing.' Borthwick had been expected to resume filming this month, but the decision was made to terminate his contract altogether. The actor had previously apologized for the incident, which disability charity Scope described as an opportunity for him to educate himself.</p>

          <p>Broadcasters for the US Open men's final have reportedly been instructed by organizers to avoid airing any booing or other negative crowd reactions toward former President Donald Trump, who is expected to attend. An email sent to media partners specified that Trump would be shown on screen during the national anthem but requested that networks "refrain from showing any disruptions or reactions" to his presence. Trump has not attended the tournament since 2015, when he was booed by spectators. The request has raised questions about media coverage and the intersection of politics and sporting events.</p>

          <p>The NFL successfully staged its first of seven international games this season in São Paulo, Brazil, where the Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Kansas City Chiefs. The event, held in a packed stadium of nearly 50,000 fans, is a key part of the league's long-term strategy to establish a year-round global presence rather than hosting one-off events. NFL executives emphasized their commitment to building a fan base in new markets, supported by new media deals and active team participation. The positive reception and improved field conditions mark a step forward in the NFL's goal to become a truly global sport.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the team's performance under manager Thomas Tuchel drew criticism for being uninspired and lacking creativity. Despite securing the win with an own goal and a header from Declan Rice, the display was described as turgid, leading many fans to leave the stadium early. Pundits suggest that under Tuchel, who took over after Euro 2024, the team has arguably regressed and has yet to establish a clear identity. The upcoming match against Serbia is seen as a more significant test for the squad's progress.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing countries that wrongfully detain American citizens abroad. The order empowers the State Department to create a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, which can trigger consequences such as economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the new measure is modeled after the state sponsor of terrorism classification and is intended to create a strong deterrent. According to advocacy group the Foley Foundation, at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained in 17 countries last year.</p>

Despite the daily dip, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended the week with gains. The market's reaction highlights the ongoing dilemma for investors, who are balancing the positive implications of lower borrowing costs against the negative signs of a cooling economy.

          <p>The southern grocery store chain Piggly Wiggly is closing several locations in states including Alabama, Georgia, and Wisconsin. The closures are attributed to a combination of inflation, decreased consumer demand, and expiring leases, reflecting a broader trend affecting the grocery industry. Smaller, independent chains like Piggly Wiggly face intense pressure from larger competitors such as Walmart, which commands a significant share of the U.S. grocery market. The low-profit-margin nature of the grocery business makes it particularly vulnerable to economic downturns and shifts in consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a settlement led to the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The deal, financed by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a massive five-year restoration effort aimed at healing the landscape from decades of intensive grazing. The plan involves using targeted grazing with new cattle herds to manage invasive plants and restore native grasslands, creating a living laboratory for conservation. The transition is complex, marked by the loss of historic ranches but also hope for ecological recovery.</p>
