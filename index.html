          <p>Sources indicate that Qatar's royal family is considering donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's use as a presidential plane. The plane, which would be donated to the future Trump presidential library shortly before he leaves office, needs security checks before acceptance. Ali Al-Ansari, Qatar's Media Attaché to the U.S., confirmed discussions between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense regarding the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One, but stated no decision has been made. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt assured that any gift would comply with all applicable laws and ensure full transparency.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it will release Edan Alexander, a US-Israeli hostage, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The 21-year-old soldier is the last living hostage with US nationality held in the territory. This announcement follows direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official in Qatar, focused on securing a truce and facilitating humanitarian aid. A senior Palestinian official stated the release is a goodwill gesture before President Trump's arrival in the Middle East, requiring a temporary halt to Israeli military activity during the handover. Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's 2023 attack, 59 remain, with up to 24 believed to be alive.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced that Edan Alexander, the last living U.S. citizen kidnapped during the October 7, 2023 attack, will be released as part of ongoing mediation efforts for a ceasefire.

Prime Minister Netanyahu's office stated that the U.S. informed Israel that this move is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of other hostages under the Witkoff outline. Alexander, a 20-year-old Israeli-American soldier, was abducted from a military base near the Gaza border.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from a European plan that insisted on a cease-fire first. The leaders of France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Poland had set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a 30-day cease-fire or face additional sanctions. President Putin countered with an offer of direct talks, which France and Germany rejected, while Trump supported the Russian proposal, prompting Zelensky to state he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey. The article indicates a shift in diplomatic strategies and potential tensions between Western allies regarding the approach to resolving the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly prepared to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 as a gift from Qatar's royal family, stirring accusations of bribery and corruption. Qatar acknowledged discussions with the U.S. about a potential transfer of a plane for Trump's temporary use as Air Force One, but denied that a final decision had been made or that it was a gift. The plane would be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation after his second term. Legal experts within the Trump administration have reportedly concluded that accepting the gift is permissible, as it is not conditioned on any official act.</p>

          <p>President Trump introduced the Special Education Simplified Funding Program as part of his 2026 budget proposal, raising concerns about the education of students with disabilities. The proposed budget aims to limit federal oversight and provide states with greater flexibility in using Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding. Parents fear reduced oversight could lead to segregated classrooms and diminished learning opportunities for students with disabilities.

          <p>Prince Harry's recent emotional plea for reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, has resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family. This has detracted from King Charles's public schedule, which included marking the 80th anniversary of V-E Day and preparing for a trip to Canada. The king's reign is shaping up as one of managing a messy brood, and some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal the rift with Harry, it could undermine his messages of tolerance and inclusiveness. The palace has pushed back on Harry's contention that his father could have done more to spare him the loss of automatic, publicly funded police protection when he visits Britain.</p>

The plane will be retrofitted with security features and modifications by the Defense Department. The plan involves the plane being donated to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office. A Qatari official stated that the transfer is being considered between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, but no decision has been made.</p>
