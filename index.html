          <p>Walmart is recalling approximately 850,000 Ozark Trail stainless steel water bottles following reports of serious injuries, including two cases of permanent vision loss. The bottle's lid can eject forcefully upon opening, creating significant impact and laceration risks for users, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The federal agency has advised consumers to stop using the product immediately and contact Walmart for a full refund. The recalled bottles were sold exclusively at Walmart stores and online for about $15.</p>

          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, a market currently dominated by its rival, Waymo. This expansion follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, which has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny from federal safety agencies. While Tesla aims to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space using a camera-based system, Alphabet's Waymo has been operating a public driverless service in the Phoenix area since 2020. A decision on Tesla's Arizona application is expected by the end of July.</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official testified that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March and is now back in the U.S. facing human trafficking charges, though a magistrate judge ordered his release. A federal judge expressed frustration over the government's lack of a clear plan, fearing he could be "spirited away" without due process. The case highlights significant procedural and humanitarian complexities within the U.S. immigration system.</p>

          <p>The premier of Manitoba, Wab Kinew, has accused a group of U.S. lawmakers of "trying to trivialize" a deadly situation after they complained that smoke from Canadian wildfires was disrupting American summer activities. Kinew highlighted that his province has declared a state of emergency, has lost lives, and is evacuating communities, while praising the efforts of American firefighters assisting in Canada. With over 100 active wildfires in Manitoba, the premier contrasted the seriousness of the crisis with the lawmakers' letter, which he characterized as political posturing.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and recent Columbia graduate student, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration, alleging false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. Khalil was arrested and detained for 104 days in what his lawyers describe as an effort to suppress his pro-Palestinian activism, despite him not being charged with a crime. The claim states he was targeted for his beliefs, while the Department of Homeland Security called the lawsuit "absurd." A federal judge ultimately ordered Khalil's release, finding the government's case was likely unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent announcement that the FBI found no "client list" among Jeffrey Epstein's files has caused a significant rift within the MAGA movement.

This reversal has forced longtime loyalists to either question the administration or invent new conspiracy theories to explain the situation.

          <p>Denim maker Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter results. The company now anticipates revenue growth of 1% to 2%, a significant improvement from its previous forecast, driven by strong consumer demand and growth in direct-to-consumer sales. Levi's stated it is working to absorb some of the costs from higher tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently affect a small portion of its manufacturing. However, the company acknowledged this could change as U.S. trade policy evolves with key manufacturing regions.</p>

          <p>An NPR report provides a harrowing first-person account of the dangers of securing food in Gaza, as told by local journalist Anas Baba. With Israel tightly restricting aid, many Gazans rely on new distribution sites run by private contractors under Israeli military protection, which have become deadly locations. The article details Baba's own perilous journey to one of these sites, highlighting the constant threat of violence faced by civilians simply trying to survive. The story underscores the severe humanitarian crisis and the failure of the current aid system to safely provide for the population.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials have discovered that a landmark criminal justice reform, Measure J, was accidentally repealed due to an administrative error. Measure J, passed in 2020, dedicates hundreds of millions of dollars to alternatives to incarceration. The mistake occurred when the county failed to codify Measure J into the charter, so when voters approved a separate government overhaul, Measure G, in 2024, they unwittingly nullified the earlier initiative. The blunder has shocked and angered advocates, who worry about the future funding for crucial social services and jail diversion programs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced an end to the universal requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints. The policy, in place for over two decades since the 2001 Richard Reid shoe-bomb attempt, had become a symbol of "security theater" for many. While the change is presented as a populist move that grants a convenience previously reserved for premium travelers, it was announced without a specific technological or intelligence breakthrough as justification.

          <p>A San Francisco judge has ruled that former CNN anchor Don Lemon's lawsuit against Elon Musk and his social media company, X, can proceed to trial. Lemon sued for breach of contract after X abruptly canceled a planned show partnership just hours after he conducted a tense interview with Musk. The judge found that Lemon's legal team had plausibly alleged claims including "fraud by false promise" and the existence of an implied contract. The case centers on Musk's actions following an interview where he was questioned on contentious topics and content moderation on the platform.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government is formulating a response to President Trump's surprise decision to impose a 50% duty on all Brazilian exports, effective August 1. Trump justified the tariffs by citing "unfair trade barriers" and the alleged political "persecution" of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Officials in Brazil are wary of direct retaliation that could harm their own industries, which rely on U.S. parts. Instead, they are considering measures like suspending U.S. patents or taxing profits, while analysts predict the move will push Brazil into a closer economic relationship with China.</p>
