            <h2>Trump's Trade Goals Face Uncertainty Amid Tariff Adjustments</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 00:01:05 EDT</div>

            <p>President Trump's initial plan for widespread tariffs faced significant adjustments this week, including a pause on higher tariffs for most countries while intensifying trade disputes with China. The administration claims numerous world leaders have offered trade concessions, leading to negotiations with countries like South Korea and Japan. However, the on-again, off-again nature of tariff moves creates instability for businesses, potentially delaying reshoring efforts and major investment decisions. Trump's approach to China carries enormous risk and may alienate allies, despite aiming to generate revenue and lower consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he is held in a prison. The court clarified that while the government must facilitate his release and ensure his case is handled properly, the extent to which they must "effectuate" his return needs clarification. This ruling follows the administration's acknowledgement that his deportation was an "administrative error", though they also allege gang affiliation, which Garcia denies. The case raises questions about executive power and due process.</p>

            <p>The RSPB reports a decline in starling sightings in UK gardens, with the lowest numbers recorded since the Big Garden Birdwatch survey began in 1979. Starlings, known for their murmurations, are among the UK's fastest disappearing birds. The RSPB recommends actions like avoiding pesticides and putting up nest boxes to support starlings and other garden wildlife. The survey, involving nearly 600,000 people, highlights the need for government and business involvement in restoring the natural world.</p>

            <p>Will Poulter and Kit Connor, part of the cast for Alex Garland's film Warfare, bonded through shared experiences like head-shaving and tattoos. The cast participated in a three-week military bootcamp to prepare for their roles as US soldiers in Iraq. Connor plays a young recruit and says the decision to get a shared tattoo with his castmates after filming wrapped was a "no-brainer." The movie is based on a real-life mission and is dedicated to a former Navy Seal who suffered memory loss.</p>

            <p>A general strike against public spending cuts in Argentina has severely disrupted transport, with cancelled domestic flights and suspended train and metro services. The strike, the third since President Javier Milei took office, protests tough austerity measures implemented to tackle hyperinflation. Unions argue that the cuts have disproportionately affected the most vulnerable, including pensioners and low-paid workers. Milei's plan has reduced inflation but also led to widespread suffering, according to protesters.</p>

The probationary employees, many of whom performed important roles at the climate research agency, had previously been rehired and put on administrative leave. The firings are part of a sweeping move by the Trump administration targeting workers in probationary status.

Former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen criticized Trump's economic policies as a "self-inflicted wound." The EU's announcement to suspend retaliatory tariffs and positive inflation data failed to boost investor confidence.</p>
