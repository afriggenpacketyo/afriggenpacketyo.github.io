        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into Bitcoin ETFs for the year. This rally was also supported by significant inflows into Ether ETFs and a wave of short liquidations totaling over $550 million. The market's momentum is attributed to institutional investment and expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy, with analysts suggesting only a major macroeconomic event could suppress the current upward trend. For the week, Bitcoin is poised for a nearly 10% gain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump toured Central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that have killed at least 121 people, offering condolences and support from the nation. The visit comes as local and federal officials face questions about the adequacy and timing of their response to the disaster, particularly regarding warnings for residents. Unlike in past disasters, Trump has refrained from criticizing local officials, instead emphasizing collaboration with Texas Governor Greg Abbott and pushing back on criticism of his administration's cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <p>During a Mets-Orioles game, broadcaster and former player Keith Hernandez had a close call when a foul ball flew directly past his head in the SNY booth, an event he was completely oblivious to until after it happened. A replay showed Hernandez looking down and only reacting to the sound of the ball hitting the wall behind him, much to the amusement of his fellow commentators. Play-by-play announcer Gary Cohen humorously noted that Hernandez, a renowned defensive player in his day, could have been seriously injured had the ball been slightly more on target.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state, which alleges the company intentionally uses addictive design features to exploit young users. The state's Attorney General argues that these features are meant to maximize engagement for advertising and e-commerce purposes, putting children at risk. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states against tech companies, focusing on harmful design rather than user-generated content. The ruling arrives as TikTok's future in the U.S. remains uncertain, pending a potential sale mandated by federal law.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the previous month's $316 billion deficit.

Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit still stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month, second only to Social Security spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that FBI Director Kash Patel and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard are conducting politically motivated internal investigations that threaten national security. Gabbard is reportedly using AI to scan agency communications for signs of dissent against the administration's agenda, while Patel is allegedly using polygraph tests to identify staff who have spoken negatively about him personally. The author contends that these actions resemble authoritarian tactics, creating a climate of fear and diverting critical resources from countering genuine threats like foreign espionage and terrorism.</p>

          <p>Chemical manufacturer DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit concerning PFOA contamination of the water supply in Hoosick Falls, New York. This agreement, which awaits judicial approval, brings the total recovery for residents to over $90 million, following earlier settlements with three other companies. The lawsuit claimed that a local facility using DuPont's Teflon materials contaminated drinking water with the harmful "forever chemical."

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting it to ask some recently laid-off grants management staff to return to work temporarily. Officials blame new bureaucratic hurdles implemented by the Trump administration for stalling the process, which has delayed funding for critical programs including services for unaccompanied migrant children and youth homelessness. With the fiscal year-end deadline approaching, there are concerns that the department may need to rush reviews or shrink application windows, potentially compromising the grant award process.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the current, highly popular season of 'Love Island USA' serves as a portrait of Gen Z's dating habits, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of deep romantic connections. Despite its high viewership, the season has been dubbed "Situationship Island" by fans, as contestants seem to avoid vulnerability and deep commitment. The author suggests this reflects a generation that grew up online, has less real-world relationship experience, and is anxious about appearing overeager. However, the immense popularity of contestants who do show genuine emotion indicates viewers may still crave authentic connection.</p>
