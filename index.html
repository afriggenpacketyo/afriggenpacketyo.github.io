          <p>President Trump asserted in an interview that he has secured 200 tariff deals and spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though Chinese officials dispute this. Trump highlighted his administration's deportation policies and reiterated his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, blaming Ukraine's NATO aspirations for the conflict. He expressed optimism about reaching a peace deal, suggesting Russia would retain Crimea, while also claiming his earlier remarks about ending the war on Day 1 were figurative. Trump also addressed the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member, stating it wouldn't bother him if Garcia received due process.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian general, Yaroslav Moskalik, was killed by a car bomb just outside Moscow, prompting a murder investigation. Russian authorities have accused Ukraine of involvement in the bombing, which occurred as a U.S. envoy was expected to meet with Putin to discuss a peace plan for Ukraine. Moskalik was deputy head of the main operational directorate of the military's General Staff and previously involved in "Normandy format" talks on Ukraine. The bombing is similar to previous attacks on Russians linked to the military offensive in Ukraine, with Kyiv claiming responsibility in some past cases.</p>

Upskirting, which involves taking pictures under someone's clothes without their permission, became a criminal offense in 2019.</p>

          <p>President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates may not translate into lower borrowing costs for consumers. Economists suggest that Trump's attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and tariff policies could keep long-term rates higher. A less independent Fed could lead to higher borrowing costs as investors worry about future inflation. While the Fed typically cuts short-term rates during economic downturns, long-term rates are largely determined by market forces, making it unclear if the Fed can fully counteract the effects of Trump's policies.

          <p>Alphabet anticipates a 'slight headwind' to its advertising business due to President Trump's trade policies, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region. The company's executives acknowledged concerns about how tariffs will affect the economy and business spending. Retail, a significant contributor to Google's ad revenue, is expected to be impacted by changes to the de minimis exemption, with Chinese e-commerce apps like Temu and Shein reducing spending. Despite the potential challenges, Alphabet plans to maintain its focus on efficiency and productivity.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on an apartment building in Ukraine killed three people, including a child, a day after President Trump rebuked Russia's leader for a deadly attack on Kyiv. The Russian attack drew criticism from Trump, who has been attempting to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Russia launched 103 drones at five Ukrainian regions overnight, causing damage to civilian infrastructure. Despite ongoing negotiations, Western European leaders accuse Putin of stalling and seeking to seize more Ukrainian territory.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's new film, Sinners, had a successful opening weekend, topping the box office and marking the highest opening gross for an original feature since the pandemic.

This skeptical framing has raised eyebrows, with some questioning why the film's potential for failure is emphasized over its concrete achievements. The debate highlights a trend of scrutinizing movie financials over celebrating creative success.</p>
