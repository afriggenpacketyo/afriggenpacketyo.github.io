          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate commutation of former Congressman George Santos's seven-year federal prison sentence, citing the former lawmaker's alleged mistreatment in solitary confinement. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, had publicly appealed to Trump from prison, emphasizing his consistent Republican voting record during his brief congressional tenure and claiming isolation due to a death threat. This clemency, which the U.S. Attorney’s Office declined to comment on, allows Santos to be released just months into his maximum sentence, despite the judge's view that he showed little remorse. The decision marks another high-profile act of clemency by Trump for a former Republican political figure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, escalating a conflict with Democratic-led cities. This emergency application by the Justice Department follows a federal appeals court's decision to uphold a lower court ruling that blocked the deployment in Illinois. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that blocking the National Guard deployment infringes on presidential authority and endangers federal personnel. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, however, condemned the move as un-American and a dangerous path for democracy, accusing Trump of overstepping his authority to intimidate political rivals in "blue" cities.</p>

          <p>Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, key negotiators for President Trump in the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, expressed feeling "a little bit betrayed" by Israeli airstrikes on Qatar during last month's peace talks. Witkoff learned of the strike, which Israel said targeted Hamas leadership, the morning after it occurred, noting it impeded negotiations by eroding Qatari confidence, who served as a crucial link to Hamas. Trump reportedly felt Israel was acting "out of control," believing their actions were not in their long-term interests. Despite the setback, Israel and Hamas ultimately agreed to a deal, leading to the release of 20 living hostages and the handover of remains.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto, directing her to withdraw a request to lift a federal judge’s order preventing LAPD from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons. The council's unanimous vote came ahead of "No Kings" demonstrations against the Trump administration, where journalists had previously reported excessive force. Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez emphasized that journalism is "under attack" and Los Angeles should not contribute to undermining court-ordered protections. This article highlights growing council frustration with the city attorney's office over legal costs and proactive litigation without council direction, questioning whose interests the office truly represents.</p>

          <p>A viral phrase, "6-7," originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," is causing widespread disruption in classrooms as kids and teens shout it out. Skrilla stated he never intended a specific meaning, allowing the phrase to become a positive and fun, yet often distracting, phenomenon. Some schools have banned it, while others, like Giano Intermediate, try to manage it by letting students release their energy or by joining in. Experts note the trend's longevity is unusual, amplified by social media and teachers' reactions, making it a generational "secret code" that kids enjoy.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has indicted former National Security Adviser John Bolton on 18 counts related to systematically sharing classified information with unauthorized individuals while writing a tell-all book. Prosecutors allege Bolton used a group chat, including his wife and daughter, to transmit over 1,000 pages of classified material, some describing high-level foreign policy discussions. While Bolton argues political retribution, career prosecutors reportedly consider the case "righteous," distinguishing it from other perceived politically motivated charges against Trump's adversaries.

The trial, involving 25,000 adults, identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with more than half detected at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by identifying fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood and correctly pinpointed the cancer's origin in 9 out of 10 cases.

          <p>Northampton Saints secured a comfortable 36-19 victory over Newcastle Red Bulls, propelling them to the top of the Prem table and extending Newcastle's winless streak. Despite playing a man down for half an hour due to JJ van der Mescht's two sin-bins, Saints demonstrated superior form with a five-try bonus point win, taking them ahead of reigning champions Bath. Newcastle showed resilience, closing the gap twice, but ultimately couldn't capitalize on their numerical advantage, a lasting frustration for Alan Dickens' side. Northampton's director of rugby, Phil Dowson, acknowledged discipline issues but praised the team's ability to recover and maintain their unbeaten record in the league.</p>

          <p>Comedians Kumail Nanjiani and Ilana Glazer canceled their performances at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference after CEO Marc Benioff's controversial remarks supporting President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to San Francisco. Benioff later apologized and retracted his comments, stating he no longer believes such deployment is necessary. Both comedians have previously criticized Trump and his anti-immigrant rhetoric, suggesting their withdrawal was a direct response to Benioff's stance, despite a company source citing Nanjiani's illness. The incident highlights the growing backlash against Benioff, which overshadowed the tech conference and led to a prominent venture capitalist resigning from the Salesforce Foundation board.</p>

          <p>Hamas has transferred the remains of another deceased Israeli hostage to the Red Cross, the Israel Defense Forces announced, with the body en route for identification. This follows Hamas's earlier statement that it had handed over all recoverable remains and that extensive efforts were needed for the rest. The peace plan required Hamas to return all 20 living and 28 deceased hostages by October 13. While all living hostages were returned, the remains of at least 18 deceased hostages are still unaccounted for. U.S. advisers are urging patience, sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas, and noting the immense destruction in Gaza complicates recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested President Trump declare a major disaster in the state's southwest after Typhoon Halong displaced 1,500 people and caused extensive damage to remote Native communities. The storm brought fierce winds, rain, and record-breaking storm surges, destroying homes and rendering utilities inoperable. Senators and a congressman urged federal approval, stating the disaster's scale surpassed state response capabilities, necessitating aid for housing and utilities before winter. The article also highlights previous Trump administration cuts to grants for disaster preparedness in these vulnerable Indigenous villages, raising concerns about long-term resilience.</p>

          <p>Boeing has received FAA approval to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, a significant milestone nearly two years after a midair near-catastrophe led to production caps. The FAA had restricted Boeing to 38 planes monthly after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines flight due to uninstalled bolts. This increase signals the FAA's growing confidence in Boeing's production safety and quality, following extensive reviews. The move is crucial for Boeing's turnaround after years of issues, including two fatal crashes, supply chain problems, and a labor strike, as the company aims to balance inventory with its supply chain.</p>

Over 290,000 vehicles, including certain F-Series Super Duty trucks, are affected by a camera system malfunction that hinders rearview visibility. An additional 115,539 Super Duty trucks face a potential loss of steering control due to a faulty steering column shaft. Furthermore, 332,778 Mustang models are being recalled for corroded seatbelt cables that could prevent proper restraint. Dealers will perform necessary inspections and repairs free of charge for these defects.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing architectural projects, including a $250 million privately financed White House ballroom and a proposed arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial, to cement his legacy. The ballroom, funded by donors, has already hosted an exclusive dinner for contributors, with discussions about etching their names in stone. Democrats, particularly California Rep. Mark Takano, are bristling at these efforts, introducing bills to ban donor names on White House structures and prohibit federally funded construction during shutdowns, arguing it distracts from critical issues like healthcare. Trump views these projects as a respite from weighty matters, such as foreign policy.</p>

The article highlights this development as a positive step in diplomatic relations, following a period of "shock tactics" and trade disputes.

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed interest in a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, calling it "interesting" and stating he would consider it. The idea, pitched by Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, suggests a "70-mile link symbolizing unity" with an estimated cost potentially reduced by Boring Company technology. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, reacted negatively to the concept. The article notes the project's significant challenges, including extreme temperatures, lack of infrastructure, frequent earthquakes, and The Boring Company's limited experience in such conditions, alongside its past regulatory issues.</p>

          <p>CBS News is ending its over 60-year presence at the Pentagon after declining to sign new press requirements that journalists' associations argue could infringe on First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's memo mandated formal authorization for publishing classified or "controlled unclassified information," even if unclassified. CBS News chief national security correspondent David Martin, who covered the Pentagon for 40 years, emphasized the importance of in-person relationships for breaking stories. The article highlights concerns from lawmakers about selective use of the Justice Department against adversaries and the impact on public understanding of military affairs, with most major news organizations also refusing the new restrictions.</p>
