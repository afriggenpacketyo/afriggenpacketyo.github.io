        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 100 U.S. colleges and universities, including Ivy League institutions, have jointly denounced President Trump's "political interference" in higher education. This action follows Harvard University's lawsuit against the administration over funding freezes and demands for policy changes, including audits for "viewpoint diversity." The universities assert their commitment to academic freedom and oppose government overreach that threatens research funding and the exchange of ideas. They emphasize the importance of higher education in sustaining democracy and call for constructive engagement to improve educational institutions. The administration claims its actions are a reaction to uncontrolled "antisemitism" and the desire to reverse diversity programs aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that tariffs could be imposed on various countries if deals are not reached within the next few weeks. While maintaining daily contact with China to negotiate a trade agreement, Trump remained vague about progress.

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily decreased during his initial months in office, according to a New York Times polling average. His approval has fallen to approximately 45 percent, a drop from 52 percent shortly after assuming office, with about half the country disapproving of his performance. While presidential approval typically declines over time, Trump's has decreased more rapidly than some predecessors. This trend reflects shifting public sentiment and potential challenges for the administration in maintaining support throughout his term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report reveals that almost half of U.S. residents live in areas with unhealthy air pollution levels, receiving an "F" grade for smog and soot. Despite overall improvements since the Clean Air Act, air pollution has been increasing in recent years, partly due to climate change-related factors like wildfires and extreme heat. The report highlights the shift of poor air quality from western to central and eastern states. While EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claims deregulation will drive down costs, the American Lung Association warns of adverse health impacts and risks to progress made over decades. The American Lung Association's report noted that Black people are more like to suffer the serious health effects of air pollution due to the long history of systemic racism in the U.S., including segregation and decision-makers finding it easier to place sources of pollution such as power plants, industrial facilities, landfills and highways in economically disadvantaged communities of color.</p>

          <p>A climate activist spray-painted "USA" over a presidential plaque inside Trump Tower in New York City, protesting against environmental destruction for profit. Nathaniel Smith, 36, was arrested for the vandalism, which followed similar actions by environmental groups, including the defacement of the Wall Street Charging Bull and a Tesla showroom. The activist group Extinction Rebellion appeared to be behind the incidents, known for disrupting public spaces and defacing buildings to raise awareness about climate change. These acts of protest highlight growing tensions between environmental activists and perceived corporate or political inaction on climate issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control over Crimea, claiming it hinders peace negotiations. Trump asserts a deal to end the war was "very close" but Zelenskyy's stance prolongs the conflict. This comes as the U.S. administration proposes a deal that would freeze territorial lines, potentially requiring Ukraine to cede some territory. Meanwhile, Russia intensified attacks on Ukraine following a brief lull, and international talks aimed at securing a ceasefire face complications with key officials pulling out. The administration has yet to publicly offer specifics about what geographic concessions would have to be made.</p>

          <p>South Korea's quarterly GDP contracted for the first time in four years, primarily due to a significant drop in construction activity. The contraction missed expectations and reversed the growth seen in the previous quarter.

With South Korea heading to the polls for a new presidential election, the economic outlook remains uncertain amidst global trade tensions and domestic political instability.</p>

          <p>Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap beneath Yellowstone National Park, which appears to play a critical role in preventing a massive volcanic eruption. The magma cap, located about 2.4 miles below the Earth's surface, traps pressure and heat, acting as a lid on the volcanic system. The discovery suggests that the magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone is actively releasing gas but remains in a stable state. While an eruption is unlikely to be imminent, this finding provides clues to future volcanic activity within the extensive Yellowstone system.</p>

          <p>A group of twelve states, primarily led by Democrats, have filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging the legality of his tariff policies. The states argue that only Congress has the authority to legislate tariffs and that the administration's actions are unlawful. The lawsuit contends that the tariffs are based on the president's whims rather than lawful authority. This legal challenge adds to the mounting opposition against the administration's trade policies.</p>

          <p>International tourism to the United States has decreased, while Americans are increasingly traveling overseas. Factors contributing to this trend include trade war tensions, detentions of visitors, and President Trump's rhetoric. The decline in foreign visitors could negatively impact the U.S. economy, with JPMorgan warning of a potential reduction in GDP. Meanwhile, American consumers' appetite for international trips is helping to offset some of the losses, particularly in high-end leisure travel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to downsize USAID have resulted in significant job losses across the United States, affecting nearly 20,000 employees. These cuts have impacted communities outside of Washington, D.C., leading to economic hardship and uncertainty for many workers. The loss of USAID funding has forced companies and organizations to shutter programs and lay off staff.

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders targeting universities, aiming to reshape higher-education institutions and crack down on diversity and inclusion efforts. The actions address foreign gifts to universities and college accreditation, with the administration alleging that accreditors have relied on "woke ideology" rather than merit. These orders are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to challenge and alter universities it claims have been taken over by "Marxist maniacs and lunatics." Despite his condemnation of diversity and inclusion efforts, Trump also signed an order establishing a White House initiative on historically black colleges and universities.</p>
