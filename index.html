          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra abruptly departed Thailand, reportedly for medical reasons, just hours before a critical parliamentary vote to select the nation's next leader. His departure precedes an impending Supreme Court ruling that could lead to his imprisonment, stemming from a 2006 coup and subsequent corruption charges, and occurs shortly after his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was removed from her prime ministerial role over an ethics violation. This significant political upheaval has positioned construction magnate Anutin Charnvirakul as a leading contender for the premiership, underscoring the persistent and complex instability within Thailand's political landscape.

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is vigorously pursuing the nation's copper potential, aiming to capitalize on soaring global demand driven by electrification and renewable energy initiatives. His administration has implemented the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), a scheme designed to provide generous tax, trade, and foreign exchange benefits for major investors over a 30-year period. Companies like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto are already committing substantial capital, with copper projects alone estimated at $16 billion seeking RIGI entry. This article underscores Argentina's strategic pivot to mining as a cornerstone of its economic revitalization efforts, despite the country's history of economic volatility.

          <p>The defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles secured a dramatic 24-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys in a season opener marked by significant events, including an hour-long lightning delay. Early in the game, Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, an action that could result in a hefty financial penalty. Despite this setback and numerous team penalties, Jalen Hurts contributed two rushing touchdowns, and the defense made a critical late-game stop.

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," reverting to a title used for much of its history until 1947. The White House states this change will serve as a "secondary title" and allow officials to use "Secretary of War." Trump believes the new name projects a stronger image of readiness and resolve. While the legality of changing the name without congressional assent is unclear, Trump expressed confidence in legislative support if needed. This article highlights the symbolic and historical implications of this proposed renaming.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic published a critical commentary on President Donald Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," labeling it "inanity" and "cringe." The article argues that the original name change in 1947 reflected a mature understanding of national security as an ongoing defense, not just discrete periods of war. It highlights that the current name was deemed appropriate by post-WWII leaders like Truman and Eisenhower, and is also used by major global powers including China and Russia. This article offers a strong dissenting perspective on the symbolic implications of the proposed renaming.</p>
