          <p>A dual German-American citizen, Joseph Neumeyer, appeared in federal court in Brooklyn after being deported from Israel, facing charges for allegedly planning to attack the U.S. Embassy branch office in Tel Aviv. Neumeyer reportedly posted threatening messages on Facebook, including intentions to burn down the embassy and expressing anti-American sentiments. According to the complaint, he spat on a guard outside the embassy while carrying a backpack containing Molotov cocktails before fleeing and being apprehended later at his hotel. His social media accounts also contained posts calling for the assassination of President Donald Trump, leading to his arrest and subsequent deportation to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Individuals and organizations aligned with Donald Trump are requesting elite law firms to fulfill their pro bono commitments made in exchange for being spared from executive orders that could have impacted their businesses. These firms, including Skadden, Kirkland & Ellis, and Paul Weiss, had collectively pledged nearly $1 billion in free legal work. Greta Van Susteren, a conservative media personality, publicly criticized Skadden for not fully assisting a veteran with a legal issue, highlighting the pressure these firms face to meet expectations. Some firms have received unusual requests, including help with rental leases and medical benefits, leading to internal discussions on how to manage these commitments while maintaining their autonomy and serving the public interest.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa intends to file a formal complaint with the Premier League after a controversial refereeing decision contributed to their 2-0 defeat against Manchester United, impacting their chances of Champions League qualification. During the match, Morgan Rogers appeared to score for Villa, but the referee disallowed the goal, deeming that the United goalkeeper had control of the ball, a decision replays suggested was incorrect. This disallowed goal occurred when the game was still scoreless and Villa were down to 10 men, and the subsequent United goals led to Villa missing Champions League qualification on goal difference. The club is specifically contesting the inexperience of the appointed referee for such a crucial match.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's budget bill, which recently passed the House, faces significant opposition in the Senate from conservative Republicans who are critical of its deficit spending measures. Senators Rand Paul and Ron Johnson have voiced concerns that the bill increases the federal debt despite cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. The bill also includes a provision that raises the cap on deductions for state and local taxes, which has further complicated its path through the Senate. These senators suggest they may block the bill unless significant changes are made to reduce spending and address the growing national debt.</p>

The strikes hit various regions, including those poorly protected by air defenses, leading to significant devastation and loss of life.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, asserting they have a "moral component" and will combat fraud. Johnson claims that those able to work but refusing to do so are "defrauding the system." An analysis indicates that 190,000 people in Louisiana could lose Medicaid under the new requirements. Johnson insists that the bill does not cut Medicaid but targets fraud, waste, and abuse, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. Critics argue the measures are harsh and will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal judges are reportedly considering establishing their own armed security force, shifting control from the Department of Justice, due to increasing concerns about safety and potential political interference from the Trump administration. This proposal arose during a meeting where judges expressed worries that the administration might compromise their security. The idea involves placing the U.S. Marshals Service under the direct authority of the Chief Justice, rather than the Attorney General. This discussion follows a rise in threats against judges, particularly after rulings against Trump's policies, with some judges experiencing swatting attacks and intimidation tactics.</p>

          <p>Cindy McCain, the head of the UN World Food Programme, stated that the current level of aid trucks entering Gaza is insufficient to address the territory's food insecurity crisis. She warned that 500,000 people in Gaza are at risk of famine due to the Israeli blockade. McCain disputed claims that Hamas is responsible for looting aid trucks, attributing it to desperate people seeking food. She emphasized the need for increased pressure on Israel to allow more aid to enter Gaza and prevent a humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail and facing potential deportation. Officer Leslie O'Neal pulled over Ximena Arias-Cristobal for a traffic violation, which was later dropped, but she was then taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to her immigration status. The arrest sparked criticism and calls for Arias-Cristobal's release, with many advocating for her to remain in the U.S. O'Neal's resignation letter cited a lack of support from the local police department in the face of widespread criticism.</p>

          <p>Rwanda's intervention in eastern Congo, highlighted by the M23 rebels' capture of Goma, has drawn international condemnation and comparisons to Vladimir Putin. Despite denials, Rwanda, led by President Paul Kagame, has been accused of supporting M23 and plundering Congo's resources. The recent actions may be linked to shifting power dynamics in the region, with Uganda gaining influence through infrastructure deals. While Rwanda has legitimate security concerns and M23 claims to fight discrimination against Congo's Tutsi minority, the Rwandan elite's hunger for Congo's minerals is a key factor.</p>

          <p>Despite pledges to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a major public financier of gas and oil projects, particularly LNG. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese institutions provided $93 billion for oil and gas projects, with $56 billion allocated to LNG development. This investment contradicts Japan's leadership in the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), which promotes cooperation on net-zero emissions. Critics argue that Japan's reliance on LNG as a "transitional fuel" and its promotion of carbon capture storage technology constitute greenwashing, as LNG can have higher emissions than coal.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach encourages parents to accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, and view "bad" behavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to manage their reactions, and create an environment where their child feels safe expressing their authentic self. The goal is to build emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations.</p>
