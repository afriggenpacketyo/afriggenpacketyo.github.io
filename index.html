          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates but revealed a substantial $1.1 billion impact from U.S. auto tariffs, which contributed to a significant stock price decline. The company affirmed its full-year guidance, stating it is working to mitigate at least 30% of the anticipated tariff costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives. CEO Mary Barra emphasized that adapting to new trade policies is essential for the company's long-term future, though ongoing uncertainty continues to weigh on investor sentiment.

          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham publicly called on the WNBA commissioner to increase player pay during ongoing contract negotiations between the league and the players' union. Her statement reflects a broader sentiment among players, many of whom have been vocal about their desire for better compensation and have used events like the All-Star game to protest. The Women’s National Basketball Players Association (WNBPA) is negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, with several prominent players calling the league's current proposals disrespectful and unacceptable.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the UN's culture and education agency, effective December 2026. The State Department cited the organization's promotion of "woke, divisive cultural and social causes" and its alleged anti-Israel bias as primary reasons for the departure. UNESCO's Director-General Audrey Azoulay called the decision regrettable but anticipated, noting that the agency has been diversifying its funding sources since the U.S. previously withdrew under Trump before rejoining under the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>The BBC has reported on harrowing allegations of a massacre at the National Hospital in Suweida, Syria, where staff and volunteers claim Syrian government forces killed numerous patients in their beds. Eyewitnesses, including a neurosurgeon, provided testimony and video evidence suggesting that troops entered the hospital during recent sectarian clashes and carried out the killings. These accounts paint a gruesome picture of atrocities in the conflict, with all sides accusing each other of committing war crimes in the heavily restricted region.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he will let Jerome Powell serve out his term as Federal Reserve chair, which ends in May 2026, stating that Powell "is going to be out pretty soon anyway." This comment suggests a de-escalation after weeks of relentless attacks on Powell for not cutting interest rates and floating the idea of firing him. While Trump continued his criticism, his willingness to wait out Powell's term could reduce uncertainty in financial markets and ease a potential legal and political battle over the Fed's independence.</p>
