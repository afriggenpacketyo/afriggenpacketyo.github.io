          <p>California's DMV is seeking public comment on proposed regulations for self-driving vehicles, ranging from robotaxis to driverless trucks, with the goal of enhancing public safety and fostering innovation. While Tesla has been promising self-driving technology, it has not yet obtained the necessary permits in California, unlike competitors like Waymo and Zoox. The proposed regulations are considered the nation's most comprehensive for autonomous vehicle operation, underscoring California's commitment to establishing a robust framework for the technology's testing and deployment. Tesla shares still climbed about 10% Friday, continuing to rebound from a recent plunge fueled by uncertainty around President Donald Trump's global tariff blitz.</p>

          <p>Recent British studies have found a correlation between exposure to air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter, and declining cognitive function in older adults. Researchers suggest that pollutants in the bloodstream may affect brain regions responsible for sensory information, language, memory, and emotions. London's low emission zones have shown promise in cutting pollution and improving health-related economic factors, saving millions annually in productivity costs. Experts emphasize the need to reverse this trend to protect brain health, as even the lowest exposures exceed World Health Organization guidelines.</p>

          <p>A New York Times/Siena College poll indicates that voters believe President Trump is overreaching with his efforts to expand executive power, expressing doubts about his agenda. Majorities of voters view the early months of his administration as "chaotic" and "scary," with many questioning his understanding of their daily lives. While his approval rating stands at 42 percent, voters express diminishing confidence in his handling of key issues such as the economy and immigration. This erosion of confidence poses a challenge as he approaches his 100th day in office.</p>

          <p>FBI agents arrested Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on obstruction charges for allegedly preventing the arrest of an undocumented immigrant during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse. Dugan is accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from the individual, who was later arrested after a foot chase. The arrest has sparked controversy, with Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin criticizing it as part of a concerning pattern of undermining courts and checks on presidential power. Dugan's arraignment is scheduled for May 15.</p>

          <p>The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has announced that it has run out of food aid in Gaza after a seven-week Israeli blockade, exacerbating an already dire humanitarian crisis.

The WFP urges all parties to prioritize civilian needs and allow immediate entry of aid, emphasizing that over 116,000 tonnes of food assistance are ready for delivery once borders reopen.

          <p>Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren are calling for an ethics investigation into President Trump's private dinner with holders of his meme coin, $TRUMP, suggesting it may constitute "pay to play" corruption. The Democratic senators sent a letter to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, asking for a probe to determine if President Trump violated federal ethics rules by offering exclusive access to top investors in his $TRUMP coin. The value of the coin surged after the announcement of the dinner, raising concerns about Trump's personal profit from political influence.</p>

          <p>With the US birth rate near a record low, the Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to incentivize Americans to have more children. However, experts caution that such incentives have had mixed success in other countries. They suggest that addressing long-standing economic issues like affordable day care and paid parental leave might be more effective. While President Trump supports policies to uplift American families, the effectiveness and feasibility of a baby bonus remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>Ethan Frisch, a former chef, transformed his New York apartment into a "spice warehouse" and co-founded Burlap & Barrel, a company that sources spices directly from small-scale farmers worldwide. The business model allows Burlap & Barrel to skip markups from brokers and pay farmers significantly more for their crops. The company has grown its annual gross revenue from roughly $100,000 in its first full year to nearly $8 million in 2024. Sourcing directly from farmers is the key.</p>

          <h2>Federal Workers Face Insurance Chaos After Being Fired, Rehired, and Fired Again</h2>

          <p>Some federal workers are finding themselves suddenly uninsured after being fired, rehired, and fired again. The Trump administration's "break first, ask questions later" approach to remaking the federal bureaucracy has brought a level of chaos to the government that workers like Waterfield have never seen anywhere, even in the private sector. Firings have been carried out with such haste that human resource departments have struggled to answer a basic question from those affected: Do we have health insurance?</p>
