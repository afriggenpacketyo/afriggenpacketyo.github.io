          <p>China's retail sales growth in April missed analyst expectations, increasing by only 5.1% year-on-year, signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite this, industrial output exceeded forecasts, growing by 6.1%, suggesting that U.S. tariffs have not had as severe an impact as anticipated. The National Bureau of Statistics cautioned about external uncertainties and the need to consolidate economic recovery. Automobile sales experienced a slowdown, while the real estate sector continued to struggle, with home prices declining further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The father of Guy Edward Bartkus, the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, says his son "changed" after moving to Twentynine Palms. The FBI believes Bartkus, who held anti-natalist beliefs, packed his car with explosives and intentionally targeted the clinic. Investigators are examining Bartkus' online posts to understand his motives, and his father recalls a childhood fascination with how things worked, including an accidental fire at their family home. Federal investigators are treating the incident as an international act of terrorism.</p>

          <p>The FBI identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the suspect in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, stating he had "nihilistic ideations" and targeted the clinic. The suspect stated in writings or recordings that he was against bringing people into the world against their will, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation. Bartkus, who is believed to be dead, was not on the FBI's radar prior to the attack, which is considered the largest bombing ever investigated in Southern California. The FBI is investigating whether he attempted to livestream the attack.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a deal, but train service will not resume until Tuesday. The three-day strike disrupted commutes for over 100,000 riders, and Governor Phil Murphy announced the agreement as fair and fiscally responsible. While specifics remain undisclosed, the deal involves work rule concessions to fund fair wages. NJ Transit needs 24 hours to prepare equipment and conduct safety checks before full service restarts.</p>

While the cancer cannot be cured, modern treatments can extend life by years. Doctors are likely to use hormone-blocking drugs, androgen blockers, and potentially chemotherapy or radiation.
