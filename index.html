          <p>Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz discussed new Medicaid work requirements, framing them as community engagement and a path out of poverty. Oz explained the administration's strategy to lower drug costs by combating "global freeloading" and pushing for most-favored-nation pricing. He also addressed the implementation of these changes, emphasizing the role of new technology like a mobile app to streamline verification for work and exemptions. The stated goal is to make the system more efficient while providing a "hand up" to beneficiaries. (not investment advice)</p>

Moynihan also discussed the long-term impact of technology and AI on the job market, noting it is a gradual transformation rather than a sudden disruption.

The victims include the bartender, Nancy Lauretta Kelly, and three patrons. Brown, a former U.S. Army soldier who lived next door to the bar, is considered armed and dangerous, with a multi-agency manhunt underway. Authorities believe the attack was targeted, as the suspect was likely familiar with the victims, and have offered a reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Proposes Compensation Scheme for Car Finance Mis-Selling</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with payouts expected to be less than £950 per deal. The plan follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively high commissions could be unfair. The FCA will consult on a scheme to address discretionary commission arrangements and unfairly high commissions on agreements dating back to 2007. The industry is expected to cover the full cost, estimated to be between £9 billion and £18 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer characterized recent trade discussions with China as positive, focusing on the flow of rare earth magnets and minerals. While an August 12 tariff deadline is under discussion, no firm commitments were detailed. Meanwhile, in Texas, the state House is set to consider new congressional maps advanced by Republicans, which could add five more GOP seats. The proposed maps, which passed a committee vote, have faced strong opposition from Democrats and will next move to the state Senate for consideration.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion, with the game hanging in the balance heading into the last day. Chasing a record 374 runs, England reached 339-6 before bad light and rain stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late surge from India's bowlers saw three quick wickets fall, reigniting the tourists' hopes. With just 35 runs needed and four wickets remaining, the outcome of both the match and the series remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham sharply criticized the federal government's new Medicaid plan, calling it impossible to implement and a bureaucratic burden for all involved. She argued that while the goal of a healthier America is valid, the proposed work requirements and funding shifts are misguided. The governor stated that the $50 billion rural health fund is a fraction of what is needed to prevent the closure of hundreds of rural hospitals nationwide.

          <p>A self-imposed summer deadline for a new US-Canada trade agreement has passed without a resolution, leaving a six-month tariff war in place. Despite recent "intense" negotiations, both nations have signaled that a quick, tariff-free deal is unlikely, with President Trump's criticism of Canada's stance on Palestine adding to the friction. While businesses seek certainty, Canadian negotiators are prioritizing a quality deal over a rushed one, buffered by the existing CUSMA/USMCA agreement which allows most exports to cross duty-free.

Experts connect this decline to multiple ongoing crises, including economic uncertainty, climate change, and inflation, which particularly affect the younger generation's decision to have children. While some women deliberately choose to be childless, research indicates a "fertility gap," as the average desired number of children is higher than the actual birth rate.

          <p>The U.S. auto market is facing a significant crisis, with a record number of subprime borrowers falling behind on their loan payments. As of early 2025, 6.6% of these borrowers were over 60 days delinquent, the highest rate since the 1990s. This situation stems from inflated car prices during the pandemic, followed by declining vehicle values and rising interest rates, leaving many owners with negative equity. The article suggests that upcoming tariffs could further strain the market, and advises consumers to budget carefully and consider refinancing to mitigate financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian officials have blamed a Ukrainian drone attack for a large fire at an oil depot near the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. According to the regional governor, debris from a drone struck a fuel tank, requiring a major firefighting response. The incident was part of a broader wave of overnight drone strikes that Russia claims Ukraine launched against several cities and installations. In retaliation, Russia conducted its own strikes, hitting a key bridge in the Ukrainian city of Kherson and causing casualties and damage in nearby Mykolaiv.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defensive end Micah Parsons' social media trade request as "negotiation talk." Jones stated he has no intention of trading Parsons, framing the public dispute as a normal part of high-stakes contract negotiations for a deal potentially worth nearly $200 million. The disagreement appears to stem from differing interpretations of springtime discussions, which Parsons did not consider formal negotiations. Despite the standoff, Parsons remains at training camp, and several teammates have publicly expressed their support for him.</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has provoked widespread anger by visiting and openly praying at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem. This action violates a long-standing "status quo" arrangement that permits non-Muslims to visit the holy site but not to pray there. The visit was condemned as an "unacceptable provocation" by Jordan, which is the custodian of the site, and as a crossing of "all red lines" by the Palestinian Authority. Israel's prime minister's office stated there has been no change in policy regarding the site.</p>

          <p>Actor Sydney Sweeney's 2024 Republican voter registration in Florida has been revealed amid public discussion of her new ad campaign for American Eagle. The campaign, which plays on the word "genes," drew criticism from some for being tone-deaf in the current political climate, while conservatives praised it for pushing back against "woke" advertising. The revelation of her party affiliation, which follows previous controversy over her family's political leanings, has added another layer to the debate. American Eagle has defended the campaign, stating it was always intended to be about the jeans.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone for the vessel. Footage aired by state broadcaster CCTV showed what looked like a successful launch from the carrier, which is a significant step before it officially enters service, expected later this year. Unlike China's previous two carriers, which use a ski-jump style ramp, the Fujian is equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults. This technology allows it to launch a wider variety of aircraft more rapidly and with heavier payloads.</p>

          <p>Recent public appearances by President Donald Trump, marked by rambling monologues and factual inaccuracies, have renewed questions about his mental fitness. Experts point to instances of him digressing into unrelated topics, such as a lengthy rant about windmills, and apparent confabulation, like a false story about his uncle and the Unabomber. While the White House dismisses these concerns, some mental health professionals suggest his behavior shows signs of cognitive decline compared to his earlier public persona. These observations have led to increased scrutiny of the 79-year-old president's capacity to govern effectively.</p>

The study ranked the 100 largest cities based on factors like unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income.

          <p>The UK government has stated it is working "at pace" to implement a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza for medical treatment in the UK. The initiative, which could be operational within weeks, reportedly aims to allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free medical care. This official government scheme follows a smaller, privately funded effort by Project Pure Hope that has already brought a few children to the UK. The move comes after a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticized the government for previously declining to support such an evacuation.</p>
