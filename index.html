          <h2>China Reveals Electromagnetic Catapult System on Fujian Aircraft Carrier</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has released footage showcasing the electromagnetic catapult system of the Fujian, China's most advanced aircraft carrier. The footage provides a glimpse of an unidentified aircraft launching from the carrier deck. However, the report suggests that due to the complexity of the electromagnetic launch system, the Fujian will require more extensive sea trials compared to China's other carriers. The adoption of this system allows carrier-based aircraft to take off with full fuel and ordnance, and could soon facilitate the deployment of fixed-wing early warning aircraft and drones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations, partly due to an air traffic controller shortage and recent equipment failures. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association reported that several controllers are on trauma leave following an incident where they lost communication with pilots, an event that lasted between 30 to 90 seconds. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has announced plans to modernize the air traffic control system to address these issues. In the meantime, the FAA is slowing the rate of arrivals to ensure safety, while experts note that staffing issues are expected to persist for several days due to the specialized certification required for Newark's airspace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data indicates that U.S. exports are declining across most ports, particularly impacting the agricultural sector with significant drops in exports of soybeans, corn, and beef, due to President Trump's trade tariffs. Ports like Portland and Tacoma have experienced substantial decreases in exports, while others such as Houston and Seattle have seen smaller declines. Simultaneously, U.S. imports are also falling, leading to concerns about lean retail inventories and potential supply disruptions. Some businesses are considering diversifying their manufacturing locations to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, while experts warn of potential job losses in the supply chain due to decreased cargo arrivals.</p>

While government sources deny a formal review of the winter fuel policy, some MPs believe reversing it would signal that the Prime Minister understands public concerns. There is also debate over welfare reforms, with some MPs fearing a loss of support from their base due to the Pip changes. Senior cabinet minister Pat McFadden will address MPs to discuss the election results and the party's strategic direction, amidst concerns about bleeding votes to progressive parties.</p>

          <p>A study reveals that the Haenyeo, women divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, have evolved unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep diving. These adaptations include a slower heart rate and genetic mutations that provide cold tolerance and lower blood pressure. The lower blood pressure mutations are believed to protect pregnant divers from complications related to high blood pressure during deep dives. Researchers hope to expand this research to other diving cultures, which could lead to new medical therapies for conditions like stroke.</p>

In contrast, Trump's economic policies are framed as a war, leading to market instability and consumer unease.

          <p>States are increasingly using taxes on hospitals and nursing homes to inflate Medicaid spending and draw additional matching funds from the federal government, a tactic now under scrutiny by congressional Republicans. This practice, which began in the 1980s, involves taxing providers and then returning the funds as higher Medicaid payments, effectively gaming the system. While legal, the maneuver allows states to create federal money out of thin air, leading to calls for reform. However, ending these taxes could significantly impact state Medicaid budgets, particularly in Republican-led states that heavily rely on this strategy.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles. However, the company warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact its profitability this year. Ferrari's CEO highlighted that the strong profitability was driven by product mix and continued demand for personalizations. The guidance for the year is subject to a potential 50 basis points reduction on profitability percentage margins due to the possible introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA.</p>

          <p>Daud Haider, a prominent Bangladesh poet, has died in Berlin after spending over five decades in exile due to a poem criticizing religion. The poem led to accusations of offending religious sentiments, resulting in his arrest and subsequent forced exile to Kolkata, India. He later moved to Berlin with the help of German author G√ºnter Grass, working for Deutsche Welle and writing around 30 books while in exile. Despite his long absence, Haider remained a revered figure in Bangladesh, although he never felt truly at home in Germany and identified as "stateless (Bangladesh)".</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that many voters are unhappy with the cuts, and former cabinet minister Louise Haigh has described the issue as "totemic" for voters.

To maximize savings, it is recommended to explore high-yield savings accounts and CDs, particularly from online banks and credit unions. (not investment advice)</p>
