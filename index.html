          <p>Despite the recent market rebound, some Wall Street analysts remain skeptical, pointing to economic data suggesting the ongoing trade war is taking a toll. Michael Mullaney of Boston Partners is holding cash, citing signals like dwindling shipping volumes and declining consumer spending. He believes the impact of trade tensions will persist, regardless of short-term signals from the White House. This cautious stance contrasts with the broader market enthusiasm driven by hopes of easing trade tensions, and time will tell whether this is another example of Wall Street skeptics getting clobbered when American markets shake off malaise and rebound.
