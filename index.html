            <p>A group of small U.S. businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, contesting the legality of his recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that Trump has overstepped his authority by claiming trade deficits constitute a national emergency, thus unlawfully usurping Congress's power to levy tariffs. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses, asserts that the tariffs are devastating small businesses and are not justified by any actual emergency. The suit seeks to invalidate the tariffs and reaffirm the principle of no taxation without representation.</p>

            <p>Apple's stock experienced a surge, leading to a market capitalization exceeding $3 trillion, after the Trump administration announced exemptions for phones, computers, and chips from new tariffs.

While analysts estimate a reduction in Apple's annualized tariff cost burden, uncertainty persists due to the potential for policy changes. President Trump indicated his willingness to help Apple, emphasizing his goal of achieving economic greatness for the country. (not investment advice)</p>
