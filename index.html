        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office reveals that President Trump's "megabill" would disproportionately benefit wealthy households while negatively impacting the poorest. The analysis projects that the poorest U.S. households would see a reduction of approximately $1,600 per year in resources, while the wealthiest 10% would gain about $12,000 annually. This assessment highlights the potential economic consequences of the bill, sparking debate about its fairness and impact on different income groups. The findings raise concerns about increasing income inequality under the proposed legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge stated that he will issue an order regarding California's challenge to the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles. California's Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta filed an emergency request to block the expansion of what they deemed an unlawful militarization of the city. The state argues that the deployment exceeds federal authority and infringes on state rights, while the federal government maintains the president's actions are justified to protect federal property and personnel. The judge is considering whether the president complied with Title 10 of the U.S. Code, focusing on the legality of federalizing the National Guard.</p>

While the U.S. continues to pursue a diplomatic deal with Tehran, Israel is reportedly considering military action, prompting the State Department to issue a security alert for Americans in the region. Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran have stalled over uranium enrichment, and the U.S. has begun partial evacuations of embassies in Baghdad, Bahrain, and Kuwait.

          <p>The Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles are a sign of increased enforcement efforts nationwide, targeting anyone deportable rather than solely those with criminal records. President Trump's chief advisor on border policy, Tom Homan, stated that these operations will continue, with ICE stepping up new strategies and tearing down precedent to meet White House demands. The administration is also appealing to the public to report undocumented individuals and is considering actions against employers who hire them. The expansive approach is drawing criticism from Democrats, who view it as retribution against California and a distraction from congressional Republicans' tax-and-spending bill.</p>

Economic problems with the venue were cited as the reason for the cancellation, with the new track league looking towards 2026 with new investors expected to be announced next week.
