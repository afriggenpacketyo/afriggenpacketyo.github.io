          <p>Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan has entered a not guilty plea to federal obstruction charges, which stem from allegations that she assisted a man in evading immigration authorities during a federal law enforcement operation at her courthouse. The charges arose after Dugan allegedly misdirected federal agents away from an illegal immigrant with a criminal court hearing. The judge's attorney has moved to dismiss the indictment, claiming absolute immunity from criminal prosecution due to her official capacity as a judge and asserting a violation of the Tenth Amendment. Dugan has been suspended from the bench pending the outcome of the trial. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Donald Trump's request to roll back injunctions blocking his executive order aimed at limiting U.S. citizenship to children born to lawful permanent residents. The case also addresses the legality of individual district court judges issuing nationwide injunctions against presidential policies. Arguments focused on whether the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause applies to anyone born in the U.S., regardless of parents' citizenship status. Justices expressed concerns about the potential for unlawful executive orders to remain in place for extended periods if nationwide injunctions are eliminated, while others questioned the chaos that could arise if the order is only blocked in some places but not others. </p>

          <p>Missouri lawmakers have passed a voter referendum that, if approved, would repeal protections for abortion rights and restore a near-total abortion ban in the state. The move comes just six months after Missouri voters approved an amendment enshrining the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution. The initiative will appear on the November 2026 ballot unless Gov. Mike Kehoe calls a special election sooner than that.

While there's a degree of political agreement that debanking is a problem, there's no easy consensus on what to do about it. The article notes that banks are generally permitted to eschew categories of customers deemed too risky, but accusations of politically motivated discrimination are also being made. The Trump administration is considering measures to address debanking, while some argue it's simply banks using their discretion to run a profitable business. </p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling 273,789 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs due to a poorly installed front brake line that may lead to reduced brake function. The affected vehicles may have a bent brake line that could contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, potentially causing a brake fluid leak. Ford is not aware of any accidents or injuries as a result of the faulty brake line. To fix the problem, Ford dealers will inspect the front brake line and, if needed, replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe, at no cost. </p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of the year, surpassing expectations, driven by strong spending on services. This growth rate is higher than that of other large economies in the G7. However, the positive outlook is tempered by the introduction of tariffs by the US, which could negatively impact UK exports. Despite a recent UK-US tariff deal, the full effects of the tariffs remain uncertain, leading economists to suggest that the current growth rate may be as good as it gets for the year. </p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, are closer to potential freedom after Gov. Gavin Newsom withdrew his request for a clemency investigation, streamlining the process for a parole board hearing. A judge recently resentenced the brothers to terms of 50 years to life, making them immediately eligible for parole under the stateâ€™s youthful offender law. At the hearings, a panel of commissioners could deem the brothers suitable for parole, but that would not be the end of the process. A 90-day review period would follow, and Newsom could still block their release. </p>
