        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilmar √Åbrego Garc√≠a, a 29-year-old from El Salvador, has been brought back to the United States to face prosecution on federal criminal charges after being mistakenly deported in March. He is accused of participating in a trafficking conspiracy to move undocumented migrants from Texas to other parts of the country. El Salvador agreed to release Mr. √Åbrego Garc√≠a after the U.S. presented it with an arrest warrant, according to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. His lawyer has called the charges "preposterous," while Bondi accuses √Åbrego Garc√≠a of trafficking weapons and narcotics into the U.S. for MS-13, though he was not charged with any related offenses. Optimism around this legal situation is low due to the severity of the charges.</p>

          <p>Pro wrestling legend Ric Flair revealed he is battling skin cancer for the second time in three years, reversing his previous denial of such reports. The 76-year-old Hall of Famer shared his diagnosis in an interview, stating he will undergo treatment soon, citing concerns for his privacy as the reason for his initial denial. Flair had previously addressed the rumors on social media, asserting he was cancer-free, and had also announced his split from his fifth wife, Wendy Barlow, in September, thanking her for her support during a health crisis in 2017. Despite the challenges, Flair's announcement reflects a proactive approach to his health.</p>

Yaxley-Lennon accused the restaurant of discriminatory behavior due to his political beliefs, but the restaurant chain maintained its decision was based on a duty of care to its staff. The incident has led to a boycott call and a temporary suspension of reviews on some Hawksmoor restaurants due to an influx of reviews not based on first-hand experiences.</p>

          <p>A professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, Rupa Marya, is suing the university, claiming it violated her freedom of speech rights by suspending her for online comments about Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. Marya, an expert in decolonial theory, was placed on leave in September 2024 after comments she made on X questioning the impacts of Zionism on healthcare. The university published a statement condemning such comments as a racist conspiracy theory, leading to Marya receiving threats and harassment. The lawsuit argues that Marya‚Äôs posts never impeded her duties and that her views were aimed at state policy, not any religious or ethnic group. The lawsuit comes amid ongoing debate about academic freedom on college campuses.</p>

The image focuses on Arsia Mons, which is twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa.

Dr. Freeman advises avoiding instant oatmeal due to its processed nature and added sugars. Oatmeal contains beta-glucan, a dietary fiber that helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels.

          <p>President Donald Trump is pushing for an upgraded Air Force One, potentially involving a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family, but the project's timeline and security requirements pose challenges. Integrating capabilities similar to the current Air Force One could lead to delays and cost overruns. To meet Trump's desire to utilize the new plane before his term ends, some security precautions may need to be omitted. The president's desire for a quick upgrade must be balanced with critical security considerations. There are many logistical concerns.</p>

Hardin had escaped by wearing a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement, according to officials. His recapture brings relief to the community and concludes an extensive search effort. The former police chief's escape and recapture underscore the importance of security measures in correctional facilities.</p>

His approach differs from Scholz, who was known for his tendency to keep the public in the dark about his plans.

          <p>Tesla has been facing massive challenges trying to get back on track after a disastrous first quarter, and those headwinds strengthened considerably this week after CEO Elon Musk had a public fallout with President Donald Trump. Ire from the Trump administration could influence everything from future regulation, investigations and government support for Tesla, to decisions on tariff exemptions the company has been seeking in order to purchase Chinese-made manufacturing equipment. In its first-quarter earnings report in April, Tesla refrained from promising growth this year and said it will "revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update." Tesla shares were badly underperforming the broader market before the Musk-Trump breakup. (not investment advice)</p>
