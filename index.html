          <p>The western United States faces significant flood risks this weekend due to monsoonal moisture, particularly in eastern New Mexico and western Texas, where rainfall rates could reach 1-2 inches per hour. Meanwhile, southern Florida continues to experience hot and stormy weather, with Miami having received over 10 inches of rain recently, though a slightly drier pattern is anticipated next week. The central and eastern parts of the country will see warmer temperatures, up to 10-15 degrees above normal for mid-September in the Mississippi Valley. Despite rising humidity, no heat alerts are currently in effect nationwide.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 people gathered in central London for a "Unite the Kingdom" rally organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, while a smaller counter-protest by anti-racism campaigners also took place. The Metropolitan Police deployed 1,000 officers, reporting "significant aggression" and officers being attacked with projectiles from Robinson's supporters. Elon Musk made a surprise video appearance, calling for a change of government. The demonstrations highlight ongoing debates in the UK over migration and political rhetoric, with police taking a firm stance against discriminatory behavior and hate crimes.</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, wife of the slain conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, delivered an emotional address, pledging to continue his political activism through his Turning Point USA organization. She thanked supporters, first responders, and President Donald Trump, who offered condolences and support. Kirk, a father of two young children, was shot and killed at Utah Valley University during a speaking event, an act described as a "political assassination." His widow emphasized that his movement would not die and her cries would "echo around the world like a battle cry."</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot at age 31 during a college event in what police call a targeted attack.

His organization, founded in 2012, played a key role in mobilizing young voters for Trump. Kirk's wife, Erika, has publicly vowed to amplify his mission following his death.</p>

          <h2>California Advances Bill Requiring Transparency from AI Companies on Catastrophic Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 11:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California's State Assembly has passed SB 53, a bill mandating transparency reports from developers of powerful "frontier" AI models, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature. The legislation aims to mitigate "catastrophic risks" from AI, defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. Companies generating over $500 million in revenue would need to publish safety reports and disclose critical safety incidents.

          <p>Los Angeles residents are expressing outrage over a large homeless encampment in Koreatown, which controversially features amenities like a tennis court and garden. City officials acknowledge the dysfunction, with slow progress in addressing the issue despite an "order to comply" issued to the property owner. This situation highlights the city's broader struggle with homelessness, impacting property values and raising safety concerns for homeowners and renters. Advocates emphasize the need for more affordable housing and resources, as short-term solutions prove insufficient for the over 45,000 unhoused individuals in Los Angeles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, has pledged to order the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he travels to New York and an international criminal court (ICC) warrant is issued. Mamdani alleges Netanyahu is a war criminal due to Israel's military campaign in Gaza, aiming to uphold international law. Legal experts, however, suggest such an arrest would be practically impossible and could lead to conflict with the federal government, as the U.S. does not recognize the ICC's authority. The comments are expected to spark strong reactions in the city, home to the world's second-largest Jewish population.</p>

The judge ruled that the attorney general lacked the authority to bring the Rico case without special permission from the governor, which was not obtained. This decision, three years after arrests, invalidates most of the indictment and highlights prosecutorial overreach and procedural negligence, including violations of attorney-client privilege.

          <p>As lip oils gain popularity for their glossy finish and hydrating properties, a doctor advises consumers to prioritize ingredients over brand names to ensure safety and prevent issues like hyperpigmentation. Dr. Rebecca Small explains that the thin skin on lips is highly susceptible to sun damage and irritation, which can be exacerbated by lip oils lacking SPF or containing irritants like fragrances. Some users, particularly women of color, have reported increased lip pigmentation. She recommends seeking lip oils with broad-spectrum SPF, linoleic acids, squalane, glycerin, and hyaluronic acid, while avoiding fragrances and oleic acids.</p>

          <p>UCLA football is in disarray, facing a potential winless season, with coach DeShaun Foster's leadership under intense scrutiny after a humiliating 35-10 defeat to New Mexico. The team exhibits a lack of discipline and poor performance, particularly in tackling and scoring, leaving Foster seemingly without solutions. Athletic Director Martin Jarmond is also heavily criticized for his decision to hire the inexperienced Foster and for his handling of the program. The Bruins remain the only Big Ten team without a win, signaling a dire need for significant changes to revive the struggling program.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox expressed profound dismay following Charlie Kirk's assassination, noting the alleged killer was a 22-year-old local, shattering the state's idealized image of peace. Cox, who had been promoting "Disagree Better" to improve political discourse, received a call from President Trump warning about the dangers of political violence. The event highlights a breach in Utah's perceived sanctuary from national strife, deeply impacting the community and challenging the state's identity. Cox fears the internet's radicalizing content is poisoning young minds, but clings to hope for a path forward through Utah's people.</p>

          <p>The future of a Montana animal shelter is uncertain after smoke from two pounds of methamphetamine, incinerated by the FBI, filled the building and hospitalized workers. The incident occurred because a fan meant to reverse air pressure was unavailable, drawing smoke into the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter in Billings. Fourteen workers were evacuated, and 75 animals were relocated, with staff experiencing headaches, sore throats, and dizziness. The FBI routinely uses the incinerator for drug burns, but shelter staff were unaware. The facility remains closed for contamination testing, raising questions about the safety of such operations within city limits.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across Los Angeles are drawing parallels to dark chapters in US immigration history, including the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Mexican Repatriation of the 1930s.

They emphasize the importance of remembering history as current events threaten to repeat these patterns.

          <p>The dictionary industry is confronting an existential crisis, with declining revenue and staff, despite a golden age for linguistic study and accessibility.

          <p>Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, his Republican allies are warning Americans to mourn him respectfully, initiating organized campaigns to target critics online. At least 15 individuals, including journalists and academic workers, have been fired or suspended for posts discussing Kirk's death, with some facing torrents of online abuse. Prominent figures like Laura Loomer and Clay Higgins are leading efforts to publicly shame critics, even proposing deportations or social media bans. This backlash contrasts with past instances where some of these same figures mocked victims of political violence, highlighting a contentious debate over appropriate public discourse. (Fox News)</p>

Downing Street's handling of the scandal, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's initial staunch defense of Mandelson, has drawn criticism and undermined his authority. Emails detailing Mandelson's association with Epstein, a convicted sex abuser, emerged despite two vetting processes failing to flag major issues.

He asserted that China's "strong control, and even grip, over Russia" could be broken by these powerful tariffs.
