          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The company announced that the discussions were terminated after JD.com indicated it would only proceed on a "materially revised set of terms." Sainsbury's concluded that accepting these new terms would not be in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, the supermarket group reaffirmed its forecast to deliver an underlying operating profit of around £1 billion for the 2025-2026 financial year.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has been crowned the new men's 100m world champion, ushering in a new chapter for Jamaican sprinting nine years after Usain Bolt's last global title. The 24-year-old delivered a personal best time of 9.77 seconds to win gold in Tokyo, leading a Jamaican one-two finish. Seville's victory is seen as a fulfillment of long-held potential after he narrowly missed a medal two years ago and faced disappointment at the Paris Olympics. The win signals a potential shift in dominance back to Jamaica after four consecutive world titles for the United States.</p>

          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a Espana, one of cycling's Grand Tours, was abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road, making it impossible for the race to continue safely. As a result of the cancellation, Jonas Vingegaard, who was leading the general classification, was officially declared the winner of the event. Protests against the Israel-Premier Tech team had occurred throughout the three-week race, causing disruptions and safety concerns for the riders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Chicago professor Robert Pape has described the current political climate in America as a watershed moment for an "era of violent populism." He points to a rising tide of political violence and a corresponding increase in public support for such actions on both the left and the right. Pape attributes this trend not to the internet, which he calls an accelerant, but to the fundamental social change of the U.S. transitioning from a white-majority to a white-minority democracy. He warns this dynamic will likely worsen over the next decade if left unaddressed.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is building a significant investment portfolio with his NFL earnings. Following a strategy to live off endorsement deals, he has reportedly invested millions from his salary into various tech startups and venture capital funds, including AI firm Anthropic and Elon Musk's Neuralink. Barkley's approach shifted from traditional index funds to more high-risk, high-reward startup investing after reading Peter Thiel's book "Zero to One." He views these investments as a way to create generational wealth, conscious of the relatively short career span of an NFL running back.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the Labour Party's deputy leadership, urging the party to remain united. In a speech, she warned against internal divisions, stating that they would only benefit political rivals like Nigel Farage. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role if elected. The contest is viewed by some as a reflection on the Prime Minister's leadership following recent high-profile resignations from his government.</p>

          <p>Actress Kathy Bates has pushed back against speculation that her 100-pound weight loss was solely due to the drug Ozempic. The 77-year-old Oscar winner stated that while the medication helped her lose the final 15 to 20 pounds, the majority of her weight loss was the result of years of hard work. Her motivation to get healthy came after a type 2 diabetes diagnosis, a condition that has seriously affected her family. Bates explained that she is still emotionally adjusting to her new body after shedding the weight she had carried for decades.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has maintained a perfect start to their Premier League title defense, thanks to a remarkable habit of scoring late winning goals, a phenomenon now being called "Arne Time." The team has won all four of its opening matches with decisive goals scored in the final minutes, including a 100th-minute winner against Newcastle. This trend of securing last-gasp victories has become a psychological weapon, creating anxiety for opponents as games enter stoppage time. While the need for late goals suggests the team is not yet at its peak, their resilience and winning mentality are proving formidable.</p>

The comment was made during a discussion about a recent fatal stabbing in North Carolina allegedly committed by a homeless man with schizophrenia. After a clip of his remarks circulated widely online, Kilmeade issued an apology on a subsequent broadcast, calling his statement "extremely callous." He acknowledged that many homeless people deserve empathy and that not all act like the perpetrator in the North Carolina case.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham asserts that the United States is in a dangerous place, suggesting that political violence historically erupts during periods of intense national debate over identity. He argues that conflicts over who qualifies as "an American" and who is included in the nation's founding principles are at the heart of the current turmoil. Meacham warns that when citizens lose the ability to engage in peaceful dissent and instead resort to violence, they are breaking faith with the American covenant. He calls on leaders to learn from history to navigate this perilous moment.</p>

          <p>Journalist James Fallows reflects on the recent wave of political violence in America, drawing parallels to the tumultuous 1960s. He warns that such cycles are far more damaging and self-reinforcing than many people realize and cautions against loose talk of civil war. Fallows argues that the most important lessons from past tragedies are to be wary of immediate reactions unless they are generous and to seek more real-world connections with others. He concludes by quoting Robert F. Kennedy's call to "tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world."</p>

          <p>Following a large march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that the nation's flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and violence.

Starmer emphasized that the flag represents the UK's diverse and tolerant society. The protest and a counter-protest drew a massive police presence, resulting in 24 arrests and injuries to 26 officers.</p>

          <p>A recent commentary critiques the American tipping culture, arguing that the new "no tax on tips" law further enables a flawed system rather than solving the underlying issue of inadequate wages. The author contends that instead of incentivizing tipping, the government should encourage employers to pay a living wage, similar to practices in many other countries. The article also questions the arbitrary list of professions eligible for the tax break, noting the exclusion of workers like postal carriers and teachers. The piece suggests that the current system places an unfair burden on consumers.</p>

          <p>A local official in Johnson County, Iowa, has publicly refused to comply with the governor's directive to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The official, Jon Green, condemned the killing but stated he would not bestow county honors upon a person he said dedicated his life to denigrating marginalized communities. The move drew a sharp rebuke from Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who called the decision disgraceful. The controversy highlights the deep political divisions in the country following the assassination.</p>
