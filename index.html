        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy registered zero growth in July, a slowdown from June's 0.4% expansion, intensifying the Bank of England's policy dilemma. This stagnation, concentrated in production output, comes as economists predict a broader economic slowdown in the latter half of 2025, driven by adjustments in trade and public sector spending. With inflation remaining high at 3.8%, the central bank faces pressure to balance monetary policy ahead of the Chancellor's fiscal plans in the Autumn Budget. Despite a recent rate cut in August, expectations are for rates to hold steady in September, with a potential cut in November now less certain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers, detained in a large-scale US immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia, have returned home, with their departure reportedly delayed by a White House directive. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung voiced strong concerns, warning that the incident could make companies hesitant about investing in the US and highlighting ongoing negotiations with Washington for new visa categories. Hyundai's chief executive also stated the raid would delay the factory's opening by several months. This event has strained US-South Korea relations, prompting calls for cooperation to repair alliance cracks amid sensitive trade talks.</p>

These specialized barges are equipped with four, six, and eight legs respectively, designed to extend to the seabed and lift the craft for stable landing operations. Featuring extended bridge decks and bow-fitted cable-stayed bridge towers, these vessels represent a significant upgrade in China's amphibious capabilities. This deployment enhances the military's capacity for complex landing scenarios and underscores its expanding naval power.</p>

          <p>UFC chief Dana White's contentious interaction with a reporter about his new boxing role and the Muhammad Ali Act largely overshadowed the press conference for the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford super-fight. White's efforts to amend the act, which critics argue could restrict fighters and create a monopoly, sparked a fiery response from him. Despite the media distraction, both boxers conveyed mutual respect and determination, with Alvarez acknowledging the 50-50 nature of the contest. The bout, set to be streamed globally on Netflix, signifies a new, albeit uncertain, chapter for the sport's promotion under White and Saudi backing.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox revealed that over 7,000 digital tips have been received in the ongoing manhunt for the killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the highest number since the Boston Marathon bombing.

New photos and video of a college-aged suspect have been released, and a high-powered rifle was recovered. Vice President JD Vance escorted Kirk's casket, highlighting the national impact of this assassination and the widespread political condemnation it has generated.</p>

Despite this substantial increase, the report concludes that the care provided is often inadequate and does not offer value for money, attributing issues to a "dysfunctional" market largely run by profit-driven private providers. The NAO highlighted that two-thirds of children are placed outside their local authority, often more than 20 miles from home.

The article argues that this crackdown on undocumented and illegal workers clashes directly with the need for skilled labor in manufacturing, exposing the tension between anti-immigrant rhetoric and economic goals. Such actions, it suggests, will disrupt globalization and harm the US and its allies more than they will benefit.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, threatening "necessary measures" if Mexico proceeds with plans to raise tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%. Mexico's proposed tariff hike, which requires Congressional approval, is part of a larger budget initiative impacting $52 billion in imports and is set against a backdrop of escalating US-China trade tensions. Beijing urged Mexico to reconsider, stressing their mutual trade importance and advocating for free trade principles against perceived "U.S. abuse of tariffs." The situation underscores global concerns about China's manufacturing overcapacity, with Mexico serving as a key export market and investment destination for Chinese auto companies.

          <p>California's Assembly has approved Senate Bill 79, a contentious housing bill set to override local zoning regulations to significantly increase high-density housing near public transit corridors. The proposed legislation, awaiting final Senate concurrence and the Governor's signature, would allow for taller structures—up to nine stories—adjacent to specific transit stops, and up to six stories within a half-mile, including single-family neighborhoods. Proponents emphasize the necessity of these measures to combat the state's severe affordability crisis, while opponents criticize it as an overreach that diminishes local control and threatens community character. The bill's passage was bolstered by amendments that secured crucial support from a powerful labor union.</p>

Rubio, on X, condemned the conviction as "unjustly ruled" and linked it to existing US sanctions against Brazilian Supreme Federal Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. This diplomatic tension escalates after President Trump previously imposed tariffs on Brazilian goods in retaliation for Bolsonaro's prosecution. Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva fiercely rejected Washington's actions as an infringement on national sovereignty, vowing to retaliate against any unilateral tariff increases and asserting Brazil's judicial independence.

Experts emphasize the delicate balance campus police chiefs must maintain between ensuring safety and upholding freedom of expression. Advocacy groups like the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression fear the emergence of an "assassin's veto," potentially stifling democratic debate. However, some campus police leaders anticipate an increase in diligence for high-profile events rather than a complete overhaul of existing security protocols.</p>

Bolsonaro, currently under house arrest, has also been barred from holding public office until 2033. His legal team plans to appeal the conviction, labeling the sentence "absurdly excessive."
