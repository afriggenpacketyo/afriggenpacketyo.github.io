          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage held in Gaza, as a gesture of goodwill before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The announcement follows talks with the United States, where the U.S. pledged to undertake "great efforts" to end the war in Gaza. While the exact timing of the release is unclear, the Trump administration hopes it will occur soon, with Hamas officials indicating it will happen within a day or two.

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a 2018 bike accident, has regained the ability to walk short distances through an innovative "digital bridge" technology developed by Swiss neuroscientists Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and Gregoire Courtine. The technology wirelessly connects an implant on top of her brain to a spinal cord stimulator, allowing her to move her legs with her thoughts. The digital bridge is a small titanium device implanted in the patient's skull directly over their motor cortex, the area of the brain responsible for controlling movement. After training, Carsteanu-Dombi took her first steps, marking a significant advancement in restoring mobility for paralyzed patients.</p>

          <p>Linda Miller, a fraud expert, estimates that the U.S. government loses nearly $1 trillion annually to fraud, perpetrated by sophisticated criminals, often overseas, using stolen American identities. The problem has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic, as relief programs moved online with minimal safeguards. Miller notes that much of the stolen money ends up in foreign adversarial nations like China and Russia. The FBI cracked a case involving $6 billion in stolen pandemic unemployment funds, highlighting the scale of the problem. These fraud rings exploit government programs like unemployment, food stamps, and disaster funding, leaving Americans struggling to access the aid they are owed.</p>

"Thunderbolts" secured the top spot with $33.1 million, while "Sinners" followed closely behind. Overall, the year-to-date box office revenue has increased by approximately 16% compared to last year, thanks to the strong performance of these films and others. The other films in the top 10 included "A Minecraft Movie", "The Accountant 2", and several new releases that did not make a significant impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks rather than insist on a cease-fire first, contradicting a plan set by European leaders. President Zelenskyy responded cautiously, reiterating the need for a halt in fighting, but added he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey. The exchanges followed President Putin's rejection of a cease-fire deadline and proposal for direct talks in Istanbul. Trump's administration has aligned with Russia on a UN vote and resumed diplomatic ties, but has not increased sanctions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system, focusing on stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. The proposed changes would also extend the waiting period for migrants to apply for settled status from five to ten years. Labour aims to create a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair", with a "fast-track" settlement for skilled workers. Critics warn that the new rules may split families and make it harder for migrants to settle in the UK.</p>

Sharvit, who believes the West Bank was given by God to the Jews, confronted the BBC team and accused them of being dangerous to Israel. The incident highlights the starkly different visions of Israel's future between settlers like Sharvit and activists working for peaceful co-existence with Palestinians.
