          <p>Geophysicist Zhigang Peng's election as president-elect of the Seismological Society of America marks a growing trend of China-born scientists taking leadership roles in US academic societies. Despite significant contributions to research and education, these scientists have historically been under-represented. Similarly, virologist Shan-Lu Liu will become the first Chinese-American to lead the American Society for Virology. These milestones reflect a desire among Chinese-American researchers to expand their impact and better serve the broader scientific community by pushing boundaries and fostering greater representation.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba embarked on a four-day trip to Vietnam and the Philippines, aiming to enhance security and economic cooperation amidst China's growing influence in the region. This marks Ishiba's third visit to Southeast Asia since October, highlighting Japan's commitment to the fast-growing bloc. Discussions are expected to cover defense equipment provisions to Vietnam and intelligence-sharing pacts with the Philippines. The move comes as the region faces economic uncertainties due to U.S. tariffs and China's assertive maritime activities.</p>

          <p>A large explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a key Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, resulted in at least 18 deaths and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage to buildings and infrastructure. The blast, felt up to 50km away, triggered fires that spread through the port area. Initial reports suggested the explosion stemmed from improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, with some sources pointing to a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel. Iranian officials later indicated the cause was a fire in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot after warnings had been issued regarding safe storage.</p>

Leaked internal documents suggest ConvrtX billed over $5 million between 2019 and 2023, but insiders claim few success stories exist.

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts detective, was convicted of murdering his wife, Amy Fanion, after an investigation revealed suspicious internet searches on his work computer prior to her death. These searches included topics such as household poisons, dangerous sources of radiation, and gunshot residue testing. The prosecution argued that these searches, coupled with Fanion's affair and inconsistencies in his statements, pointed to premeditation. The defense countered that the searches were related to household hazards and that Amy Fanion suffered from anxiety and anger issues.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Westfield, Massachusetts detective, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the shooting death of his wife, Amy Fanion.

The absence of gunshot residue on Amy's head, coupled with the bullet's trajectory, contradicted Fanion's claim that she shot herself at close range. Despite support from some of Amy's family members, the prosecution successfully argued that Fanion's motive was to start a new life with his lover without the financial repercussions of a divorce.</p>

While Kimmel has also addressed the feud recently, both comedians have since made peace after Kimmel's son underwent heart surgery. Leno admits that the incident started a whole thing that continues to this day, but that he wouldn't have done it, but that it is okay, and alright, because it is what it is.</p>

Doctors warn of long-term health consequences, especially for children, due to malnutrition.

          <p>The article discusses the historical pattern of tyrants eventually facing their demise, drawing parallels to Donald Trump's current presidency. It suggests that Trump's actions, such as undermining democratic institutions, disregarding laws, and prioritizing personal gain, are unsustainable. While impeachment or the 25th amendment seem unlikely, the author suggests that Trump's own incompetence, greed, and chaotic policies may ultimately lead to his downfall. The author ultimately argues that Trump's biggest enemy is himself, and those who seek to preserve democracy must work to contain, deter, and depose him, while the best and brightest hope is that, drowning in hubris, Trump will destroy himself.</p>

The poll reveals widespread economic discontent, with 72% believing his economic policies will cause a recession and 73% stating the economy is in bad shape. Concerns extend beyond the economy, with majorities expressing worry about his administration's respect for the rule of law and expansion of presidential powers. Despite these negative ratings, Trump still holds an advantage over Democrats in Congress regarding trust to handle the nation's main problems.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating placing caps on international student admissions as a means to address the country's housing affordability crisis. The move represents a significant shift for Australia, which has historically relied on international education as a key economic driver.
