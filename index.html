          <p>Six individuals were found deceased at a dairy farm in Weld County, Colorado, following what authorities described as a "confined space rescue" operation. Fire crews were dispatched to the farm in Keenesburg, but were unable to save the individuals. The Weld County Sheriff's Office has stated that no criminal element is suspected in the incident. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched a comprehensive investigation, which is expected to take up to six months to complete.</p>

          <p>The UK government has introduced new guidance for baby food manufacturers, mandating reductions in sugar and salt content and prohibiting the promotion of snacks for infants under one year old. Companies are given an 18-month deadline to comply or face potential action, a move that follows a BBC investigation revealing high sugar levels and misleading marketing in popular products. Health campaigners have welcomed the guidelines, which also restrict unsubstantiated health claims, though some critics note the rules are voluntary and may be open to exploitation.</p>

Despite Walmart raising its full-year sales and earnings forecast, the stock fell, a reaction Simon attributes possibly to a one-time earnings miss driven by non-systemic issues. He highlighted the company's success in attracting shoppers with low prices and absorbing tariffs, suggesting investors should be more optimistic about its performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Automaker Stellantis has unveiled the redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee, featuring the brand's first hybrid system in North America, as part of an effort to reverse six consecutive years of declining sales. The new model, which was discontinued in 2023, is larger, has more cargo space, and incorporates a 1.6-liter turbo-four hybrid powertrain. This relaunch is a key strategy for new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa to regain market share for the Jeep brand, which has been facing headwinds from sales declines and tariffs.</p>

          <p>The global race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying, with China and Russia currently leading the United States and its allies. These weapons pose a significant challenge to existing defense systems because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them difficult to detect and intercept. While the U.S. and UK are now increasing investment in this technology, experts warn that Western nations fell behind while focusing on counter-insurgency conflicts over the past two decades.</p>

CEO Carl Eschenbach warned of challenges in its state and local government business due to potential funding slowdowns. He also noted pressure in the higher education sector, partly due to President Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education, which creates uncertainty for university funding.

          <p>The Trump administration is undertaking a review of more than 55 million current U.S. visa holders for potential rule violations that could lead to revocation and deportation. The State Department confirmed that all foreigners with valid visas are subject to "continuous vetting" for any new information suggesting ineligibility, including criminal activity or threats to public safety. This policy significantly expands the administration's immigration crackdown, which now also includes screening for "anti-American" views on social media for new applicants seeking to live in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors, allowing them to transform highly appreciated stocks into shares of a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) without immediately triggering capital gains taxes. This process involves seeding a new ETF with existing assets, effectively deferring the tax liability until the ETF shares are sold. While the strategy can be highly effective for managing large taxable gains, it is subject to strict diversification rules and can limit an investor's future flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>
