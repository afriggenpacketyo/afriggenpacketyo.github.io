          <p>In response to devastating floods in Texas, the state's National Guard continues its recovery operations, now joined by a specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic. This international cooperation is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, which has linked Texas with the Czech Republic for over three decades. The guard has rescued hundreds of people, including over 130 children from a summer camp, utilizing Black Hawk helicopters for evacuations. With around 100 people still missing, the search remains intensive, supported by resources from other states like Arkansas and North Dakota, highlighting a large-scale, collaborative emergency response effort.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged four Louisiana law enforcement officials, including two active police chiefs, and a local businessman in a significant visa fraud scheme. The group is accused of fabricating police reports for armed robberies that never occurred, which were then used to help immigrants fraudulently apply for U visas, a category reserved for victims of certain crimes. The officials allegedly received payments for each falsified report they produced in the scheme, which spanned nearly a decade. The charges include conspiracy, mail fraud, and money laundering, carrying potential sentences of decades in prison for the accused.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the US-China Business Council reveals that a vast majority of American companies operating in China consider the market critical for their global competitiveness. This sentiment persists despite facing significant challenges, including strained bilateral relations, ongoing tariffs, and domestic economic weakness in China. While leaving the country is not seen as a viable option for most, fewer than half of the surveyed firms are optimistic about their future prospects. They cite persistent concerns over policy uncertainty and insufficient demand, urging for diplomatic talks to address more than just tariffs and export controls. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A San Diego hip-hop group, The Neighborhood Kids, has gained viral attention for their track "Kids in Cages," which powerfully articulates the anger and fear within communities affected by recent federal immigration raids. The song, originally from 2023, found new resonance and was championed by artists like Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who called them his "new favorite band." The lyrics highlight the contributions of working-class immigrants and condemn the dehumanizing nature of family separations and aggressive enforcement actions. The group's sudden rise in prominence led to a performance at a "Defend L.A." benefit concert, amplifying their message of social justice.</p>

The investigation began after the boy was found in a parking lot on Saturday morning. Following a tip, authorities executed a search warrant at a nearby apartment, detaining a man and a woman and placing two children into the custody of social services. Three other adults were detained later, as the community holds vigils and grapples with the tragic discovery amidst heightened local tensions from recent immigration raids.</p>

          <p>The UK's Ministry of Defence reportedly offered to expedite the rejected resettlement application of an Afghan national after he posted names from a sensitive data breach on Facebook. The man had obtained a dataset of nearly 19,000 Afghans who applied for UK relocation after a UK Special Forces employee accidentally emailed it externally in 2022. In what a government source described as blackmail, the man published nine names and indicated he could release more, prompting authorities to negotiate the data's removal in exchange for overturning his rejected application. The individual is now reportedly in the UK, and the incident highlights what critics call the chaotic nature of the Afghan relocation process.</p>

This economic pressure, combined with rising uncertainty that paralyzes business investment, has contributed to a lowered global growth forecast. The situation is further complicated by renewed Houthi aggression in the Red Sea, which adds additional inflationary pressure through increased shipping and insurance costs.

Trump has frequently criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, and allies have recently scrutinized a costly renovation project at the Fed's headquarters.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold another 225,000 shares of the company's stock for approximately $37 million, according to a recent SEC filing. This sale is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, under which Huang can sell up to 6 million shares. The immense demand for Nvidia's AI chips has propelled the company's market capitalization past $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company and significantly increasing Huang's net worth. The news comes as Nvidia also announced it plans to restart sales of its H20 chips to China after receiving assurances of license approvals from the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A meteorite identified as the largest piece of the planet Mars on Earth has been sold for nearly $5.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York. The meteorite, named NWA 16788, weighs over 54 pounds and represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles and crashing in the Sahara Desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, constituting only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on Earth, making this a significant acquisition for the unidentified buyer.</p>

The fund, expected to be operational within a month, aims to support workers and their families in smaller cities and unincorporated areas of the county.

The county is also considering measures to safeguard property left behind by detained individuals and establish a hotline for deported workers to claim unpaid wages.</p>

His family describes him as a rare soul who made everyone feel loved and important. Saif was killed on his family's farm during a confrontation where settlers were reportedly destroying olive trees.

          <p>President Trump has labeled the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation a "hoax" and "bulls***," lashing out at members of his own party who are calling for greater transparency. In social media posts and comments to reporters, he dismissed the issue as a politically motivated "scam" perpetrated by Democrats and criticized his own supporters for focusing on it. This comes as his administration, led by Attorney General Pam Bondi, has faced pressure to release more files after stating no "client list" was found. The president's dismissive stance has highlighted a significant fracture within his party and conservative base over the handling of the case.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is considering amendments to a Trump administration request to rescind $9 billion in previously approved spending, primarily targeting foreign aid and public media funding. The package, which narrowly advanced with a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President, faces opposition from some Republicans concerned about its impact. A proposed amendment would restore $400 million for an AIDS prevention program, but this may not be enough to secure full party support. With a Friday deadline looming before the funds must be spent, the Senate's changes mean the revised package will have to be sent back to the House for another vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a podcast interview, former FBI official Peter Strzok warns that the FBI is a fragile institution being systematically hollowed out during President Trump's second term. Strzok argues that Trump loyalists like Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino are dismantling the agency’s national security functions by purging experts and sidelining key investigations, leaving the U.S. vulnerable. The discussion also touches on the political fracture within the MAGA movement over the administration's decision to shut down the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. Strzok contends that the bureau's effectiveness is being compromised by a combination of malevolence, incompetence, and a focus on political loyalty over institutional integrity.</p>

          <p>A surprise acceleration in UK inflation is creating new challenges for the Bank of England's anticipated interest rate cut next month. With inflation now expected to remain above the bank's target until the autumn, the decision to lower rates from the current 4.25% is no longer seen as certain. While some economists argue a cut would be irresponsible, market expectations still lean toward a reduction, though with renewed caution. The decision will be further influenced by upcoming employment figures, as a weakening jobs market could strengthen the case for easing monetary policy despite the current inflationary bounce.
