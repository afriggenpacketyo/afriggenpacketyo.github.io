          <p>A tour bus returning from Niagara Falls tragically overturned on Interstate 90 in Pembroke, Upstate New York, resulting in at least four fatalities, including one child, and dozens of injuries. Police reported the vehicle lost control, veered into the median, and ended up in a ditch, with some of the 52 passengers ejected or trapped. This severe incident prompted a massive emergency response, involving multiple medical helicopters transporting injured individuals, many of whom were of Indian, Chinese, and Filipino descent, to various hospitals. The highway was closed in both directions, highlighting the profound and immediate impact of this devastating accident on travelers and emergency services alike, with investigations into the cause ongoing.</p>

          <p>Newly released Department of Justice transcripts detail a two-day interview with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted accomplice, where she was questioned extensively about her interactions with Donald Trump and Epstein. Maxwell consistently denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior by Trump, describing him as a "gentleman" and expressing admiration for his presidency. She also refuted allegations of former President Bill Clinton visiting Epstein's private island and speculated that Epstein's death might not have been a suicide, suggesting it could have been a killing by another inmate. These disclosures from the DOJ aim to provide transparency amid persistent public and congressional scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of Epstein-related files and their delayed release.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongly deported in March and later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. A federal judge ordered his return to Maryland, blocking further deportation attempts by immigration authorities. Abrego Garcia, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, must remain under his brother's custody in Maryland and adhere to specific release conditions, including anger management and avoiding MS-13 gang members, allegations his family denies. This development marks a significant step in his ongoing legal battle, although his attorneys emphasize he is "far from safe."</p>

          <h2>Key Factors That Can Reduce Your Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 17:01:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many American retirees rely on Social Security, but several factors can unexpectedly reduce these crucial benefits. Working while receiving benefits before full retirement age can trigger an earnings test, leading to temporary reductions. Medicare Part B premiums, especially Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts for high-income earners, are often automatically deducted, significantly lowering monthly payments. Furthermore, a portion of Social Security benefits can be subject to federal income tax if combined income exceeds certain thresholds. Understanding these potential reductions is vital for retirement planning, with options like reverse mortgages or part-time work available to supplement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's critique of the Smithsonian Institution for emphasizing "how bad slavery was" has ignited significant controversy, with critics labeling his stance as ignorant, mean-spirited, and racist. This aligns with broader administration efforts to control museum exhibits and historical narratives, pushing for "unifying and constructive descriptions" that downplay past injustices. The article argues that whitewashing history, particularly regarding slavery, the civil rights movement, and the treatment of Indigenous Americans, is a grave insult and prevents a crucial understanding of current societal issues. Such actions, it suggests, aim to erase accountability for historical brutalities and promote a narrative of an unblemished national identity.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, continued moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast but remained a powerful hurricane-force low-pressure system.

          <p>As credit card debt and delinquencies rise, many Americans seek relief, with credit card forbearance emerging as a temporary option. Forbearance allows borrowers to pause or reduce payments for a limited time, potentially including fee waivers and interest relief, but it does not erase debt. Qualification typically requires demonstrating legitimate financial hardship, such as job loss or unexpected expenses, along with a history of on-time payments. If forbearance isn't an option, alternatives like debt management plans, consolidation loans, balance transfers, or even bankruptcy can help manage unmanageable debt.

          <h2>UN-Backed Report Declares Famine in Northern Gaza Due to Israeli Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 15:55:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations-backed panel, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), has declared that famine is underway in northern Gaza, affecting over half a million people, and is expected to spread. The report attributes this "entirely man-made" catastrophe to Israeli restrictions and "systematic obstruction" of aid, despite Israel's denials and accusations against aid agencies and Hamas. The IPC confirmed severe starvation, acute malnutrition in children, and high mortality rates, emphasizing that while Israel has eased some restrictions, aid organizations still face significant impediments to distribution. This declaration intensifies international pressure on Israel to ensure full humanitarian access.</p>

Scheduled for the first day of school, this non-sectarian event invites parents, students, and community members to gather in the Wahluke High School gym to join local clergy in prayer for the well-being and safety of students and teachers. Inspired by a past fentanyl-related tragedy, the initiative aims to counter negative influences and provide faith-based support. Organizers hope to start a trend of community-led spiritual gatherings in public schools, emphasizing the power of collective prayer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sri Lanka's highest court has ordered the owners of the Singapore-flagged MV X-Press Pearl container ship to pay $1 billion for causing the "largest recorded marine plastic spill in the world." The June 2021 disaster, where the ship caught fire and sank with chemical cargo, led to "unprecedented devastation," killing hundreds of marine animals and spreading tons of plastic pellets across beaches and into the ocean. The court's ruling, based on "The Polluter Pays Principle," holds the liable parties responsible for ongoing environmental damage and severe disruption to the nation's fishing communities. The substantial compensation aims to fund crucial restoration efforts, while globally, the incident intensifies calls for stricter international shipping regulations.</p>

          <h2>FBI Search of John Bolton's Home Raises Concerns Over Political Weaponization of Justice</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FBI's search of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home for classified documents has sparked accusations of political weaponization of federal law enforcement. This investigation marks the fifth targeting individuals from FBI Director Kash Patel's 2023 book, "Government Gangsters," which listed those who allegedly "weaponized" the government. Critics argue the systematic nature of these investigations, especially reviving a previously settled case against Bolton, contradicts claims of restoring justice department integrity. President Trump further fueled concerns by calling Bolton a "lowlife" and "unpatriotic," despite claiming no direct involvement in the search.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new three-year media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to expand its reach and secure new revenue streams in a shifting media landscape. Under the proposed deals, NBC would acquire Sunday night games and Wild Card playoffs for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix would gain Home Run Derby rights for about $50 million. ESPN is set for a new $550 million package, including digital out-of-market games and rights to five local teams. These partnerships reflect MLB's strategic effort to capitalize on streaming services as traditional TV viewership declines, developing new media alliances that could lead to further opportunities after 2028.
