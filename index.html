          <p>Best Buy has launched an online third-party marketplace, allowing other vendors to sell products directly through its website and app. This strategic move aims to reverse declining sales by expanding its product range beyond core electronics to include items like custom gaming accessories, seasonal decor, and cookware. By adopting a model similar to Amazon and Walmart, Best Buy can fill gaps in its inventory and create a new revenue stream from seller commissions and on-site advertising, addressing a recent slump in business.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decrease in young adults aged 25-34 achieving traditional milestones like moving out, getting married, and having children compared to previous generations. The study, comparing data from 2005 and 2023, attributes this shift to mounting economic barriers, including the rising costs of housing and daily essentials. Changing societal norms, such as viewing marriage as a "capstone" achievement after financial stability, also contribute to this redefinition of adulthood.</p>

          <p>An Alabama inmate scheduled for execution by nitrogen hypoxia in October has filed a lawsuit challenging the method as unconstitutionally cruel. The inmate, Anthony Boyd, is requesting alternative methods such as a firing squad or hanging, arguing that previous nitrogen gas executions showed signs of "conscious suffocation, terror, and pain." This legal challenge is part of a broader controversy surrounding the experimental execution method, which Alabama officials defend as humane and quick.</p>

          <p>Banking experts advise savers on steps to take if they miss their Certificate of Deposit (CD) maturity date, which could lead to automatic renewal at a less favorable interest rate. The first step is to immediately contact the financial institution, as most offer a grace period of seven to ten days to make changes without penalty. If the grace period has passed, it is still worth asking the bank to waive or reduce early withdrawal fees, especially for established customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused India of profiteering by purchasing discounted Russian crude oil, refining it, and then reselling the products to global markets, including Europe. He described this as an "Indian arbitrage" that has generated billions in excess profits for some of India's wealthiest families. This practice has surged since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, leading the Trump administration to impose a 25% tariff on Indian exports to the U.S. as a punitive measure.</p>

          <p>A Guardian opinion article contends that the Republican party is actively working to undermine fair elections ahead of the 2026 midterms. The piece highlights efforts in Texas, at Donald Trump's urging, to redraw congressional maps in the party's favor, a practice known as gerrymandering. It also points to an upcoming Supreme Court case that could further weaken the Voting Rights Act, potentially diluting the voting power of minority communities and making it harder for them to elect preferred candidates.</p>

          <p>A trend in Silicon Valley sees tech giants like Google, Meta, and Amazon acquiring top talent from AI startups through massive licensing and investment deals, rather than full acquisitions. This practice often enriches founders and key researchers but can leave the original companies as hollowed-out "zombie startups" with uncertain futures. The article explores how these deals can circumvent regulatory scrutiny while disrupting the traditional venture capital model, leaving many employees and investors with little to show for their contributions.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he will begin interviewing a field of 11 candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair after Labor Day. The list includes current Fed governors, economists, and Wall Street experts, with the White House keen to expedite the process to replace current Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent reiterated the administration's desire for interest rate cuts to stimulate the housing market, suggesting a significant reduction could spur a home-building boom and control future inflation.

          <p>An opinion piece argues that resolving the long-standing disputes in the South China Sea requires addressing the mutually exclusive narratives held by China and other claimant nations. One side views China's actions as aggressive, while Beijing sees them as defensive exercises of its rights. This gap is rooted in differing interpretations of post-World War II treaties and a conflict between historical claims and modern international law. The author suggests a joint, fact-based collaborative process is needed to narrow this divide and enable a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described the White House summit on Ukraine as a significant step forward, highlighting President Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees as a key breakthrough. European leaders, initially anxious about the meeting, now appear to be fully supporting Trump's peace initiative. The focus has shifted to ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible negotiating position, with UK officials noting that Trump's pledge of U.S. involvement allows President Zelenskyy greater flexibility in future talks with Russia.</p>

          <p>Cholera, a severe intestinal infection caused by contaminated water or food, is resurging globally, with conflict-ridden Sudan experiencing a severe outbreak of over 65,000 cases. The disease leads to rapid dehydration and can be fatal within 24 hours if untreated, posing a particular threat to young children whose immune systems are less developed. Disrupted access to safe water, sanitation, and healthcare in crisis zones exacerbates the spread, while a global shortage of the oral cholera vaccine hampers prevention efforts.</p>

          <p>As diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine continue, the status of Ukrainian territory currently controlled by Russia remains a central issue. Russia occupies or claims approximately 20% of Ukraine's land, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and large parts of the eastern Donbas region. While President Trump has mentioned potential "land swapping," Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has consistently rejected ceding any territory, as it could violate Ukraine's constitution and embolden future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>The thong swimsuit was invented by Austrian-American designer Rudi Gernreich in 1974 as a political statement against a ban on public nudity at Los Angeles beaches. Gernreich, a gay man and early LGBTQ+ rights activist, designed the minimalist garment to liberate the body from societal sexual hang-ups, rather than to sexualize it. A pioneer of unisex fashion, he also created the first topless swimsuit, the "monokini," in 1964, championing the idea that women should have control over their own bodies and clothing choices.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's defense ministry is planning a major expansion of its drone fleet, seeking to acquire nearly 50,000 new unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) over the next two years. The procurement plan spans five different categories, from small multi-rotor platforms to larger fixed-wing systems, to meet a wide range of operational needs. This move comes as the island's military intends to reclassify drones as consumables, similar to ammunition, which will streamline and accelerate the purchasing process to enhance its defensive capabilities.</p>
