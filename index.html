        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Perplexity AI, an artificial intelligence search engine, is reportedly in late-stage discussions to raise $500 million at a $14 billion valuation, with Accel leading the round. This funding comes amidst a generative AI boom, driven by the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Perplexity is focusing on its upcoming AI agent web browser, Comet, but faces increasing competition from Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI, all of whom are developing their own AI-driven search capabilities. The funding is expected to help Perplexity compete in the rapidly evolving AI search market, where it aims to differentiate itself from traditional search engines. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany has tightened its border controls, with Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt ordering the federal police to turn away non-EU citizens without a visa, including asylum seekers who have already applied in another EU country. This move, based on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's election pledge, aims to curb irregular immigration and motivate EU neighbors to prevent migrants from passing through to Germany. Exceptions will be made for vulnerable individuals like pregnant women and unaccompanied minors. The policy is controversial, with left-wing politicians criticizing it as a breach of European law, while the far-right AfD seeks even stricter measures. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party has announced its plans to reduce immigration to the UK, focusing on a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements, generally requiring degree-level qualifications for skilled workers, but loosening them for graduates of elite universities outside the UK. Immigrants will typically need to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for indefinite leave to remain, with a potential reduction through an "earned settlement" system. The dedicated visa for social care workers will be scrapped, and stricter rules will be applied to overseas graduates and their dependents. </p>

Under the agreement, the U.S. would reduce tariffs on Chinese imports, while China would lower import duties on American goods.

          <p>Dodgers' Freddie Freeman attributes his recent hot streak to a single off Paul Skenes, which helped him rediscover his mechanics at the plate. After struggling with a "cut swing" for over a year, Freeman felt his swing align during that at-bat. Since then, he has been on a tear, batting .475 with five home runs and 22 RBIs. Despite playing through a sprained ankle, Freeman has maintained a high level of performance, leading to praise from his manager and teammates. </p>

          <p>Tennesseans who have owned or used a Siri-enabled Apple device since 2014 may be eligible for up to $100 from Apple due to a $95 million class action lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Siri of spying on users by listening to private conversations when accidentally activated. To claim a payment, users must swear under oath that they experienced an unintended Siri activation during a private conversation. Payments will be $20 per device, with a maximum of $100. </p>
