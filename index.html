          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who led London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has died at the age of 72 after a short illness. His tenure was marked by significant events, including the 7/7 London bombings and the controversial fatal shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, which led to sustained pressure on his leadership. Despite the controversies, colleagues like current Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley praised his vast contributions to policing, particularly in improving the handling of sexual assault cases. Lord Blair was eventually forced to resign by then-Mayor Boris Johnson but continued public service as a crossbench peer in the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flooding that has resulted in 121 deaths, with over 170 people still missing. The president met with first responders and local officials in Kerrville, the county most affected by the disaster that occurred on July 4th. A significant number of the fatalities occurred at a girls' summer camp that was inundated by the flash floods. Trump has signed a disaster declaration for the region, enabling federal assistance, and stated he delayed his visit to avoid impeding ongoing rescue and recovery operations.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner secured his first Wimbledon final appearance by defeating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in a decisive straight-sets victory. The 23-year-old Italian will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, setting up a highly anticipated rematch of their recent five-set French Open final. The 38-year-old Djokovic, who was seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title, acknowledged that age and physical wear were significant factors in his defeat but confirmed he intends to return to the tournament. Alcaraz advanced to the final after a four-set win over American Taylor Fritz.</p>

          <p>A judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state of New Hampshire, allowing the case to move forward. The state alleges that the social media platform intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit young users for commercial gain. This lawsuit is part of a larger trend of legal actions by state attorneys general targeting the design and safety policies of tech companies, rather than user-generated content. The ruling comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September deadline to sell its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a major reduction-in-force, laying off over 1,300 civil and foreign service employees as part of a broader reorganization under the Trump administration. The plan aims to cut the department's domestic workforce by about 15% and consolidate numerous offices to streamline what officials call a "bloated bureaucracy." Critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue the indiscriminate cuts undermine national security and U.S. diplomatic efforts. The move follows a recent Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for the administration's plans to reduce the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>The rise of generative AI is creating new challenges for recent college graduates, as data shows a 15% decline in entry-level job listings and a 30% surge in applications per role. Experts suggest AI is automating many of the rote tasks traditionally performed by junior employees, leading to a redefinition of entry-level positions and increasing the demand for AI-related skills. The unemployment rate for young degree holders is currently higher than the national average, signaling a potential shift in the labor market. This technological disruption may also lead to a renewed focus on skilled trades that are less susceptible to AI automation.</p>

Frost is accused of misappropriating over $19 million for personal use, including lavish vacations and political contributions.

Palace argues Textor lacks decisive control and missed a key deadline to alter their ownership structure, a step Forest had already taken regarding their owner's ties to Olympiakos.

          <p>Relatives of Israeli hostages with German citizenship, who were abducted by Hamas on October 7, have traveled to Berlin to seek greater support from the German government. They are appealing to officials to apply more pressure to secure the release of the remaining captives, of whom 24 are believed to still be alive. The families share stories of their loved ones, such as Alon Ohel, a 24-year-old gravely injured during the attack, highlighting the critical conditions and uncertainty they face.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting it to ask some recently laid-off employees to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic review processes implemented by the Trump administration, which have stalled the awarding of funds for critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and the homeless. With the end of the fiscal year approaching, there are concerns that the department may need to drastically shorten application periods, putting grant-seeking organizations in a difficult position to meet tight deadlines.</p>

          <h2>Three Potential Ways for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:24:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's future solvency and potential benefit reductions, seniors may need to explore alternative income sources. This article outlines three potential options to supplement retirement funds. One method is a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive monthly payments from their home equity. Another option is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump-sum investment. Finally, a personal loan can offer a financial buffer for emergencies, though it involves taking on new debt. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly tap into their home equity, several strategies can expedite the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with a fully online lender can streamline the process through digital automation and virtual appraisals. Homeowners might also consider a "low-doc" or "no-doc" HELOC, which minimizes paperwork but may come with higher rates. Working with one's existing mortgage lender can also be faster, as they already possess the necessary financial and property information. These methods can reduce the approval timeline from weeks to days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The investigation into the fatal Air India crash near Ahmedabad is reportedly focusing on pilot error as a primary cause. Preliminary findings suggest that switches controlling fuel flow to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's engines were turned off, leading to a loss of thrust shortly after takeoff. The crash, which killed 241 of the 242 people on board and 29 on the ground, was the first fatal accident involving a Dreamliner. U.S. officials involved in the probe have not found any initial evidence of mechanical failure with the aircraft or its engines.</p>

          <p>The current season of 'Love Island USA' is notable for a lack of deep romantic connections, which this article suggests is a reflection of Gen Z's dating habits. The cast, many of whom were in high school during the pandemic, appears emotionally guarded and hesitant to show vulnerability, leading to numerous "situationships" rather than committed relationships. This behavior aligns with data showing Gen Z has less relationship experience and is anxious about appearing "cringey" or "overeager." Despite the absence of classic romance, the show's popularity remains high, perhaps because viewers relate to the contestants' struggles with modern dating.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new spending bill includes a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, but tax experts warn of a potential "SALT torpedo" for some high-income earners. The new, higher deduction limit begins to phase out for those with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) between $500,000 and $600,000. This rapid phaseout can create an unusually high effective tax rate on income within that specific range, potentially reaching as high as 45.5% on those earnings. Experts advise taxpayers near this income threshold to conduct careful tax planning to avoid an unexpected financial hit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widely adopted goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number was initially arbitrary, subsequent research suggests it is a reasonable, if not precise, benchmark for physical activity. Health experts note that benefits from walking, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 steps, with many benefits plateauing around 7,500 steps. The key message from doctors is that any movement is better than none, and individuals should focus on gradually increasing their activity rather than fixating on a single number.</p>
