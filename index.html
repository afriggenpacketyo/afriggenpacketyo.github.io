            <h2>India Likely to Maintain Regional Ties Despite Not Joining Squad Alliance</h2>

            <p>Analysts suggest India is unlikely to accept the Philippines' invitation to join the Squad alliance (US, Australia, Japan, Philippines), despite mounting tensions between Manila and Beijing in the South China Sea. However, India is expanding its regional engagement, seen as significant for exerting pressure on Beijing. While Beijing and New Delhi face new tariffs from Washington, they've made progress in restoring normalcy, including high-level meetings and resuming direct flights. India has remained silent on the Squad proposal, even after the Philippines described China as a "common enemy."</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has expressed strong opposition to U.S. President Trump's threat of escalating tariffs and has promised to take countermeasures to protect its rights and interests. This comes after Trump's announcement of an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing does not withdraw its 34% tariff on American products. China retaliated to Trump's initial levies with 34% additional tariffs on goods imported from the U.S. The broadened tariff scope reflects diminished hopes for a trade deal, potentially denting China's economy by 1.5 to 2 percentage points this year.</p>

            <p>Akkermansia muciniphila, an unusual gut bacteria, is associated with good health and plays a key role in maintaining the gut barrier. It lives in the large intestine and feeds on mucin, a mucus layer separating human and microbial cells. An imbalance of this bacteria can lead to inflammation and diseases like inflammatory bowel disease. A. muciniphila uses 66 different enzymes to extract energy from mucin. While it only eats mucus, our diet affects it indirectly, as fiber-rich foods support other bacteria that produce beneficial short-chain fatty acids.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, a significant beneficiary of global trade, faces potential disruption due to U.S. President Trump's aggressive tariffs. The nation, which relies heavily on exports, has been hit with a steep 46% import duty. Economists estimate this could shave 1.2 percentage points off Vietnam's economic growth this year. Vietnam has become a manufacturing hub for companies like Nike, Adidas, and Apple, and many Chinese manufacturers have relocated there to avoid U.S. tariffs. The new levies could slash Vietnam's total goods exports by as much as 40% this year.</p>

            <p>Wall Street traders expressed concerns about President Trump's trade policies, with some predicting a recession. The market swings, triggered by false reports of tariff pauses, highlight the edgy nature of the markets. Traders believe the administration aims to isolate China, but fear the U.S. may become an insulated, self-sustaining nation. Despite potential profits from volatility, the traders worry about the economic pain and the long-term impact of Trump's policies. One analyst suggests that retail investors haven't even begun selling off yet, but it's coming, leading to a recession.</p>

            <p>Former Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean suggests the Bank should aggressively cut interest rates to at least 4% in May to combat financial turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs. Bean believes uncertainty will force businesses to delay investments and hit consumer spending. David Blanchflower, another former rate setter, advocates for an emergency meeting to consider a deep rate reduction. Financial markets have already priced in a 0.25 percentage point cut in May, but Bean argues for a larger cut to address the disinflationary shock.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariff regime may inadvertently open the door for China to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). Many expect countries to close ranks against the US in response to the tariffs, potentially aiding China's application to join the CPTPP. The CPTPP is a 12-member trading bloc that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. China applied to join the grouping in 2021, but its bid remains pending.</p>

            <p>Wall Street experienced another volatile day as economists raised recession concerns and President Trump threatened to escalate tariffs against China. Leading indexes initially fell sharply, then rebounded on a false report of a tariff freeze, before declining again. Trump escalated his threats against China, saying the U.S. will apply an additional 50% tariff if China doesn't withdraw its retaliatory import fee.
