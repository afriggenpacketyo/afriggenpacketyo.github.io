Other notable features include a profile on the world's largest truck stop in Iowa, an interview with painter Alex Katz about his curated art exhibition, and a conversation with musician John Fogerty about rerecording his classic Creedence Clearwater Revival hits after regaining the rights to his music catalog.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is publicly calling for tips regarding employers who may be illegally favoring foreign workers over American citizens in their hiring processes. Citizens are encouraged to report job advertisements that explicitly state a preference for individuals on temporary visas, such as H-1B visas, which are intended for skilled workers. The initiative also seeks information on potential human trafficking violations linked to these temporary visa programs, amid ongoing debate and criticism from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Ron DeSantis who argue the system is being exploited to undercut American labor.</p>

          <p>Chicago's Mayor, Brandon Johnson, is set to sign an executive order aimed at resisting the Trump administration's planned immigration enforcement crackdowns in the city. The order will direct city agencies, including the police, to refrain from collaborating with federal agents on immigration-related patrols and arrest operations. This move comes in response to the White House's request to use a local military base for immigration operations and public statements from the administration's "border czar" that Chicago would be a target for increased arrests of undocumented immigrants, escalating tensions between the city and federal government.</p>

He thanked his medical team for their swift action and used the opportunity to urge his followers to be vigilant about sun protection, reminding everyone to use sunscreen, especially over the weekend.</p>

The demonstrations, initially sparked by legislative pay, intensified after a fatal traffic incident involving a police vehicle and have resulted in several regional parliament buildings being set on fire. A presidential spokesperson stated that Prabowo wishes to remain in the country to monitor the situation directly, forcing him to decline an invitation to attend China's "Victory Day" parade marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Gen Z individuals are pursuing careers in skilled trades like HVAC installation, plumbing, and welding, driven by concerns that artificial intelligence may render many white-collar jobs obsolete. Enrollment in trade schools and vocational programs has surged, as these fields offer job security and competitive wages without the significant student debt associated with a four-year university degree. Career experts note this "AI-xiety pivot" reflects a shift in perception, where tangible skills are seen as more stable and reliable in a rapidly changing labor market, as AI cannot perform physical tasks like installing an air conditioner.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly increased its bid for Crystal Palace's captain, Marc Guehi, to £35 million, now including a 10% sell-on clause for the defender. Talks between the two football clubs are ongoing as the transfer deadline approaches, with Palace seeking an additional £5 million in performance-related bonuses to finalize the deal. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, compelling Palace to consider a sale to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. The club is actively trying to sign two new central defenders, which could facilitate Guehi's move to Liverpool.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, Hamburg's Astra St. Pauli Brewery has partnered with the condiment company Hela to create a limited-edition beer called "Currydurst," which translates to "Currythirst."

The creation is a tribute to Hamburg's street food culture, combining the city's cult-classic beer with the familiar spicy and smoky taste of the ketchup. Only 2,000 liters of this unconventional brew will be produced, making it a rare novelty for local enthusiasts.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has abruptly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich, recalling him to London after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was made after another Chelsea striker, Liam Delap, sustained a serious hamstring injury during a match against Fulham, leaving the team with limited attacking options. This sudden reversal has reportedly left the 24-year-old Jackson angered by the collapse of his deal. The situation highlights the club's precarious position, having gone from four available strikers to just one fit player in a matter of hours.</p>

The strike, which occurred earlier this week, also killed several other senior officials, including the foreign and justice ministers. The Israel Defense Forces had previously stated it targeted a Houthi "military target" without providing further details. Rahawi was considered more of a figurehead than a key military decision-maker within the Iran-backed group, which has controlled northwestern Yemen since 2014.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of "expedited removal," a policy that allowed for the rapid deportation of undocumented immigrants found anywhere in the U.S. without a court hearing. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled the practice unlawful, stating it deprived individuals of due process by not giving them a meaningful opportunity to challenge the government's claims. This decision curtails the administration's ability to immediately deport migrants who cannot prove they have been in the country for more than two years, dealing a significant blow to a key part of its immigration agenda.</p>

An investigation traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing frequency of cooling towers to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in a matter of seconds. The device uses a sophisticated microphone to analyze subtle heartbeat sounds imperceptible to the human ear and sends the data to an AI system for analysis. A large-scale study involving over 200 GP surgeries found that the AI stethoscope significantly improved detection rates for these conditions. This innovation is being hailed as a potential "game-changer" that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients across the UK.</p>

Director Macon Blair infuses the story with gory violence and goofy humor but anchors it with an unexpected emotional sincerity.

          <p>The term "red pill," originating from the 1999 film "The Matrix," has evolved from an internet meme into a widespread political and social ideology centered on anti-feminism and male dominance.

The ideology has entered mainstream discourse through figures like Andrew Tate, who faces allegations of human trafficking and sexual assault, and has been amplified by social media algorithms.

This event compounds the financial devastation from previous wildfires, raising concerns about the long-term viability of the region's renowned wine industry.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a New Jersey Little League game has been sold at auction for $9,882. The bat gained notoriety after Rocco's celebratory bat flip following a home run led to his ejection and a suspension, a decision that was later overturned by a judge after his family took legal action. The incident drew national attention and support from Major League Baseball players. All proceeds from the auction of the signed bat will be donated back to the Haddonfield Little League program.</p>

In retaliation, Ukraine's military conducted drone strikes on two major Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran, causing significant fires and damage. The exchange of fire comes amid stalled diplomatic efforts to end the war and represents another major escalation in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A recent performance at the Hollywood Bowl titled "Sarabande Africaine" featured a unique collaboration between Afropop star Angélique Kidjo and cellist Yo-Yo Ma, exploring the African origins of Baroque dance forms. The concert showcased how the rhythmic patterns of dances carried by enslaved Africans to 16th-century Spain influenced composers like Bach and Handel. Kidjo transformed classics like Gershwin's "Summertime" and Ravel's "Bolero" with African languages and rhythms, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, background. The show was a vibrant demonstration of cross-cultural musical fusion, highlighting shared histories and celebrating artistic connection.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal ruling overturned an injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that using hotels for this purpose constitutes a breach of planning law and creates public safety risks. Despite the decision, councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne have confirmed they will proceed with their own legal challenges. The government maintains that using hotels is not a sustainable long-term solution but that the court's decision allows for an orderly transition.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most trading partners represent an illegal overreach of executive power. The court found that the President did not have the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose such global tariffs, as that power belongs to Congress. The decision upholds a lower court's ruling but allows the tariffs to remain in place until mid-October to provide time for an appeal to the Supreme Court. This ruling creates significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade relations.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on Social Security survivor benefits for individuals whose spouses have passed away, clarifying that one cannot collect both their own full retirement benefits and their deceased spouse's benefits simultaneously. It outlines the eligibility criteria for survivor benefits, which generally require the surviving spouse to be at least 60 years old, or 50 if disabled. The Social Security Administration will pay out the higher of the two benefit amounts. The article also discusses strategies, such as starting with survivor benefits and later switching to one's own retirement benefit if it becomes larger. (not investment advice)</p>
