          <p>Authorities have identified Robin Westman, 23, as the suspect in the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that tragically killed two children and injured 17 others. Westman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene, reportedly harbored a "deranged obsession" with previous mass shooters. Investigators are diligently examining YouTube videos and extensive writings, which paint a portrait of a deeply nihilistic outlook and grievances. The legally purchased weapons were acquired recently, and the suspect's connection to the church and school through her mother adds a complex, tragic dimension to the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, Mick Barton, has controversially banned the Nottingham Post and its online affiliates from engaging with him or his councillors. This "unprecedented ban" is understood to stem from a disagreement over a story concerning local government reorganization. The newspaper's editor has voiced profound concern, viewing the action as a direct assault on press freedom and the ability to hold elected officials accountable. Various political figures have strongly condemned the move as "dangerous and chilling," urging intervention to protect independent journalism crucial for a healthy local democracy.</p>

          <p>With U.S. bankruptcy filings increasing, individuals facing overwhelming debt are urged to carefully consider key questions before filing. An article advises assessing whether bankruptcy will truly eliminate all debt, as student loans and recent tax debts are typically not discharged. It also highlights exploring less damaging alternatives like debt consolidation, credit counseling, or direct creditor negotiations. Understanding the long-term consequences on credit, employment, and housing is crucial, emphasizing bankruptcy as a last resort rather than a first response to financial difficulty.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have triggered a mechanism to restore major UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal. This "snapback" provision could reimpose sanctions within 30 days, a move Iran's foreign ministry called a "provocative and unnecessary escalation." Western powers express concerns that Iran's nuclear program lacks civilian justification, particularly its highly enriched uranium stockpile, posing a threat to international security. Diplomatic efforts continue, but Iran's perceived lack of credible assurances has prompted this significant escalation.</p>

          <p>Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome has sustained multiple serious injuries, including a pneumothorax, five broken ribs, and a lumbar vertebrae fracture, following a significant training crash on Wednesday. He was promptly airlifted to a hospital in Toulon for urgent surgery, with his team confirming no other cyclists or vehicles were involved. This latest incident raises considerable concerns about the 40-year-old cyclist's career trajectory, as he has not fully returned to his previous elite level since a severe training accident in 2019.

          <p>A Metropolitan Police special constable, James Bubb (now identifying as Gwyn Samuels), has been found guilty of child sexual assault and other serious sexual offences. Bubb groomed one victim online before committing sexual assault when she was just 12 years old, and later sexually assaulted a woman he met online while posing as a teenager. Investigating officers characterized Bubb as a "dangerous, predatory sex offender" who exploited his position within the Met Police to intimidate and control his victims. These convictions underscore a profound breach of public trust and highlight critical issues concerning online safety and accountability within law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has sued the Trump administration, challenging her firing as an "unprecedented and illegal attempt" to remove her. Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, was dismissed over allegations of improper mortgage funds, which she denies and argues do not constitute "cause" under federal law. The lawsuit raises significant concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference, especially given President Trump's past criticisms of the institution. Cook asserts her right to due process was violated by the abrupt termination without notice or a hearing.</p>

These grants, automatically applied at the point of sale, are designed to make EVs more competitive with traditional fuel vehicles.

The new plan suggests an average of 182 days let over several years and allows charity holidays to count towards the target. While the government claims to have listened to feedback, industry groups and Welsh-language society Cymdeithas yr Iaith criticize the changes as insufficient, arguing the 182-day threshold remains problematic for struggling tourism businesses.</p>

This development is seen as a dangerous precedent, potentially allowing President Trump to seize control over the money supply by dismissing Fed governors at will.

          <p>Microsoft fired two employees for breaking into the office of Vice Chair and President Brad Smith as part of a protest against the company's alleged links to Israel. The activists, from a group called No Azure for Apartheid, demanded Microsoft cut ties with Israel following reports of its Azure cloud platform being used for surveillance of Palestinians. Microsoft confirmed the terminations were due to "serious breaches of company policies" and code of conduct, with both individuals having been arrested. Smith stated the company has launched an investigation into Israel's reported use of Azure, committing to upholding human rights principles.</p>

          <p>A police officer is set to face a gross misconduct hearing following an investigation into the deaths of two teenagers in an e-bike crash in Cardiff in May 2023. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found the officer has a case to answer regarding the accuracy of his accounts, potential inconsistencies, and his driving at the time. Kyrees Sullivan, 16, and Harvey Evans, 15, died after their bike crashed, an incident that sparked widespread unrest and riots. While no direct contact with the police vehicle was found, the hearing will address professional practice and potential breaches of honesty and integrity.</p>

          <p>Iran is deepening its "Eastward orientation" in foreign policy, strengthening ties with Russia and China through its membership in organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS. This strategic shift aims to counter the US-dominated global order and prevent a pro-American axis in the Middle East. Experts suggest this move accelerated after the US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal and recent US/Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear program. Despite some internal criticism regarding these alliances, Tehran is actively seeking military cooperation with China to rebuild its defenses, highlighting Europe's diminishing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Best Buy exceeded revenue and earnings expectations for its recent quarter, showing a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, its highest growth in three years. Despite this modest recovery, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing "uncertainty of potential tariff impacts." CEO Corie Barry noted strong customer response to back-to-school sales and innovation in computing and gaming, particularly with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. However, the company anticipates a potential slowdown in the third quarter as shoppers await holiday deals, and is working to boost slower categories like appliances and home theater.

          <p>Syria's upcoming parliamentary election will exclude three minority-dominated regions—Sweida (Druze-majority) and Hassakeh/Raqqa (Kurdish-dominated)—due to security concerns and absence of central government control. The Kurdish-led Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria condemned the exclusion as "undemocratic," while Druze leaders in Sweida renewed calls for a separate governorate. This decision leaves seats for over 5 million people vacant, further undermining the legitimacy of the indirect elections overseen by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa. The exclusion highlights ongoing political instability and the challenges of forming an inclusive government in post-Assad Syria.</p>

          <p>Signed contracts to buy existing homes, known as pending sales, saw a 0.4% decline in July from June, with cancellations reaching their highest rate since 2017. This downturn is attributed to slightly rising mortgage rates and ongoing buyer hesitation amidst economic uncertainty. Redfin reported 15% of contracts were canceled, with high rates in Texas and Florida, often due to "cold feet." Realtors expect little increase in buyer traffic, indicating a cooling housing market where affordability challenges persist and sellers are slow to adjust expectations, leaving the market in a state of flux.

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster 3.3% annual pace in the second quarter, an upward revision from initial estimates, following a first-quarter contraction. This growth was primarily driven by an upward revision to business investment and consumer spending, alongside a sharp decline in imports. While investment related to AI is noted as a masking factor for underlying weaknesses, economists highlight that the economy grew at an average rate of only 1.4% in the first half of the year. Concerns about a hiring cooldown persist, with investors anticipating Federal Reserve interest rate cuts to bolster economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A $1.2 billion Army contract to build and operate a massive immigration detention complex at Fort Bliss, Texas, has sparked controversy due to its award to a small, inexperienced firm. Acquisition Logistics LLC, with no prior correction facility experience, secured the deal, raising concerns about transparency and standards. The Pentagon has refused to release the contract details, leading to a competitor's complaint and comparisons to Florida's recently ordered-closed "Alligator Alcatraz" facility. Critics, including a U.S. Congresswoman, fear private facilities prioritize profit over welfare, especially as the government expands military involvement in migrant detention.</p>

          <p>The US Air Force will grant military funeral honors to Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot during the January 6 Capitol attack, reversing a previous decision. This move follows a $5 million wrongful death settlement to Babbitt's family and aligns with President Trump's efforts to reframe the events of January 6. Babbitt, a former air force and air national guard member, was killed while climbing through a barricaded door. Critics view this decision, alongside Trump's pardons for rioters and changes in the justice department, as a systematic attempt to portray the assault as legitimate protest rather than criminal conduct.</p>
