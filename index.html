          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major commercial port in Iran near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 18 fatalities and 800 injuries. The blast caused widespread damage, including shattered windows, collapsed roofs, and destroyed vehicles, with the impact felt up to 50km away. Initial reports suggest the explosion was linked to improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, though Iranian officials attribute it to a fire in a chemical storage depot. Warnings about the safe storage of chemicals at the port had been previously issued by Iran's National Disaster Management Organisation.</p>

          <p>Brian Fanion, a Massachusetts police detective, was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Amy Fanion, after investigators uncovered incriminating internet searches on his work computer. Eleven days before Amy's death, Brian searched "gsr testing" and related terms, despite not being assigned to any cases involving gunshot residue. Other searches included common household poisons, divorce laws, and how to make a murder look like a suicide, though the latter was disputed. The case also revealed an affair between Brian and another woman, Cori Knowles, further complicating the narrative.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the shooting death of Amy Fanion led to the exposure of her husband Brian Fanion's affair and inconsistencies in his account of the events. Detectives questioned the lack of gunshot residue on Amy's wound and uncovered deleted text messages revealing a passionate relationship between Brian and Corrine Knowles. Brian Fanion's initial claim that Amy shot herself during an argument was further complicated by the medical examiner's report, which contradicted a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Brian Fanion was eventually found guilty of first-degree murder, though his conviction is under appeal.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that Donald Trump, like other tyrants throughout history, is destined to fall due to his hubris and destructive policies. The article explores various potential avenues for his removal, including impeachment, the 25th amendment, the courts, the media, and even divine intervention. However, the author ultimately suggests that Trump's own stupidity and failures, particularly his chaotic economic policies and blatant corruption, are his greatest enemies and will likely lead to his downfall. The commentary emphasizes the need for democratic means to contain and depose him.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reportedly deported three American children, aged 2, 4, and 7, along with their undocumented Honduran mothers from Louisiana. The deportations have sparked outrage, with the ACLU calling them "illegal and inhumane." One of the children, a 2-year-old, has a rare form of metastatic cancer and was allegedly deported without medication or medical consultations. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing to investigate the deportation of the 2-year-old, raising concerns about due process.</p>
