          <p>The United Kingdom is under an amber weather warning for severe thunderstorms and torrential rain, particularly affecting the south coast, London, and Cambridge. The Met Office warns of potential flash flooding, transport disruptions, and power cuts, with over a month's worth of rain expected in just hours. This severe weather follows a recent heatwave, which has left the ground dry and hard. This condition significantly increases the risk of rapid surface water runoff, making potential flooding more likely and severe for affected communities.</p>

          <p>China's Guangxi province has initiated an "AI for All" competition to cultivate artificial intelligence start-ups with a focus on the ASEAN market. The event, hosted by the regional government, spans 17 tracks including e-commerce, smart agriculture, and tourism. The launch occurred simultaneously in eight cities, including Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur, reflecting a strategy to enhance technological collaboration and economic integration between the regions. This initiative leverages Guangxi's long-standing role as a primary hub for China-ASEAN cooperation and trade.</p>

          <p>Syria's presidency has declared an immediate ceasefire in the southern city of Suweida following a week of violent sectarian clashes between local Bedouin tribes and the Druze community. The conflict has resulted in hundreds of deaths, with graphic reports of atrocities from both sides. Syrian internal security forces have been deployed to enforce the truce, a move approved by Israel on the condition that the Druze minority is protected. The United Nations has called for an end to the bloodshed and for accountability for widespread human rights violations.</p>

          <p>Leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for a nationwide council tax exemption for people with a terminal diagnosis of 12 months or less to live. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that this measure would provide significant financial and emotional relief to patients and their families, who often face reduced income and increased costs for medical care. The move is framed as a compassionate response to alleviate burdens during the most challenging times.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on proposals in France and Denmark to eliminate national holidays to boost economic productivity, connecting it to recent discourse in the U.S. about Juneteenth. The author argues that while former President Trump's suggestion to cut holidays was likely aimed at Juneteenth, this holiday is economically and historically significant, marking the end of slavery which ultimately boosted the American economy. The columnist proposes that if a U.S. holiday were to be eliminated, a more suitable candidate would be Thanksgiving, citing its problematic historical origins and its modern commercial treatment.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are using artificial intelligence to aid the comeback of the California red-legged frog, which had vanished from Southern California decades ago. After reintroducing frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula, scientists deployed an AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings from the relocation sites. The technology successfully identified the mating calls of mature male frogs, confirming for the first time in 25 years that the reintroduced population is successfully breeding. This marks a significant milestone in the conservation effort and showcases how new technology can accelerate wildlife preservation.</p>

Many products use protein claims as a marketing tool while containing high amounts of sugar or being heavily processed. Experts suggest a simple calculation to assess a snack's protein value: a food is genuinely high in protein if 30% or more of its total calories come from protein. They also recommend prioritizing whole foods like Greek yogurt, nuts, and cottage cheese over processed snacks to meet daily protein needs without consuming excessive sugar and additives.</p>

While supporters, including some medical groups, see it as a step in the right direction, reproductive rights advocates are skeptical.

          <p>To avoid impulsive and emotionally driven purchases, financial therapists and consumer experts recommend asking a series of introspective questions before buying. Consumers should consider if the purchase fits their budget, if it's an attempt to fill an emotional need, or if it's part of a recurring pattern of spending. It's also important to research major purchases to ensure quality and value, rather than assuming price equals performance. By practicing this mindfulness, individuals can make more intentional spending decisions that align with their financial goals and emotional well-being.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is seen by many Muslim and South Asian Americans as a significant moment, challenging assumptions about who can represent the city. His campaign resonated with a diverse coalition by focusing on issues like affordability and Palestinian rights, while also embracing his identity. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, his rise has energized grassroots organizations and voters who feel their communities have been marginalized, particularly in the post-9/11 era. His success signals a potential shift in the city's political landscape and the growing influence of these communities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has criticized media reports about the cause of a fatal Air India crash as "premature and speculative." Following the release of a preliminary report by India's investigative bureau (AAIB), which noted a conversation about engine fuel cutoff switches, media outlets began speculating about pilot error or suicide. The NTSB and Indian officials have urged caution, emphasizing that complex investigations take time and that jumping to conclusions based on limited information is irresponsible. The Federation of Indian Pilots has also sent legal notices to news organizations over the unverified reporting.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. Instead of engineering the cells in a lab, this new approach uses gene therapy tools to produce the cancer-fighting cells directly within the patient's body. The team successfully used this in-vivo method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer. This innovation could significantly reduce the cost and complexity of CAR-T therapy, which currently exceeds $139,000 per treatment, making it more accessible to patients.</p>

          <p>Italy is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birthrate has fallen for 16 consecutive years, reaching a record low of just 1.18 babies per woman. This trend is causing towns like Fregona in northern Italy to empty out, with shrinking populations threatening the viability of local services like schools. Despite government initiatives such as tax breaks and baby bonuses, many Italians cite the high cost of living and lack of affordable childcare as major barriers to having more children. Experts suggest that without massive changes in social services and increased immigration, Italy's economy and social fabric face a perilous future.</p>

Many exporters say a 30% tariff would be untenable, making their products uncompetitive and potentially halving their sales in a crucial market.
