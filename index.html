        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump deployed nearly 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to immigration enforcement protests, marking the first time since 1965 that a president has deployed a state's National Guard without the governor's request. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, while Trump officials claimed violence necessitated federal intervention. The National Guard's presence led to tense moments outside a federal detention center, with troops using tear gas and nonlethal rounds on protesters. Trump asserted that Los Angeles was being "invaded" by illegal aliens and criminals, while local officials accused him of exploiting the situation for political gain. Optimism is tempered by the escalation of tensions and the political divide surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, her government explored transitioning India to a presidential system, aiming to centralize power and diminish the roles of the judiciary and parliament. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, advisors proposed a directly elected president with curtailed judicial powers and controlled press. While the idea didn't fully materialize, the Forty-second Amendment Act of 1976 expanded parliamentary powers and centralized executive authority. Despite later reversals and Gandhi's consideration of the presidency in 1982, India remained a parliamentary democracy, though the episode highlights a significant challenge to its democratic foundations.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff and Yu Yongding, prominent economists from the US and China respectively, discussed the future of the US dollar and the potential rise of the Chinese yuan. Yu Yongding asserted that foreign investors' demand for US assets, particularly Treasury bonds, will gradually decline, making it increasingly difficult for the US to sustain its balance of payments and maintain a strong dollar. Rogoff has warned that the US dollar is approaching a crisis of legitimacy, while Yu has advocated for a free-floating yuan and broad fiscal stimulus in China. The economists' views highlight the shifting dynamics in the global financial landscape.</p>

While police budgets are expected to see a real-terms increase over the next three years, negotiations continue regarding the broader Home Office budget. Other ministers, such as Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, have reached settlements, but Cooper is holding out in talks involving both the Treasury and Number 10 Downing Street. The Spending Review is set to outline government department budgets for the next few years amid pressure to balance spending with fiscal rules.</p>
