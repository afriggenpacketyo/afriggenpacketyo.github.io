        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has enacted a new wave of tariffs on imported goods from over 90 countries, raising the average rate to its highest level in nearly a century. This article explains that the tariffs function as a backdoor tax increase, as companies are expected to pass the additional costs on to American consumers, potentially worsening economic conditions. The administration's strategy appears to be using the threat of high tariffs to negotiate trade deals, though the legality of the entire regime is currently under review by a federal appeals court.

          <p>OpenAI has launched its latest model, GPT-5, positioning it as a significant leap forward in the competitive AI race. CEO Sam Altman described the new model as a "Ph.D.-level expert" that is more intuitive, faster, and more personalizable than its predecessors, aiming to improve the overall user experience. While the model shows state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks, the company's focus appears to be on usability and integration, such as with Google Calendar and Gmail, to solidify its market dominance. This release consolidates many of OpenAI's previous models into a single, more powerful and adaptable interface.</p>

Varet, who is also Korean American, accused the congresswoman of betraying the immigrant community, leading to condemnation from the National Republican Campaign Committee, which labeled her a "hate-filled bigot." In response, Rep. Kim stated she is proud of her accent and will continue to represent her community, while her campaign called the comments "race-baiting, anti-immigrant slurs."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court, asking it to pause a lower court's order that restricts certain immigration enforcement tactics in Southern California. A district judge had previously ruled that federal agents were violating the Fourth Amendment by detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The Justice Department argues these restrictions interfere with law enforcement, claiming such factors can heighten the likelihood that someone is in the country illegally and are necessary for their operations.</p>

          <p>The current political standoff in Texas, where Democratic lawmakers have fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort, highlights a concerning trend in American politics. This analytical article argues that such mid-decade, partisan gerrymandering is an example of "total politics," where every available tool is used for immediate advantage, regardless of long-term consequences for democratic norms. The piece explores how these actions, which are now being considered in other states by both parties, create less representative governance and are difficult for voters to challenge, potentially stripping meaning from the right to vote itself.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, pausing all further construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center in Florida. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility was built in an environmentally sensitive area without the required impact studies. While the order halts new construction, including paving and fencing, it does not affect the housing of current or incoming detainees at the facility.</p>

          <p>A property owner in Australia has drawn attention to the severe environmental damage caused by feral pigs, an invasive species found worldwide.

Feral pigs are known for being highly adaptable and difficult to control, causing billions of dollars in damage globally and threatening native wildlife and agriculture. The post highlights the broader challenge of managing invasive species to protect local ecosystems.</p>
