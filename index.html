          <p>Researchers with the People’s Liberation Army have developed the world's first laboratory system capable of simulating the effects of a triple-nuclear strike on a single, deeply buried target. The experiment, led by an associate professor at the Army Engineering University, aims to address the challenge of destroying hardened underground facilities that can withstand powerful conventional weapons. This development underscores the ongoing efforts to model and understand the complex impacts of coordinated nuclear detonations, reflecting a significant advancement in strategic weapons research.</p>

          <p>Amid soaring housing costs and high mortgage rates, a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are teaming up with friends or relatives to buy homes. This trend of co-buying allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome the significant affordability gap, which is especially challenging for single buyers. While offering a path to homeownership and a sense of community, the arrangement also necessitates careful legal planning to navigate potential future complications that are not covered by marital law.</p>

          <p>The future of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program remains uncertain as Congressional Republicans indicate they are waiting for a signal from President Trump before negotiating a permanent solution. Despite some bipartisan support for protecting the program's recipients, who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, the administration's focus on mass deportation has stalled legislative efforts. Lawmakers who previously supported a fix for DACA now suggest that any progress depends on the president initiating the talks, leaving beneficiaries in a state of political limbo.</p>

The arrests in the UAE suggest a deeper connection to global criminal networks, including the Kinahan crime group, and highlight Dubai's role as a haven for organized crime leaders.</p>

At the start of the day, each captain secretly submits the name of one player in a sealed envelope; if an opponent withdraws, that named player must also sit out, and the match is declared a half-point tie for each team.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has announced a plan to start the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to tackle the nation's housing crisis. This initiative is central to Labour's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified several promising locations, with the government set to confirm the final sites and funding next spring, aiming to create modern communities with at least 40% affordable housing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report warns that companies rushing to adopt artificial intelligence without proper planning are likely to incur "AI debt"—the future costs of fixing poorly implemented systems. This debt can manifest as security risks, low-quality data, wasted resources, and employee burnout from using ineffective tools. Experts advise that a thoughtful, structured approach, including clear use cases and employee training, is necessary to avoid these pitfalls and realize the true benefits of AI, rather than treating it as a quick fix.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Trump's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could have the unintended consequence of driving high-skilled tech talent to the Middle East. Gulf countries, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, are heavily investing in becoming global AI hubs and are offering attractive incentives like long-term golden visas, reduced regulations, and high compensation packages. These business-friendly environments could make the region a prime beneficiary of stricter U.S. immigration policies for skilled workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Graham Potter has been sacked as manager of West Ham United after just eight months, with the team sitting 19th in the Premier League. This marks his second consecutive high-profile dismissal, following a brief seven-month tenure at Chelsea. Once considered a top candidate for the England manager role due to his success at Brighton, Potter's reputation has been significantly damaged by his struggles at clubs with higher pressure and less structural patience, leaving his future career path uncertain.</p>

          <p>The reimposition of UN "snapback" sanctions is severely impacting the daily lives of ordinary Iranians, exacerbating an already dire economic crisis. Soaring inflation has put essential foods like meat and rice out of reach for many families, leading to widespread food insecurity. This economic pressure, combined with fears of a renewed military conflict and rising internal repression, has created a pervasive sense of anxiety and hopelessness across Iranian society, with many citizens worried their dreams are slipping away.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the deal brokered by the Trump administration for TikTok's U.S. operations may not be the American victory it appears to be. The author contends that because TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, remains the single largest shareholder, China retains significant leverage over the platform's algorithms and data. From this perspective, what seems like a move to secure American data could ultimately be a major strategic triumph for Beijing, allowing it to maintain influence under the cover of a U.S.-led ownership structure.</p>
