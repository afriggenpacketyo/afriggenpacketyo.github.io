          <p>In Boston, a resident named Jean Powers has established a unique way for neighbors to connect by setting up a "not mail" box outside her home. This initiative invites strangers to anonymously share thoughts, poems, secrets, and art, fostering a sense of community and human connection in an increasingly distant world. Powers, who started the project during the pandemic, has been moved by the heartfelt and personal nature of the notes she receives. The project serves as a testament to shared humanity, allowing her to feel connected to the mysterious inner lives of her neighbors.</p>

          <p>A Baltimore mother is demanding answers after her son, Dontae Melton, died in police custody following a mental health crisis. The case highlights multiple systemic failures, including a significant delay in medic response and a computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system outage during the incident. Just a day prior, a judge had denied the mother's emergency petition to get her son mental health assistance. Melton, who was restrained by police after approaching an officer for help, became unresponsive while waiting for medical aid that never arrived, raising serious questions about the city's emergency protocols.</p>

          <p>WWE star Drew McIntyre is preparing for his return to the ring with a renewed commitment to his physical condition, stating he feels better than he has in years. After taking time off, McIntyre reflected on his habits and realized he was only giving about 65% of his potential, particularly regarding his diet and sleep. He has since hired professionals to overhaul his diet and training regimen, including incorporating new stretching and rehab techniques. McIntyre expressed self-criticism for not making these changes sooner and is determined to prove his capabilities in his upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>Irish cyclist Ben Healy achieved his first Tour de France stage win after a remarkable solo attack during the 201.5km sixth stage. As part of an initial eight-man breakaway, Healy broke away from the group with 42km remaining and maintained his lead to finish nearly three minutes ahead of his closest competitors. Meanwhile, Mathieu van der Poel, who was also in the breakaway, finished ahead of the main peloton to reclaim the overall leader's yellow jersey from Tadej Pogacar by a slim one-second margin. Healy credited his experience from last year's Tour for giving him the belief to succeed.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flash floods in central Texas has reached at least 120, with Kerr County being the most severely affected. As recovery efforts continue, with over 160 people still missing in that county alone, questions are emerging about the adequacy of local warning systems. The tragedy has also become a backdrop for political discussions, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem discussing plans to overhaul FEMA, an agency the Trump administration aims to downsize. Experts warn that reducing federal emergency response capabilities could leave states vulnerable in future disasters of this magnitude.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast have announced they will not assist contractors in dismantling a controversial bonfire built for the annual Eleventh Night celebrations. The decision came despite concerns that the structure, located near a major electricity substation, could endanger the power supply to two major hospitals. Following a multi-agency risk assessment, authorities concluded that intervening to remove the bonfire posed a greater risk than allowing it to proceed as planned.

          <p>A report from the UK Parliament's intelligence and security committee has warned that the nation faces a 'rising' and 'unpredictable' threat from Iran. The inquiry highlighted a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted assassinations or kidnappings of UK-based individuals, primarily regime opponents and journalists, since early 2022. The committee accused the government of focusing too much on Iran's nuclear program at the expense of countering other well-resourced threats like espionage and cyber attacks.

          <p>Recent decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court have significantly altered the balance of power within the federal government, according to legal analysis. The Court has moved to expand the authority of the executive branch while simultaneously limiting the power of lower courts to issue broad, nationwide injunctions against federal policies. This trend has been further amplified by the Court's increasing use of its 'shadow docket' for consequential rulings without full public arguments. These developments are reshaping the constitutional order and the ways in which presidential actions can be challenged through the judicial system.</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates nearing all-time highs, many consumers are exploring debt forgiveness as a potential solution to manage overwhelming balances. This strategy involves negotiating with creditors to settle a debt for a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed. Key signs that this approach could be financially beneficial include situations where monthly interest payments exceed principal reduction or when a long repayment timeline will ultimately cost more than a settlement. While debt forgiveness can negatively impact a credit score, it may offer substantial savings for those struggling with high-cost debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former Kerr County IT director has revealed that a crucial emergency alert during the deadly Texas floods was delayed because dispatchers needed supervisor approval to activate it. Radio traffic from the morning of the flood shows a firefighter requesting a CodeRED alert to warn residents to seek higher ground, only to be told to stand by for authorization. This delay occurred as the situation was rapidly escalating, with first responders already engaged in swift-water rescues. The revelation raises serious questions about the county's emergency response protocols and whether a faster warning could have saved lives.</p>

          <p>A new non-opioid painkiller, Journavx, is offering hope for patients with severe pain but remains out of reach for many due to high costs and restrictive insurance coverage. The FDA approved the drug only for short-term acute pain, such as post-surgery, based on limited clinical trials. This narrow approval means patients with chronic pain are often denied coverage. Even for eligible patients, the high price and short 14-day coverage limits create significant barriers, highlighting a frustrating gap between pharmaceutical innovation and patient access to potentially safer pain management alternatives.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's nomination of Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is a cynical and absurd publicity stunt. The author contends that Netanyahu is exploiting Trump's desire for flattery to prolong the war in Gaza and maintain his own political power, thereby avoiding domestic legal and political challenges. The piece critiques the nomination as a distraction from the ongoing conflict and the humanitarian crisis, which is fueled by U.S. weapons. It frames the gesture as a calculated move to manipulate the U.S. president rather than a genuine recognition of peacemaking.</p>

          <p>Kevin Stein, CEO of the defense contractor TransDigm Group, is facing renewed congressional scrutiny over allegations that his company has made millions in excess profits from federal contracts. A 2021 Pentagon audit identified at least $20.8 million in such profits, but unlike a similar instance in 2019, the company has not voluntarily repaid the funds. Campaign finance records show Stein has since become a major political donor to both parties, raising concerns among government waste watchdogs. Critics argue the case exemplifies a system that allows contractors to overcharge taxpayers with little accountability.</p>

          <p>Scientific research supports the long-held belief that sunshine can improve happiness, with studies showing a positive effect on well-being. Exposure to sunlight is believed to boost mood by affecting brain regions that regulate circadian rhythms and by stimulating the production of vitamin D, which may have antidepressant effects. For optimal health benefits, experts recommend a daily routine of about 5 to 15 minutes of morning sun exposure. While sunlight is beneficial, the article cautions that relationships and other life factors remain more significant drivers of overall life satisfaction than climate alone.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has enacted a new law requiring food sellers to disclose if animal products come from animals that underwent painful procedures without anesthesia. This includes common practices like the castration of pigs, dehorning of cattle, and beak searing of hens. The law, which has a two-year phase-in period, also requires labels to explain that foie gras is made by force-feeding birds. While Switzerland already requires pain relief for these procedures domestically, the law aims to provide transparency for imported products. The move is seen as a novel step towards informing consumers about animal welfare at the point of purchase.</p>

          <p>Grocery stores have evolved from purely utilitarian spaces into powerful brands that cultivate fanatical followings, reflecting a broader cultural shift where consumption has become a primary form of identity. Chains like Trader Joe's, Wegmans, and H-E-B inspire intense loyalty by aligning with specific regional, cultural, or lifestyle values, effectively becoming a form of tribal affiliation for their shoppers. Anthropologists and marketing experts suggest this trend is driven by a decline in traditional community affiliations and the rise of social media. Shopping at a particular store is now a way for consumers to signal their values and connect with like-minded individuals.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Central Texas, false claims blaming the disaster on cloud seeding have circulated widely online. However, meteorologists and weather experts have confirmed that the weather modification technique played zero role in the catastrophe. A small cloud seeding operation did occur 150 miles away two days before the floods, but experts state the technology is incapable of creating or significantly intensifying a storm of that magnitude. The devastating deluge was caused by a natural convergence of storms with the remnants of a tropical storm in a region already prone to flash flooding.</p>

Analysts predict this abrupt deadline will create a 'summer of the EV,' as consumers rush to make purchases before the incentive disappears. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to buy soon to take advantage of the credit. To qualify, consumers must take possession of the vehicle by the deadline, adding to the sense of urgency in the market. (not investment advice)</p>
