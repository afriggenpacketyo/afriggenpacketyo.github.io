          <p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen criticized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for creating chaos at the Pentagon through staffing shakeups and mishandling of classified information. Shaheen pointed to reports that Hegseth shared details about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen on the Signal messaging app with unauthorized individuals. She also highlighted the recent resignations and firings of political appointees, leaving Hegseth without key staff. Shaheen argued that Hegseth's actions demonstrate he is not qualified for the role and is not the kind of leader needed at this time. An expedited watchdog investigation is underway regarding the Signal chat leak.</p>

          <p>The DEA, along with other law enforcement agencies, arrested 114 immigrants in the U.S. illegally during a raid at a Colorado Springs nightclub. The DEA's Rocky Mountain Division stated that those arrested were placed on buses for processing and likely deportation. The raid, which resulted in the seizure of drugs and weapons, appears to be one of the largest single-day arrests of undocumented individuals in recent years. Authorities claim the club was frequented by members of the Tren de Aragua gang, although NPR could not immediately verify gang membership.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that the pilot of a military Black Hawk helicopter involved in a mid-air collision over Washington, D.C., failed to follow instructions from her flight instructor moments before the crash. The report details exchanges between the Black Hawk and air traffic controllers, revealing that the pilot, Capt. Rebecca Lobach, requested to fly by "visual separation" despite being informed of nearby airliners. The instructor, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, reportedly urged her to turn left to avoid the passenger jet, but she did not comply. The crash prompted scrutiny of air traffic control policies and plans to bolster airport systems with advanced technology.</p>

Trump suggested Putin may need to be "dealt with differently," hinting at more sanctions. This comes as the U.S. has been pushing Ukraine to accept a peace plan that many Ukrainians view as unfavorable, potentially signaling a shift in Trump's approach.

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that while President Trump maintains support from his base, there is growing concern among Americans that his administration is too focused on tariffs, leading to disapproval of his handling of the economy and inflation. The poll also reveals that most Americans believe Trump is making major changes to the government and the U.S. economy. While Republicans generally view these changes positively, Democrats and independents express frustration and nervousness. The poll also found majority approval for Trump's deportation program, though more prioritize the economy in their evaluations.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended President Trump's negotiating strategy on trade deals but said he didn't know whether Trump was speaking directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bessent offered a time frame of "months" to hammer out a trade deal with China, but suggested "good behavior" from other countries engaged in negotiations could keep the tariffs from remaining high. He described Trump's strategy as "strategic uncertainty" and emphasized the importance of setting the fundamentals for a strong dollar and economy.</p>

          <p>Republicans in North Carolina have been attempting to overturn an election that did not go their way, challenging 65,000 votes from the state’s Supreme Court election. While the effort has narrowed, the outcome remains uncertain. Legal experts suggest the battle may have created a blueprint for overturning future elections, as judges have shown a willingness to entertain Republican challenges of votes in Democratic-leaning areas based on technicalities.</p>

          <p>With stock and bond markets experiencing volatility, dividend stocks may become more appealing to investors seeking a balance between growth and yield. There are over 100 dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) available, with a growing number actively managed. While tech stocks have faced challenges, dividend ETFs offer exposure to the biggest tech companies, which are also major dividend payers. Actively managed dividend ETFs may be advantageous in volatile markets, allowing for adjustments based on market conditions. Investors are cautioned against buying dividend funds based solely on yield, as the highest yield payers may be vulnerable to dividend cuts.</p>
