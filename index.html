          <p>Ballymena, Northern Ireland, experienced a second night of unrest as rioters threw fireworks and petrol bombs at police, following protests sparked by an alleged sexual assault case involving two teenagers. The violence, which police described as "racist thuggery," led to property damage, including arson and smashed windows, with some residents displaying signs indicating the nationalities of those inside their homes. Politicians expressed concerns that the violence was overshadowing sympathy for victims of sexual assault and highlighted rising tensions related to immigration in the area. Police used water cannons and baton rounds to disperse crowds, and investigations are ongoing to address the unrest and underlying issues.</p>

          <p>Asia is progressively reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary policy changes, and currency hedging, with ASEAN committing to promoting local currencies in trade and investment. The global share of the dollar in foreign exchange reserves has declined from over 70% in 2000 to 57.8% in 2024. This shift is driven by concerns over the dollar being used as leverage in trade negotiations and sanctions, prompting Asian economies to seek alternatives to reduce foreign exchange risks. Countries with large foreign asset holdings, such as Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China, are leading the way in repatriating assets to their home currencies.

          <p>Following an ICE operation at the Ambiance store in Los Angeles, businesses in the fashion district are experiencing a significant decline in customers, leading to concerns about economic stability. Business owners report a decrease in sales and employee absenteeism due to fear of further raids, and the impact extends to businesses that supply the district. A local business owner lamented not knowing how he will pay the rent, and the owner of Marie Shey Boutique commented on families suffering from the separation of their relatives.</p>

          <p>According to PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer report, employer demand for formal degrees is declining, particularly in AI-exposed fields, as AI helps individuals rapidly build expert knowledge. The skills employers seek are changing 66% faster in occupations exposed to AI, such as financial analysts, compared to those least exposed. PwC Global Chief AI Officer Joe Atkinson suggests upskilling on AI at home to adapt to the changing work landscape, emphasizing that the ability to tap into vast amounts of knowledge is amplified in the age of AI.</p>
