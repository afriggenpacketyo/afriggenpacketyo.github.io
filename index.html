          <h2>Kohl's Stock Price Experiences Extreme Volatility in Apparent Meme Stock Rally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 13:57:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of department store Kohl's saw a dramatic 30% surge on Tuesday, exhibiting volatile trading patterns reminiscent of past meme stock events. The sudden increase occurred without any specific corporate news, but analysts point to the company's high short interest and name recognition as factors attracting retail investors on social media platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Despite the trading frenzy, experts caution that the company's underlying business fundamentals remain weak, with declining sales and leadership instability. This market activity is seen as driven by speculative exuberance rather than a change in the company's actual value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump continued his public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling his performance "a bad job" and accusing him of keeping interest rates too high for political reasons. However, Trump appeared to step back from previous suggestions that he might try to fire Powell, noting that the chair's term will end in about eight months anyway. The comments come amid ongoing speculation about Powell's job security and legal questions over a president's authority to remove a Fed chair. The administration has also questioned a multi-billion dollar renovation project at the Federal Reserve's buildings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has appointed former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary in a significant front-bench reshuffle. This move places Cleverly in direct opposition to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and is described by Badenoch as bringing experienced "heavy hitters" back to the forefront. The reshuffle includes several other key changes, such as new appointments for shadow transport and health secretaries, aimed at strengthening the party's position. The changes come as the Conservative party struggles in the polls and seeks to renew its policy direction under Badenoch's leadership.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report found that 27% of workers have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, marking the lowest level since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, reducing the economic pressure that previously drove people to seek extra work. This shift suggests that more people are using extra income for discretionary spending rather than covering basic living expenses, indicating a potential decrease in economic anxiety.

While the city plans a permit program to temporarily exempt some current RV residents who agree to seek housing, critics argue there are not enough available housing units.

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old veteran athlete, has successfully campaigned for Peloton to create new competition categories for its oldest riders. After discovering the fitness company's age brackets maxed out at 60-plus, Dorion, a marathoner and triathlete, launched a 14-month effort involving letters and legal assistance to advocate for change. In response to her persistence, Peloton has now added new 90-plus and 100-plus age categories to its platform. Dorion's story highlights her lifelong commitment to fitness and her determination to ensure older athletes are recognized and can compete fairly among their peers.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a fee of around €73.5 million (£63.5m). While the player has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract, the completion of the transfer has been slightly delayed by negotiations over add-on payments between the two clubs. The 27-year-old striker has been a top target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who is keen to add more firepower to his squad. Gyokeres had an exceptional season, scoring 54 goals in 52 appearances for the Portuguese club.</p>

          <p>This article examines the controversial role of Hikmat al-Hijri, a key spiritual leader of Syria's Druze community, in the recent deadly violence in the Sweida province. Al-Hijri's critics accuse his belligerent stance toward the new Syrian government of escalating the conflict, while his supporters view him as a necessary defender of the Druze people against potential threats. His rejection of ceasefire agreements and calls for international intervention have made him a polarizing figure. The situation highlights the deep sectarian tensions and lack of consensus within the Druze community as it navigates its future in a fragile, post-Assad Syria.</p>

          <p>This analysis by Jeremy Bowen argues that the war in Gaza is at a new inflection point, with mounting evidence of war crimes committed by Israel drawing condemnation even from its staunchest allies. The article notes that while Hamas committed atrocities on October 7, Israel's subsequent actions—including the starvation of civilians and disproportionate destruction—have led to international legal action and eroding diplomatic support. Western nations, including the UK and US, are expressing increasing frustration with Prime Minister Netanyahu's conduct of the war and the dire humanitarian crisis. A potential ceasefire is seen as more possible, but the conflict has reached new depths of animosity.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that the estate of deceased tech entrepreneur Mike Lynch and his former business partner owe Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) £700 million. The ruling stems from HPE's 2011 acquisition of Lynch's software firm, Autonomy, with the court finding that the company's finances were misrepresented during the sale. Lynch, who died in a yachting accident last year, had consistently denied the allegations, claiming HPE had mismanaged the acquisition. The decision marks a significant step towards resolving the long-running, multi-billion dollar legal dispute between the technology giant and Autonomy's former leadership.</p>

While the UK is not a primary arms supplier like the US, it has approved over £500m in export licenses since 2015 and provides 13-15% of the components for the F-35 fighter jets used extensively by Israel. Although the UK government suspended some direct licenses last year over human rights concerns, it argues it cannot stop F-35 components sent via global programs. The article also discusses UK surveillance flights over Gaza, which the government insists are solely for hostage location, and the training of a small number of IDF personnel in the UK.</p>

While President Trump has dismissed the issue as a waste of time, Carlson has channeled his supporters' anger, arguing the government's refusal to provide answers is unacceptable. In recent speeches and interviews, Carlson has used the Epstein issue as a jumping-off point to critique the administration on other fronts, such as foreign policy and economic issues affecting average Americans.

          <p>This commentary from The Atlantic uses the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show as a starting point to analyze the state of comedy under President Trump. The author argues that the new definition of "legal comedy" is one where humor is dictated by those in power, and laughter becomes a tool of coercion rather than shared recognition. The piece suggests that Trumpism's project is to be "the only people in the room," where jokes are only funny if they punch down or align with the president's views. It concludes that in this environment, humor is often used to mask threats, and laughter can be a sign of fear rather than genuine amusement.</p>
