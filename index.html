          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to resume trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war. The meetings, the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports, sought to address the economic impact of the levies, which have disrupted global supply chains and raised prices for consumers. While expectations for a significant breakthrough were low, the fact that both sides were engaging in talks raised hopes for a potential reduction in tariffs and a tempering of rhetoric. The article highlights the economic stakes, with businesses and investors closely watching the negotiations for signs of progress that could alleviate fears of a global economic downturn. The Trump administration signaled a willingness to lower tariffs, but insisted on reciprocal reductions from Beijing.</p>

          <p>China's imposition of export controls on rare earth elements, critical for manufacturing military and commercial products, is causing anxiety within the US defense industry. This move, a retaliation for increased US tariffs on Chinese goods, impacts the production of essential military equipment like jet engines and radar systems. China dominates the global supply of rare earths, accounting for 90% of production. The export restrictions, which went into effect in April, target seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths. This article emphasizes the potential vulnerability of the US defense sector due to its reliance on Chinese rare earth elements.</p>

          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, who was deported to Honduras with her mother, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney stated they are taking time to consider their options and ensure the safety of their children. A federal judge previously expressed suspicion that the deportation occurred without due process. The dismissal comes after the Department of Justice argued it was in the child's best interest to remain in her mother's custody.

          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for violating Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority rules. The Kentucky Board of Stewards determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times with his riding crop, exceeding the permitted maximum of six times. This marked Alvarado's second violation within 180 days, leading to a doubled fine under HISA's escalating penalty structure. All jockey crop fines are allocated to a jockey mental health program. Sovereignty will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to compete in the Belmont Stakes.</p>

          <p>Elana Cohen-Roth, a retired IRS agent from Southern California, has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding an elderly woman out of $1 million in life savings. Cohen-Roth offered the victim fraudulent "investment opportunities" promising high interest rates with no risk. The scheme, which began in 2013, involved Cohen-Roth running a Ponzi scheme where she used money from new investors to pay off earlier ones and fund a lavish lifestyle. The victim was left financially destitute after Cohen-Roth failed to return her money. The judge cited Cohen-Roth's age as a factor in the reduced sentence.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic damage caused by climate change when developing policies and regulations. This directive effectively shelves the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the economic benefits of limiting carbon pollution against the costs to industries. Jeffrey B. Clark, acting administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, expressed doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Scientists and environmental groups criticize the move as a denial of reality, while industry groups support limiting the application of the social cost of carbon. This policy shift could facilitate the rollback of climate regulations, though it may face legal challenges.</p>

Both sides are signaling they want to break the deadlock, but it is not clear who will make the first move. While both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock, the timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. China's foreign ministry framed it as a favor to Washington, saying it was answering the "calls of US businesses and consumers". The uncertainty caused by tariffs has led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years.</p>
