          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating increased to 37%, up from 31.7% in May, according to a Kyodo News survey.  The rise in approval is partly attributed to public support for a policy shift to increase rice production amid shortages and record-high prices.  The survey also revealed opinions on government responses to rising rice prices and upcoming elections.</p>
