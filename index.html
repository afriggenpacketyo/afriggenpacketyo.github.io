          <h2>Single-Stair Housing Reform Gains Momentum to Address Housing Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 06:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A movement is growing to modernize U.S. building codes to allow single-staircase apartment buildings up to six stories, a design common in Europe and other parts of the world. Advocates argue that this change could significantly reduce construction costs and increase the supply of "missing middle" housing, which includes two- to 19-unit buildings that are increasingly rare in the U.S. By eliminating the need for a second staircase, developers could cut costs by about 10 percent and create more varied unit layouts, including family-friendly three- and four-bedroom apartments. Fire safety officials, however, express concerns about the safety of single-stair buildings, leading to ongoing debates and research efforts to evaluate the design's viability. The article notes that at least 15 states are considering or have already adopted single-stair reforms. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the last five years. The Housing Ombudsman warns of a growing imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, with issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety, pest control, and damp and mold contributing to a breakdown in trust. The report calls for a "transformative overhaul" of the current system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a "national tenant body" to amplify tenant voices and landlord accountability. Without change, the watchdog suggests England risks the "managed decline" of social housing and growing social unrest, referencing the Grenfell Tower fire and the death of Awaab Ishak as examples of the human cost of poor housing conditions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares experienced a significant surge in premarket trading following the release of a positive earnings report, triggering a widespread rally in semiconductor stocks globally. Despite challenges stemming from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results surpassed market expectations, bolstering confidence in the broader semiconductor industry and artificial intelligence-related stocks. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, but still posted strong financial results, demonstrating the continued demand for its graphics processing units in AI model training. The article notes that the U.S. has ordered companies to stop shipping goods to China without a license, but Nvidia's performance allayed concerns about dwindling demand.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is holding events in Poland and Hungary, signaling an effort to promote right-wing populism in Europe. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem urged Polish voters to support a right-wing candidate, while Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is positioning himself as a key figure in the "MAGA soft power export." However, these events occur as President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs threaten a trade war with the European Union, potentially straining the relationship between the MAGA movement and its European allies.

          <p>Scientists are expressing concern that Donald Trump's proposed 24% budget cut to NASA could jeopardize future discoveries and prevent the resolution of some of the universe's greatest mysteries. The cuts would disproportionately affect space and Earth science missions, potentially leading to the closure of labs, the abandonment of deep-space missions, and the cancellation of projects like the Mars sample return mission and Venus exploration initiatives. Experts argue that the cuts would halt the "spigot of discovery" and prevent investments from paying off in the future, potentially ceding U.S. leadership in space to other nations. Advocates are urging Congress to defy the president and maintain or increase NASA's funding to preserve ongoing research and future exploration efforts.</p>

The team's upcoming matches against China and Jamaica will serve as important tests for the new-look squad, with Hayes emphasizing the importance of club form in player selection.

          <p>A House Republican budget bill proposes a larger "pass-through" business tax break, potentially benefiting owners of partnerships, S-corporations, and sole proprietorships. The QBI deduction, which allows these businesses to report profits or losses on individual tax returns, is currently subject to income limitations, particularly for certain white-collar professionals. The proposed changes could provide a bigger tax break for some owners of specified service trades or businesses (SSTB) by altering the phaseout calculation. While the deduction has been controversial due to its disproportionate benefits for high-income taxpayers, the proposed changes could further exacerbate this issue, according to experts.

          <p>Commercial pilots face a unique dilemma when dealing with mental health issues: seeking help could jeopardize their careers, while avoiding treatment could endanger themselves and their passengers. The FAA's system of medical reviews, designed to ensure pilots are fit to fly, may unintentionally discourage them from seeking necessary care due to the risk of being grounded. A 2019 survey revealed that over half of pilots reported avoiding healthcare due to fear of losing their flying status. While the FAA has taken steps to address this issue, such as expanding the number of allowed medications and offering peer-support services, significant challenges remain in reducing the stigma and financial burden associated with seeking mental health treatment. </p>

          <p>Amid ongoing tensions between the Trump administration and Harvard University, at least 350 medical research grants have been terminated, affecting numerous faculty members and research projects. The White House has accused Harvard of allowing antisemitism and failing to end diversity, equity, and inclusion practices. These actions have disrupted research on critical topics including tuberculosis, chemotherapy, pandemic preparedness, Parkinson’s disease, and Alzheimer’s disease. Scientists at Harvard express concern that the cancellations are collateral damage in the broader political battle and that potential scientific breakthroughs may be lost, as the loss of research funding interrupts crucial work and endangers the school's educational mission.</p>

          <p>The fragile truce between the U.S. and China is being undermined by the use of export controls, with both countries disrupting each other’s key industries. China has restricted exports of rare earth magnets, critical for various industries, while the U.S. has banned semiconductors from Huawei and suspended shipments for China’s commercial aircraft. This supply chain warfare is disrupting the flow of essential components, impacting industries and employment. Although a temporary agreement was reached to de-escalate the tariff confrontation, the continued use of export controls raises concerns about the stability of the truce and the potential for further economic disruption.</p>

          <p>Chinese students in the U.S. are facing uncertainty after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced potential visa revocations for those in “critical fields” or with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The decision has sparked concerns among students, with some calling it a “new version of Chinese Exclusion Act.” The Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized the move as unreasonable and discriminatory. Some students are considering studying in other countries, while Hong Kong is offering to welcome those discriminated against by American policies. The article notes that the tense bilateral relationship has already led some Chinese students to opt for other countries over the U.S.</p>

Hoover, who was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges, will remain in prison due to a separate 200-year state sentence.

          <p>A partial glacier collapse in Switzerland caused a landslide that has buried approximately 90% of the village of Blatten, prompting a search for a missing 64-year-old man. The landslide, triggered by a large chunk of the Birch Glacier breaking off, sent mud and rocks cascading down the mountainside, submerging homes and buildings. Authorities had previously evacuated around 300 residents and livestock due to concerns about the glacier's instability. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about the accelerated retreat of glaciers in Switzerland due to global warming, with significant losses in glacier volume recorded in recent years.</p>

Instead, Trump should increase pressure on both sides to reach a settlement, leveraging measures such as new sanctions on Russia and bolstering support for Ukraine.

The project will repair the leaky garage roof that the park occupies and construct a new amphitheater, eliminating the need for costly temporary stages. Most significantly, the renovation seeks to address historical injustices by connecting the park to the west side, previously walled off by urban renewal projects. By tearing down a garage wall and creating tiered gardens, the plan aims to heal a civic wound and create a more accessible and inclusive space for the community.</p>
