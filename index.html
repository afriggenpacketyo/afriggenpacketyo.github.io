          <p>The FBI has fired over a dozen agents who knelt during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, D.C., citing a "lack of judgement." The agents' actions were seen by some as a de-escalation tactic, but angered others within the bureau. The firings, condemned by the FBI Agents Association as politically motivated, occur amidst a broader personnel purge under Director Kash Patel, which critics claim is damaging morale and weakening the agency. The association has called for a congressional investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his remarks at a New York protest. During the demonstration, Petro urged American soldiers to disobey orders from President Trump, actions the State Department deemed "reckless and incendiary." This move marks a significant escalation in tensions between the U.S. and Colombia, a historically close ally, amid recent disagreements over anti-narcotics efforts and deportation policies. Petro, who holds European citizenship, stated he is unaffected by the decision.</p>

Major corporate news included Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI, strong iPhone sales boosting Apple, and mixed results for Costco and Boeing, reflecting a complex market landscape.

          <p>Market analyst David Zervos has issued a warning that the rapid growth in artificial intelligence could lead to the loss of three to five million jobs within the next few years. He argues this presents a significant challenge for the Federal Reserve, which could face a scenario of strong economic growth combined with rising unemployment. Zervos suggests the central bank's dual mandate of price stability and full employment will be tested, urging a greater focus on the labor market over inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating the party's policies "will tear this country apart" ahead of the annual Labour conference. He specifically condemned Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, calling it one of the "most shocking things" the party has said. Starmer positioned the conference as an opportunity to present Labour's alternative vision of "patriotic national renewal" against what he describes as Reform's divisive agenda.</p>

          <p>During the second day of the 2025 Ryder Cup, Team Europe's Jon Rahm executed a spectacular chip-in for a birdie from a difficult position in the rough beside a bunker. The shot, occurring on the eighth hole of the morning session, was a pivotal moment in his and Tyrrell Hatton's match against the American pair, Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele. Rahm's incredible play helped halt Team USA's momentum and maintained Europe's lead in a tightly contested match at Bethpage Black.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that his military has received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel, which has been operational for a month. This development is notable given Israel's previous reluctance to provide military aid to Ukraine and its complex relationship with Russia. The transfer signals a potential shift in Israeli policy as Russia strengthens its ties with Iran. Additionally, the International Paralympic Committee's decision to lift sanctions on Russia and Belarus has drawn strong condemnation from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated Austrian-Jewish journalist who fled the Nazis and later returned to Europe as a U.S. soldier, has died at 103. As an interpreter for the Allied forces, he was present at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. Troller became a renowned television reporter, famous for his unconventional and sensitive interviews with cultural figures like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen for German television. He viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing" after the trauma of the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>A spokesperson for Prince Harry has suggested that some sources are deliberately trying to sabotage a reconciliation between the prince and his father, King Charles. The statement came in response to a media report that characterized a recent meeting between them as overly formal and disappointing for the duke. The spokesperson called the claims "categorically false" and "pure invention" fed by individuals intent on preventing a repair of the father-son relationship. This follows years of public strain within the Royal Family.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques President Trump's recent advice that pregnant women should "tough it out" and avoid taking Tylenol, linking the medication to autism without scientific evidence. The author argues that this guidance is not only medically irresponsible but also deeply misogynistic, playing into a history of dismissing women's pain. The piece contends that the sudden focus on Tylenol is another form of "mom-shaming" and an attempt to control women's bodies, rather than a genuine concern for their health.</p>

          <p>Major dating apps, including Bumble and those under Match Group, are increasingly incorporating AI to act as "emotionally intelligent matchmakers," aiming to combat user burnout from endless swiping. These new systems analyze user data on values and goals to suggest more compatible partners, moving beyond superficial criteria. However, experts and past data from sites like OkCupid suggest that romantic chemistry is highly unpredictable and that algorithms have historically struggled to crack the code of human connection. The success of a relationship still ultimately depends on the unquantifiable spark between two people meeting in real life.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a town with many Holocaust survivors. The author recounts the pain the event caused survivors while citing the ACLU lawyer who argued the case, David Goldberger. Goldberger, who is Jewish, maintained that the First Amendment was the true client, arguing that free speech must be protected even when it is deeply offensive. The article concludes that this principle—that speech cannot be banned simply because some find it disagreeable—remains a vital concept in today's divided times.</p>
