          <p>Heavy rainfall has caused catastrophic flash flooding along the Guadalupe River in central Texas, leading to at least 13 confirmed deaths, including children. First responders are engaged in extensive search-and-rescue operations for more than 20 individuals who remain unaccounted for from a local summer camp. The rapidly developing situation prompted a flash flood emergency declaration, with authorities conducting numerous helicopter and boat rescues for people stranded by the fast-moving waters. The disaster struck quickly, preventing officials from issuing advance evacuation orders for the affected communities.</p>

          <h2>Archaeological Study Suggests Neanderthals Used Advanced Fat Extraction Methods 125,000 Years Ago</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study of a 125,000-year-old site in Germany suggests that Neanderthals engaged in a sophisticated process to extract and consume animal fat. Archaeologists discovered clusters of marrow-rich bones from large mammals, indicating these areas may have served as dedicated "fat factories." Researchers believe Neanderthals used tools to smash the bones and then boiled them to render the fat, which provided a crucial, calorie-dense food source. This evidence of organized resource management pushes back the timeline for such advanced food preparation techniques by nearly 100,000 years.</p>

          <h2>Connecticut Law Permitting Quick Resale of Towed Vehicles Faces Criticism as Predatory</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Connecticut law that allows towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizure is drawing sharp criticism from residents who label it as predatory. Critics and affected individuals argue that operators are specifically targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods, where residents may struggle to quickly pay the high fees required to retrieve their cars. One company, MyHoopty.com LLC, has been accused of towing over a thousand cars from a single apartment complex in two years. The company owner defends the practice, stating he is simply enforcing the parking rules of the private properties.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, California, has rapidly expanded to over 70,800 acres, making it the state's largest wildfire of the year. The blaze, which is currently only 10% contained, has prompted evacuation orders for over 200 people and threatens at least 50 structures. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire has mobilized more than 600 personnel and dozens of fire engines to combat its spread. The cause of the fire remains under investigation as firefighting efforts continue across multiple jurisdictions.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, the recently passed tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, but instead introduces a new temporary deduction for seniors. The legislation creates a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below a certain threshold, which can be applied to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts note this measure primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not alter the fundamental taxation of Social Security payments. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.

The artisans, who handcraft the sandals for a modest price, were angered that Prada did not initially acknowledge the design's origins. The controversy has highlighted the struggles of the nearly 100,000 artisans in the industry and sparked a wider debate about cultural appropriation and the need for better legal protection and recognition for traditional crafts. Prada has since acknowledged the sandals' roots and is reportedly in talks with an Indian trade association.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change due to their epic annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists calculate this process sequesters about 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The discovery highlights a crucial, previously under-quantified natural process for mitigating global warming, even as these creatures face growing threats.</p>

The fraudsters exploit weaknesses in the UK's probate system by monitoring a government list of unclaimed estates and then producing fake wills that name them as the sole heir. This allows them to illegally claim property and assets while also committing tax fraud by undervaluing the estates.

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five "toxic" foods he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, sugary cereals and drinks, flavored yogurts high in added sugar, microwave popcorn with chemical-lined bags, and deep-fried foods. The doctor emphasizes that childhood eating habits can establish a foundation for chronic illness in adulthood. He suggests healthier alternatives such as plain Greek yogurt with fruit, air-popped popcorn, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run victory in the final moments at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the last ball, but captain Harmanpreet Kaur was caught, ending their chase at 166-5. England's innings was a tale of two halves, with openers Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge powering the team to 137-0 before a stunning collapse saw them lose nine wickets for just 31 runs.

          <p>Competitive eater Joey Chestnut made a triumphant return to win the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, reclaiming his title after being banned from the previous year's event. Chestnut consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes, comfortably beating defending champion Patrick Bertoletti. The 16-time champion's ban in 2024 was due to a partnership with a rival plant-based hot dog company. In the women's competition, Miki Sudo continued her long-running dominance, securing her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs and buns.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation's founding emerged from deep division and civil war, a complexity that he believes makes the founders' achievements even more inspiring. Burns argued that understanding this gritty, complicated history is essential for navigating modern divisions and that a citizen's obligation is the "pursuit of happiness" through lifelong learning. He stressed that telling fuller, more inclusive stories strengthens the nation's identity.</p>

          <p>In the second Test against India, England wicketkeeper Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out, the highest score ever by an England men's Test wicketkeeper. The 24-year-old's aggressive and powerful innings, which came at a crucial moment in the match, has solidified his place in the team and drawn comparisons to Australian great Adam Gilchrist. The performance is seen as the culmination of a transformative year for Smith, who has quickly adapted to the pressures of international cricket. The article suggests that if he continues on this trajectory, he could become one of England's greatest-ever wicketkeeper-batters.</p>
