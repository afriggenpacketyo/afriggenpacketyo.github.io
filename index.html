          <p>Russell Brand attended Westminster Magistrates' Court in London for the initial hearing regarding allegations of sexual assault. The charges include one count of sexual assault, one of oral sexual assault, two counts of sexual assault, and one of indecent assault, involving four different women and spanning from 1999 to 2005. Brand, who denies all charges, was surrounded by photographers upon arrival and did not speak to reporters. The court appearance is the first step in what is expected to be a lengthy legal process, with a plea hearing anticipated in about a month and the trial potentially a year away.</p>

          <p>Roche and Zealand Pharma have entered a $5.3 billion agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide amylin analog, a next-generation weight loss drug. This move signifies Roche's ambition to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the growing obesity treatment market. Petrelintide mimics a hormone that increases satiety, potentially offering better tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to existing GLP-1 drugs. The deal involves upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments, and both companies will share development and commercialization responsibilities, emphasizing a collaborative partnership.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farageâ€™s Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, northwest England, unseating the Labour Party by a mere six votes. This outcome suggests a rising influence for Farage and his anti-immigration party, potentially reshaping the British political landscape. The victory, attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment and concerns over immigration, marks Reform's first parliamentary by-election win. The article highlights the close margin, voter frustration, and the potential implications for both the Labour and Conservative parties in upcoming municipal elections.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election, with right-wing extremist George Simion as the frontrunner. Simion's rise reflects widespread weariness with the country's political establishment, which has been dominated by clientelistic cliques and corruption. The election is considered crucial due to Romania's geopolitical importance and its proximity to the war in Ukraine. Simion's closest rival is Crin Antonescu, while Nicusor Dan represents a more progressive alternative, but Simion's potential victory raises concerns about Romania's future stability.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) is working to manage a cyber attack that has forced the retailer to temporarily shut down its online operations. The attack has significantly impacted M&S, as online transactions account for about a third of its clothing and home sales. The company has paused online orders on its website and apps since Friday, and the disruption has also affected food shelves in some stores. M&S is not the only retailer to be hit by a cyber attack, with the Co-op and Harrods also being targeted this week.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ended the 'de minimis' tariff loophole on low-value imports, which allowed goods worth under $800 to enter the US without import fees. The White House accuses sellers in China of deceptive shipping practices to exploit the loophole, and US industry associations have complained of unfair competition. The move is expected to increase prices for consumers and potentially disrupt the flow of fentanyl into the US.

The decision, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases involving the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling is a philosophical rejection of the White Houseâ€™s attempts to transpose the Alien Enemies Act into the context of modern-day immigration policy.</p>
