        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested Japan to increase its defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, potentially leading to the cancellation of a planned high-level meeting with Washington. This request was reportedly made by Elbridge Colby, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy. Japan previously committed to doubling its annual defense budget to 2% of GDP by 2027 after Trump's first term. The increased demand will likely lead Japan to cancel a planned meeting of the countries' foreign and defense chiefs. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece suggests that the media's actions underscore why Americans turn to conservative media for coverage that liberals allegedly want to bury.</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports on Donald Trump's increasing commercialization of politics, highlighting the launch of Trump-branded products like a gold mobile phone and patriotically-priced phone plans. Experts suggest that Trump's presidency has become a brand-franchise, blurring the lines between business and politics. The article notes that these ventures reinforce Trump's political persona among his supporters, who see them as proof of his self-made success. Democrats are struggling to criticize this interplay, partly due to similar accusations against Joe Biden.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that a war with Iran would be perilous to American democracy, given Donald Trump's dictatorial tendencies.

The piece contends that any success Trump claims in Iran would be a victory for anti-liberal forces globally. The author concludes that the U.S. is at risk of becoming a military dictatorship, and war with Iran would hasten its demise.</p>

          <p>An NPR article examines a plotline in Celine Song's movie 'Materialists,' focusing on the cinematic depictions of sexual assault and its narrative function. The author draws a parallel to Paul Verhoeven's 'Showgirls,' where a character's trauma is used to drive the protagonist's emotional growth. In 'Materialists,' a character's sexual assault is used to shatter the protagonist's cynical approach to dating and love, leading to her redemption. The author critiques this trope as oddly cynical in a film marketed as a rom-com.</p>
