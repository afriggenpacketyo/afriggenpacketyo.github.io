          <p>U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy met with European leaders to discuss the ongoing war with Russia, focusing on a potential ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine. NATO's Secretary-General described the discussion on security arrangements as a significant breakthrough. The meeting also raised the possibility of a future trilateral discussion involving Russian President Putin, building on recent talks held in Alaska. This summit occurred in the context of Trump's recent meeting with Putin, where a plan involving Ukraine ceding territory was reportedly discussed.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared his intention to eliminate mail-in voting and certain voting machines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, claiming he will use an executive order to enact the changes. Legal experts cited in the article, however, state that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate state-run elections, a power explicitly granted to Congress. Any such executive action would likely face immediate legal challenges and logistical impossibilities, with critics viewing it as an attempt to undermine confidence in the electoral process rather than a feasible policy shift.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals the plight of women in Afghanistan's largest mental health center, where many are effectively trapped due to abandonment by their families and societal rules preventing them from living independently. The article profiles women who are medically ready for discharge but have nowhere to go, highlighting the country's worsening mental health crisis under Taliban rule. With services overwhelmed and a growing waiting list, the facility struggles to cope, leaving many women in a state of permanent institutionalization with little hope of release.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s policing, noting the escalating militarization with National Guard troops from several states being deployed. The author questions the vaguely stated mission of liberating the city from crime, pointing out that there is no clear objective or endpoint, which raises concerns about an indefinite occupation. The piece suggests this action in D.C., where the president has more legal authority, could be an improvisational test to see what can be normalized before attempting similar takeovers in other Democrat-run cities.</p>

          <p>Jasveen Sangha, known as the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges, including one count of distributing ketamine resulting in the death of actor Matthew Perry. She is the last of five individuals charged in connection with Perry's October 2023 overdose to reach a plea agreement with the Justice Department. Prosecutors stated that Sangha supplied the ketamine to others who then administered the fatal dose to Perry. Her plea deal also includes admissions to selling drugs in another overdose death and using her home to distribute narcotics.</p>

          <p>A debated penalty call was the deciding factor in Leeds' 1-0 victory over Everton, sparking controversy over the current handball rule in the Premier League. Everton defender James Tarkowski was penalized after a shot struck his arm, which was positioned close to his body, leading to the game's only goal from a penalty kick. Pundits and players expressed confusion and frustration over the interpretation of the law, which states a player has made their body "unnaturally bigger." The incident highlights the ongoing debate and lack of clarity surrounding what constitutes a handball offense.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated the driver sped off after refusing to lower his window and struck two agents, prompting one to fire in self-defense, with no one being hit. An immigrant advocacy group, however, shared video from inside the car showing agents smashing the windows before the driver fled, followed by the sound of gunshots.

By leaving, they broke the legislature's quorum, temporarily halting the process.

Leaders from Germany, France, and other nations emphasized that future negotiations would be difficult without a halt to the fighting. This diplomatic push followed Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where Trump appeared to back away from demanding an immediate ceasefire. While Trump expressed a preference for a ceasefire to stop the killing, he stated it was not strictly necessary to achieve a final peace deal.</p>

The piece contrasts China's investment in diplomatic infrastructure with the UK's recent trend of selling off prime diplomatic properties for short-term financial gain.

          <p>A new study from Bankrate indicates that, on average, American wages have lagged 1.2 percentage points behind the rise in the cost of living over the past four years. This gap means that typical pay increases have not been sufficient to offset the higher prices that emerged since the pandemic, contributing to widespread economic dissatisfaction. The analysis found that educators have experienced the largest deficit between income growth and inflation. In contrast, workers in the leisure, hospitality, and healthcare sectors have seen wage growth that outpaced inflation, largely due to increased demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Officials in Anaheim, California, have issued a public warning about what they term the "most significant and disruptive" federal immigration enforcement actions seen in the city in weeks. The warning follows several raids over the weekend, including at a car wash and outside a Home Depot, where multiple individuals were detained. City leaders have condemned the federal actions, stating they spread fear and destabilize the community and local economy. The city council recently voted to join a lawsuit challenging the legality and methods of these federal immigration operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A source within Hamas has informed the BBC that the group has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal presented by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is said to involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. The proposal is reportedly based on a framework suggested by a U.S. envoy in June. Israel's official response remains unclear, as the Prime Minister's office previously stated it would only accept a deal that released all hostages at once.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Debt Forgiveness Eligibility for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 16:46:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether debts from 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay can be included in debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, they are technically eligible for negotiation and settlement, similar to credit card debt. However, the process is complicated by the newness of the BNPL industry, meaning many debt relief companies may not have established relationships with these lenders. The article suggests that direct negotiation with the BNPL provider, debt consolidation, or credit counseling may be more effective strategies for consumers struggling with these payments.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Polari Prize, an award for LGBTQ+ literature, have canceled this year's event following a controversy surrounding longlisted author John Boyne. Several other nominated authors withdrew in protest of Boyne's inclusion, citing a recent article he wrote defending J.K. Rowling's views on trans rights and women's spaces. In response to the backlash, which included an open letter from over 800 publishing figures, the organizers decided to pause the prize for the year. They plan to review their governance and increase trans representation on their judging panels before potentially returning in 2026.</p>

          <p>This analysis from the BBC highlights Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's significantly different approach during his most recent visit to the White House compared to a contentious meeting in February. Dressed in a suit and offering numerous thanks, Zelenskyy adopted a more collegial and charming tone, a stark contrast to his previous appearance where he was criticized by U.S. officials. The article suggests this charm offensive, along with a focus on security guarantees and the potential for a trilateral meeting with Putin, marked a more strategically adept performance on the diplomatic stage.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin fell sharply after hitting a new all-time high of over $124,000, dropping to as low as $114,706 amid heightened macroeconomic concerns. The downturn was reportedly sparked by higher-than-expected inflation data, which cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This market shift triggered a wave of over $500 million in forced liquidations of long positions, accelerating the sell-off across the broader cryptocurrency market. Investors are now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's upcoming economic symposium for further clues on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran is on the brink of a severe water crisis, with officials warning that millions of residents could face water shortages within weeks. The critical situation is attributed to a combination of a long-lasting drought, extreme summer heat, and governmental mismanagement of the nation's dams and water resources. This convergence of environmental and administrative failures has led to dangerously low water levels across the country. The impending crisis poses a significant threat to the daily life and stability of the Iranian population, particularly in major urban centers.</p>
