          <p>A Mexican Navy ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to several others. U.S. and Mexican officials are collaborating to investigate the accident, which occurred as the ship was departing from Pier 17 in Manhattan and headed in the wrong direction. Senator Chuck Schumer highlighted the many unanswered questions surrounding the incident, including potential mechanical issues and the role of a tugboat.

          <p>A business owner in Los Angeles has resorted to playing the children's song "Baby Shark" on repeat through a loudspeaker to discourage homeless individuals from camping near their building. Residents of the encampment have complained about the noise disrupting their sleep and sanity. The business owner, Shalom Styles, defends the tactic as a means of survival, claiming that the homeless encampments are detrimental to local businesses. California Governor Gavin Newsom has unveiled a multi-billion-dollar plan to address homelessness, urging cities and counties to take immediate action to clear encampments and connect people with shelter and services. </p>

To achieve this, China needs to deepen its financial markets and improve access to yuan-denominated assets for foreigners.
