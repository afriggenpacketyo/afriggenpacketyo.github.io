          <h2>Media Industry Sees Shift in Leadership Towards Finance and Operations Executives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 08:41:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major media companies are increasingly appointing leaders with finance and operations backgrounds, a departure from the traditional creative and programming-focused executives. This trend, exemplified by appointments at Warner Bros. Discovery, Comcast, and Netflix, reflects the industry's focus on profitability in streaming, managing declining cable revenue, and strategic deal-making. Experts suggest this shift is a response to industry disruption and the need for financial engineering to navigate a challenging landscape and drive growth.</p>

          <p>A prosecutor has asked Brazil's Supreme Court to convict former President Jair Bolsonaro for his alleged role in a violent plot to overturn the 2022 election results. The charges, which could lead to a 40-year prison sentence, accuse Bolsonaro and seven others of attempting to violently overthrow the democratic order. The trial has drawn significant attention from U.S. President Trump, who has supported his ally by threatening tariffs and condemning the proceedings as a political "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, informed President Trump of the company's plan to build ten large AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction slated to begin by 2030. The initiative aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050 and is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value. This ambitious plan follows the recent completion of two Westinghouse reactors in Georgia, a project that faced significant budget overruns and delays.</p>

A key factor was net interest income, which missed estimates due to lower interest rates offsetting loan and deposit growth, though trading operations showed strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Independent Review Recommends Renaming 'Physician Associates' to 'Physician Assistants' in UK</h2>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, prompted by safety concerns and debate over the roles' responsibilities, also suggests they wear standardized uniforms and see patients only in limited circumstances under senior doctor supervision. The recommendations aim to clarify the distinction between these roles and fully qualified doctors, following tragic cases where patients were treated by PAs believing them to be doctors.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that the Trump administration's push for mass deportations is rooted in the misunderstanding that undocumented workers take jobs that Americans are willing to fill. Citing studies and industry data, the article contends that many immigrants work in sectors like agriculture and hospitality that face chronic labor shortages, and their removal could lead to production cuts and higher consumer prices. The piece suggests that rather than creating jobs for Americans, mass deportations could shrink the overall job supply and harm the U.S. economy.</p>
