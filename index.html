        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Syrian-born student and pro-Palestinian activist, was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in New York City.  ICE revoked his student visa and green card, citing activities aligned with Hamas.  His lawyer criticized the detention as politically motivated, while President Trump and Secretary of State Rubio defended the action. Khalil's wife was also threatened with arrest.  The incident follows the Trump administration's recent rescinding of federal grants to Columbia University.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian forces claim to have stalled the Russian offensive in eastern Donetsk, even regaining small areas of land.

          <p>Los Angeles County's new District Attorney, Nathan Hochman, opposes a resentencing petition for Lyle and Erik Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents.
