          <p>The US will "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or those studying in sensitive fields, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Visa criteria will be revised to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move follows efforts to ease trade tensions between the US and China and comes amid accusations against Harvard for alleged coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Trump has also advocated for limiting international enrollment at Harvard, claiming some foreign students are "troublemakers."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car production has plummeted to its lowest level in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and Easter's timing which reduced working days. The automotive industry's transition from petrol cars to electric vehicles also contributed to the decline. While a US court blocked some of Trump's tariffs, those on steel, aluminum, and cars remain, significantly impacting British carmakers like Jaguar Land Rover. New trade deals with the US, EU, and India may offer a boost to production in the future, but current exports have suffered due to decreased demand from major markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing headwinds from US chip export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial results exceeded market expectations, allaying fears about dwindling demand for its graphics processing units. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, also calculating $2.5 billion of lost revenue. The positive results from Nvidia, considered a bellwether for the semiconductor industry, boosted shares of companies like Tokyo Electron, SK Hynix, ASM International, and Qualcomm.

          <p>Global markets rallied after a US court blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs, easing concerns about a trade war's impact on economic and corporate growth. Futures for the S&P 500 index jumped, driven by the court ruling and strong earnings from chip giant Nvidia. While the ruling is subject to appeal, it has lifted investor sentiment and reduced some uncertainty in the market. The dollar rose, oil prices increased, and gold prices slipped as investors reacted to the news, with analysts suggesting that extreme tariffs are now less likely in the long run.

Specific cases include a Treasury team leader holding stock in major financial institutions and Doge aides owning shares in Intuit, which opposes the IRS's free tax filing program.

          <p>Commercial pilots face a difficult decision when dealing with mental health issues, as seeking treatment can jeopardize their careers and flying status. While the FAA has attempted to tighten mental health protocols to prevent severe distress in the cockpit, it has also created a system that may unintentionally discourage pilots from seeking the care they need. This added layer of scrutiny may encourage pilots to conceal mental health issues, potentially increasing the risk to passenger safety. To improve access to care, the FAA is considering changes to reduce paperwork, improve training for medical examiners, and expand peer support services.</p>
