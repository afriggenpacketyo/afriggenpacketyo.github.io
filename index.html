          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 02:35:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities globally are witnessing a substantial increase in rat populations, with some regions reporting a 20% surge in recent years. This phenomenon, dubbed "Ratageddon," is linked to factors such as rising temperatures leading to warmer winters, increased fast-food consumption, less frequent waste collection, and extensive urban construction disturbing sewer networks. Experts like urban rodentologist Bobby Corrigan note rats' prolific breeding and cautious nature, making traditional poisons less effective. The article concludes that comprehensive urban sanitation and environmental care are essential to manage this growing challenge, with New York City's former "Rat Tsar" advocating for public awareness and rat-proof waste bins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black sees Europe aiming to secure an away victory, a feat not achieved since 2012. Key factors for success include a strong start in Friday's foursomes, which have historically set the tone, and effectively managing the notoriously boisterous New York crowd. European captain Luke Donald's calm leadership and experienced team contrast with US captain Keegan Bradley's more cluttered preparations and gaffes. With veterans like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose leading Europe, and Scottie Scheffler as the US standout, the competition is poised to be intense, potentially influenced by former President Donald Trump's presence.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is reportedly involved in high-level discussions about leading a transitional authority in Gaza, should a ceasefire be established. This proposal, backed by the UN and Gulf states, envisions a temporary body before Palestinian control is restored. Sir Tony, who previously served as a Middle East envoy, attended a White House meeting with President Trump to discuss post-war Gaza plans. The context includes recent UK recognition of Palestine and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's rejection of Hamas's future governing role. The article also touches on the ongoing conflict and its devastating human toll in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Rangers manager Russell Martin is facing intense scrutiny and criticism following the team's Europa League defeat to Genk, which marks their fourth loss in seven matches. Former players and a significant portion of the fanbase express deep disillusionment, pointing to a perceived lack of belief, creativity, and persistent defensive vulnerabilities within the squad. Martin's post-match press conferences, characterized by a subdued tone and statements that pundits found perplexing, have done little to reassure supporters. The article underscores a growing sense of apathy and frustration among the Ibrox faithful, who are increasingly calling for a change in leadership as the team struggles both domestically and in Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on two charges: making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice. The indictment stems from his September 2020 testimony regarding whether he authorized the leak of classified information to the media. Comey maintains his innocence, stating he has "great confidence in the federal judicial system" and is prepared for trial. This development follows President Trump's public calls for investigations into his political adversaries, with the probe now led by a former Trump personal lawyer. The article notes the charges were filed just before the five-year statute of limitations expired.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contrasts China's long-term, proactive economic planning with the US's market-driven, often reactive approach, particularly under President Trump. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) meticulously crafts five-year plans, consulting diverse experts to guide growth and reforms. This strategic foresight has driven significant economic transformation over decades. In contrast, the US, despite theoretical monetary and fiscal tools, struggles with policy consistency due to intense political polarization and a general aversion to government planning. The article posits that this fundamental difference in governance styles leaves the US at a disadvantage in a rapidly evolving global landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that South Korea and Japan will provide billions of dollars in "upfront" investments for US projects, touting the success of his tariff policies. While Japan formalized a $550 billion investment deal, South Korea, which pledged $350 billion, is resisting US demands for control over the funds. Seoul officials warn that meeting these demands without safeguards, such as a currency swap, could trigger a financial crisis. The article highlights the deadlock in trade talks and investor concerns that South Korea might face an unfavorable deal or no agreement at all, underscoring the contentious nature of these international economic negotiations.

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks clinched their eighth consecutive victory over the Arizona Cardinals, winning 23-20 on a 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. The Seahawks initially held a 14-point fourth-quarter lead but saw the Cardinals rally with two late touchdowns from Kyler Murray. Despite blowing the lead and Myers missing an earlier field goal, Seattle managed to drive into range for the game-winning kick after a crucial penalty on the kickoff. Quarterback Sam Darnold had an efficient outing, contributing to the Seahawks' 3-1 record, while the Cardinals dropped their second straight game.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on charges of false statements and obstruction is widely seen as an escalation of President Trump's promise of political retribution against his critics. This move raises significant concerns about the weaponization of the Justice Department, particularly given Trump's public calls for such prosecutions and the appointment of a former personal lawyer to lead the probe. Legal experts, like Laurie Levinson, argue that the traditional firewall between the White House and DOJ has "completely collapsed." The article highlights how this case, regardless of its legal merits, serves Trump's broader agenda to target political rivals and undermine the credibility of past investigations.</p>

As of Thursday evening, it was moving northwest with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, extending 90 miles from its center. The National Hurricane Center is also monitoring a second storm system in the northeast Caribbean, which is likely to become a tropical depression and bring heavy rains to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before strengthening near the Bahamas. Currently, no coastal watches or warnings are in effect for Humberto, the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>This article traces James Comey's trajectory to becoming a primary target of Donald Trump, culminating in his recent indictment. Comey's firing in 2017, after refusing a loyalty pledge and confirming the Russia investigation, inadvertently led to Robert Mueller's special counsel probe. While Mueller found no Trump-Russia conspiracy, it revealed Russian interference and the campaign's openness to foreign help. Ironically, Comey's actions as FBI director in 2016, particularly his public statements on Hillary Clinton's emails, significantly impacted the election, providing Trump with campaign ammunition. The article underscores the deeply intertwined and politically charged history between the two figures.</p>
