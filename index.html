          <p>A major political conflict is underway in Texas after Democratic lawmakers left the state to prevent a vote on a new congressional map favored by Republicans. This move denies the legislature the necessary quorum to proceed, effectively halting the special session. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent Democrats from their elected positions, escalating the standoff over a redistricting plan that could significantly impact the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Shares for the design software company Figma experienced a significant 23% drop on Monday, erasing a substantial portion of the gains achieved after its successful initial public offering last week. The stock, which had more than tripled on its first day of trading, fell to $94.50 after closing at $122 on Friday. Despite the downturn, the company's initial market performance indicated strong investor appetite for high-growth tech firms, especially profitable ones like Figma, which now holds a valuation far exceeding Adobe's 2022 acquisition offer.

The manhunt has intensified after it was revealed the suspect, who initially fled barefoot, is now believed to be clothed and in possession of stolen camping and survival gear. Hundreds of local, state, and federal officers are navigating rugged, heavily wooded terrain as they search for Brown, who is considered armed and dangerous.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has publicly called for police forces to release the immigration status of individuals charged with crimes. His comments came in response to the case of two men charged in connection with the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire, who are reportedly Afghan nationals. Farage argued that a lack of transparency fuels online conspiracy theories and public unrest, referencing last year's Southport attack. Warwickshire Police stated they follow national guidelines, which do not include sharing a suspect's ethnicity or immigration status after charges are filed.</p>

When the owners, brothers Abed and Mohammed Assad, attempted to de-escalate the situation, the man attacked them with a knife, injuring both. The suspect fled the scene and remains at large as police investigate the violent incident.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, who broke barriers as the first female director general of the British intelligence agency MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. She led the security service from 1992 to 1996, a period during which she became the first head to be publicly identified. Her tenure was notable for bringing a new level of openness to the historically secretive organization. Dame Stella was also widely believed to have been the inspiration for the character of M, played by Dame Judi Dench, in the James Bond film series.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's stock value decreased after the conglomerate reported a 4% decline in quarterly operating earnings and continued to halt its stock buyback program.

The company also recorded a significant $3.8 billion loss on its Kraft Heinz stake, a move that surprised many investors. With a near-record cash pile of $344.1 billion, the lack of acquisitions or share repurchases has left some analysts feeling disappointed. (not investment advice)</p>

A new study reveals that the culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the bodily fluid of infected sea stars. The epidemic has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star, which has seen a 90% population decline, disrupting the entire marine ecosystem by allowing sea urchin populations to explode and destroy kelp forests.

Klingbeil expressed a desire to secure an exemption for German steel from new U.S. tariffs, possibly through a quota system. He also conveyed disappointment with the recent EU-U.S. trade deal, which established a 15% tariff on most European goods, suggesting that the EU was not strong enough in its negotiations. The visit underscores Germany's concerns about protecting its key industries and jobs.</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 workers at Boeing's defense unit in the St. Louis area have gone on strike after voting to reject the company's latest contract proposal. This marks the first strike for this work group, which assembles F-15 fighter jets, in nearly three decades. The union stated that the offer did not adequately reflect the skill and dedication of its members. Boeing expressed disappointment with the rejection and confirmed it has activated a contingency plan to ensure continued support for its customers during the work stoppage.

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States for six months, a move intended to de-escalate trade tensions. This suspension follows a political agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal aims to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The countermeasures were originally set to take effect this week but will now be paused to allow more time for negotiations to finalize the trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

A Reuters analysis shows the combined downward adjustment of 258,000 jobs was the largest of its kind since at least 1979, excluding the volatile period at the start of the pandemic. These significant revisions, which have occurred more frequently in the past year, have become a focal point of political debate over the integrity and interpretation of federal economic data.

          <p>A new randomized controlled trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. The findings suggest that the level of food processing itself, not just the nutritional content like fat or sugar, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities are gaining attention as a tool for retirement income, but they are not suitable for everyone. This article suggests that near-retirees looking to lock in currently high interest rates and risk-averse individuals prioritizing guaranteed income may benefit from buying an annuity now. Conversely, younger investors with long time horizons, people who may need access to their funds soon, and anyone carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid them. The decision depends heavily on an individual's financial situation, risk tolerance, and proximity to retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
