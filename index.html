          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, after experiencing a significant boom following the 2008 recession, is now facing a market slowdown. Factors contributing to the decline include shifting consumer habits, post-pandemic inflation, and the impact of global tariffs, particularly from the EU and Canada. Major brands like Bulleit and Wild Turkey have reported sales decreases, and smaller distilleries are facing bankruptcy due to oversupply and economic pressures. Experts warn that while the industry's past success fueled growth, it now confronts a challenging period of consolidation and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 19:46:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its portfolio of patents derived from federal funding. The Commerce Department alleges Harvard has breached its legal obligations tied to this research and has initiated a "march-in" process under the Bayh-Dole Act, which could allow the government to seize the patents. This action follows previous administration pressure on Harvard regarding its handling of on-campus protests, which has already led to the freezing of research funds. Critics suggest these moves are a pretext to exert federal control over academic institutions.</p>

          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages," which promise benefits like relaxation and stress relief, is facing scrutiny from health experts. Dietitians and nutritionists are skeptical that the small amounts of supplements like Lion's Mane and L-theanine in these drinks are sufficient to produce their advertised effects. While some consumers find them to be a good alternative to alcohol for unwinding, an advertising watchdog recently banned one brand's ad for making unsubstantiated health claims. Psychologists suggest the perceived calming effect may be more related to the ritual of taking a break than the ingredients themselves.</p>

This article explores the complexities of cultural identity, noting that it often transcends birthplace and citizenship, especially for the second-generation Irish in Britain.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After decades of robotic exploration, scientists have identified a key reason why rovers on the Moon and Mars get stuck in extraterrestrial soil. Previous designs accounted for the effect of lower gravity on the rover itself, but new physics-based simulations show they failed to consider how lower gravity also affects the soil. The sand and dust on other worlds is fluffier and shifts more easily, reducing traction and making it easier for wheels to become embedded. This discovery could lead to improved rover designs for future missions, preventing them from getting stranded on alien surfaces.</p>

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's World War II atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time is testing the improving ties between Tokyo and Beijing. The presence of Lee Yi-yang, Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Japan, is part of a broader effort by Taipei to increase its international visibility and strengthen unofficial relations with key partners. While Beijing is expected to view the move unfavorably, observers believe both China and Japan will act cautiously to avoid derailing their recent diplomatic progress. The event highlights the delicate geopolitical balance in the region.</p>

The event highlights a new offensive by Democrats who are energized in their opposition to the legislation, viewing it as a key issue for the upcoming midterm elections. Gallego's appearance in a competitive Republican-held congressional district is part of a broader strategy by Democrats to attack the bill's cuts to programs like Medicaid. The unified Democratic push contrasts with the mixed reception the bill has received at some Republican town halls.</p>

However, Wilton officials state they were unaware she had accepted a second full-time public office, which would not have been approved.

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans that would allow for the immediate deportation of foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away and barred from re-entry, with their home country deciding if they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues the measure would save taxpayer money and protect the public, as foreign nationals constitute about 12% of the prison population. The opposition has criticized the plan, warning that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals.</p>

          <p>A neurologist is highlighting the cognitive benefits of pomegranates, recommending them as a key fruit for people over 50 to support healthy brain aging. Pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While the fruit can be costly and seasonal, pomegranate extract is an alternative, though consumers should be wary of added sugars and consult a doctor about potential medication interactions.</p>

          <p>The dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long after just two months in office reportedly stemmed from a clash with the White House over sharing confidential taxpayer data. The administration had requested the IRS use its data to help locate undocumented immigrants for deportation, a key part of its immigration crackdown. The IRS reportedly resisted the request, citing taxpayer privacy laws and its inability to verify most of the names provided by the Department of Homeland Security. Long's removal highlights the administration's pressure on federal agencies to align with its political priorities, even when it conflicts with agency regulations.</p>
