          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions, China and the U.S. have agreed to continue communication, as indicated by a recent call between Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau. The two sides exchanged thoughts on critical issues without providing specific details. This development follows previous tariff de-escalation efforts after a meeting in Switzerland. However, China has criticized a U.S. decision warning companies against using Chinese-made AI chips, particularly from Huawei, labeling it "unilateral bullying" and blaming the U.S. for undermining trade talks.</p>

Tariffs and protectionism contribute to division, but the green transition can foster progress across political and economic divides, presenting economic opportunities through clean energy and climate-smart investments.

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by halting its ability to enroll international students and ordering existing international students to transfer or lose their legal status. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. This move follows previous grant terminations totaling $450 million in May, after an earlier cancellation of $2.2 billion in federal funding, prompting Harvard to file a lawsuit against the administration. Pippa Norris, a lecturer at Harvard‚Äôs Kennedy School of Government, predicts this decision will benefit other academic institutions while harming America.</p>

President Trump confirmed their location after a federal judge in Boston found their initial deportation from Texas violated an order requiring reasonable notice before deporting immigrants to a country not their own. Lawyers for the migrants expressed concern for their welfare, citing potential issues with access to food, water, and prolonged shackling. The judge directed the administration to provide the deported men the opportunity to contest their removal from the United States on the ground in Djibouti.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to prevent Harvard University from enrolling international students by revoking its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS). This database is essential for managing and tracking international students, and without certification, Harvard cannot log students into the system. The move is seen as an escalation in the administration's efforts to pressure Harvard to align with its agenda. The termination of SEVIS would leave all foreign students at Harvard in limbo, potentially subject to deportation unless they transfer or a court intervenes.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, as the Bank of Japan considers pausing rate hikes to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. The core inflation figure, excluding fresh food prices, exceeded expectations and marked the highest level since January 2023. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has indicated his intention to raise rates based on price trends but also noted the need to monitor the effects of U.S. tariffs. The core inflation is expected to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation.</p>
