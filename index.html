          <h2>Netflix Shares Fall After Missing Earnings Due to Brazilian Tax Dispute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 08:06:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares declined 7% after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily attributing the weaker-than-expected results to an ongoing Brazilian tax dispute. The company stated this specific 10% tax on payments made by Brazilian entities was not factored into its previous forecast. Despite the miss, Netflix's revenue grew 17%, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue, with the streamer also reporting its best ad sales quarter ever. The article highlights the impact of international tax issues on corporate performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea has become a major hotspot for invasive species, with over half introduced by maritime traffic since 1970. The invasive Asian seaweed Rugulopteryx okamurae, likely transported via ballast water, is now devastating local ecosystems and economies in Spain and Italy, smothering seagrass and impacting fisheries. Despite international conventions on ballast water treatment, enforcement remains weak, and many countries have not ratified the IMO convention. The article stresses the urgent need for stronger controls and international cooperation to prevent further ecological damage.</p>

          <p>Generative AI is increasingly displacing white-collar jobs across various industries, with executives like Ford's Jim Farley predicting it could replace half of such workers.

Entry-level positions in software development, customer service, and clerical work are particularly vulnerable, though physical jobs remain less affected.
