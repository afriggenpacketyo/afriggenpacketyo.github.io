        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has found that it is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted public distrust due to pollution, financial issues, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review suggests clearer government direction, long-term investment approaches, and stronger community voices are necessary. Increased monitoring has revealed the extent of sewage spills into rivers, lakes, and seas, exacerbating the need for urgent reforms. (not investment advice)</p>
