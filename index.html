          <p>Cassie Ventura testified in court, recounting disturbing details of her relationship with Sean 'Diddy' Combs. She described an incident on a flight where Combs allegedly showed her a 'freak off' video and threatened to release it to embarrass her. Ventura claimed that upon landing in New York, she was pressured to participate in a 'freak off' and feared the video's release if she refused. During her testimony, Ventura broke down, stating that Combs beat her during these 'freak offs', making her feel worthless and insignificant. She expressed a willingness to return the $20 million she received from her 2023 civil settlement with Combs if it meant never having to participate in the 'freak offs'.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump unleashed a series of social media attacks targeting the Supreme Court, fellow Republicans, and celebrities. He criticized Bruce Springsteen for speaking negatively about him abroad, questioned Taylor Swift's popularity, and accused the Supreme Court of being 'played.' These posts reflect Trump's focus on domestic issues and his willingness to attack perceived enemies, highlighting challenges he faces, including setbacks for his tax-cut bill and contentious Supreme Court arguments over birthright citizenship. The outburst occurred during his flight back to the U.S. from Abu Dhabi, showcasing his focus shifting back to domestic political headwinds.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued an order continuing to block the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This order grants an emergency injunction sought by lawyers for a group of Venezuelan migrants who claim they face imminent removal under President Trump's proclamation invoking the act. The ACLU argued that the administration's actions violate an earlier Supreme Court decision requiring adequate notice and the opportunity to challenge removals under the 1798 law. The administration contends that the request for an injunction is unprecedented, while the ACLU warns of potential wrongful removals and sentences in foreign prisons.</p>

          <p>Airlines, hotels, and analysts are predicting a bleak tourism season in the United States due to unpopular policy decisions and trade tensions. Canadian travel to the U.S. has significantly decreased for the third consecutive month, and major hotel chains are experiencing slower growth. Political and economic confusion created by the Trump administration's 'America First' agenda is causing both domestic and international tourists to reconsider their plans. While arrivals from most top tourist-generating countries rebounded slightly in April, analysts anticipate further declines in the coming months, with the tourism industry projecting a $12.5 billion loss this year.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the Trump administration's executive order ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and those with temporary legal status. During the arguments, the Solicitor General admitted the administration lacks a plan to implement this order, which is at odds with the Fourteenth Amendment. States argued that the order would create chaos and varying citizenship rules across state lines, while the government contended that nationwide injunctions against the order should be prohibited. Justices raised concerns about the practicality and constitutionality of the order, highlighting the potential for a 'catch me if you can' system where individuals must sue to protect their rights.</p>

Medin was covering protests triggered by the arrest of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, when he was detained.

The Swedish Prime Minister thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European colleagues for their help in securing Medin's release.

          <p>A House amendment to the Republican budget package, which would allow the sale or transfer of approximately 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah, is facing opposition from within the Republican party. Representative Ryan Zinke, former interior secretary, has voiced strong opposition, threatening the future of President Trump's budget bill. The amendment reflects Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's view of public lands as assets to be exploited, which has drawn criticism from conservation advocates. The proposed sale has sparked debate over the value and management of America's public lands, with concerns about potential development and loss of valuable wildlife habitats.</p>

The resolution calls for an investigation by the DOJ and urges authorities to prevent Comey from serving as a federal employee again. Comey claimed the post, featuring seashells forming the numbers, was misinterpreted and that he opposes violence. The resolution argues the post jeopardized Trump's security during a diplomatic visit, referencing previous attempts on the president's life.</p>

While other blood tests have been sold without FDA approval, this clearance provides stricter federal oversight and validation.

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the bulk of savings would not take effect until after Trump leaves office. The move is a setback for Johnson and Trump, who had urged unity behind the bill. Negotiations will continue over the weekend, with the Budget Committee set to reconvene on Sunday night.</p>

          <p>A military parade to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers, with possible participation of 50 helicopters. The event, taking place on June 14, will feature Abrams tanks, requiring metal plates to protect the streets. While the White House emphasizes the parade honors all who served, critics like Rep. Steve Cohen have called it wasteful and egotistical.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House has passed legislation requiring more comprehensive background checks for police officer hires, spurred by the killing of Sonya Massey by a former Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Kam Buckner, mandates that law enforcement agencies review prior employment records before making a final job offer. The legislation aims to prevent hiring officers with documented conduct issues, addressing a gap that allowed Sean Grayson, Massey's killer, to be hired despite concerns raised by previous employers. The bill now heads to Governor Pritzker's desk after unanimous passage in the Senate.</p>

This possible deal, discussed with families of victims, has been met with disappointment and resistance from the families' lawyers. The proposed agreement would involve Boeing paying into a victims fund, investing in compliance, and agreeing to oversight by an independent consultant. The crashes, blamed on changes to flight control software, resulted in a global ban on the 737 Max and intense scrutiny for Boeing.</p>
