          <p>A gunman, identified as Shane Tamura, killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building. Authorities report he intended to target the NFL offices located in the same building but took the wrong elevator. A note found on Tamura indicated he believed he suffered from CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition. The investigation revealed Tamura had a history of mental health incidents but legally purchased the firearms used in the attack, prompting renewed debate over gun control laws.</p>

          <p>HSBC reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, a 29% decrease from the previous year and below analyst expectations, citing impairment charges and increased operating costs. In response, the bank has announced a substantial $3 billion share buyback program. This financial report comes as HSBC undergoes a significant restructuring, including staff reductions in its European investment banking division, to cut costs and refocus its operations on Asian and Middle Eastern markets. The bank also noted that ongoing global trade tensions are creating macroeconomic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is conducting a three-day hearing to investigate the January midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter near Reagan National Airport (DCA), which killed all 67 people aboard. The investigation is examining the notoriously congested airspace around DCA, potential malfunctions with the helicopter's altimeters, and possible communication breakdowns with air traffic control. The hearing aims to establish facts and produce safety recommendations for the FAA, rather than assign blame for the deadliest U.S. aviation accident since 2001.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has reversed an earlier decision and will now include YouTube in its landmark social media ban for children under 16, set to begin in December. The move follows a recommendation from the eSafety Commissioner, who noted YouTube was the most frequently cited platform where children encountered harmful content. While users under 16 can still view videos, they will be prohibited from having an account for uploading or interacting. The policy, which also covers platforms like TikTok and Instagram, has been praised by ministers as a necessary step to protect children from predatory algorithms.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom is set to issue an executive order that will allow local governments in the Los Angeles area to bypass a state housing law, SB 9, in neighborhoods designated as very high-risk for wildfires. This decision follows pressure from L.A. officials who raised concerns that the law, which permits building up to four units on single-family lots, could dangerously increase population density in fire-prone areas like Pacific Palisades. Officials argued that such development would strain evacuation routes and infrastructure, fundamentally altering the safety of these communities, especially during rebuilding efforts after a fire.</p>

The policy shift has drawn mixed reactions, with some UK political parties calling for immediate, unconditional recognition, while others argue the timing is inappropriate.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced its decision to revoke the 2009 "endangerment finding," a key scientific determination that classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal basis for regulating emissions from vehicles and power plants for over a decade. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action, while critics condemned it as scientifically unfounded and dangerous. Environmental groups and former EPA officials have vowed to challenge the decision in court, citing overwhelming evidence of climate change's harmful impacts.</p>

Despite the cautious outlook, Singapore's economy grew 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, avoiding a technical recession. The Monetary Authority of Singapore uses its currency's exchange rate, rather than interest rates, as its primary policy tool and stated its current stance is appropriate to manage risks.

This slowdown in inflation, driven partly by a fall in transport costs, strengthens the argument for the RBA to consider another interest rate cut at its next meeting.
