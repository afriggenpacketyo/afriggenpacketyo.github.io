          <p>The United States and the European Union have established a framework for a major trade deal, imposing a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported into the U.S. This article analyzes the immediate impacts, identifying President Trump and U.S. carmakers as potential winners, while U.S. consumers, German car manufacturers, and the EU pharmaceutical industry may face negative consequences. The deal, which still requires ratification by all 27 EU member states, has already exposed divisions within the bloc, with some leaders criticizing the terms. The agreement's true economic effects will become clearer with upcoming data on inflation and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over a year ago, Boeing is beginning to stabilize after a period of intense crisis, with company shares rising over 30% this year. The manufacturer has increased aircraft production and deliveries, and analysts anticipate it will report halved quarterly losses and potentially its first annual profit since 2018 next year. Despite these gains and improved relations with airline customers like Ryanair, Boeing still faces significant challenges, including an FAA production cap on the 737 Max and ongoing delays with other models. Ortberg's hands-on approach is credited with improving the company's culture and operational consistency.</p>

          <p>Following mediation talks in Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end recent border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chaired the ASEAN-led discussions. The conflict, which erupted after a landmine explosion, had led to diplomatic recalls and border closures. The deal came after international pressure, including from the United States, which warned that trade deals could be jeopardized if hostilities continued, signaling a significant step toward de-escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>Despite Fox News's long-standing support for Donald Trump, 94-year-old media mogul Rupert Murdoch is now positioning his company for a legal battle with the president. The conflict escalated after the Wall Street Journal, a Murdoch-owned paper, published a story about Trump's connection to Jeffrey Epstein, prompting a $10 billion lawsuit from Trump. This article explores the complex motivations behind Murdoch's stance, suggesting it could be a mix of business strategy, a desire to back a winning side, and a personal rivalry. In a media landscape where other outlets have seemingly bent to political pressure, Murdoch's defiance positions him as an unlikely defender of press freedom.</p>

The company, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, also projected a significant revenue increase, attributing the growth to both online and offline expansion. However, the stock, which has surged over 2,000% since its listing last year, declined as investors appeared to lock in profits. Analysts suggest the drop is due to a reset in market expectations and concerns over rising gold prices, though some believe the company's valuation has become more attractive.

The U.S. government is now heavily dependent on SpaceX for launches and national security, giving Musk immense influence over America's future in space.

          <p>A recent report from Renmin University indicates that the international use of China's yuan grew by approximately 11% in 2024, strengthening its position in the global financial system. While the U.S. dollar remains dominant, its influence slightly decreased, whereas the yuan now ranks ahead of the British pound and Japanese yen. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the rise of U.S.-backed stablecoins is identified as a potential threat to the currency's continued expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is set to report earnings amid significant challenges, including a nearly 50% drop in its share price this year and ongoing Department of Justice investigations into its Medicare billing practices. The company's profits have been hit by declining performance in its Medicare Advantage program and its Optum Health physician practices, leading to an abrupt CEO change. Investors are now looking for a clear recovery plan from reinstated CEO Stephen Hemsley, who will need to address concerns about profit margins, the impact of new reimbursement rules, and the potential fallout from the federal probes.

          <p>A tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity projects that the new U.S.-EU trade deal, which imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods, will cause a dramatic shift in global trade. The model forecasts that global exports to the U.S. will drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent years, as countries rewire their trade relationships away from the U.S. to avoid the new tariffs. While U.S. exports are expected to increase, the simulation suggests a significant decrease in imports from major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico, potentially leading to less product diversity for American consumers.

They also condemned aid airdrops as ineffective and dangerous, pointing out that land crossings with stockpiled aid remain largely inaccessible.

Buttigieg believes that while the current administration is damaging key institutions, it is also wrong to assume those institutions were perfect before. He advocates for a forward-looking approach that embraces change and fundamentally rethinks how government agencies and policies should function to better serve the country.</p>

          <p>Psychologists and nutrition experts are highlighting that some children have a naturally strong food reward drive, making them more susceptible to overeating ultra-processed foods. These children often feel hungry, eat quickly, and struggle with satiety signals, which can lead to health problems in an environment where such foods are ubiquitous. This article suggests that standard advice may not work for these kids and offers tailored strategies for parents. Recommendations include keeping ultra-processed foods out of the home, limiting variety, and teaching children to make healthier choices in social settings, rather than completely forbidding certain foods.</p>

Health advocates and participants report that excessive red tape, technical failures, and confusing communication lead to improper denials and loss of essential care. Critics argue that these systems are expensive to run and primarily serve to cut people off from insurance rather than promote employment.</p>
