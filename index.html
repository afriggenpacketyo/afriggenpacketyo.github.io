            <p>This article examines how Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has systematically eroded democratic institutions in Hungary, offering lessons for aspiring autocrats. It details Orban's strategies, including media control, undermining the judiciary, and university takeovers, with the help of EU funds. The article also highlights the growing opposition to Orban and the parallels between his methods and those of Donald Trump, noting the accelerated pace of Trump's actions. Furthermore, it discusses the government's targeting of the LGBTQ+ community and the limitations of Orban's model due to Hungary's proximity to Europe and its open society. The article shows that the dismantling of democracy is a step-by-step process over the years.</p>

            <p>Two people died in Moore, Oklahoma, after their vehicles were swept away by floodwaters caused by heavy rainfall, with over 30 million Americans under severe weather alerts during Easter weekend. Emergency responders recovered the bodies of an adult female and a 12-year-old child from one of the vehicles, while three others were rescued from the submerged vehicles. The flooding was described as a historical weather event, leading to numerous high-water incidents across the city. The police department extended gratitude to neighboring agencies for their assistance in rescue efforts, urging residents to stay home if possible due to waterlogged roads and neighborhoods.</p>

            <p>While tongue scraping gains popularity as a dental health practice, experts caution about potential heart health risks. Dr. Bradley Serwer notes the link between oral hygiene and heart health, raising concerns that tongue scraping could cause cuts, introducing bacteria into the bloodstream and increasing endocarditis risk. Dr. Whitney White advises moderation, as excessive scraping can disrupt nitric oxide levels, impacting blood pressure. Serwer emphasizes that regular dental visits, brushing, and flossing outweigh tongue scraping's minimal benefits, advising it should not replace essential oral hygiene practices. The article suggests that gentle, occasional tongue scraping is preferred to maintain oral health.</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 05:00:00 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>This article explores the Texas Easter tradition of cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, and their cultural significance. Denise Solis carries on the tradition started by her mother, who passed away before Easter in 2003, by making cascarones with her son. Cascarones, common in Texas and Northern Mexico, symbolize rebirth and are playfully broken over people's heads. Norma Cantu, a Humanities Professor at Trinity University, explains the egg's pre-Christian symbolism of fertility and resurrection, which was later adapted to Easter. For Solis, cascarones represent a powerful connection to her past and a way to share love and joy with her family.</p>

            <p>China has shown a shift in its non-interference policy in African conflicts by directly criticizing Rwanda's support for the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Beijing, through its UN ambassador, has urged Kigali to withdraw its troops from the DRC and voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role. Observers suggest this is to protect China's mining interests and relationships with both countries. This measured approach reflects Beijing's effort to balance its non-interference stance with the need to safeguard its economic interests in the region.</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for shipments worth more than $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays for shipments over $800, though business-to-business shipments will still proceed with potential delays. The White House is set to clamp down on deliveries under $800, particularly those from China and Hong Kong, by removing the "de minimis" rule, which allows low-value packages to enter the US without duties. Shein and Temu have warned that they will increase prices as a result of these changes.</p>

            <p>Three Indian and two Chinese students have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the termination of F-1 visas for international students. The ACLU lawsuit accuses the administration of unilaterally terminating visas, causing financial and academic hardship without required notice. The students face potential deportation and degree abandonment, despite significant financial investments. The Trump administration's tightening of student visa policies has sparked widespread concern, particularly among Chinese and Indian students, who constitute a large portion of international students in the US, with over 1,000 visas revoked since late March.</p>
