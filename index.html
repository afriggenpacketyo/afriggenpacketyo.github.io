          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was recorded in the New York City and New Jersey region on Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While residents reported feeling brief shaking, there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such minor quakes are not unusual for the East Coast and are not expected to cause significant damage. The event follows a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred in the same region in April 2024.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This non-criminal investigation stems from a referral by Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial activities against Donald Trump were politically motivated to influence the 2024 election. The OSC is an independent federal agency responsible for enforcing the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from engaging in certain political activities. Smith and former Attorney General Merrick Garland had previously denied any political motivation.</p>

          <p>More than three decades after the brutal murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved. This article recounts the horrific 1991 crime, the subsequent investigation, and the long-lasting trauma for the victims' families. It details the initial arrests and confessions, which were later overturned due to constitutional issues and conflicting DNA evidence. Investigators and family members still hope that advancements in DNA technology, focusing on a small male DNA sample found at the scene, might one day identify the killer or killers.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop Advanced Drone-Based Electronic Warfare System</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 22:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones. By precisely coordinating their signals, the drones can create an "electromagnetic storm eye," effectively jamming enemy communications while simultaneously creating a protected bubble for friendly forces where interference is canceled out. This targeted approach represents a significant advancement over traditional brute-force jamming methods that disrupt all signals in an area. The technology aims to provide a strategic advantage for the People's Liberation Army in complex battlefield environments.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was a key motivator for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment. In an interview, Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, explained that he felt unsuited for the emotional demands of the medical profession. Witnessing his stepfather pass away at age 54 before he could enjoy retirement solidified his resolve to follow his passion for comedy. Hill recalled the immense relief he felt upon leaving his hospital job for the last time, embarking on a new path that was both exciting and terrifying.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for a fee of around £30 million. Despite Hojlund expressing his desire to stay at the club, the potential sale is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. While the club has not finalized a deal for Sesko, his arrival would likely marginalize Hojlund. United sources indicate that any major incoming transfers would necessitate player sales to comply with the Premier League's profit and sustainability regulations, placing Hojlund's future at the club in doubt.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it will be more cautious with its open-source approach in the future. This shift in strategy contrasts with China's recent surge in releasing advanced, open-source AI models from companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI. Renowned AI expert Andrew Ng has suggested that China's competitive, "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be a path for the country to surpass the U.S. in AI development. While top proprietary models still originate from U.S. labs, Chinese firms are increasingly dominating the open-source space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of what killed a platypus sent to Winston Churchill as a gift from Australia during World War Two. The platypus, named Winston, died just days before reaching England in 1943, with long-held rumors blaming shell-shock from a nearby Nazi submarine encounter. However, new analysis of the platypus attendant's logbook by university researchers reveals the more probable cause was heatstroke. The records show that water and air temperatures on the ship climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as it crossed the equator, suggesting the animal was essentially cooked alive.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Kori Schake, a conservative foreign policy expert from the American Enterprise Institute, argues that President Trump's approach is dangerously isolating the United States on the world stage. Schake contends that Trump's conviction that allies are a burden and his use of arbitrary tariffs are causing other nations, including key partners like Japan, to hedge against American power. She warns that this could lead to a post-American world where international cooperation falters, making it more expensive and difficult for the U.S. to protect its interests without the help of its allies.</p>

          <p>Author Carol Mason discusses her new book, "From The Clinics To The Capitol," which argues that the American anti-abortion movement has become increasingly intertwined with far-right and white nationalist extremism. Mason traces the evolution of rhetoric from simply opposing abortion to an insurrectionary mindset that sees the rule of law as something to be ignored, connecting the tactics used at clinics to the January 6 Capitol riot. She contends that the movement has facilitated intersections among various far-right groups, unified by a conspiratorial worldview and the idea that Western Christian civilization is under threat.</p>
