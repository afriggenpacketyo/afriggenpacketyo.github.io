          <p>President Donald Trump officially pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, had appealed to the Trump administration for pardons for her parents and spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention. The couple, famous for "Chrisley Knows Best," were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution for providing false information to banks and fabricating bank statements. The charges against the Chrisleys stem from activity that occurred as early as 2007, and prosecutors described their actions as a "fifteen-year fraud spree."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the emerging critique of his tariff policies, known as the "TACO trade," which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out." This term describes a pattern where Trump announces tariffs, markets decline, and then he eases them, causing markets to rebound. When asked about the term, Trump denied backing down and argued that his actions have helped the U.S. in trade negotiations, citing the European Union's willingness to meet after he threatened a 50% tariff. He emphasized that his approach is a negotiation tactic, not a sign of weakness.</p>

Authorities are investigating the killings as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism, raising questions about shifts in political violence, which has historically been associated with the far-right. The conflict in Gaza has spurred increased political violence, with numerous instances of physical conflict and property damage at U.S. demonstrations related to the war.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry. Despite political tensions, Nvidia continues to experience strong growth due to high demand for its artificial intelligence chips, used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.</p>

Hoover was already serving a 200-year sentence on state charges in Illinois for a 1973 murder when he was convicted of federal charges in 1997. Federal prosecutors had accused him of leading a criminal enterprise to continue overseeing the gang while in prison. It's unclear how soon he will be released from federal custody, as he still faces the remainder of his 200-year sentence in Illinois.</p>

          <p>Canada's decision to cull 400 ostriches on a British Columbia farm due to avian flu has drawn criticism from Trump administration officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz. Kennedy urged Canadian authorities to conduct further testing to better understand the virus, while Oz offered to relocate the birds to his ranch in Florida. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) ordered the culling to prevent the virus from mutating and spreading, despite arguments from the farm owners to keep the birds alive for research.</p>
