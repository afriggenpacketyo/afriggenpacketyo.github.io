          <p>This article recounts the harrowing experiences of Robert Violante and Carl Denaro, two men who survived attacks by the "Son of Sam" serial killer, David Berkowitz, in the late 1970s. Violante describes being shot on his first date, which resulted in the death of his companion Stacy Moskowitz and left him permanently blind, derailing a promising modeling career. Denaro shares his own story of being shot and the long-term impact of the attack on his life, while both men reflect on the killer's eventual capture. The piece highlights their resilience and the profound, lifelong consequences of the violence they endured.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an interview with prosecutor Bill Thompson, investigators have not ruled out the possibility that Bryan Kohberger used a second weapon in the University of Idaho murders. Thompson suggested that some injuries on victim Kaylee Goncalves appeared distinct from those caused by the primary knife. He also theorized that Kohberger may have spared a surviving roommate because he panicked and was scared after spending more time and killing more people than he had planned. The prosecutor emphasized that DNA evidence found on a knife sheath was critical to building the case against Kohberger.</p>

          <p>Clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators outside hotels housing asylum seekers in England have resulted in fifteen arrests across London, Newcastle, and Manchester. Police imposed special restrictions in London to manage the protests, which were organized by local residents but endorsed by outside groups. In response to the situation, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the number of people housed in hotels. The government aims to end the use of hotels for migrants by 2029, a move it claims will save £1 billion annually.</p>

The OSC, an independent agency that enforces rules for civil service members, does not have criminal authority but can recommend disciplinary action. This investigation is one of several recent inquiries into former officials under the Trump administration, including former FBI director James Comey.</p>

Despite the cutthroat nature of the situation, where only one will make the final 53-man roster, both athletes maintain a friendly and supportive relationship.

Illegal mining is a significant issue in South Africa, which has thousands of abandoned mines that attract "zama-zamas," or illegal miners, many of whom are from neighboring countries.

          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has surged to €3,248, a sum that is increasingly unaffordable for many, given the average monthly pension is around €1,100.

With an aging population and a system on the verge of collapse, German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance. Experts suggest solutions could include introducing tax revenue into the system or increasing contributions from higher earners.</p>

          <p>World champion sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson was arrested for a fourth-degree domestic violence offense following an alleged assault on her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman, at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. According to the police report, camera footage showed Richardson grabbing Coleman's backpack and shoving him into a wall. Coleman reportedly declined to participate further in the investigation or be considered a victim. The arrest occurred just days before Richardson was set to compete at the U.S. track and field championships, where she has an automatic bye to the world championships as the defending 100m champion.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people, particularly adults under 30, are turning to TikTok as a regular source for news, favoring creators and news-adjacent memes over traditional media outlets. Content creators like Aaron Parnas have amassed millions of followers by delivering rapid-fire updates on current events, catering to a demand for quick and convenient information. While users feel this format is more direct and less agenda-driven, experts raise concerns about the potential for misinformation and the lack of depth in content designed for the platform's algorithm. The trend highlights a significant shift in media consumption habits, moving away from established news institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited President Trump's sweeping ban on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court ruled that the administration cannot use the ban to summarily deport migrants without considering their eligibility for other mandatory humanitarian protections, such as "withholding of removal" or relief under the Convention Against Torture. However, the court did allow the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system itself. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging the president's proclamation, which has been used to expel migrants without allowing them to make protection claims.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts federal immigration agents from conducting "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area based on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit Court agreed that such sweeps, which have targeted locations like car washes, likely violated the Constitution's protection against unreasonable seizures. The ruling requires agents to have reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country illegally before detaining them. The decision is a setback for the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement and mass deportation campaign in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton described his own driving as "terrible" and "useless" after he qualified in a disappointing 12th place for the Hungarian Grand Prix. While Hamilton struggled, his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, the team's first of the year. Hamilton's result continues a trend of qualifying struggles this season compared to his teammate. Leclerc attributed his unexpected pole to changing wind conditions that disrupted competitors and an improved car that gives him more confidence to push the limits.</p>

The U.S. Forest Service confirmed the leak was located and is being fixed, but water quality testing will continue to ensure public safety. This incident follows a major sewage spill on the lake's northern shore last summer, which resulted in a significant fine for the responsible parties.</p>

The investigation found signatures from people who claim they were forged, including three deceased individuals, as well as others who say they were deceived into signing. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far more than the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the practices of contractors hired to gather them.

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, ending with a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after hitting a record high on Monday. The market was rattled by a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new positions, far below expectations. This data, along with President Trump's subsequent criticism of the Federal Reserve and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, increased market uncertainty. The week also included a Fed decision to hold interest rates steady, new tariff announcements, and a wave of major tech earnings reports, all contributing to investor anxiety.

These include a lack of a formal financial plan, excessive spending on brand-name items to project an image of wealth, and confusing high income with actual wealth by not saving. Other red flags are a lack of financial discipline, characterized by frequent impulse buying, and a tendency to chase get-rich-quick schemes instead of pursuing steady, long-term wealth-building strategies. The piece suggests that many people, including high earners, live paycheck to paycheck without adequate savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the disciplinary issue, England's performance was overwhelming, with players like Helena Rowland scoring a hat-trick.
