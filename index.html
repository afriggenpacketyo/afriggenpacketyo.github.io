          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in Hong Kong and mainland China, experienced significant declines following a renewal of trade hostilities between the U.S. and China. The downturn was triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of new retaliatory tariffs and China's subsequent defiant response, stating it is "not afraid" of a trade war. The escalating rhetoric has reintroduced volatility and uncertainty into global financial markets, overshadowing recent positive economic data. (not investment advice)</p>
