          <p>President Trump recently declared foreign workers "welcome" in the United States, expressing a desire not to deter international investment. This statement comes just days after a large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Georgia, where nearly 475 South Korean nationals were arrested at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery factory. ICE officials alleged visa overstays or unauthorized manual labor, an operation that caused significant alarm in South Korea and prompted calls for an official apology. Trump emphasized his support for temporarily allowing foreign experts to teach US workers specialized manufacturing skills, framing it as a strategy for domestic industrial growth.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of "underwater" car trade-ins, where individuals owe more on their auto loans than their vehicles are worth, has surged to a four-year high, impacting a significant portion of new car purchases. According to Edmunds, 26.6% of trade-ins in Q2 2025 had negative equity, with an average amount owed of $6,754. This situation forces consumers to either pay the balance in cash or roll it into a new loan, exacerbating financial strain. The article highlights that longer loan terms and smaller down payments contribute to this issue, recommending strategies like improving credit scores, securing loan pre-approvals, and considering gap insurance to navigate these challenges effectively.

          <p>In the aftermath of the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Trump claimed that many individuals on "the left" are under investigation, pointing to them as the sole source of political division. This assertion follows the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, the alleged shooter, and comes amid a broader context of Republicans blaming liberal rhetoric for fostering anti-conservative violence. Trump's Sunday comments notably avoided calls for national unity, instead intensifying his focus on what he described as "vicious and horrible" radicals from the left.

          <p>American farmers are currently enduring a severe economic squeeze, primarily driven by President Trump's tariff policies and escalating trade disputes with China, which have led to a drastic reduction in international crop orders and a five-year high in farmer bankruptcies. Despite these financial pressures, many rural Americans, a key voting bloc for Trump, maintain their support, believing the tariffs will eventually "make us great again." The article delves into this complex loyalty, noting that factors like a strong "rural identity" and selective blame attribution in a polarized political climate contribute to their continued backing. This situation raises questions about the long-term sustainability of this support if economic improvements are not realized soon.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed Charles Mwesigwa, a self-proclaimed former London bus driver, as the alleged orchestrator of a degrading sex-trade ring exploiting vulnerable Ugandan women in Dubai's upscale neighborhoods. Women were reportedly lured with promises of legitimate jobs, only to be trapped in sexual exploitation to repay exorbitant, fabricated debts. Undercover reporting and victim testimonies detail extreme demands from clients, including requests for gang-rape, and allegations of police dismissing victims' pleas for help. The article also raises serious concerns about the suspicious deaths of two women linked to Mwesigwa, who fell from high-rise apartments, with their families disputing the official suicide conclusions and highlighting a wider issue of exploitation in the Gulf.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy asserts that Manchester United's ongoing struggles are primarily due to personnel choices and players being deployed in unsuitable positions, rather than inherent flaws in Ruben Amorim's 3-4-2-1 system. Despite noticeable improvements in team compactness and defensive shape, individual mistakes, particularly from players like Bruno Fernandes in a deeper midfield role and Luke Shaw at center-back, are proving costly. Murphy argues that while Fernandes offers strong passing from deep, his defensive instincts are lacking, and Shaw appears uncomfortable in his adapted role. This article suggests that for United to achieve consistent success, Amorim must address these selection issues and ensure players are better aligned with their roles within the tactical framework.</p>

Beyond this competitive threat, established financial institutions are wary of BNPL because it creates a "giant black hole" in consumer credit profiles, making it difficult to accurately assess overall credit quality due to insufficient data sharing.
