          <p>Pam Bondi, a member of President Trump's legal team, indicated that Trump would likely leave office after his second term, although she didn't completely rule out the possibility of him seeking a third term, which would require a constitutional amendment. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the revocation of all visas for South Sudanese passport holders due to the South Sudan government's failure to accept repatriated citizens promptly. This decision highlights ongoing diplomatic challenges and potential shifts in immigration policies under the Trump administration, showing a firm stance on international cooperation regarding repatriation. The administration's policies are being scrutinized for their impact on both domestic and international relations.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a sharp decline following President Trump's tariff announcements, raising fears of a global trade war and potential recession. Major indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong plummeted, with analysts citing concerns about inflation and economic slowdown. Goldman Sachs increased its forecast for a US recession within the next 12 months to 45%, while JPMorgan estimated a 60% chance of a downturn. The tariffs are expected to disproportionately affect Asian economies heavily reliant on exports to the US, with countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh facing significant tariff hikes. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not make a deal with China on tariffs unless the trade deficit is resolved, emphasizing that the U.S. loses hundreds of billions of dollars annually. He also discussed the stalled TikTok deal, suggesting that China changed its stance due to the tariffs. Trump believes a small tariff cut would quickly lead to the deal's approval, highlighting the leverage he sees in tariffs. This stance underscores the administration's focus on trade imbalances and its willingness to use tariffs as a negotiating tool.</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Health Organization reveals that a woman dies every two minutes globally due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023.

          <p>A proposed bill in the New York state legislature aims to prohibit police from conducting traffic stops for minor violations, such as a broken taillight or expired registration, to reduce unnecessary stops and promote racial equity. The bill seeks to address the disproportionate number of traffic stops and arrests involving racial minorities. Critics argue that the proposal would endanger roads by limiting law enforcement's ability to address traffic violations and potentially allowing criminals to evade detection. The debate highlights the tension between addressing racial bias in policing and maintaining public safety.</p>

This move signals the central bank's intention to stabilize the yuan rather than devalue it to offset the impact of US tariffs.
