          <p>The U.S. Army's Caisson Detachment has resumed its horse-drawn funeral tradition at Arlington National Cemetery after a two-year hiatus. The program was suspended due to concerns about the living conditions and care of the horses, prompting a $28 million overhaul. The renovated stables now provide better care for the horses, and the Army has brought in equine experts to ensure their well-being. The Caisson Detachment plays a crucial role in honoring veterans and service members, with the return of this tradition symbolizing the Army's commitment to respecting those who have served. The upgrades include improved feeding practices, rubber matting to prevent gravel ingestion, and enhanced veterinary care.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old in Connecticut was arrested for driving 132 mph on Interstate 91, claiming he was late for a job interview. State troopers initially attempted to stop the Mercedes E300, but the driver sped away, weaving through traffic. The driver, identified as Azmir Djurkovic, admitted to the offense, stating that he did not stop because he was running late. He faces charges including reckless driving, engaging police in pursuit, and reckless endangerment, and is scheduled to appear in court later this month. The incident highlights the dangers of excessive speeding and the importance of adhering to traffic laws, regardless of personal urgency.</p>

          <p>An international drug trafficking ring has been dismantled by police forces from several countries, according to Spanish police. The ring used high-speed "narco boats" to smuggle cocaine from Brazil and Colombia to Spain's Canary Islands. They allegedly used an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform for the speedboats. Authorities have arrested 48 people and seized nearly 3,800 kilos of cocaine, along with boats and cash. The operation involved cooperation between law enforcement agencies from Britain, the U.S., and Europol. The bust highlights the ongoing efforts to combat drug trafficking networks operating between South America and Europe.</p>

          <p>The feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk has revealed a divide within the contemporary right, highlighting differing ideologies and priorities. The conflict stems from personal and business interests, with Musk opposing Trump's legislative agenda due to its impact on electric vehicle tax credits. This has illuminated fault lines between traditional conservatives focused on fiscal responsibility and nationalist conservatives favoring state power. The spat underscores broader tensions within the right-wing political landscape, including disagreements over trade, immigration, and the role of government. The implications of this division could affect Trump's political agenda and the future direction of the Republican party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to lift a court order that would reinstate Education Department employees who were laid off as part of efforts to dismantle the agency. The administration argues that the district judge lacked the authority to require rehiring the workers.

The move has been challenged by states and organizations, who argue that it undermines the Department's ability to enforce civil rights and provide essential services.

The report eased concerns about a potential collapse in the labor market, which had been sparked by previous suboptimal economic reports. The U.S. economy's reliance on private consumption makes job market data a key indicator for investors.
