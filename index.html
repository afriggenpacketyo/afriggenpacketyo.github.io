          <p>A federal judge issued a 14-day restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois, a move praised by state and local officials. The judge found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of an organized rebellion to be unreliable and determined the deployment would likely escalate civil unrest. This ruling followed a lawsuit by the state and the city of Chicago, which argued the federal action was unconstitutional, dangerous, and politically motivated. The decision underscores a significant legal challenge to executive authority over domestic military deployment.</p>

The new owner, founded by a former Republican elections director, emphasized that the company will now be 100% American-owned and aims to rebuild trust in elections with a focus on paper-based transparency. This acquisition marks a significant shift for Dominion, which recently won major defamation lawsuits against media outlets that promoted baseless narratives about its technology.

          <p>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison has responded to concerns from over 40 school board members about transgender athletes, stating that their inclusion in girls' sports "doesn't harm anyone." This statement comes despite a lawsuit from female high school athletes who claim competing against a transgender pitcher is unfair and unsafe. Ellison maintains that excluding transgender students violates the Minnesota Human Rights Act and is resisting a federal deadline to change state policies. The controversy highlights the ongoing national debate over Title IX, fairness in sports, and transgender rights.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's track "Not Like Us," which accused Drake of being a pedophile. The judge ruled that the lyrics in the context of a rap battle constitute opinion and rhetorical hyperbole, not defamatory statements of fact. Drake's legal team has announced its intention to appeal the decision, which is a significant development in the high-profile feud between the two artists. The lawsuit is one of several legal actions Drake has taken related to the promotion and streaming of the song.</p>

          <p>Wales head coach Craig Bellamy described his team's 3-0 friendly defeat to England at Wembley as a harsh but valuable learning experience. Overwhelmed by three goals in the first 20 minutes, Wales struggled against the high-caliber opposition, which Bellamy intentionally selected to prepare his squad for an upcoming World Cup qualifier against Belgium. He stated that he wants his players' egos to be hurt by the loss, using the feeling as motivation to improve. Bellamy emphasized that such challenging matches are crucial for understanding the team's standing and fostering growth.</p>

          <p>An expert's report has found that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona improperly spent millions of dollars designated for court-ordered reforms following a racial profiling case against former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The funds were allegedly used for unrelated expenses, including surplus body cameras, office renovations, and vehicles, rather than for compliance with the overhaul. The analysis concluded that 72% of the $226 million in compliance spending was wrongly attributed or improperly prorated. This misuse of taxpayer money raises serious questions about the agency's commitment to remedying the constitutional violations identified over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a ban that would prevent Chinese airlines from flying over Russia on their routes to and from the United States. The U.S. Transportation Department argues that the current situation creates an unfair competitive advantage, as American carriers are barred from Russian airspace, leading to longer flight times and higher fuel costs. This move aims to level the playing field for U.S. airlines but comes amid rising economic tensions between Washington and Beijing. The proposal could affect major carriers like Air China and China Southern, potentially escalating trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have formally approved the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, initiating a ceasefire in Gaza.

In exchange, Israel will release approximately 1,950 Palestinian prisoners and detainees and allow hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks into the famine-stricken territory. This development marks a significant breakthrough after two years of devastating conflict, though major challenges remain for implementing the plan's subsequent phases, which address demilitarization and long-term governance.</p>

The decision to exclude a recovering Jude Bellingham was met with surprise, but Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers excelled in his place, scoring the opening goal and becoming a symbol of Tuchel's merit-based approach. The coach has made it clear he is building a cohesive team rather than collecting talented individuals, a philosophy that appears to be paying off.

          <h2>Texas Court Stays Execution of Robert Roberson Amid Doubts Over 'Shaken Baby Syndrome' Conviction</h2>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was scheduled to be put to death for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter. Roberson's conviction was based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome, a theory that has faced increasing scientific scrutiny. His defense argues the child died from severe pneumonia, and the court has ordered a review of the case under Texas's "junk science" law. This ruling allows Roberson to continue his fight for a new trial, highlighting a growing number of cases where such convictions are being challenged and overturned.</p>

          <p>The anniversary of the National Palace Museum is underscoring the ongoing political and cultural tensions between Taiwan and mainland China. While Beijing's Palace Museum celebrates its centenary, the Taipei branch, which houses nearly 700,000 imperial Chinese artifacts, is marking its own 60th anniversary. The museum in Taipei serves as both a symbol of Taiwan's deep connection to Chinese civilization and a point of contention for the ruling party, which seeks to define a distinct Taiwanese identity. This dual role makes the museum a cultural battleground, reflecting the island's complex relationship with its historical roots.</p>

          <h2>Arson Suspect's ChatGPT History Used as Evidence in Deadly Los Angeles Fire Case</h2>

          <p>In a novel investigative turn, federal authorities are using a suspect's conversations with ChatGPT as evidence in the case of the deadly Palisades Fire in Los Angeles. The criminal complaint alleges that Jonathan Rinderknecht started the fire and then asked the AI chatbot about criminal liability for fires started with cigarettes. This use of AI chat logs to help establish intent marks a new frontier in criminal investigations. While the arrest provides a potential explanation for the fire's origin, many affected residents remain focused on what they see as government negligence in fire preparation and response, which they believe exacerbated the disaster.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched an investigation into nearly 2.9 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. The probe follows dozens of reports of safety violations, including running red lights and making improper lane changes, which have been linked to multiple crashes and injuries. This investigation adds to the growing regulatory scrutiny of Tesla's automated driving technologies and their real-world safety performance. The outcome could have significant implications for the future of autonomous driving systems on public roads.</p>

          <p>The newly brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas represents a significant diplomatic achievement for President Trump, but one that is fraught with historical precedent for failure. A lasting peace could cement his legacy as a peacemaker, yet the fragile nature of past agreements in the region shows that any truce could easily collapse, posing a political risk. The deal, which involved leveraging relationships with Arab partners and pressure from Qatar and Egypt, is a victory for the administration's diplomatic efforts. However, its ultimate success will depend on sustained engagement and the complex realities on the ground.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James will be sidelined for the team's season opener against the Golden State Warriors due to a sciatica nerve injury. The team announced that the 40-year-old forward, who is entering his 23rd NBA season, will be re-evaluated in three to four weeks. This injury disrupts James's potential to break the record for most regular-season games played this year and is a significant setback for the Lakers as they begin their season. The absence of the league's all-time leading scorer will be a major challenge for the team and new coach JJ Redick.</p>
