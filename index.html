          <p>With high interest rates making savings products attractive, many are weighing whether to open a certificate of deposit (CD) or invest in the stock market. Experts advise that the choice depends on financial goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs offer guaranteed, stable returns, making them suitable for short-term goals, while the stock market provides higher potential growth for long-term objectives like retirement. The article notes that stocks are more liquid but carry greater risk, whereas CDs protect the principal investment but may have early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident has drawn widespread condemnation, including from the UK government and Glastonbury organizers, and has prompted the UK's broadcast regulator, Ofcom, to investigate why the comments were aired.

The move is supported by regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who see an opportunity to bring the new Syrian government into their sphere of influence.

Players used ice packs and cold towels to stay cool, and two-time runner-up Ons Jabeur retired from her match after feeling unwell.

This finding is part of a broader conflict between the administration and Harvard, which includes frozen grants and challenges to the university's DEI programs.

          <p>Despite the perceived glamour of professional tennis, many players outside the top ranks face significant financial hardship and mental health challenges. The article highlights the story of former player Noah Rubin, who describes the loneliness and anxiety of struggling on the lower-tier circuits, where prize money often fails to cover travel and coaching expenses. The Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) reports that most top-1000 players earn less than their annual costs. The PTPA is now suing tennis's governing bodies, arguing that players receive an unfairly small percentage of tournament revenue compared to athletes in other major sports.</p>

He describes the direct confrontation as an inevitable escalation after years of proxy wars, assassinations, and covert operations. Bathaei expresses concern that a U.S.-backed effort to topple the Iranian government would create a disastrous failed state, similar to what occurred in Libya and Iraq. Despite a temporary ceasefire, he feels the region is heading toward a darker future and believes direct talks between the U.S. and Iran are essential to de-escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>Ryland Headley, 92, has been found guilty of the 1967 murder and sexual assault of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, a case believed to be the UK's oldest solved cold case. Dunne was found strangled in her home, and despite a massive investigation at the time, no suspect was identified for decades. The case was solved when modern DNA testing linked semen from a swab taken at the scene to Headley, who was already a convicted rapist with a history of similar crimes. A palm print from the scene also matched his, finally bringing justice nearly 60 years later.</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wages are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and twelve other cities and counties. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that over 800,000 workers will see their pay increase as a result of these changes, which are driven by ballot measures and inflation adjustments. These local and state-level hikes contrast with the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009. The analysis notes that the wage increases will disproportionately benefit women and minority workers.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large U.S. technology firms, a move made just hours before the first payments were due. The decision came after President Donald Trump called off trade negotiations, describing the tax as a "blatant attack" and threatening higher tariffs on Canadian imports. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, and was expected to generate over C$1.5 billion in its first year. Canada's finance minister stated the country's preference has always been a multilateral agreement, and the reversal aims to restart crucial trade talks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from a group of Los Angeles landlords who sought financial compensation for losses incurred during the city's COVID-19 eviction moratorium. The landlords argued that the strict limits on evictions amounted to an unconstitutional taking of their private property without just compensation. A federal judge and the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously dismissed the suit, citing long-standing precedents that allow for property regulation. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented, stating they would have heard the case to address the significant constitutional question it raised.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their home's equity must choose between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan, each with different interest rate structures. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially cheaper if rates fall. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates based on mortgage bond trading, offering stability but less direct correlation with Fed cuts. Experts suggest that while HELOC rates may decline later this year if the Fed cuts rates, home equity loan rates are less certain to follow suit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's Pride celebrations ended in violence Sunday night when two teenage girls were shot and six other people were attacked with bear spray near the Stonewall Inn. Police reported that a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old were shot, with one victim in critical condition from a gunshot to the head. The shooting occurred in a crowded area as festivities were winding down. About two hours earlier, in nearby Washington Square Park, six people sustained minor injuries after an individual deployed bear spray into a crowd; a suspect in that incident is in custody.</p>

          <p>At least 12 people were killed and dozens more were injured after a powerful explosion and subsequent fire destroyed a pharmaceutical factory in southern India. The blast occurred Monday at the Sigachi Industries factory in Telangana state, reducing the facility to ruins. Firefighters recovered the bodies of ten workers from the rubble, with two more later dying in the hospital. The explosion is believed to have originated in a spray dryer unit used to process raw materials. Industrial accidents are unfortunately common in India, which is a major global supplier of generic medicines and vaccines.</p>
