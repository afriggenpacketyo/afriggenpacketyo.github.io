          <p>A Japanese court sentenced Toyoshi Wakamoto to a three-year suspended prison term after a wheel detached from his modified car and struck a five-year-old girl, leaving her in a coma. Masamitsu Tanaka, the car's owner, received a fine for the illegal modifications, which included extending the car's suspension, causing the wheels to protrude. The presiding judge emphasized the increased accident risk due to the unauthorized modifications, which violate Japanese law prohibiting such alterations. This incident highlights the dangers of illegal vehicle modifications and their potential consequences for public safety.</p>

          <p>Amidst trade turmoil and declining confidence in U.S. assets like Treasurys and the dollar, gold prices have surged, reaching $3,500 per ounce, and analysts predict further rallies. The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, with gold's inflation-hedging quality making it an attractive investment. Analysts attribute this shift to dwindling faith in America and its assets due to economic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as gold's independence from any single nation's monetary or fiscal policy. A weaker dollar further enhances gold's appeal for holders of other currencies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Ofcom has announced new regulations, the Children's Codes, mandating tech firms to implement age verification checks and modify algorithm recommendations to safeguard children from harmful online content by July 25. Social media platforms and websites must protect children from accessing pornography, content promoting self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders, or face fines and potential UK bans. Algorithms must filter harmful content from children's feeds, and platforms must have streamlined reporting systems and a designated person accountable for children's safety, with annual risk reviews by senior management. While some critics argue the restrictions don't go far enough, others see it as a step in the right direction for online child safety.</p>

          <p>China has updated its market access negative list, decreasing restricted sectors for private firms from 117 to 106, signaling further business environment liberalization. National-level restrictions have been removed for seal engraving and specialized computer information system security products, while sectors like television production and pharmaceutical sales have streamlined entry procedures. Local-level restrictions are abolished in transport, logistics, and industrial scrap metal recycling, and the updated list strengthens oversight in emerging sectors like auto-driving aircraft and novel tobacco products.

          <p>European officials are optimistic about reaching a trade deal with the U.S., warning of significant economic harm if tariffs are introduced. Negotiations are ongoing to avoid U.S. tariffs on EU goods and EU countermeasures, with the EU having paused retaliatory duties to allow for discussions. The EU insists its trade with the U.S. is reasonably balanced, but failure to reach a deal could jeopardize over 4 billion euros in daily trade. The IMF has also warned that Trump's tariffs pose major headwinds for the U.S. and global economy, forecasting reduced growth.</p>

          <p>Police in Kenya busted an ant smuggling ring, arresting two Belgian teenagers and others for trafficking queen ants destined for Europe and Asia. The seized ants, valued at up to $1 million, were taken from giant African harvester ant colonies, crucial for Kenya's wildlife ecosystem. Experts compare the trade to cocaine smuggling, highlighting the high value addition in European markets, where ant aficionados pay large sums for colonies. The case raises concerns about organized crime diversifying from large mammals to lesser-known species, though the greatest threat to insects remains pesticides and habitat destruction.</p>

SK Hynix anticipates a limited impact from tariffs on AI server demand, while demand from consumer electronics is expected to benefit from new AI functionalities.

          <p>Public criticism of Hamas is growing in Gaza, with increasing numbers of Palestinians openly defying the group that has ruled the strip for almost 20 years. Many Gazans hold Hamas responsible for the territory's current crisis and are demanding an end to their rule. However, speaking out against Hamas remains dangerous, with dissent often met with violence and punishment. Recent protests and incidents suggest that civilians, pushed to the brink by ongoing conflict, are losing their fear of Hamas, though the group still maintains a firm grip on power.</p>

          <h2>Economist Warns of Potential US Recession Amid Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard economist, suggests the odds of a US recession are as high as 60% in the coming year, driven by Trump's tariffs and declining consumer and business confidence. While indicators like an inverted yield curve and professional forecasts offer clues, prediction markets show a significant increase in recession probabilities. Frankel emphasizes that early measures of economic activity, such as purchasing managers' indices and retail sales data, are crucial in identifying a potential downturn. He suggests we should not be surprised if the US economy runs aground. (not investment advice)</p>

Hegseth's decision to use Signal on a computer in his Pentagon office, bypassing security protocols, has raised concerns about communication security. The operation, costing billions, has yet to restore regular traffic through the Red Sea and has led to increased casualties and loss of equipment, prompting questions about the mission's effectiveness and long-term implications.</p>
