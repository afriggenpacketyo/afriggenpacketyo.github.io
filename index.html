          <p>Anna Repkina, a Russian woman, was found murdered in Oregon, leading investigators to her fiancé, William Hargrove, who exhibited peculiar behavior after her death.  Hargrove's extensive online research into time travel and his attempts to withdraw money from Repkina's account were key pieces of evidence in his eventual arrest and conviction.  The case involved a complex love triangle and ultimately led to a life sentence for Hargrove.</p>
