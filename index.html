          <p>After 23 years and £2 billion, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened, aiming to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce travel times between west Wales and the Midlands. Initially conceived in 1990 and started in 2002, the project faced overspends, delays, and a pandemic. The upgrade involved building almost 70 structures and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While some residents appreciate the reduced travel times, others criticize the cost and disruptions during construction; the project is funded through a 30-year payment plan. The road's completion predates a Welsh government decision to scrap new major road projects on environmental grounds in 2023, though future schemes may be considered if they align with climate emergency goals.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governors Tim Walz of Minnesota and Wes Moore of Maryland urged their party to adopt a more forceful approach to politics, emphasizing the importance of building coalitions and engaging with diverse constituencies. Speaking at Jim Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina, both governors stressed the need to compete in every district and deliver tangible alternatives to the opposition. While denying any presidential aspirations for 2028, Walz and Moore highlighted the urgency of the 2025 political battles. Moore emphasized the importance of delivering alternatives to Trump's policies, while Walz encouraged Democrats to compete in every district and not wait until the midterms to engage with voters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sperm from a single donor in Europe has been linked to cancer in 10 children conceived through assisted reproduction, raising concerns about genetic screening practices. The donor carried a rare TP53 mutation, which causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, increasing the risk of developing cancer, but this variant was not known to be linked to cancer at the time of donation in 2008 and would not have been detectable through standard screening. The European Sperm Bank confirmed the presence of the mutation and stated that donor-assisted reproduction generally remains a safer alternative. The research has sparked discussions about the need for European limits on the number of births from a single donor, with the European Sperm Bank advocating for an internationally binding family limit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that the world's population may be hundreds of millions or even billions higher than the UN estimates due to undercounting in rural areas. Researchers at Aalto University discovered that UN estimates undercount the number of people living in rural areas by more than 50% because census data in the global south is often incomplete. This challenges long-standing anxieties about overpopulation, which often reflect power struggles over resources and whose lives matter. While population growth presents challenges, particularly in resource management and consumption, experts suggest that sustainable technologies and responsible consumption can mitigate potential crises.</p>

          <p>Meta plans to replace human reviewers with AI for up to 90% of privacy and integrity risk assessments for new features on Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook. This shift is intended to streamline decision-making and accelerate product development, but current and former Meta employees fear it could lead to inadequate scrutiny of potential harms. Concerns have been raised about AI making sensitive decisions regarding AI safety, youth risk, and content integrity, potentially increasing the risk of unforeseen repercussions and misuse of Meta's platforms. While Meta claims that human expertise will still be used for novel and complex issues, critics worry that product teams may prioritize speed over thorough risk assessment.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are raising concerns about the validity of deals made between President Trump and several law firms, suggesting they may not be legally enforceable due to coercion. These deals, which involve firms providing pro bono services in exchange for curtailed investigations and maintained access to federal buildings, are viewed by some as being made under duress. Critics argue that the deals may violate federal bribery statutes and raise ethical concerns about conflicts of interest between the firms and their clients. Some targeted law firms have successfully challenged Trump's actions in court, while others who settled report losing clients.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034, according to the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This target is a key assumption underlying the review, with some planned measures potentially becoming unaffordable if the spending level is not achieved. The review is expected to highlight new threats, such as drones and artificial intelligence, necessitating the deployment of digital experts alongside troops. The government's budget watchdog estimates that meeting the 3% target would require an additional £17.3 billion in 2029-30, and the review will also allocate over £1.5 billion to improve military housing.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani hit two solo home runs, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to an 8-5 victory over the New York Yankees in the opening game of their series, a rematch of the 2024 World Series. Ohtani's first home run answered Aaron Judge's opening homer, and his second sparked a four-run sixth inning, turning a 5-2 deficit into a 6-5 lead. The reigning National League MVP has hit 15 home runs in May and commented on his good rhythm with his new lifestyle after the birth of his daughter. Andy Pages added two insurance runs in the seventh, while the Yankees' early four-homer barrage was contained for the rest of the game.</p>

          <p>Satellite images reveal North Korea has deployed balloon-like objects alongside its damaged 5,000-ton warship, which has been partially submerged since a launch malfunction. Experts suggest the balloons could be used to help right the ship or protect it from drone surveillance. The warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered damage during a botched launch on May 21. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers' Party.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice hitting store shelves, drawing consumers seeking relief from soaring prices. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice at a lower price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags sold out in just 30 minutes, while long lines formed at an Iris Ohyama store in Sendai. The government is selling 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 to curb prices.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has accused Russia of undermining the upcoming round of peace talks in Istanbul by failing to provide its negotiating proposals, a key demand by Kyiv. While Russia confirmed it would send a team to the talks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized Moscow for actions that ensure the next meeting is fruitless. Ukraine has sent its proposals to Russia, reaffirming its readiness for a full and unconditional ceasefire.

          <p>German-Greek relations are facing a crisis due to differing views on refugee policy, with Germany seeking to return asylum seekers to Greece, a move opposed by Athens. Greece is seeking more EU support for border protection and a migration agreement with Libya, rather than accepting returns from Germany. A German court ruling stated that migrants do not face extreme hardships in Greece, providing a legal basis for deportations. The Greek Minister for Migration warned against any request to repatriate migrants who have traveled on from Greece.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to impose tariffs on global trade are facing legal challenges and economic setbacks, despite his initial claims that tariffs are easy to implement. A New York court blocked his signature trade policy, leading to a battle expected to reach the Supreme Court. The administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify blanket tariffs has been questioned, with a federal court ruling that the tariffs exceed the president's authority. The administration's appeal has alleged “judicial tyranny” in the US, but another US court issued a preliminary ruling against Trump’s tariffs in a case brought by two Illinois toy companies.</p>

The decision is subject to review by the full state Board of Parole Hearings and the California governor, who previously reversed a parole recommendation for Krenwinkel in 2022.
