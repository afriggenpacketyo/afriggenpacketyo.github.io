          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. The company's net income for the quarter was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, but free cash flow also declined. CEO Amin Nasser noted that global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty impacted energy markets. The company faces pressure due to lower oil prices, costly megaprojects, and OPEC+ production cuts, even though it has eased pressure on itself by slashing its performance-linked dividend payout, which means less revenue for the Saudi government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting a "big week" ahead for negotiations. This follows Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine said was repeatedly violated. Zelenskyy proposed a 30-day ceasefire and indicated that Putin's offer of direct talks in Istanbul was "a positive sign." Both leaders have expressed a willingness to negotiate, but a lasting ceasefire remains elusive amid ongoing fighting and skepticism from Ukrainian officials.

          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a senior staff psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, challenges the notion of the 'perfect mother,' arguing that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. She criticizes the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to stop constantly questioning their adequacy. The article advocates for self-compassion and the recognition that being flawed is a vital part of motherhood, allowing children to develop healthy perspectives on relationships and self-acceptance.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the meeting offer a "positive sign," while emphasizing the need for a complete and lasting ceasefire, but leaders from France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland threatened increased sanctions if Russia violates the truce.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States remained steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels but below the rate from a year prior. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including the demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season. The recent fluctuations in mortgage rates reflect volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, used by lenders to price mortgage loans.</p>

          <p>This article examines the consequences of USAID funding cuts on healthcare in Africa, detailing how HIV patients are losing access to medication and healthcare programs are halting. The Trump administration's decision to dismantle USAID and slash foreign contracts has severely impacted countries reliant on US aid, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Experts warn that millions could die from treatable diseases, and NGOs like Amref Health Africa have had to cancel educational programs and tuberculosis screenings. The article also highlights the disruption to HIV/AIDS programs, malaria prevention efforts, and routine vaccinations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump characterized the first day of trade talks between US and Chinese officials in Switzerland as "very good," indicating a "total reset" in US-China trade relations. The talks, led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's vice-premier He Lifeng, aim to de-escalate the trade war initiated by Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. While little information emerged beyond Trump's statement, he expressed hope for China to open up to American business. The White House emphasized that Washington would not unilaterally lower tariffs, requiring concessions from China.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. From 2010 to 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled $66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This trend aligns with China's global commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
