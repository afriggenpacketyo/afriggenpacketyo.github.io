          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Taoyuan as a "camp area," a move seen as further distancing the island from its Kuomintang past. The mausoleum of Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was similarly reclassified. This decision reflects updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area. The sites will no longer be referred to as mausoleums or spirit-worship facilities, marking a symbolic shift in how Taiwan grapples with its historical legacy.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor, critiques a plan proposed by Stephen Miran to weaken the dollar, arguing it's based on a flawed understanding of trade deficits. The article explains that while the dollar's reserve currency status plays a role, it's not the only factor contributing to America's persistent trade deficits, and tariffs are not a cure-all. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. The article concludes that the strength of the American economy and other factors also influence the current account deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an exclusive BBC interview, former President Joe Biden condemned the Trump administration's pressure on Ukraine to cede territory to Russia, calling it "modern-day appeasement." Biden expressed concern about the potential breakdown of US-Europe relations under President Trump, emphasizing the importance of supporting Ukraine's independence. He defended his own record on Ukraine, stating that his administration provided Kyiv with the necessary resources to resist Russia's invasion. Biden also criticized Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal and acquire Greenland, asserting that such actions are not representative of American values.</p>

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will attend the talks, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will represent Washington.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting raids targeting businesses in Washington, D.C., prompting concern from Mayor Muriel Bowser.

The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington expressed deep concern, emphasizing the significant role of immigrants in the local restaurant workforce and the potential impact on the economy.</p>

          <p>Criminals in England and Wales who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings could face an additional two years in prison under a new bill. The Victims and Courts Bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot "opt out" of justice, providing victims' families with a moment of recognition and a form of reparation. The legislation was initiated after several high-profile cases where killers refused to attend sentencing, prompting calls for changes to the law. Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones thanked the families who campaigned for the changes, emphasizing that "justice isn't optional."</p>
