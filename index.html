          <p>Wisconsin's Attorney General filed a last-minute appeal to block Elon Musk's planned $2 million donation to voters at a Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate's rally.  The appeal alleges the giveaway violates state election laws prohibiting offering anything of value in exchange for votes.  The Fox News article leans slightly conservative, framing the appeal as an attack on Musk's support for a Republican candidate, potentially downplaying the legal concerns.</p>
