With federal employees expected to miss their first full paychecks, many like Criss are facing immense financial strain in safety-sensitive jobs where the margin for error is zero. Despite warnings from officials like Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy against taking second jobs, Criss stated it's a necessity, having also tapped into retirement funds to make ends meet.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently underperforming the S&P 500 index by its largest margin this year, with a year-to-date gain of 8.6% compared to the index's 15.5%. This gap coincides with Berkshire's significant reduction of its stake in Apple, which has continued to reach record highs. By selling a large portion of its shares since late 2023, Berkshire has potentially left an estimated $50 billion in unrealized profits on the table, a decision Buffett has partly attributed to expectations of future capital gains tax hikes.

          <p>A new report from Brown Harris Stevens reveals that more than a third of Manhattan condominium apartments sold between July 2024 and June 2025 were resold at a loss. The median price per square foot in the borough has remained largely stagnant over the past decade, a stark contrast to real estate trends across most of the United States. Analysts suggest this "lost decade" is due to factors like tax law changes and pandemic-related migration, although the luxury market, particularly sales over $10 million, has continued to see profits.

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old from Fort Lauderdale, has transformed his small-scale eBay resale operation into a wholesale business named Technsports, which generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024. Starting in 2008 while unemployed, Senko began by flipping a used cell phone and eventually pivoted to pre-owned clothing, recognizing a market inefficiency for valuable brands. His new business model involves buying used clothing in bulk and selling it wholesale to other resellers, a strategy that has proven more profitable and less time-intensive.</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist outlines effective methods for parents to say "no" to their children in ways that foster connection rather than conflict. The approach emphasizes turning denials into teachable moments by explaining the reasoning behind rules, particularly those related to safety and kindness. Offering children choices within established limits helps provide them with a sense of autonomy, while consistency in enforcing boundaries builds trust and teaches emotional regulation and self-control.</p>

His attorneys have condemned the move as punitive and cruel, noting that Costa Rica has offered him refuge, while the administration asserts Liberia is a safe and democratic partner.</p>

          <p>The manufacturing city of Erie, Pennsylvania, a crucial swing county, is experiencing economic whiplash from President Trump's policies, including spending cuts and tariffs. A major $300 million recycling plant project was canceled after a Department of Energy loan was put on hold, and the local food bank has lost 25% of its budget due to federal cuts. Despite these challenges and the uncertainty created by tariffs, many voters who supported Trump remain loyal, attributing economic hardships to other factors and expressing faith in his long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly planning to issue new dietary guidance that encourages Americans to eat more saturated fats, a move that contradicts decades of established nutritional recommendations. Health experts are alarmed by the potential shift, which could affect national food programs like school lunches. While some research suggests saturated fats may be less harmful than previously thought, experts like Dr. Cheryl Anderson of the American Heart Association stress that current American diets already contain too much, contributing to cardiovascular disease.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview since losing the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris told the BBC she might run for president again, stating she is "not done" with her life of public service. Harris expressed confidence that a woman will be president in the future and suggested it could "possibly" be her, hinting at a potential 2028 bid. She also strongly criticized her former rival, branding President Trump a "tyrant" and asserting that her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct.</p>

          <p>Although new AI tools like OpenAI's Sora 2 have caused widespread panic in Hollywood over potential job losses and copyright infringement, the technology's actual integration into the industry has been slow. Major studios like Disney and Lionsgate have made significant investments in AI but have yet to see substantial cost savings or revolutionary creative outputs, facing challenges with legal uncertainties and technical integration. For now, AI remains more of a curiosity and a tool for specific tasks like dubbing and storyboarding rather than a full-fledged replacement for human creativity and labor.</p>

These commercials, often for conditions such as plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease, target a large, captive audience but pair images of happy, active lifestyles with a long list of serious potential side effects. The author notes that while the FDA permits such ads, critics like Dr. Caleb Alexander of Johns Hopkins argue that this direct-to-consumer advertising is more about persuasion than information, potentially driving patient behavior in subtle ways.</p>
