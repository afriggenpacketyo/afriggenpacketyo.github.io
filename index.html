The article emphasizes that any resolution to trade concerns must occur within a multilateral framework, sending a clear message to the US President. Although headline tariffs were reduced, these cuts primarily reversed measures that were inconsistent with WTO regulations.

Amendments being considered include ensuring no obligation for medical staff to participate and requiring a government assessment of palliative care availability. The debate comes as the government corrected its impact assessment on assisted deaths, leading to concerns about the process's chaotic nature.</p>

          <p>A transit strike began in New Jersey as locomotive engineers walked off their jobs due to a pay dispute, shutting down the NJ Transit rail network and affecting tens of thousands of commuters. The strike, the first in the state since 1983, follows months of unsuccessful negotiations and federal interventions. The agency has hired private buses to substitute for train service, but they can only accommodate a fraction of the displaced riders. The article discusses the expected disruptions to other transit systems and the economic impact on the New York City metropolitan region.</p>

          <p>Sports coaches can play a "critical role" in addressing the issue of toxic masculinity. UK Coaching found that coaches were the most trusted profession among 18 to 24-year-olds. Jordan Puente's life was transformed by a sports coach and mentor, Roddy Slater, who helped him use weightlifting as a tool to get away from a troubled life as a teenager. A decade on from that first session in the gym Puente's life has come full circle, with the 25-year-old now working for Slater mentoring and coaching vulnerable young people.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying efforts to bolster its domestic market to reduce vulnerability to external trade shocks, even with a tentative ceasefire in the trade war with the US. Premier Li Qiang emphasized strengthening "domestic circulation" to enhance economic self-reliance. Analysts believe the confrontation with Washington has added urgency to China's efforts to boost domestic demand and decrease reliance on overseas trade. The government realizes that China can no longer depend on exports as the primary growth driver due to deglobalization trends.</p>

          <p>The technique used on a 9½-month-old boy with a rare condition has the potential to help people with thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases.\nSomething was very wrong with Kyle and Nicole Muldoon’s baby.\nThe doctors speculated. Maybe it was meningitis? Maybe sepsis?\nThey got an answer when KJ was only a week old. He had a rare genetic disorder,\nCPS1 deficiency\n, that affects just one in 1.3 million babies. If he survived, he would have severe mental and developmental delays and would eventually need a liver transplant. But half of all babies with the disorder die in the first week of life.\nDoctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia offered the Muldoons comfort care for their baby, a chance to forgo aggressive treatments in the face of a grim prognosis.\n“We loved him, and we didn’t want him to be suffering,” Ms. Muldoon said. But she and her husband decided to give KJ a chance.\nInstead, KJ has made medical history. The baby, now 9 ½ months old, became the first patient of any age to have a custom gene-editing treatment, according to his doctors. He received an infusion made just for him and designed to fix his precise mutation.</p>

The deployment of the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) advanced air-to-air missiles, including the domestic version of the PL-15 commissioned since the mid-2010s, carries broader implications not only for regional security in the Asia-Pacific, but also for any future Taiwan contingency. It has also sparked discussions about the potential expansion of air-to-air missile exports as Beijing grows more ambitious in challenging the Western-dominated global arms market.</p>
