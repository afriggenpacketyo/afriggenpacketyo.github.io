        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a White House meeting, President Trump confronted South African President Ramaphosa with a video purportedly showing the persecution of white Afrikaner farmers. Ramaphosa disputed Trump's claims, asserting that black people are more likely to be victims of violence in South Africa. Trump also raised concerns about land seizures without compensation, which Ramaphosa addressed by stating that no land has been seized under the controversial law. The South African leader emphasized his country's commitment to racial reconciliation, invoking Nelson Mandela's name and pointing out white members of his delegation, including prominent golfers and businessmen, as evidence against the genocide claims.

          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit, Evernorth, has reached a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower the cost of popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound.

This initiative targets clients who currently do not cover the drugs due to high costs, while also offering simplified pre-authorization processes. The deal could reduce costs for existing Evernorth clients offering weight loss drugs by up to 20%.</p>

Affleck, a climate-literate member of Generation Z, expressed surprise at her mother's astonishment at the destruction, asserting that the fires were related to the climate crisis, while Garner was shell-shocked by the scale of the destruction. Affleck compared the experience of wearing N95 masks due to poor air quality after the fires to the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing that climate change will soon be impossible to ignore.

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated a court order by deporting eight migrants to a third country without sufficient notice. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, stated that the government gave the men little more than 24 hours' notice, which he deemed plainly insufficient. The flight carrying the deportees, who are citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma and Vietnam and convicted of crimes, landed in Djibouti. The judge is considering ordering interviews to assess their fear of being sent to a country like South Sudan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. debt-and-deficit situation is worsening, triggering a credit rating downgrade from Moody's and a sell-off in stocks and bonds due to President Trump's proposed spending bill. Experts are concerned about the bill's impact on the $36.2 trillion national debt and a budget deficit heading towards 7% of GDP. The market has seen a severe increase in Treasury yields, particularly in longer-denominated debt, as investors demand higher compensation for holding U.S. debt. With the deficit expected to reach 6.5%-7% of GDP, concerns about U.S. fiscal dynamics are likely to persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is implementing a new framework for COVID-19 vaccines, potentially limiting access to initial vaccine series for healthy children, per recent announcements from the FDA's new vaccine czar, Vinay Prasad, and Commissioner Marty Makary. The agency will require new clinical trial data for approving COVID shots for healthy individuals under 65, which may prevent children from accessing their first series of COVID vaccines. Experts express concern that this policy could leave children vulnerable to the virus without protection. This framework prioritizes vaccination for those at highest risk, but may disproportionately affect children.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has invalidated regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and accommodations for abortions. Judge David Joseph ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion among pregnancy-related conditions under the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This decision was lauded by conservative lawmakers and religious groups who opposed the EEOC's interpretation. The ruling does not affect the rest of the regulations under the act, which still protect pregnant workers' rights.</p>
