          <h2>Right-Wing Intellectuals Shape Trump's Authoritarian Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 10:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how right-wing intellectuals, often feeling marginalized in traditionally liberal fields like journalism and academia, have created echo chambers that reinforce their worldview. This insular environment leads to a distorted perception of America, where they believe conservatives are on the brink of extinction. With figures like JD Vance and Pete Hegseth now in positions of power, these radical ideas are shaping policies ranging from immigration to education, resulting in what the article calls 'carnage' in those sectors. The article points to a preoccupation with dismantling elite universities as a prime example of this counterrevolution. Optimism is tempered by the recognition that these radical ideas are actively shaping policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have recently surged, reaching record highs, but experts suggest several scenarios that could trigger a price drop. These include investors taking profits, a sharp strengthening of the U.S. dollar, economic recovery reducing safe-haven demand, cooling political and economic tensions, a breakout equity market rally, and deflationary pressure with central bank shifts. Despite potential declines, experts advise that gold investing should be viewed as a long-term strategy, and that it is best secured before market turmoil begins. (not investment advice)</p>

The measure aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice and causing further distress to victims' families. The bill follows campaigns by families of murder victims whose killers refused to attend sentencing, and it seeks to ensure that perpetrators face the consequences of their actions. The bill is seen as a 'step in the right direction' by some victims' families.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden, in his first interview since leaving the White House, criticized the Trump administration's approach to Ukraine as "modern-day appeasement." He expressed concern about the potential breakdown of US-Europe relations under President Trump. Biden defended his own record on Ukraine and his decision to end his 2024 re-election bid. He also condemned Trump's calls for the US to take back the Panama Canal and acquire Greenland, saying, "That's not who we are."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to eliminate the Energy Star program, a 33-year-old energy efficiency certification for appliances. The plan was announced at an Environmental Protection Agency meeting, with the agency citing a reorganization effort. The EPA said it is reorganizing the agency, although it didn't specifically mention the Energy Star program. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the move, calling it "economic sabotage — sabotaging family budgets to pay off fossil fuel donors."</p>

          <p>With the process of picking the next pope about to start, the article answers questions about how the Catholic Church selects Pope Francis’ successor. The conclave lasts as long as it takes for two-thirds of the eligible cardinals to agree on a pick, which this time means the new pope needs to earn 89 votes. Cardinals are sequestered and can’t use cellphones, the internet, television or other pipelines to the outside world. There is no clear frontrunner, and the vote for the next pope is also a referendum on Francis’ papacy.</p>

          <p>Many companies now offer customers the option to opt-out of receiving Mother's Day-related promotional emails, using empathetic language to acknowledge the holiday can be difficult for some. This practice aims to show the brand cares about customers' feelings and isn't just trying to sell products. By offering this choice, brands hope to retain customers on their email lists and strengthen relationships, even though the opt-out process itself involves sending more emails. The article questions whether brands can truly address the complexities of grief and loss.</p>

          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers have traded wide receiver George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys, signaling a lack of patience with his inconsistent behavior. Pickens, known for his talent but also his emotional outbursts, will join the Cowboys in exchange for draft picks. The Steelers' decision to trade Pickens came after they acquired DK Metcalf and signed him to a long-term contract, making Pickens expendable.</p>
