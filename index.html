          <p>A Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, will remain in federal custody. His lawyers requested a delay in his release, citing conflicting statements from the government about whether he would be deported again immediately after being freed. A federal magistrate judge granted the delay until a July hearing can clarify the government's intentions and prevent interference with his criminal proceedings, which highlights the complexities of his legal situation.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is engaged in a major effort to persuade dozens of his own MPs who are concerned about the reforms. Critics worry that tightening eligibility criteria for disability benefits will harm vulnerable people, while the government argues the changes are necessary for the long-term stability of the welfare state. The situation is drawing comparisons to past contentious votes within the party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on President Trump's signature domestic policy bill. Republicans are aiming to pass the legislation before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, navigating numerous amendments primarily from Democrats. The bill, which passed the House narrowly, combines spending increases for border security and defense with cuts to social programs like Medicaid.

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The study, published in the journal *Cell*, found that betaine combats inflammation and organ aging by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind exercise's anti-aging benefits.

          <p>A new Trump administration policy banning transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military is now in effect, creating a precarious situation for thousands of service members. The policy deems a history of gender dysphoria incompatible with military standards and removes nearly all previous exceptions for those already serving. This article follows two transgender officers as they navigate the possibility of involuntary separation from their careers, which could result in the loss of jobs, pensions, and benefits. The ban has been criticized as discriminatory and is facing legal challenges.</p>

          <p>As Congress debates a massive Republican-led spending bill, Americans are examining how its provisions could affect their lives. The legislation proposes funding tax cuts by altering programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), causing concern for recipients who rely on them for healthcare and food. Conversely, provisions like eliminating federal taxes on tips and overtime have been met with excitement by workers such as firefighters. The bill also contains controversial measures, including a 10-year ban on state-level AI regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from UK child health experts suggests that logistical obstacles, rather than vaccine hesitancy, are a primary reason for falling childhood vaccination rates. Parents face difficulties such as booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders, which prevent them from getting their children vaccinated. With no childhood vaccine meeting the 95% WHO target since 2022, preventable diseases like measles are re-emerging. The report recommends improving booking systems and service accessibility to address this public health concern.</p>
