          <p>This New York Times article details the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, sparked by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, which quickly escalated into a series of airstrikes and clashes involving new-generation technology like drones and missiles. The fighting reached sensitive military and strategic sites, alarming the United States and prompting diplomatic intervention for a cease-fire. The conflict has changed the nature of warfare in the region, moving toward noncontact barrages, but with the risk of further escalation between the two nuclear powers. The article concludes that entrenched religious nationalism in both countries continues to be a major source of tension.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to negotiate and ease trade tensions stemming from tariffs imposed by both countries. The talks aim to address disruptions to global supply chains and concerns about slowing global growth and inflation. While both governments express a desire to lower tariffs, significant disagreements remain regarding subsidies, export bans, and fentanyl shipments. Economists warn that tariffs above 50 percent could prohibit trade, but Trump appears optimistic about reaching a deal.</p>

          <p>This New York Times news analysis examines the recent India-Pakistan conflict, noting that while a cease-fire has been reached, new military technology and entrenched religious nationalism could lead to more frequent battles. The conflict saw a rapid aerial escalation with airstrikes, antiaircraft fire, and weaponized drones used extensively. The article highlights the need for international diplomacy to prevent further escalation, as well as the political realities in both countries that contribute to ongoing tensions. The analysis suggests India emerged more assertive, but questions whether the conflict improved their operational or strategic standing.</p>

          <p>Defensive lineman Desmond Watson, nicknamed "the tush push terminator," is turning heads at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rookie minicamp. The undrafted free agent signing, who weighed 437 pounds at minicamp after previously being 464 pounds, is working to cut weight to make the Bucs' roster. Watson's ability to stuff the line of scrimmage could be an asset in stopping the short-yardage play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. Watson hopes to play for the team he grew up near, as he's from Plant City, which is east of Tampa.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas as part of a broader crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. The government aims to reduce net migration by requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The new measures are expected to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year.

          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously proposes the concept of "Father's Day Month," suggesting that after Mother's Day, we should celebrate Dads for 35 days leading up to Father's Day. The plan involves alternating even days with presents for Dads and odd days with a communication fast from Dads. The idea is presented as a lighthearted way to appreciate fathers, with Dad jokes being encouraged. However, he admits that it's too late to implement Father's Day Month this year.</p>

          <p>The papacy of Leo XIV begins, marking a new era for the Catholic Church with the election of the first American-born pope. The new pope, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, delivered his first Mass and called for peace in ongoing conflicts. He has been described as a tennis-loving, Wordle-playing White Sox fan from Chicago. He has also been described as prudent and able to listen passionately. The election of an American pope was considered unlikely, but Cardinal Prevost was seen as bringing together the qualities of an evangelizer, statesman, and governor.</p>
