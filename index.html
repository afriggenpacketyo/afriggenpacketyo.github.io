            <p>Former central banker Mark Carney, now Canada's prime minister, has called a snap election for April 28th after US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs, escalating trade tensions. The election features key parties including the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP, and Bloc Quebecois, with polls tightening after Trudeau's resignation and Trump's tariffs. The election will determine who leads Canada amidst growing economic challenges and strained international relations, as voters prioritize responses to Trump's economic threats over cost of living concerns. Canada's political landscape has dramatically shifted due to Trump's policies, making this election a pivotal moment for the nation's future.</p>

            <p>Economists are warning that President Trump's sweeping tariffs could significantly increase the unemployment rate, potentially leading to a recession. A CNBC survey revealed that over a third of CEOs anticipate cutting jobs this year, with some companies already announcing layoffs. Industries such as retail, wholesale trade, and manufacturing are expected to be most affected. The Budget Lab at Yale estimates that Trump's tariffs will reduce U.S. GDP growth, potentially raising the unemployment rate to 4.7% by the end of 2025.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is using tattoos to identify migrants as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but experts argue that tattoos are not reliable indicators of gang affiliation.

Experts emphasize that Tren de Aragua does not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership. The Aurora Police Department, which has investigated the gang, focuses on criminal activity rather than relying on tattoos for identification.</p>
