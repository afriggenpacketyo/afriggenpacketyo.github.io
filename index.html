            <h2>Stocks Plunge Following Announcement of 104% Tariff on Chinese Goods</h2>

            <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn after the Trump administration announced a 104% tariff on Chinese goods, reversing earlier gains fueled by hopes of tariff negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply, contributing to a multi-day sell-off triggered by anxieties over the economic impact of widespread reciprocal tariffs. Economists warn that these tariffs could drive up inflation and increase the risk of a recession, while corporate earnings season looms with uncertainty, particularly for sectors like airlines and banks. The new tariff rate is a result of escalating trade tensions, with China retaliating against previous U.S. tariff impositions.</p>

            <p>Some Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees may face unexpected tax bills due to past fraud by rogue brokers, who enrolled individuals in plans or switched them without their knowledge, leading to excess premium tax credits. The Biden administration took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues. The Trump administration's proposed policy and budget changes, including cuts to navigator programs and stricter verification processes, could further affect ACA enrollees. Additionally, Congress is debating whether to extend enhanced premium tax credits that expanded eligibility during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could significantly impact monthly premium costs.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday, reversing an earlier rally amid ongoing concerns over President Trump's tariffs, which have triggered market turbulence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq both experienced significant drops, with the S&P 500 nearing bear market territory. While Asian and European markets initially showed positive reactions, the confirmation of Trump's additional tariffs on China heightened investor jitters. This market volatility follows a period of mixed performance and reflects growing anxieties about the economic impact of the trade standoff between the U.S. and China.</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is once again relying on President Donald Trump to persuade Republican holdouts to vote for the Senate-approved budget bill, which is crucial for funding Trump's agenda. Johnson met with Trump and House Republicans at the White House, aiming to flip enough votes to pass the bill before the House enters a two-week recess. However, some Republicans remain unconvinced, citing concerns about deficit reduction, and it remains uncertain whether Trump's influence will be sufficient to secure the necessary votes for passage.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has once again become the world's most valuable public company, surpassing Apple, due to Apple's recent stock plunge amidst market turbulence caused by President Trump's tariff plans. Apple's heavy reliance on China for manufacturing makes it particularly vulnerable to the economic fallout from the tariffs. While both companies were previously valued at over $3 trillion, the current market sell-off has significantly impacted Apple's valuation. Despite issuing disappointing revenue guidance earlier in the year, analysts view Microsoft as more insulated from tariff uncertainty.</p>

            <p>President Trump's decision to implement tariffs has created a challenge for his supporters, who are struggling to reconcile their faith in him with the negative economic consequences. While some Trump loyalists are dismissing concerns about the stock market decline, others, particularly those with significant financial losses, are expressing unease. Some are blaming Trump's advisors for the tariff policy, attempting to shield the president from direct criticism, while others reaffirm their unwavering support, believing Trump is using tariffs to eliminate unfair trade practices. This internal debate highlights the tension between loyalty to Trump and the economic realities of his trade policies.</p>

The feud highlights the internal divisions within the Trump administration regarding trade policy and comes as Tesla faces declining stock value and increased production costs due to the tariffs.

            <p>The Trump administration's air war against Yemen's Houthi rebels, dubbed Operation Rough Rider, is unlikely to achieve its goal of completely annihilating the group without a comprehensive strategy. While the strikes have caused some damage, the Houthis' remote terrain and ability to replenish forces pose significant challenges. The lack of a ground offensive, diplomatic engagement with Houthi rivals, and accidental damage to Yemeni allies further undermine the operation's effectiveness. The Houthis' growing capabilities and alliances with nations opposed to the U.S. and Europe highlight the need for a more nuanced and strategic approach to addressing the conflict.</p>

Trump, who withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal, warned Iran of potential consequences if the talks are unsuccessful.

            <p>New Mexico has enacted a "turquoise alert" system to aid in locating missing Indigenous Americans, addressing the disproportionately high rates of violence and disappearances within these communities. The alert, named for a sacred stone, will function similarly to Amber and Silver Alerts, sending notifications to cellphones when a Native American is reported missing. This legislation symbolizes increasing attention to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people, particularly women and girls. New Mexico joins California, Washington, and Colorado in implementing such alert systems.</p>

            <p>Texas is experiencing its largest measles outbreak in over 30 years, fueled by declining vaccination rates and misinformation, leading to over 500 cases and multiple deaths. Public health officials are employing standard strategies, including identifying cases, isolating patients, and promoting vaccination. However, efforts are hampered by conflicting messaging and proposed federal funding cuts to health services. The situation is further complicated by the consideration of bills in the Texas Legislature aimed at loosening vaccine mandates, adding to the challenges faced by health professionals responding to the outbreak.</p>

            <p>Over fifty years ago, the existence of government records on magnetic tape brought down a president. In 1971 the secret service installed Sony open-reel tape recorders throughout the White House, to guarantee that Richard Nixon’s presidency would be “the best chronicled” in American history. Three years later the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the tapes of 42 conversations had to be handed over to Congress, after Nixon himself had refused. His failure to co-operate was one part of the articles of impeachment prepared against him. The contents of one tape, the so-called “smoking gun”, showing Nixon’s attempt to cover-up the Watergate scandal, led to his resignation.</p>

Broadcom is recognized as a top "relief rally candidate", and its growing revenue from custom semiconductors is a positive factor. This buyback is a good situation that can help backstop the stock by providing a consistent buyer even in times of turmoil. (not investment advice)</p>
