        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has intensified its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing letters to California, New York, and Illinois demanding they honor ICE detainer requests. These requests ask local jails to hold undocumented migrants for federal agents after their scheduled release. The states have largely refused, citing state laws and constitutional concerns, arguing that compliance is voluntary and can lead to erroneous detentions. In response, the Trump administration is threatening to sue the states and block future federal funding, arguing these policies release dangerous criminals into communities and obstruct federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Joanna Page, star of the popular British sitcom "Gavin and Stacey," has revealed in her new book that she was groped by a television host while filming. She recounts that a female producer had warned her beforehand that the host could be "very handsy." Page states that when the host began groping her mid-filming, she forcefully hit his hands and verbally confronted him, which made him stop the unwanted contact. The incident highlights the historical workplace culture in the entertainment industry where such behavior was sometimes anticipated and normalized, even by production staff.</p>

          <p>An armed man carrying a gun and a knife was taken into custody by the Secret Service at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the site of a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individual, a former deputy sheriff, allegedly exhibited suspicious behavior and presented inactive law enforcement credentials, claiming he was there to provide private security. The incident occurred before the secure perimeter for the high-profile event was established. The memorial is designated a top-level security event, with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance scheduled to speak before an expected crowd of up to 100,000.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights secured by the White House as a condition of Nippon Steel's $14.1 billion takeover of the company. These rights grant the government veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the CEO against the closure, U.S. Steel reversed its decision, ensuring the facility will remain operational and continue production.

          <p>British singer Morrissey, former frontman of The Smiths, has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving a credible death threat. The threat was made online prior to a performance in Ottawa, Canada, leading to the arrest and charging of a 26-year-old man. Out of caution for the safety of the artist and his band, scheduled performances at Boston's MGM Music Hall and Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut were called off. All tickets for the canceled shows are being refunded, while his next scheduled performance is in Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Defense lawyers for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the federal indictment against him. They argue that prejudicial public statements from officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, have made a fair trial impossible. The defense claims the decision to seek the death penalty is "based on politics, not merit," pointing to a televised "perp walk" and public declarations of guilt by the Attorney General. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal charges, including using a firearm to commit murder, in the case which prosecutors have called a premeditated assassination.</p>

The system reportedly integrates data from various sources like sonar buoys and water temperature to create a real-time underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While this technology could potentially undermine the strategic value of submarine-based nuclear deterrents, Western military experts express skepticism about its immediate real-world implementation.

The author contends that while technology once embraced personality, it now favors a spartan, unobtrusive aesthetic that leaves little room for joy or character, comparing it to a beige and bland fast-casual restaurant. This design philosophy, the article suggests, offers a false sense of control and order in a chaotic world.

          <p>According to a Guardian analysis, President Trump is leveraging the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to intensify a campaign against his political adversaries. Over the past ten days, the administration has escalated threats against the "radical left," considering domestic terrorist classifications for some groups despite no evidence linking them to the killing. Critics warn this response mirrors authoritarian tactics, using a tragedy as a pretext to crush dissent, undermine the Democratic party, and erode free speech protections. The upcoming memorial service for Kirk is expected to be a major platform for this political messaging.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of aviation technology, has caused significant disruptions at several key European airports, including London's Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected the company's check-in and baggage drop software, forcing airlines to revert to manual processing and leading to widespread delays and some cancellations. While the immediate impact was contained through manual workarounds, cybersecurity experts say the incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry. The attack on a single third-party vendor caused a ripple effect across multiple airlines and international borders.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed a plan to tackle the UK's asylum seeker backlog by invoking the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime. The party suggests using these sweeping powers to establish temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and double the number of asylum caseworkers to expedite decisions. This, they argue, would reduce the costly and controversial use of hotels to house asylum seekers. The proposal was unveiled at the party's annual conference as part of a focus on creating a more efficient and humane immigration system.</p>

          <p>Police in Sacramento have arrested a 64-year-old man suspected of shooting into the lobby of the local ABC affiliate, KXTV. The incident occurred just one day after protesters had gathered outside the station to demonstrate against ABC's suspension of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel. While the motive is still under investigation, authorities were able to identify and apprehend the suspect after linking him to a vehicle believed to have been used in the shooting. No one was injured in the incident, though the building was occupied at the time of the gunfire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, figures within the U.S. Christian nationalist movement are portraying him as a martyr for their cause. His widow described her grief as a "battle cry," and allied pastors have stated that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church," calling for followers to become more bold. This framing aligns with Kirk's own political evolution, as he increasingly embraced Christian culture war rhetoric and ideas popular in anti-democratic religious circles. His death is now being used to energize a movement that views political conflict as a spiritual battle.</p>

          <p>Several appliance brands, including Haier, Hisense, and Xiaomi, are introducing a new washing machine design featuring three separate drums to address the chore of running multiple laundry cycles. The design typically includes one large central drum and two smaller drums above it, allowing users to wash a main load while simultaneously running smaller, separate cycles for items like delicates or baby clothes. While this innovation promises greater convenience and efficiency, these machines are not yet widely available. Consumers can find a similar, though less expansive, feature in dual-drum models currently offered by brands like LG and Samsung.</p>

Lewinsky noted the cultural shift since the '90s, with younger generations and the #MeToo movement bringing a new perspective and language to issues of power abuse. She now focuses on helping others tell their stories through projects like her podcast, emphasizing that one can insist on a different ending to their story.</p>
