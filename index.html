          <p>A clinical trial at Shanghai's Fudan University enabled four paralyzed patients to regain leg control after minimally invasive surgery.  This breakthrough challenges Elon Musk's Neuralink technology, which assumes the irreversibility of paralysis in spinal cord injuries. The Chinese team achieved this by creating a neural bypass using implanted electrode chips.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge denied an injunction seeking mandatory gender testing in the NCAA to exclude transgender athletes from women's sports.  The ruling follows a lawsuit by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and three female athletes who argued that the NCAA's revised gender eligibility policy was insufficient.  The NCAA maintains its policy complies with President Trump's executive order.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the phenomenon of "pro-Israel antisemitism" within the Trump-aligned right wing, which involves simultaneous support for Israel and hostility towards American Jews.  It argues that this approach allows the right to maintain antisemitic views while appearing pro-Israel, and it examines examples of this phenomenon within the MAGA movement and its influence on American Jewish life.</p>
