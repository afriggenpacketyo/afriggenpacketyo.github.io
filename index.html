          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized a proposal by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. In response, Mexico labeled the move an "unfair deal," while the EU has threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if the tariffs are implemented, though both expressed a desire to continue negotiations. The proposed tariffs are part of a broader U.S. strategy to address long-standing trade deficits, with the Trump administration having now proposed new tariff conditions on 24 countries and the EU. This action has sparked disapproval from various European leaders and industry groups, who warn of a potential trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

For Swiatek, this victory adds a Wimbledon championship to her four French Open titles and one U.S. Open title, solidifying her status as a dominant force in women's tennis. The match was a career milestone for Anisimova, who was playing in her first-ever Grand Slam final after returning to the sport from a mental health break.</p>

          <p>A group of over 30 active and former Navy SEALs have volunteered to assist in the search and recovery operations in Texas Hill Country after last week's deadly floods. The SEALs are utilizing their specialized skills in difficult terrain and diving to navigate the debris-laden Guadalupe River, where they have tragically recovered several victims. The volunteers, working with the non-profit 300 Justice Road, described the devastation as unprecedented, with the discovery of children's belongings being particularly difficult. Their efforts are focused on providing closure for the families of the missing by locating their loved ones amidst the widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>The long-standing feud between Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell has reignited, with Trump suggesting he is considering revoking the comedian's U.S. citizenship. In a social media post, he called O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity" and suggested she remain in Ireland, where she recently moved. O'Donnell responded fiercely, calling Trump a "criminal con man" and a "danger to our nation," continuing a public dispute that dates back to 2006. Despite the threat, legal experts note that the government cannot unilaterally revoke the citizenship of a natural-born U.S. citizen like O'Donnell.</p>

          <p>The 2018 murder of Aileen Seiden in Florida's Franklin County was a brutal crime that baffled investigators until they uncovered the victim's unconventional life. Seiden was involved in a "throuple," a three-person romantic relationship, with Zachary Abell and Christina Araujo, which was marked by jealousy and alcohol-fueled violence. The investigation, detailed in a "48 Hours" report, revealed that Seiden was killed in a motel room during a road trip with her partners. Both Abell and Araujo were ultimately convicted in connection with her death, with testimony revealing a horrific and prolonged assault.</p>

Gergiev has been largely barred from European stages since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine for not condemning the war. The regional leader of Campania, Italy, defended the decision, stating that culture should not be influenced by politics. However, critics, including a vice-president of the European Parliament, argue that Gergiev is a "cultural mouthpiece for Putin" and that his performance is part of a deliberate Kremlin strategy to soften Western public opinion.</p>

          <p>Britain's historic steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Redcar, are grappling with a precarious future as the industry faces a steep decline and ongoing uncertainty over U.S. tariffs. The closure of blast furnaces and thousands of job losses have devastated communities whose identities are deeply intertwined with steelmaking. While a 25% U.S. tariff on UK steel remains, a key concern is that the U.S. may not consider steel modified in the UK from imported materials as a UK product. This adds to the pressure from high energy prices and global competition, leaving many to question the industry's long-term viability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly denied rumors that he plans to resign from his position. Speculation arose following reports of his frustration with a Justice Department decision to conclude its review of the Jeffrey Epstein case without releasing further files, a move that angered many MAGA supporters. In a social media post, Patel affirmed his commitment to serving the President, stating the "conspiracy theories just aren’t true." The denial comes amid reports of a heated confrontation between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino over the public handling of the Epstein matter.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to a massive coltan mining site in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which is currently under the control of M23 rebels. The Rubaya mine, vital for the production of mobile phones and other electronics, employs over 10,000 miners and is a significant source of revenue for the armed group. A UN report detailed how the M23 profits from taxing the mineral, much of which is allegedly smuggled to Rwanda. The visit comes as a fragile ceasefire deal is in place, with the U.S. reportedly seeking mineral rights in the region as part of its involvement in the peace process.</p>

          <p>The reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence in popularity, with viewership for its 12th series returning to levels not seen in years.

Content creators and fans are using the platform for recaps, analysis, and discourse, making the show more accessible to viewers who cannot commit to the nightly one-hour episodes.

          <p>With the cost of package holidays soaring, families are employing creative strategies to save money on their summer vacations. One family saved thousands of pounds by booking a last-minute, all-inclusive trip to Mexico just two days before departure, which was cheaper than a European holiday. Another couple saved over £3,000 by traveling off-peak and finding a "kids go free" deal for their twin daughters. Other popular money-saving hacks include home-swapping to get free accommodation, using credit card loyalty points for flights, and house-sitting to enjoy a staycation or travel affordably within another country.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas have killed at least 129 people, including children at a summer camp, with dozens still missing. The disaster, fueled by moisture from a tropical system, caused the river to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during a holiday weekend. Survivors reported receiving no emergency warnings, leading to intense scrutiny of local officials and the county's lack of a robust flood alert system. While officials have called it an unforeseeable "100-year flood," discussions are now underway about state funding for an improved warning system to prevent future tragedies.</p>
