Her cancers are potentially linked to the toxic dust she inhaled, and she is part of the World Trade Center Health Program. After using running to process the trauma of 9/11, her subsequent cancer diagnoses and grueling treatments tested her resolve. Now cancer-free again, she is undertaking the charity bike ride to celebrate her health and raise money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>Despite two recent analyst downgrades to a neutral rating, the CNBC Investing Club expresses continued confidence in GE Vernova. The downgrades from Mizuho and Guggenheim were primarily attributed to the stock's significant price increase and current valuation, not fundamental weaknesses in the company's performance. In fact, Mizuho raised its price target, citing accelerating margin expansion. The analysis suggests that the company's strong order book for gas turbines remains a key positive factor for its long-term outlook, viewing the current market tepidity as a potential buying opportunity.

The Metropolitan Police also charged him with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, intentional strangulation, coercive and controlling behavior, and making threats to kill. The alleged offenses took place between 2022 and 2024, and the investigation began earlier this year. A woman is being supported by specially-trained officers, and Gallagher is scheduled to appear in court in late August.</p>

The deal has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum, with some questioning the legality and ethics of accepting such a high-value gift from a foreign power.

          <p>As extreme heat becomes more common, it is crucial to know how to stay safe, as heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the U.S. Experts advise staying in air-conditioned spaces, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding strenuous activity during the hottest parts of the day. It is important to recognize the symptoms of heat exhaustion and the more severe heat stroke, which requires immediate medical attention. Special care should be taken for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, and those with chronic health conditions, who are at greater risk for heat-related illness.</p>

          <p>Despite recent changes to airport security that make standard screening lines faster, such as ending the "shoes off" policy, experts suggest paid services like TSA PreCheck still offer compelling benefits. While standard lines are improving, PreCheck continues to provide a significantly less stressful and more predictable experience, with 99% of its passengers waiting less than 10 minutes. The value of such programs depends on an individual's travel frequency, but for those who fly often, the convenience can be worth the cost.

          <p>A new scientific study indicates that the human immune system can be triggered simply by the sight of a sick person, even a virtual one. Researchers used VR headsets to show participants avatars, some of which appeared to have a cough. Brain monitoring and blood samples revealed that when a sick-looking avatar approached, participants' brains sounded an alarm, and a type of immune cell involved in early responses became more active. This suggests the brain can prime the body for a fight against infection before a pathogen is even present, opening potential therapeutic avenues.</p>
