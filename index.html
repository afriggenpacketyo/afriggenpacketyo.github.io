          <p>The Japanese government reported that 87 Japanese nationals and their family members were evacuated from Iran and Israel due to ongoing conflict in the Middle East. These individuals were transported to Baku, Azerbaijan, and Amman, Jordan, via bus, as local airports remained closed. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the government's commitment to protecting Japanese citizens and expressed deep concern over the retaliatory exchanges between Israel and Iran during discussions with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Sa'ar. Japan is also planning to dispatch Self-Defense Forces planes to Djibouti to assist in further evacuations if needed, as approximately 220 Japanese nationals remain in Iran and 1,000 in Israel. The situation remains tense as the U.S. considers potential military intervention. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing instability and potential for escalation.</p>

          <p>China's export of magnets to the US experienced a significant drop of 93.3% in May, according to recent customs data, reflecting the impact of trade tensions and export controls. This decline has put pressure on US manufacturers in sectors like defense, energy, and automotive. Exports to Germany and Japan also saw substantial decreases, with drops of 70% and 84.1% respectively. China's Ministry of Commerce has stated that it is expediting the review of rare earth-related export license applications and is willing to communicate with relevant countries to facilitate compliant trade. The export controls imposed by Beijing are intended to counter Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods, as the trade war continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping commemorated the 120th birth anniversary of Chen Yun, a key economic planner of the Communist Party of China, signaling a shift towards prioritizing resilient governance. Xi's speech focused on development planning and political resilience, with less emphasis on communist conviction compared to his 2015 address. He portrayed Chen as a model of disciplined governance, highlighting his ability to balance state-led and market approaches to economic planning. Xi also promoted Chen's maxim of following facts and embracing policy logic in uncertain times, suggesting a pragmatic approach to navigating current challenges. This rhetorical shift indicates a move towards technocratic governance amidst multiple crises.</p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton, a major UK airbase, and sprayed two military planes with red paint, leading to a security review. The group, Palestine Action, claimed responsibility, stating they aimed to disrupt operations related to the conflict in Gaza. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer condemned the action as vandalism, while the Ministry of Defence assesses the damage and works with police on the investigation. The activists claim to have put the air-to-air refuelling tankers "out of service", however a defence source told the BBC they did not expect the incident to affect operations, as RAF engineers are assessing the damage. This incident follows similar actions by Palestine Action targeting arms companies involved in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Apollo, a U.S. asset management firm, is set to provide a Â£4.5 billion loan to the Hinkley Point C nuclear project in the UK. The deal represents a significant private capital investment in a project of national interest for the UK, with the interest rate below 7%. The unsecured lending to EDF, the majority owner of Hinkley Point C, is believed to be earmarked for the project, which has faced delays and budget increases. This investment comes after China General Nuclear Power Corp halted its funding amid tensions with the British government, leaving EDF to cover the project's costs alone, and the first reactor is expected to come online in 2029.</p>

The Department of Energy has ordered the JH Campbell coal plant to remain open beyond its planned closure date, and a similar decision is expected for the Monroe power plant. Opponents argue that this decision lacks support in Michigan, could increase costs for ratepayers, and is ideologically driven, as the state's utilities did not request the plants to stay online. These plants emit significant greenhouse gases and pollutants, while the state aims for 100% clean energy by 2040.</p>

The author notes that entry-level hiring in some professions is already contracting due to AI automation and suggests that critics are often behind the curve in assessing AI's capabilities. The piece emphasizes that the real question is not whether AI can solve complex puzzles, but whether it can perform tasks that humans are currently paid to do.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old woman details her experience navigating life after a divorce and being catfished online. After a 23-year marriage ended, she moved to a new city and sought connection through online dating, where she encountered a man named Jay. Their relationship quickly escalated through texts, but red flags emerged when Jay claimed to be working on a military base and couldn't video chat. Eventually, she discovered Jay was a liar, but the experience, though painful, helped her regain hope and realize she was capable of feeling again.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Edinburgh have discovered that individuals with ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, exhibit significant differences in their blood compared to healthy individuals. This finding could lead to the development of a diagnostic test for the condition, which has long been dismissed as psychological. The study, which compared 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals, identified consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease. Researchers hope this evidence will help validate the experiences of individuals who have been disbelieved regarding their symptoms.</p>
