His comments followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Trump reiterated complaints about India's high tariffs on U.S. goods and its purchase of oil from Russia, claiming these actions create an unfair economic imbalance between the two nations.

A military commentator on state broadcaster CCTV highlighted the potential for an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, which would enhance China's long-range strike capabilities with greater penetration abilities. This development points toward a versatile family of land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic weapons being developed by the country's military.</p>

The piece references a recent op-ed in The Telegraph which described Britain's managerial class as rigid and fearful of questioning obsolete dogma, similar to the late Soviet era. The author argues that while the comparison's accuracy is debatable, the potential decline of the West has serious global consequences that warrant serious attention.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. Analysts suggest the move is intended to help the 10-nation Eurasian bloc reduce its reliance on the US dollar for trade and finance key infrastructure projects. The creation of such a lender would insulate member countries from risks associated with the dollar-dominated global financial system and accelerate regional development, marking a significant geopolitical shift.

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The announcement came two days after Giuliani was seriously injured in a car crash. The decision is notable given Giuliani's complex legacy, from being lauded as "America's Mayor" after 9/11 to facing disbarment and criminal charges for his role in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating, places the skull in the Middle Pleistocene era and strengthens the theory that it belongs to *Homo heidelbergensis*. The findings suggest this more primitive human species coexisted with emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of the human family tree.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days. Heightened solar activity from a recent coronal mass ejection means the phenomenon could be seen further south than is typical. While visibility depends on clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution, the event could offer a rare and memorable display for many residents, particularly in the Midlands and northern regions.</p>

          <p>The recent transfers of Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa, who both reportedly refused to train to force moves, have sparked a debate about player power in football. While some commentators have called their behavior "despicable," others argue that clubs are often hypocritical, as they show little loyalty when deciding to sell players. The success of these tactics contrasts with the case of Marc Guehi, whose professionalism did not result in his desired transfer, raising questions about player-club dynamics.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records at the US Open, but questions remain about his physical durability through the grueling tournament. Despite playing himself into good form, he has required medical attention for various physical issues in nearly every match so far. As he prepares to face No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a perfect 10-0 record, his biggest challenge may be whether his body can sustain the high level required to win a 25th Grand Slam title.</p>
