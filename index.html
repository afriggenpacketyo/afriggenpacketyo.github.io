          <p>Toyota Industries' shares experienced a significant drop following the announcement of a $33 billion deal by Toyota Group to take the company private. This deal occurs amidst increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind long-established cross-shareholding ties, with the Financial Services Agency advocating for a reduction in such arrangements. The offer price was considered unattractive by some analysts, as it was below the valuation range provided by independent financial advisors, who were rebuffed when requesting a higher offer. While the deal is seen as positive for Toyota Group in the long term if proceeds are used for growth investments, the immediate market reaction reflected concerns about the offer's value.

          <p>Australia's economy grew at a slower pace than anticipated in the first quarter, with a 1.3% year-on-year increase, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This undershot the expected 1.5% growth due to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports, exacerbated by extreme weather events affecting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to 3.85% to stimulate growth amid global trade tensions. Economists suggest that this GDP release could prompt further monetary policy easing by the RBA, though upside risks to inflation persist due to rising labor costs. (not investment advice)</p>

His election marks a turning point for the country after months of political turmoil, and he will now determine South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies toward China and North Korea.

Senior government watchdogs state that victim support services are being pushed to the brink by funding cuts and rising costs. The intervention comes ahead of the chancellor's spending review later this month, which is expected to feature cuts to some areas of public spending. Police chiefs have also warned Starmer that they will face stark choices about which crimes to investigate if their budgets are cut as expected.</p>

Sean Parnell, a spokesman for the Pentagon, told CBS on Tuesday that the renaming of the USNS Harvey Milk is to realign the US military with the Trump administration's goal of "re-establishing the warrior culture" in the armed forces. The directive also comes amid a broader movement by the Trump administration to curb programmes that promote diversity and inclusion across federal departments.</p>
