          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly responded to President Trump's repeated suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st state, declaring that Canada is "not for sale ever." Trump, prior to Carney's arrival, questioned the U.S.'s trade relationship with Canada, claiming the U.S. subsidizes Canada by $200 billion annually. Carney's visit follows his election win, fueled by an anti-Trump platform, and he aims to address trade pressures and the broader economic and security relationship between the two nations, while the historically friendly relationship between the U.S. and Canada remains strained amidst ongoing tariff disputes.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough, nearing his 99th birthday, is releasing a new film, Ocean, which he considers his most important message yet, emphasizing the ocean's crucial role in combating climate change and preserving biodiversity. The film showcases the severe damage caused by bottom trawling, a widespread fishing practice that devastates marine life and releases substantial amounts of carbon dioxide. Despite the grim state of the oceans, Attenborough remains optimistic, highlighting the ocean's remarkable ability to recover quickly. He urges global leaders to act decisively at an upcoming UN conference to protect a third of the world's oceans, believing that a healthier ocean ecosystem can significantly aid in trapping carbon dioxide and mitigating climate change.</p>

          <p>Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz stated that President Trump's tariffs on China are unlikely to bring toy manufacturing back to America, but will likely lead to price hikes. Kreiz explained that while toy creation, design, and engineering remain in America, producing toys in other countries allows for affordable pricing. Mattel has been diversifying its global manufacturing to reduce dependence on China, with less than 40% of its products sourced from China by the end of the year and no single country representing more than 25% of sourcing in two years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson indicated limited support among House Republican leaders for impeaching judges who block Trump's policies, favoring a bill to limit federal district judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. Johnson acknowledged the high bar for impeachment and the unlikelihood of Senate removal, emphasizing the importance of passing Congressman Issa's bill, the No Rogue Rulings Act, which would prevent individual judgments from halting administration policies. Some conservatives, however, still advocate for impeachment, potentially forcing a House vote, though this approach faces political risks and Senate failure. The article notes that this situation arises amid ongoing legal battles between the Trump administration and the courts over various policies.</p>

          <p>In a surprising move, 35 Democrats joined Republicans in the House to repeal California's requirement for all new vehicles to be electric or nonpolluting by 2035, a policy also adopted by 11 other states. Representative Lou Correa cited concerns about the high cost and impracticality of electric vehicles in his district, reflecting worries about the working class. Environmentalists expressed disappointment, attributing the vote to intense lobbying from the oil industry and concerns about rising prices due to Trump's trade wars. The New York Times article notes that some states are already reconsidering adopting California's ban, citing freedom of choice and potential cost increases.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains above target, some sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing price declines, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Economists attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors affecting specific categories, but caution that these lower prices are not expected to last due to potential tariff impacts. Despite President Trump's claims of gas prices at $1.98 per gallon, the average is still over $3, but prices have broadly declined in the past year, and the article analyzes the market sectors which are seeing prices fall.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade deal after three years of negotiations, aimed at boosting trade by an additional Â£25.5 billion a year by 2040. The agreement will reduce tariffs on UK exports like whisky, cars, and medical devices to India, while cutting taxes on India's clothing, footwear, and jewellery exports. While the British government hails the deal as the biggest since Brexit, opposition leaders have raised concerns about potential tax implications for Indian workers in the UK, with the BBC article noting that the terms of the deal include a three year National Insurance exemption for some Indian and British workers.</p>

          <p>HELOC interest rates have steadily declined this year, reaching their lowest point since 2023, averaging 7.95%.

The CBS News article notes that CME Group's FedWatch tool indicates a low chance of a rate cut this week, but higher chances for June and July.
