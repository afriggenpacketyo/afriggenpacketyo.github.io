The coins, scattered around the shipwreck nearly 2,000 feet below the ocean's surface, feature depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, with the Latin motto "Plus Ultra" signifying the expansion of the Spanish monarchy. Colombian authorities plan to begin extractions from the ship, discovered in 2015, while protecting it from treasure hunters.

          <p>The U.S. is spending over $1 trillion annually on debt servicing, raising concerns about long-term fiscal stability, especially with the potential increase from proposed tax and spending bills.

Experts warn that this growing debt could lead to economic strain and a financial crisis, similar to what occurred in Greece, as the government struggles to balance its budget. The situation is exacerbated by COVID-related spending and rising interest rates, contributing to a 32% increase in outstanding debt since 2020 (not investment advice).</p>

The education sector will receive increased funding for schools and training, while the NHS will benefit from a rise in spending to address increasing demands.

          <p>Traditional allies, including Japan, Britain, Canada, and France, are reportedly working more closely together due to Trump's trade and aid policies, which have led them to seek stronger alliances independent of the United States. Recent deals, such as a $170 billion defense agreement between Canada, Britain, and the EU, and sanctions placed on Israeli cabinet members by Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway, highlight this shift. Experts suggest that these actions reflect a desire for predictable, rules-based international affairs, a goal no longer shared by the Trump administration. As the G7 summit approaches, organizers have planned meetings without the U.S., indicating a growing divide between the U.S. and its traditional allies.</p>

          <p>Following two days of violent clashes in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, police have deployed additional officers to affected areas, with 32 officers injured and six people arrested. The violence, described as "racist thuggery," was sparked by a peaceful protest over an alleged sexual assault, targeting ethnic minorities and police officers. Police Scotland has agreed to send officers to provide additional support, and authorities are reviewing footage of the incidents for prosecutions. The unrest has led to increased fear among residents, undermining the criminal investigation and diverting resources from other communities, resulting in a dangerous situation for all those involved.</p>

          <p>Entering a romantic relationship often leads to a decline in friendships, as society prioritizes romantic bonds over platonic ones.

Jealousy and feelings of replacement can arise when friends enter new relationships, prompting intentional efforts to maintain connections. Prioritizing both love and friendship involves recognizing distinct roles and allocating time for both, ultimately enriching life with diverse and fulfilling relationships.</p>

Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying New York business records to cover up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.
