Dr. Katherine Keyes, a researcher cited in the report, stated that she did not write the paper attributed to her, raising concerns about the report's citation practices. The White House attributed the errors to "formatting issues" and stated that the report would be updated.

          <p>Jesse Armstrong, the creator of "Succession," is set to release his first feature-length film, "Mountainhead," a satire about tech billionaires facing social unrest. Armstrong explains that his interest lies in exploring power dynamics rather than simply focusing on wealth. "Succession" was about who holds power and why the world is the way it is. Armstrong wanted to capture the anxieties surrounding technology, especially AI, with a quick turnaround on the film, which stars Steve Carrell and Ramy Youssef.</p>

The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33, along with revenue ranging from $41.0 billion to $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts cited a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a minor operating margin miss as potential factors contributing to the stock's movement.

The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision, potentially leading to a Supreme Court review.
