          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a hydrogen-based explosive device in a controlled field test, achieving significant chemical chain reactions without nuclear materials. Developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, the 2kg bomb produced a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds, significantly longer than TNT blasts. The device uses a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material, originally intended for clean energy applications in off-grid areas, and rapidly releases hydrogen gas when activated by conventional explosives. The implications of this technology could be far-reaching, especially for underwater weapon systems and unconventional warfare. </p>

            <p>A woman in Spain, deemed at "medium" risk by a police algorithm (VioGén) after reporting threats from her ex-partner, was later killed. The algorithm assesses the likelihood of repeat domestic violence, but critics argue it may lead to police over-reliance on technology and neglect of individual circumstances. The case raises questions about algorithmic bias and the need for independent audits to ensure these systems effectively protect vulnerable women. The algorithm's assessment may have influenced the court's decision to deny her a restraining order, highlighting the potential consequences of flawed risk assessments.</p>

            <p>Roki Sasaki, despite his season-long six-inning, two-run start against the Texas Rangers on Saturday, will have to keep waiting for his first Major League Baseball victory. Veteran reliever Kirby Yates blew a save in the Dodgers’ 4-3 walk-off loss. Sasaki's fastball velocity was lower than usual, but he effectively used his other pitches to hold the Rangers to just two runs. The Dodgers' offense rallied to give Sasaki the lead, but the bullpen faltered in the ninth inning.</p>
