          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not dismissed the possibility of assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, citing the regime as an existential threat. Netanyahu has stated Israel's desire to see a change in the Iranian regime and urged Iranians to stand up for their freedom. When asked if Israel would attempt to kill Khamenei, Netanyahu said Israel is doing what it needs to do, rejecting suggestions that such a move would escalate the conflict, claiming it would end it. The article notes that even if Khamenei were killed, Iran's system has a process for leadership succession, and internal tensions, not external actions, are more likely to cause regime change. </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is now advocating for a national inquiry into grooming gangs, a shift from his earlier stance where he accused those calling for it of pandering to the far-right. This change of heart follows the release of Baroness Casey's report, which calls for a national criminal operation and inquiry to coordinate local investigations into abuse. The report also highlights issues with data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators, suggesting officials have shied away from the issue. Starmer stated that the national inquiry must address all relevant aspects, including ethnicity and the role of public officials. </p>

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family has gained backing from 55 attorneys general nationwide, resolving claims related to the opioid crisis. The settlement would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, preventing them from selling opioids in the U.S., and distribute funds over 15 years to affected states. The funds are intended to compensate victims and combat the opioid crisis, with Purdue stating the settlement will deliver overdose rescue medicines and address opioid use disorder. The previous settlement was rejected by the Supreme Court due to concerns about shielding the Sackler family from liability. </p>

          <p>Tuesday's primary contests in Virginia are considered a significant indicator of President Donald Trump's performance and influence. The general election in November is seen as a referendum on Trump's second term, with analysts noting that Trump's policies and popularity will play a crucial role in the outcome. The article points out that the Republican and Democratic parties have already selected their nominees for key positions. The Democratic primaries have seen strong turnout, fueled by opposition to Trump's agenda, particularly the policies of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) which have impacted northern Virginia's federal workforce. </p>

          <p>A Bronx high school student is advocating for the Open Captioning Accessibility Act in New York, aiming to make movie theaters more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. The student, Sarah Lin, has seen firsthand how inaccessible movie theaters can be due to her mother's hearing loss. The act would require movie theaters to offer some showings with open captions each week. Advocates argue that closed captioning is a more reliable option than assistive devices, and they hope New York's example will encourage other states to follow suit. </p>

          <p>Experts suggest that the Trump Organization's newly announced smartphone, the T1, will likely be manufactured in China despite claims that it will be built in the United States. Analysts argue that the phone was likely designed and will be manufactured by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). They cite the lack of readily available smartphone manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. and the impracticality of designing the phone from scratch domestically. This comes after Trump has previously urged Apple to manufacture its iPhones in the U.S., a move experts deem nearly impossible and costly. </p>
