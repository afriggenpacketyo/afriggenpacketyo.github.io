          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has named eight new advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, replacing the previous roster of 17 members. Kennedy stated that his picks are committed to evidence-based medicine and demanding definitive safety data before making vaccine recommendations. Several of Kennedy's selections have histories of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety, circumventing the usual CDC process for selecting committee members. This move has drawn criticism from public health advocates who fear it could undermine public confidence in vaccines and lead to an anti-vaccine agenda.</p>

The GHF aims to provide aid without the need to compromise with nefarious purposes, offering an alternative to the challenges faced by other aid organizations.

          <p>The United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue to negotiate in good faith, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Bessent's remarks suggest a willingness to push the deadline beyond 90 days for countries actively engaged in negotiations. Japan is one such partner, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba scheduled to meet with President Trump at the upcoming G7 summit. The pause, which runs until July 8, applies to country-specific tariffs under the reciprocal scheme, covering about 60 trading partners with trade surpluses with the United States.

          <p>A former CIA analyst, Asif William Rahman, has been sentenced to 37 months in prison for leaking classified documents about Israel's plans to strike Iran. Rahman pleaded guilty to charges under the Espionage Act after printing, photographing, and transmitting top-secret documents that were later circulated on social media. The leaked information pertained to Israel's air strikes on Iran in October 2024, which targeted military sites in response to earlier missile launches by Tehran. This incident highlights the serious consequences of mishandling classified information and the potential damage to national security.</p>

This move is expected to give Hong Kong a competitive edge in Asia, with a friendlier regulatory stance than Singapore.

This discovery reveals an evolutionary shift from small hunters to the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia.

While a procedural vote passed along party lines, the final vote may face resistance from Republicans concerned about targeting popular programs like PBS and NPR.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist arrested by immigration officers in March. Judge Michael Farbiarz paused the injunction until June 13 to allow the government time to appeal. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, was arrested as part of President Trump's crackdown on international students protesting the Israel-Gaza war. The judge stated there was no compelling interest to keep Khalil in custody and that his career and reputation were being damaged, chilling his speech.</p>

          <p>David Hogg, the vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, will step down from his role following months of infighting within the party. His decision comes after members of the committee voted to hold new vice-chair elections. Hogg stated that there is a fundamental disagreement about the role of a Vice Chair, adding that it's okay to have disagreements. In April, DNC chair Ken Martin endorsed a proposal that would have forced Hogg to choose between his vice-chair position and his push to bring generational change to the party.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying immigration enforcement, targeting undocumented farm workers in California with raids. Immigration lawyers report that detainees, including families with young children, were held in inadequate conditions with limited access to food and water. US immigration officials have conducted further "enforcement activity" in California's agricultural heartland, leading to protests and criticism from advocacy groups and local officials. The increasing raids come as Ice ramps up its efforts to meet a reported quota of 3,000 detentions a day set by Stephen Miller, Trump's White House deputy chief of staff.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson, who passed away on Wednesday at the age of 82, was a visionary musician whose sound epitomized the lore of Southern California. As a composer, constructor of textures, and arranger of vocal harmonies, he was among the greats, alongside Phil Spector, George Martin, and the Motown team. Wilson's genius lay in his control of emotion, articulating feelings of affection, fear, and disappointment. The Beach Boys' music, especially their masterpiece "Pet Sounds," captures the essence of the California dream while exploring deeper emotional themes.</p>
