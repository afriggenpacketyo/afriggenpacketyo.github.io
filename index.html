          <p>Seven men have been convicted of sexually assaulting two teenage girls in Rochdale over a five-year period. The victims, referred to as Girl A and Girl B, were groomed from the age of 13 and treated as "sex slaves" by the gang, who worked as stallholders and taxi drivers. The girls were plied with drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes in exchange for sexual activity, with one victim claiming social workers were aware but did not intervene. The Greater Manchester Police has apologized for their failure to act on the information they had at the time, stating they have since improved their investigation procedures.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has temporarily halted a federal judge's order that would have returned control of California's National Guard troops to the state. The Trump administration deployed the troops to Los Angeles to quell immigration raids, claiming it was necessary to restore order and protect ICE agents. California Governor Gavin Newsom opposed the move, arguing it was an unnecessary provocation and asserting that the military should be on the battlefield, not city streets. The appeals court will hold a hearing to further consider the matter, leaving the National Guard in federal control for the time being.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece describes the author's experience traveling to China after the country reopened its borders following the COVID-19 pandemic. The author, who previously taught in China, noted a significant change in the atmosphere, with a more welcoming and friendly environment for foreigners. This "new opening up" contrasts with reports of increasing authoritarianism and warnings of arbitrary detention, as the author experienced a streamlined visa application process and minimal questioning upon arrival. The piece suggests that China is actively working to attract international visitors through measures like visa-free entry schemes and simplified application processes.</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, scientists, and military commanders, followed by Iran launching over 100 drones at Israel. Israel claimed the strikes were preemptive, aimed at thwarting an Iranian plan to destroy Israel and develop nuclear weapons. Iranian officials have vowed a strong response, raising concerns about a wider regional conflict, with the U.S. urging Iran not to target U.S. interests or personnel. NATO Secretary-General urged de-escalation, but the situation remains highly volatile with potential implications for U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>The High Court has rejected a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights, particularly for children with special educational needs, those in same-sex schools, and low-paying faith schools. The court ruled that Parliament made the policy after full debate and considered its impact, deciding the revenue raised for state schools outweighed any adverse effects. The government estimates the policy will generate Â£1.8 billion annually to support pupils in state schools.</p>

          <p>A Bulgarian influencer named Zornitsa Gyutsova is facing backlash for her online content that promotes misogyny and incites violence against women. Gyutsova's posts suggest that women prefer men who are physically abusive and that men should control their partners psychologically and physically. Despite complaints filed with the prosecutor's office, no charges have been brought against her because Bulgaria's criminal code does not define gender discrimination as a crime. While her social media profiles were briefly deactivated, they have since been reactivated, highlighting the challenges in addressing online misogyny and incitement to violence.</p>

Instead, the expert recommends acknowledging these fathers and offering support with phrases such as "You are important, and we celebrate you today. Support is here if you ask for it." The expert emphasizes that no father dreams of being away from their child and that parenting is a team sport requiring support systems. Recent studies highlight the negative impact of parental separation on children, but the expert underscores that even separated or struggling parents want the best for their children.</p>

          <p>Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israeli territory in response to Israel's missile strike on the country, which killed senior military leaders. Israel stated its attack targeted nuclear enrichment facilities and came just days before scheduled U.S. and Iranian nuclear deal talks. Rocket sirens sounded in northern Jordan, and the U.S. urged Iran to reach a deal "before it's too late." The escalating conflict raises concerns about regional stability and potential disruptions to global markets.</p>

          <p>The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) reports assisting approximately 50 households following disorder in Ballymena, with 14 families receiving emergency accommodation. The unrest, triggered by a protest over an alleged sexual assault, has led to racial attacks and families hiding in fear. NIHE anticipates increased demand for emergency and temporary housing, but faces challenges due to limited availability. Concerns are growing about vulnerable households, particularly those with children, who may be susceptible to exploitation, as police investigate racially motivated attacks and anti-immigration graffiti in the region.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Elon Musk has experienced a decrease in favorability among Republicans following his public disagreement with President Donald Trump. The poll reveals that fewer Republicans view Musk "very favorably" compared to previous surveys, suggesting his opposition to Trump's legislative agenda and subsequent online exchanges may have impacted his standing within the party. While Musk's overall popularity remains relatively stable, the shift in Republican sentiment highlights potential challenges for the tech billionaire's political influence. The poll also found that Americans view Tesla less favorably than Musk himself.</p>

          <p>Meta AI is making user searches public, potentially without users' full awareness, as prompts and results are posted on a public feed. This practice raises privacy concerns, as some posts can be traced back to social media accounts, revealing sensitive information about users' searches. Examples include users posting test questions seeking answers and requests for images of scantily clad characters. One internet safety expert has called it "a huge user experience and security problem," highlighting the need for greater transparency and user control over data sharing.</p>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists have issued an open letter denouncing the resurgence of fascism in its various forms. The letter draws parallels to a similar act of defiance against Mussolini in 1925, emphasizing the need to defend democratic institutions, call out abuses of human rights, and uphold facts and evidence. It warns against the undermining of national and international rule of law, the targeting of independent institutions, and the suppression of dissent. The signatories call for collective action, boycotts, and strikes to resist authoritarianism and protect universal human rights.</p>

          <p>Recent policy changes are poised to make life significantly harder for Baby Boomers, who have generally enjoyed prosperity and security. Potential overhauls of Social Security, volatile markets, and cuts to Medicare and Medicaid access are creating insecurity for their assets, long-term care, and Social Security benefits. Cuts to Social Security will disproportionately affect low-income Boomers, while middle-income seniors face risks from market volatility and rising medical costs. Decreased funding for research into diseases of old age, such as Alzheimer's, could also worsen the experience of aging for future generations.</p>

          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait, which sees roughly 20 million barrels of oil and oil products pass through daily, would likely trigger further retaliation and could draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Experts suggest that disrupting the channel would be more detrimental than beneficial for Tehran, as most of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route. It is argued that closing the waterway might even be physically impossible.</p>
