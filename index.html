          <p>President Trump addressed the graduating class of the United States Military Academy at West Point, praising them as "winners" and heralding a "golden age" for the U.S. military.

          <p>In early May, military air traffic controllers near the Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter for approximately 20 seconds. This communication lapse prompted two commercial jets to abort their landings at Reagan National Airport out of an abundance of caution. The Army attributed the loss of contact to a temporary antenna's placement during construction of a new control tower, stating that the helicopter's location was continuously broadcast via ADS-B.  The incident raises concerns about safety protocols following a deadly midair collision earlier in the year.</p>
