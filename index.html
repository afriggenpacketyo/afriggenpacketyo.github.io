          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer plans to maintain current pricing levels, despite tariffs, due to its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. Over half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports, aiming for no single country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. CEO Ted Decker noted that high interest rates and economic uncertainty have dampened larger home improvement projects, with consumers focusing on smaller tasks. The company expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the year, with comparable sales rising about 1%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Fed reports that the resumption of collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans could lead to a spike in delinquencies and a "spillover effect," causing borrowers to fall behind on other debt repayments. With the end of pandemic-era pauses, disposable income could be reduced by billions each month, potentially increasing credit card debt as borrowers struggle to manage student loan payments. Experts like Ted Rossman from Bankrate emphasize that something has to give, while Matt Schulz from LendingTree notes that the money used for student loans cannot be used for other financial needs.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, Ukrainians expressed a mix of exhaustion and determination to continue fighting despite what they perceive as a lack of meaningful pressure on Moscow from the United States. Citizens like Olena Boiko, who has suffered significant losses, view diplomatic efforts as disconnected from the realities on the ground, while others like Liliia Zambrovska emphasize the need for self-reliance and support from allies. Lieutenant Pavlo Velychko noted intensified Russian offensives under the guise of negotiations, and Oleksandr Palii highlighted European allies' steadfast support and Ukraine's growing domestic weapons production, reflecting a collective resolve to defend their future regardless of U.S. involvement.

          <p>Texas lawmakers are pushing for federal reimbursement of billions spent on border security under the Biden administration, citing a "dereliction of duty" by the federal government. The proposed State Border Security Assistance Act would create funding sources within the Justice Department and Homeland Security Department to reimburse states for border wall construction, law enforcement surveillance, and the apprehension and prosecution of illegal immigrants. Texas officials argue that they had to self-fund Operation Lone Star due to federal inaction, and the reimbursement would ensure the state is repaid for protecting the nation's southern border.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for a massive budget package, facing resistance from dueling factions within the party. Conservatives are pushing for steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates are wary of larger cuts to the program and are demanding changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). With a slim majority, House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to build consensus around a modified version of the bill before a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill, officially known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, faces key hurdles as it advances towards a full vote in the House of Representatives. Four Republican dissidents are withholding their support, arguing that the bill's spending cuts are insufficient to reduce the US national debt. Key points of contention include the extent of cuts to Medicaid, the implementation of work requirements for Medicaid recipients, and the level of state and local tax deductions.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a decision that would allow asset managers to offer an ETF share class of an existing mutual fund, potentially giving investors more choice. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief, and recent amendments to their applications indicate progress. A key concern for the SEC is the tax treatment, as co-mingling funds might result in ETF holders facing unexpected tax bills, which the updated guidelines aim to address.</p>

          <p>A Republican plan to tax university endowments, intended to target "woke, elite universities," could also affect smaller schools like McPherson College in Kansas. The tiered tax, part of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," would impose a top rate of 21 percent on schools with endowments of at least $2 million per student. While proponents say the tax aims to ensure elite schools can no longer abuse tax benefits, critics argue it would harm institutions that use endowments to fund financial aid for students.</p>
