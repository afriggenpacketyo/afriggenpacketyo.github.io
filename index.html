          <p>Vladimir Putin led Russia's Victory Day parade in Red Square, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, amidst tight security following Ukrainian strikes. Putin addressed the military, veterans, and international leaders, including China's Xi Jinping, emphasizing Russia's commitment to truth and justice. A unilateral ceasefire was announced but rejected by Ukraine, who called it a "theatrical show," and reported thousands of attacks since it began. Restrictions were in place in Moscow, and several world leaders attended, while the EU's foreign policy chief discouraged participation due to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir has escalated tensions between India and Pakistan, bringing the two countries to the brink of war.

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain U.S. imports like steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a major shift from its protectionist policies. This comes after President Trump announced tariffs on Indian exports, which are now suspended. Experts suggest India aims to boost foreign investment and global market access, while ensuring domestic businesses are not harmed. A trade deal could benefit sectors like financials, materials, and healthcare, but the absence of a deal could compromise their earnings.</p>

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by shipments to Southeast Asian countries, offsetting a sharp drop in goods to the U.S. due to tariffs.

Analysts suggest the surge may be due to transshipment and pre-tariff contracts, expecting trade data to weaken in coming months. The U.S. has placed tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliation with 125% tariffs on American imports.</p>

          <p>Judith Robbins, a holiday lettings manager in Blackpool, faces potential bankruptcy after her flats were reclassified as "second homes," resulting in a significant council tax debt. Under new tax rules, her business rates increased drastically, making it unaffordable to continue operating. Other business owners in the town are facing similar issues, with many considering selling their properties. The tax changes are part of a government crackdown on second homes and holiday lets, but critics argue they are harming seaside resorts.</p>
