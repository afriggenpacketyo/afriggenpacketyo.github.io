          <p>An individual allegedly linked to the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing has been apprehended at JFK Airport in New York City and is awaiting extradition to California. The 26-year-old primary suspect, motivated by a fringe "pro-mortalism" ideology, died in the blast last month, which injured four others. The FBI has classified the bombing as an act of domestic terrorism, noting the suspect's intention to destroy human embryos stored at the American Reproductive Centers facility, though the clinic director confirmed that no embryos were harmed in the attack.</p>

The ground beef was produced on May 22 and 23, 2025, and distributed to Whole Foods Market retail locations nationwide, as well as distributor locations in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, and Maryland. While there have been no confirmed reports of illness, consumers are urged to discard or return the product, as E. coli can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, with children under 5 and older adults being particularly susceptible to a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).</p>

McCook, who died in a B-25C "Mitchell" crash during a bombing raid over Burma in 1943, have been accounted for. McCook was credited with saving the life of Sgt.

McCook's remains were recovered in 1947 but remained unidentified until recently, and he will be buried in his hometown in August 2025 with a rosette placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.</p>

Despite exceeding earnings estimates and posting in-line revenue for the fiscal first quarter, CrowdStrike announced a $1 billion share repurchase plan, but analysts downgraded the stock due to concerns about valuation and recurring one-time events.

          <p>Geert Wilders, the leader of the far-right PVV party, has withdrawn from the governing coalition in the Netherlands, triggering fresh elections and aiming to become the next prime minister. The move comes after a dispute over migration policy, with Wilders proposing a '10-point plan' on asylum that includes strict measures, such as military units at borders and halting accommodation for refugees. Experts question whether Wilders can build alliances with other parties, as his reputation as a politician who walks away when things get tough may hinder his chances, although some believe discontent over migration policy could reward him with votes.</p>

Despite this, Trump has publicly defended Barrett, highlighting her intelligence and commitment to interpreting the Constitution as written. While some conservative voices have expressed disappointment, legal scholars note that Barrett has consistently voted conservatively on key issues like abortion and gun rights, and she votes with Justice Kavanaugh 90% of the time. Despite the rumblings, it is not a fair comparison to liken Barrett to the late Justice David Souter.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a pairing that defies current scientific understanding of planet formation. The gas giant planet, named TOI-6894b, has a slightly larger radius than Saturn but only half its mass, and orbits its star in just over three days. This discovery challenges the core accretion theory, as low-mass stars were not thought capable of hosting such large planets, and the planet's unusually cold temperature also intrigues scientists, with the James Webb space telescope scheduled to study it further in the coming year.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which drove an earlier-than-usual wave of infections last year. With GII.17 now dominant in the U.S., questions arise about whether norovirus season could start early again, as several other countries also experienced shifted waves of the virus. While the CDC is monitoring outbreaks, it cautions that there is insufficient data to definitively link GII.17's emergence to a change in the norovirus season, though shifts in strains typically lead to more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.</p>

The initial investigation was criticized for not properly sealing off the apartment from which she vanished, and searches at the time were not rigorous and seemed unstructured. The publicly-known evidence against the suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, is based on comments he is alleged to have made to a friend about Madeleine's death, and on the fact a phone linked to him was in Praia da Luz on the night she disappeared.</p>

While tariffs can protect domestic industries, they also lead to higher prices for consumers and a net loss of economic surplus overall. Economists emphasize that targeted tariffs on specific goods or industries may be beneficial, but broad-based tariffs create uncertainty and make it difficult for businesses to plan, especially considering the balance between consumer and producer surplus in the long term.
