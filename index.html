          <p>China's trade performance in July surpassed market expectations, with exports growing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. This unexpected surge occurred as a tariff truce with the United States approaches its expiration, possibly prompting businesses to front-load shipments. The import growth marked the largest jump in a year, suggesting a potential recovery in domestic demand. Despite this positive trade data, China's factory activity unexpectedly contracted, indicating underlying weakness in the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Highway Loss Data Institute, the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the most stolen vehicle in America, with a theft rate 39 times higher than the average car. The analysis found that expensive, high-horsepower vehicles and pickup trucks are frequently targeted by thieves. The report suggests that the Camaro's desirability and a specific vulnerability in its onboard data port make it a prime target. In contrast, electric vehicles were among the least stolen, possibly because they are often parked in secure garages. </p>

          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant technology disruption that led to a nationwide ground stop for its mainline flights, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and Newark. The airline attributed the problem to its Unimatic system and confirmed it was not a cybersecurity issue. The ground stop was lifted after several hours, but residual delays continued throughout the evening. United stated it would treat the disruption as a controllable delay, meaning it will cover passenger expenses like hotels where applicable.</p>

The blaze, described by officials as the largest in nearly 80 years, has resulted in one death, one missing person, and 13 injuries, including nine firefighters. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft, are battling the flames amid unfavorable weather conditions with high winds and temperatures.

However, South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix, along with Taiwan's TSMC, saw their shares rise, as their significant investments in U.S. production facilities are expected to shield them from the new levy.

According to witnesses, agents emerged from the back of the truck after the driver offered work, leading to the arrest of 16 people. The tactic has sparked fear and condemnation from immigrant advocates and city leaders, who question whether it violates a recent federal court order restricting immigration enforcement methods that rely on racial profiling. </p>

The new system aims to better reflect local needs, redirecting funds to areas with more low-band council tax properties.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has labeled the recent U.S. jobs report as 'concerning,' focusing on the substantial downward revisions to hiring data for May and June. She observed that such large revisions are historically 'typical of turning points' in the economy, hinting at a potential slowdown. Cook also spoke of an 'uncertainty tax' affecting businesses, where executives must spend valuable time preparing for macroeconomic instability and potential tariff impacts, resulting in a loss of productivity.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's justification for firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner reveals that his claims about the timing of jobs report revisions are incorrect. Trump alleged that the BLS released 'phony' strong numbers before the 2024 election and revised them down afterward, but a major downward revision of over 800,000 jobs was actually announced in August 2024, months before the election. Furthermore, the final pre-election report showed a sharp hiring slowdown, which his campaign used to attack his opponent at the time.</p>

          <p>A new report warns of a deepening insurance crisis in Florida, suggesting that escalating risks from extreme weather could render parts of the state uninsurable in the future. The study highlights that home insurance premiums in some coastal areas have surged to an average of $14,000 a year, driven by more frequent and severe hurricanes fueled by climate change. Experts state that risk models are now playing catch-up, leading to a rapid and painful price correction that is straining household budgets across the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly announced 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian goods are expected to hit certain sectors of its economy particularly hard, even if the overall GDP impact is limited. An economic analysis indicates that industries like gems and jewellery, textiles, apparel, and chemicals are the most exposed to the steep levies. However, India's vast exports in IT services and pharmaceuticals, which are not targeted under the current tariffs on goods, are likely to be insulated, partially shielding the broader Indian economy and its equity markets.
