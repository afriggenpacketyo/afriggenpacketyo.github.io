          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit alleges the newspaper knowingly published false information about a purported "bawdy" birthday letter from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump vehemently denies writing or drawing the contents of the letter, which the Journal reported was reviewed by criminal investigators. A spokesperson for Dow Jones, the Journal's publisher, stated they have full confidence in their reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an active MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room against staff orders after hearing his relative screaming during a scan. The powerful magnetic force of the machine drew him in, causing fatal injuries. The incident highlights the strict safety protocols surrounding MRI technology, as metallic objects can become dangerous projectiles in the machine's magnetic field. Experts note that such deaths are rare.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The legislation provides consumer protections and clear definitions for stablecoins, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce volatility. Supporters, including major crypto firms, believe the act will facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions and allow banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. The bill's passage is seen as a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The condition, described as benign and common in older adults, occurs when leg veins struggle to send blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. Dr. Sean P. Barbabella stated that medical evaluations, including ultrasounds, confirmed the CVI diagnosis but found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots, declaring the president to be in "excellent health." Treatment for mild cases typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise and wearing compression stockings.</p>

          <h2>UK Experiencing a Surge in Wasp Populations This Summer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 19:06:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts report that the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in its wasp population this summer, likely due to a very warm and dry spring creating ideal breeding conditions. While many of the UK's 9,000 wasp species are solitary, the more noticeable social wasps are thriving, leading to more human interactions. Entomologists emphasize the ecological importance of wasps as apex predators and natural pest controllers, urging the public to coexist with them. They note that while wasps can be a nuisance, they play a vital role in the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking competition "MasterChef" is in crisis after both of its longtime presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were fired following investigations into their conduct. An inquiry upheld over 40 claims against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact, while a separate allegation of using a racist term was upheld against Torode. The sackings have revealed deep tensions between the presenters and between the production company and the BBC. Despite the turmoil, the BBC has stated that the show, a highly successful global format, will continue with new hosts.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis explores the deep-seated investment of many Trump supporters in the Jeffrey Epstein case, viewing it as a symbol of a corrupt "deep state" controlling government and society. The article suggests that for this segment of the base, the case is less about Epstein himself and more about a belief in a shadowy system of elite control. This conspiratorial thinking, which has been part of the MAGA movement since its inception, has created a political challenge for the Trump administration as it navigates demands for transparency while trying to manage expectations about what government files actually contain.</p>

          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," has transformed the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen into a fantasy spoof inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play draws on a tabloid story from 2004 about Coleen's allegedly discarded engagement ring. The writer emphasizes that the show is an affectionate homage rather than a critique, celebrating the couple as heroic figures. The production is characteristic of Liverpool's Royal Court theatre, which focuses on original, locally relevant comedies.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's public health service will extend its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination program to include premature babies starting this autumn. The new program will provide a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, to infants born too early to have benefited from the maternal RSV vaccine offered during pregnancy. RSV is a highly infectious virus that is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness and reduce pressure on hospitals by protecting a highly vulnerable group.</p>

          <p>A remarkable story from two decades ago is being revisited, recounting how a 12-year-old girl in Ethiopia was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. In June 2005, the girl had been abducted by men intending to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. A pride of three lions reportedly chased the men away and then stood guard over the terrified girl until she was found by authorities. Wildlife experts at the time speculated that the girl's whimpering may have mimicked the sound of a lion cub, preventing the lions from attacking her.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it is canceling "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" after its upcoming season, citing financial pressures that are affecting the entire late-night television landscape. The decision has sparked a broader debate about the viability of the traditional talk show format in an era of declining viewership and shifting media consumption habits. While the network cited finances, the timing, coming days after Colbert criticized a settlement between parent company Paramount and President Trump, has drawn scrutiny and accusations of political motivation from some public figures, which the network denies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria byproduct and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by certain bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation in the colon. This finding helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and why treatments vary in effectiveness among patients. The research could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific inflammatory pathway.</p>

Public media leaders warn the cuts will be devastating, especially for smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on federal money to operate. Tom Michael, general manager of Boise State Public Radio, stated the loss of 20% of his budget could lead to a reduction in staff and services, threatening the existence of news coverage in areas already becoming "news deserts."

Lowry's score on the 12th hole was changed from a five to a seven, significantly impacting his position.
