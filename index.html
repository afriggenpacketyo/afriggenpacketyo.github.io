          <p>A "No Kings" protest in downtown Los Angeles escalated from peaceful to violent.  Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers deployed tear gas and flash-bangs after protesters allegedly threw objects at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building. Protesters blamed the escalation on police aggression, while law enforcement cited the throwing of rocks, bricks, bottles, and fireworks.  The LAPD closed nearby freeways and enforced a downtown curfew.</p>
