          <p>Following the assassination of founder Charlie Kirk, the board of Turning Point USA has unanimously elected his widow, Erika Kirk, as the new CEO and Chair. The organization stated that this decision aligns with Charlie Kirk's previously expressed wishes for succession in the event of his death. Erika Kirk is scheduled to speak at her late husband's memorial service alongside prominent political figures. This leadership transition occurs as the investigation into the killing continues, with a suspect now in custody.</p>

This vision is materializing with the new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display and a neural wristband for control. The device's initial capabilities focus on core functions like messaging, aiming to make daily digital interactions more fluid.</p>

          <p>The late-night talk show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' has been pulled off the air indefinitely by ABC following comments the host made about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel argued that the political right was exploiting the tragedy for political points, which prompted a strong backlash and a celebratory response from President Donald Trump. This event marks a significant escalation in the long-simmering feud between the comedian and the president. The suspension underscores the highly polarized and sensitive political environment surrounding media commentary.</p>

          <p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr weighed in on ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, stating the host appeared to "mislead" the public regarding the killing of Charlie Kirk. Carr suggested the FCC might take action against ABC's parent company, Disney, and commented that the media landscape is undergoing a massive shift, partly enabled by President Trump's election. These remarks have drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and former President Obama, who accused the administration of using regulatory threats to silence media critics.</p>

          <p>A Fox News opinion newsletter has sharply criticized The New York Times for what it describes as a "lame correction" to an article that allegedly smeared the late Charlie Kirk. The newsletter claims the Times quoted the Turning Point USA founder out of context on the day of his assassination, accusing him of antisemitism. This piece compiles several stories defending Kirk's legacy, including his support for Israel, and frames the media coverage as part of a broader, biased effort by mainstream outlets to undermine conservative figures.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has eased its martial law restrictions to allow men between the ages of 18 and 22 to leave and re-enter the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the policy aims to give young men more freedom, hoping it will encourage them to build their futures in Ukraine rather than leaving permanently. The decision has generated a national debate, with supporters viewing it as a positive step towards normalcy, while critics worry it is unfair to active soldiers and that many who leave will not return.</p>

The leaders acknowledged a "disagreement" over the UK's intention to recognize Palestinian statehood, while Trump suggested Starmer could use the military to halt illegal migration. Both presented a united front in condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with Trump expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin. The meeting highlighted areas of both cooperation and tension in the transatlantic relationship.</p>

          <p>According to a new paper in the journal Nature Food, the severe suffering of chickens bred for rapid growth could be drastically reduced for a very small cost. Researchers calculated that by switching to slower-growing chicken breeds, an hour of what they term "disabling" or "excruciating" pain could be prevented for just half a cent to three cents. This change would address widespread welfare issues like lameness and heart failure, though the poultry industry has raised concerns that it could increase production costs and the environmental footprint of farming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has a complex effect on reverse mortgages, a financial tool often used by retirees to access home equity. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates do not always follow the Fed's lead directly, as they are influenced by a wider range of factors. However, a lower rate environment can be beneficial, as it often increases the principal limit, allowing homeowners to borrow a larger percentage of their home's value. This article advises retirees to carefully compare fixed and adjustable-rate options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have confirmed the first four human cases of West Nile virus for the year, all of which required hospitalization between July and August. The patients, who are now recovering, reside in the Antelope Valley, San Fernando, and central Los Angeles areas. With mosquitoes thriving in the current hot weather, officials are strongly advising residents to take preventative measures, such as using EPA-registered insect repellent and eliminating any sources of standing water around their properties to reduce mosquito breeding grounds.</p>

          <p>The student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, has won decisive victories in student council elections at two of the nation's most prominent public universities. These were the first elections held since a student-led uprising led to the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose government had banned the party. The results are being interpreted as a potential indicator of shifting political sentiment among Bangladesh's large youth population ahead of national elections scheduled for 2026.</p>

          <p>Consumers may face higher prices on Halloween items like costumes, decorations, and candy this year due to U.S. tariffs on goods imported from overseas. Despite this, the National Retail Federation forecasts that spending for the holiday will reach a record $13.1 billion, surpassing the previous year's total. This suggests strong consumer demand for the holiday, with shoppers indicating they will look for discounts and prioritize their spending on what is important to them, even in the face of rising costs.</p>

          <p>Influential hedge fund manager David Tepper has cautioned that while the Federal Reserve has room for a few more interest rate cuts, going too far could push the economy into "danger territory." Speaking on CNBC, Tepper expressed concern that overly aggressive easing could reignite inflation, weaken the dollar, and create asset bubbles in the market. Despite feeling that market valuations are currently high, he stated he is not betting against stocks as long as the Fed remains in a rate-cutting cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

These drastic measures are a direct consequence of the Trump administration's significant reduction in U.S. funding for the international body and its various agencies. The funding shortfall is forcing a major organizational review, known as UN80, to streamline operations and address bureaucratic inefficiencies as the UN grapples with its diminished resources.</p>

The judge ruled that the government's justification for the removal—that it was reuniting the children with their families at the families' request—had "crumbled like a house of cards" under scrutiny, with no evidence to support the claim. The ruling came after an emergency lawsuit was filed by advocates who intervened while the children were already on airplanes in Texas, poised for deportation.</p>
