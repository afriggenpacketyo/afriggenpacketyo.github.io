          <p>U.S.-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander was freed after 584 days in Hamas captivity and reunited with his family in Israel. His parents recounted the emotional moment they received the call about his release, which they attributed to the efforts of the Trump administration, specifically Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff. They described the joyous, yet exhausting, reunion at an Israeli military base, noting Edan's weakened state and the minor injuries he sustained in the tunnels. The family is now focused on supporting the remaining 58 hostages in Gaza, advocating for their release and sharing Edan's experiences to offer hope to other families. The father urged for an end to the war, emphasizing the urgency of bringing all hostages home. </p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 18% in its Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL intends to use the majority of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aiming to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. While facing increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, CATL's focus remains on expanding in Europe and emerging regions, where EV sales penetration is still relatively low.</p>

          <p>Portugal's recent general election, the third in three years, has not provided a clear resolution to the country's political instability, resulting in another minority government for the center-right Democratic Alliance. This outcome leaves the government dependent on opposition parties, while the surge in support for the hard-right populist party Chega adds further uncertainty. The Democratic Alliance won the most seats, but Chega's gains have shaken up the traditional balance of power. The election was triggered by a political storm surrounding potential conflicts of interest involving Prime Minister Luís Montenegro's family law firm.</p>

Injuries to key pitchers like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell have forced the team to rely on rookies and depth arms.

While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range of 2-3%, it also acknowledges economic uncertainties, including global trade tensions.

          <p>Richard Grenell, President Trump's appointee as president of the Kennedy Center, has alleged "criminal" financial mismanagement and deferred maintenance, promising to refer the matter to federal prosecutors. This comes as the center announces its upcoming season, featuring some prominent names in theater and dance, but also notable absences and a shift towards presenting some Broadway shows with nonunion casts. Trump's involvement has divided artists about performing at the center, with some canceling planned runs in protest. The article details the changes and controversies surrounding the Kennedy Center under Trump's leadership.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck deals with both the European Union and the United States, but these agreements required politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's diminished position in the global economy. While the deals offer benefits like reduced tariffs and easier travel, they also highlight the challenges of operating between larger trading blocs. The agreement with the EU generates economic benefits, but Brexit has cost the country a significant portion of its GDP. To secure these deals, Britain had to make trade-offs, such as allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters and granting greater access to American agricultural products.</p>

The company shifted to a Reg S offering, preventing sales to U.S. onshore investors and avoiding certain U.S. regulatory filings.
