          <p>Sun Yun argues that despite the unconventional nature of Trump's second-term foreign policy, it's unlikely to significantly alter the US military presence in the Indo-Pacific.  While Trump aims to enhance US power projection, his actions may inadvertently stabilize the region's complex geopolitical dynamics, which are less about inherent regional factors and more about the perception of China as a threat.</p>
