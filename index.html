The world number one golfer overcame a deficit to leader Robert MacIntyre, finishing the tournament at 15-under par for a two-shot win. This victory marks Scheffler's fifth of the season, a feat only matched by Tiger Woods in the last 40 years for consecutive seasons with at least five wins.

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause. This potential breakthrough, described as "game-changing," emerged from the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska and could offer a path to ending the war. While Ukrainian President Zelenskyy welcomed the development, he noted that crucial details about its implementation remain unclear. The discussions signify a potential shift in Russia's long-standing opposition to external security alliances for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Protesters across Israel conducted a nationwide strike, blocking roads and closing businesses to demand a ceasefire deal with Hamas and the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The demonstrations, organized by hostage families, reflect growing public frustration after 22 months of war and fears that a new military offensive could endanger the approximately 50 hostages still held. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the protests, claiming they benefit Hamas, while far-right cabinet members reiterated their opposition to any deal that leaves Hamas in power. The unrest highlights deep divisions within Israel over the war's direction and strategy.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, was downgraded to a Category 3 storm but is forecast to strengthen again as it moves over the ocean. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 intensity, is not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast but poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents. A tropical storm warning has been issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands and parts of the Bahamas, with heavy rain expected across the region. The storm's development comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its typical peak activity period.</p>

Leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will attend. The move underscores European concerns about being sidelined and aims to prevent a repeat of a contentious previous encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>Scottish golfer Robert MacIntyre voiced his extreme frustration after squandering a four-shot overnight lead to lose the BMW Championship to world number one Scottie Scheffler. MacIntyre struggled in the final round, shooting a three-over-par 73 while Scheffler carded a 67, aided by a spectacular chip-in on the 17th hole. The Oban native admitted he wanted to "smash up my golf clubs" after the loss, citing an inexplicable issue where his shots were traveling much farther than intended. The defeat denied him a third PGA Tour victory and highlighted the pressure of competing against a top-tier opponent.</p>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has sparked significant controversy, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and those with religious ties to the practice. Authorities imposed the ban due to health risks associated with pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding pigeons is a pious act, and from others who view the birds as part of the city's cultural fabric. The conflict reflects a broader challenge in Indian cities of balancing tradition, public health, and ecological concerns amid a booming pigeon population.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new drugs and income from technology licensing deals. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by 40 percent, with the company increasingly shifting its revenue structure from generic drugs to more innovative pharmaceuticals. This strategic move is expected to continue, with generics projected to constitute a much smaller portion of Hengrui's business in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Plastic surgeons and other medical professionals have identified several cosmetic procedures they would avoid due to significant health risks and potential for poor long-term outcomes. Among the most cited are Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), which carry a high risk of fatal blood clots, and rib removal for a smaller waist, which compromises organ protection. Other procedures of concern include buccal fat removal, which can lead to a skeletal appearance with age, and filler-based "liquid rhinoplasties," which pose a risk of blindness.

          <p>The upcoming White House meeting between President Trump, President Zelenskyy, and European allies is fraught with tension as the unity of the Western alliance against Russia appears threatened. Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, Trump has seemingly shifted his stance by abandoning calls for an immediate ceasefire and appearing open to territorial concessions by Ukraine. This has reportedly left Ukrainian officials feeling betrayed and concerned about being pressured into an unfavorable peace deal. The challenge for Zelenskyy and his European partners will be to guide Trump back to a unified position without alienating the U.S. president.</p>

          <p>The birth rate in the United States has reached a historic low, mirroring demographic declines seen in other developed nations like Japan and raising concerns about future economic and social stability. Experts attribute the trend to multiple factors, including women under 30 having fewer children, a societal shift in values regarding family and career, and economic pressures like the high cost of childcare. While proposals for financial incentives like a "baby bonus" are being considered, some analysts argue that policies supporting affordable childcare and economic confidence are more likely to be effective.

Factors contributing to the decline include a punishing work culture, a stagnant economy, and shifting social norms that have led to record-low marriage rates.

          <p>Jing Qian, a vice-president at the Asia Society, provides an analysis of the recent U.S.-China trade talks, framing them as a continuation of principles established at the leader-level Geneva summit. He notes that when negotiators met in May, a shared interest in de-escalation was paramount due to rattled markets and a dim global economic forecast. The discussions featured high-level officials from both nations, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng. The dialogue represents an ongoing effort to manage what Qian describes as a complex but potentially manageable rivalry between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has stated that its members deployed to patrol Washington D.C. as part of a federal crime crackdown "may be armed," a shift from earlier Army statements that they would not carry weapons. This development is part of the Trump administration's plan to increase law enforcement presence in the capital, which has drawn significant criticism from local officials and residents as a federal overreach. While the Guard's role is officially to support civil authorities and deter crime without making arrests, the potential for armed troops on city streets has heightened concerns about the militarization of policing.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke and his political organization, Powered by People, from sending funds to Democratic lawmakers outside of Texas. The ruling is part of a legal challenge by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton against Democrats who left the state to block a GOP-led redistricting session. The judge found that the group's fundraising constituted deceptive trade practices and that financial platforms like ActBlue are restrained from moving the group's funds out of the state. O'Rourke's group stated it had already donated over $1 million to the lawmakers.</p>

          <p>An early goalkeeping error by Altay Bayindir was the deciding factor in Manchester United's 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford. United's manager, Ruben Amorim, chose Bayindir over the recently fit Andre Onana, a decision that came under scrutiny after Bayindir failed to handle a corner, leading to Riccardo Calafiori's goal. Despite an improved attacking performance from United, the team was unable to find an equalizer. The mistake has renewed debate about Manchester United's goalkeeping situation, a position that has been a point of concern for the club.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that 68 people were arrested overnight in Washington, D.C., as part of the ongoing federal law enforcement surge in the nation's capital. The total number of arrests has now surpassed 300 since President Trump federalized the city's police force and deployed the National Guard to combat crime. The operation has resulted in the seizure of illegal firearms and charges against suspects for homicide and drug trafficking. The crackdown continues to draw strong criticism from Democratic officials, who label it a political stunt, while the administration maintains it is necessary to restore safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intense and sudden downpours known as cloudbursts are causing deadly flash floods and landslides in mountainous regions of India and Pakistan. These extreme weather events occur when a massive amount of rain, often over 100 millimeters, falls in a very short time over a small area. The phenomenon is triggered when moisture-laden air is forced upward by mountains, forming dense clouds that eventually release their contents at once. Experts say the frequency of these destructive events is increasing due to climate change, as a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, leading to more erratic and extreme rainfall patterns.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended its plans to resume operations after the union representing its flight attendants announced it would defy a government-ordered return to work and continue its strike. The Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB), at the request of the Canadian government, had ordered the strike to end, but the union is challenging the order as unconstitutional. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) is demanding that flight attendants be paid for time spent on the ground between flights. The ongoing labor dispute has led to the suspension of approximately 700 daily flights, affecting over 100,000 passengers.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers from Texas who fled the state to prevent a Republican-led special session on congressional redistricting are beginning to return. Their departure successfully denied Republicans the necessary quorum to pass a plan that would create more GOP-leaning U.S. House seats. With a new special session now underway, some Democrats are already back in Texas, and the caucus is determining if a quorum will be present on Monday. The move by Texas Democrats prompted California's governor to announce a reactive redistricting plan of his own, escalating the partisan battle over electoral maps.</p>
