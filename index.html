          <p>AI-focused cloud provider CoreWeave has agreed to acquire data center infrastructure company Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9 billion.

          <p>Financial experts advise homeowners with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) to take proactive steps before the Federal Reserve's expected rate cut in September. Recommendations include checking and improving one's credit score to qualify for better rates and shopping around for different lenders beyond their current mortgage provider. The article also stresses the importance of calculating potential repayment costs under various interest rate scenarios, as HELOCs have variable rates and use the home as collateral.

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced its most significant first-half decline in 52 years, falling 10.7% against global currencies, and faces ongoing headwinds. Factors such as policy volatility, increasing national debt, and potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are contributing to investor concerns and a shift towards safe-haven assets like gold. While a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exports, analysts are divided on its future, with some predicting further decline while others believe fears of its diminishing global role are overstated.

          <p>According to the CDC, emergency room visits for tick bites across the United States are nearing record levels, with July already seeing the highest numbers since 2017. The Northeast is the most affected region, and young children and the elderly are the most vulnerable populations. Health officials attribute the spike to climate change, which leads to milder winters and greater tick survival, increasing the risk of diseases like Lyme disease. The CDC advises the public to use EPA-registered insect repellents and take precautions in wooded areas.</p>

Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan will face 25% tariffs, while South Africa will be subject to 30%, and Laos and Myanmar will face 40% duties. The move, which preempts the expiration of a 90-day tariff pause, caused U.S. financial markets to decline.

          <p>A new tax and spending package, touted as eliminating federal income taxes on Social Security, does not entirely remove the tax but offers significant relief through a new temporary deduction. The legislation introduces a "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes under $75,000, which can lower their overall taxable income. However, policy experts note this primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas were caused by an extreme weather event that saw some areas receive upwards of 20 inches of rain over the holiday weekend. This deluge, fueled by moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The region's geography, known as "flash flood alley," is naturally prone to rapid runoff, which exacerbated the situation. Forecasters warn that additional rainfall is possible, maintaining a high risk of further flooding in the devastated areas.</p>

Named Eotephradactylus mcintireae, it is now considered the earliest known pterosaur in North America. The seagull-sized creature lived during the late Triassic period on the supercontinent of Pangaea, and analysis of its teeth suggests it fed on hard-shelled prey like armored fish. The fossil was found in a rich deposit that offers a snapshot of an ecosystem in transition just before a major extinction event.</p>

          <p>A federal judge forcefully denied the Justice Department's motions to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was erroneously deported to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis labeled one of the government's arguments as "meritless" and expressed deep skepticism about the DOJ's conduct. She questioned the timing of a separate federal indictment against Abrego Garcia in Tennessee, which was secured while the DOJ was simultaneously claiming it had no power to bring him back to the U.S. The judge has ordered further testimony to clarify the government's plans for him.</p>

          <p>Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki in Indonesia erupted twice on Monday, spewing volcanic ash and hot gas clouds up to 11 miles into the sky. The powerful eruptions from the volcano, which is on its highest alert level, blanketed nearby villages in debris and prompted the cancellation of dozens of flights in the region, including to Australia and Singapore. Authorities have established a 4.3-mile exclusion zone around the crater and warned residents of potential lava flows from heavy rain. No casualties were immediately reported from the significant volcanic event.</p>

          <p>French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping violation after successfully arguing she was contaminated with a banned substance by kissing her partner. Thibus tested positive for ostarine, but a tribunal found she bore no fault after she claimed the substance was passed through bodily fluids from her partner, former U.S. Olympian Race Imboden. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) upheld the ruling, finding it scientifically plausible that contamination occurred through kissing. The verdict allows Thibus to continue competing internationally.</p>

          <p>An exhaustive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a "client list" or of Jeffrey Epstein blackmailing prominent associates. The two-page memo, released to provide transparency, also reaffirmed that Epstein's 2019 death in a federal facility was a suicide, a finding supported by video evidence showing no one entered his cell area. This conclusion directly contradicts earlier public statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi about a list. The review confirmed Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims but found no evidence to predicate new investigations.</p>

This move follows President Trump's recent decision to end U.S. sanctions on Syria to support its "path to stability." The delisting is part of a broader Western effort to reset relations with Syria's new leadership, despite concerns over its radical past.</p>
