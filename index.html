          <p>Archaeologists in Warsaw have unearthed significant remnants of Villa Regia, a magnificent 17th-century Polish royal palace, from the Vistula River. The palace was looted and destroyed during the Swedish Deluge, a devastating mid-1600s invasion where a vessel carrying stolen valuables sank as Swedish troops attempted to flee. The recovered artifacts, including large architectural elements and a previously unknown pillar capital, are considered invaluable for reconstructing the historic residence. These findings will help the Museum of Polish History tell the story of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's former power and its subsequent crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour party is in the process of selecting a new deputy leader, a contest primarily between Bridget Phillipson and Lucy Powell. While both are straight-talking politicians from the north of England, their approaches differ significantly; Phillipson is a current cabinet member, while Powell was recently sacked. Powell is campaigning as a voice that will offer a "course correction" from outside the inner circle, while Phillipson argues for influencing policy from within to avoid destabilizing the government. The election is seen as a verdict on Keir Starmer's leadership, with Powell currently viewed as the favorite.</p>

A'ja Wilson was named Finals MVP, delivering a powerful performance with 31 points and nine rebounds in the final game. The Aces demonstrated offensive dominance throughout the series, with five players scoring in double figures in the clinching match. Despite a late rally attempt by the Mercury, the Aces maintained control to solidify their status as a modern dynasty in the league.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of a ceasefire agreement, Hamas is pushing for Israel to release high-profile Palestinian prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. Israel's justice ministry published a list of 250 prisoners to be freed but excluded these key figures, who are seen by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance. The disagreement over their inclusion could potentially complicate the timeline for the deal, which involves the release of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza.

          <p>Despite persistent global hunger, true famines have become far less common due to significant agricultural advancements over the last century. The world is projected to produce a record amount of grain this year, continuing a long-term trend of increasing food availability per person and crop yields per acre. This progress is attributed to the Green Revolution, the development of synthetic fertilizers, expanded irrigation, and improved global trade logistics. However, challenges remain, as modern famines are now primarily caused by political failures, conflict, and climate change rather than crop failure.</p>

The report suggests that an advanced EW system was used to simulate the radar signals of a large vessel, such as an aircraft carrier, from up to 300 kilometers away. This tactic likely misled the reconnaissance aircraft into tracking a non-existent target or traveling toward an incorrect location. The disclosure offers a rare glimpse into the capabilities and combat operations of China's increasingly sophisticated electronic warfare units.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel argues that building and maintaining wealth is a two-part equation: what you have minus what you want. He emphasizes that spending decisions are highly personal and should be aligned with internal values rather than external benchmarks like social status or impressing others. Housel advises that true contentment comes from controlling one's desires and focusing on long-term compounding rather than chasing quick riches, a mindset often fueled by a fear of missing out. He suggests people ask themselves how they would live if no one was watching to better understand their genuine values.</p>

          <p>This opinion article raises critical questions about the Trump administration's plan for the forced sale of TikTok's U.S. operations, suggesting the deal could enrich a select group of political allies. The author points to the reportedly low valuation of the company, the opaque process for selecting buyers, and the potential for the administration to influence content on the powerful media platform. Concerns are also raised about whether the deal genuinely improves the security of American user data or meaningfully severs control from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The piece calls for greater transparency and oversight of the unfolding arrangement.</p>

          <p>The new play "littleboy/littleman," by Rudi Goblen, presents the story of two immigrant brothers from Nicaragua with a unique, performance-art style infused with live music and hip-hop poetry. The drama centers on the conflict between the older, pragmatic Bastian and his younger, dreamer brother Fito, as they navigate life and identity in Sweetwater, Florida. Staged immersively at the Geffen Playhouse, the production breaks the fourth wall, creating a direct connection with the audience. The review praises the dynamic acting and emotionally truthful portrayal of the brothers' bond, even as it notes that the freestyle, jazz-like structure doesn't always smoothly integrate every element.</p>

          <p>A new battle is brewing between Hollywood and Silicon Valley after OpenAI launched Sora 2, an AI tool that can create videos featuring the likenesses of real people in generated environments. Hollywood studios, talent agencies, and unions like SAG-AFTRA have swiftly condemned the technology, arguing it violates well-established copyright and personality rights. The core of the dispute is OpenAI's initial 'opt-out' model, which creators argue unlawfully places the burden on them to prevent infringement. The clash signals a major legal and ethical fight over control, consent, and compensation for intellectual property in the age of generative AI.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat rampant shoplifting, the city of Long Beach, California, has enacted a first-of-its-kind ordinance requiring large food and pharmacy retailers to increase staffing at self-checkout areas. The law mandates at least one employee for every three self-checkout stations and limits customers to 15 items. The measure, supported by grocery worker unions for safety, has been criticized by retail associations who warn it will lead to longer lines and higher prices. In response, some major chains like Albertsons and Vons have closed their self-checkout lanes entirely, sparking a debate over the best approach to retail theft.</p>

          <p>Nine months after the devastating Palisades fire, residents are expressing growing frustration and anger toward Los Angeles city officials over what they perceive as a slow and bureaucratic recovery process. At a community meeting about rebuilding the local recreation center, residents voiced distrust in the city's ability to manage projects, contrasting it with the speed of privately funded efforts. The delayed installation of a temporary library has become a symbol of this inefficiency, fueling a sense of abandonment in the affluent, fire-ravaged neighborhood. The recent arrest of an arson suspect has only intensified feelings that the tragedy was preventable.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors allege that Jonathan Rinderknecht, the 29-year-old man accused of starting the deadly Palisades fire, recently threatened to burn down his family's home in Florida during an argument.

Authorities claim he maliciously set a brush fire on January 1 that later flared up amid extreme winds.

          <p>An after-action report from the Los Angeles Fire Department reveals that crews battling the destructive Palisades fire in January faced significant delays in getting water tanker trucks to the scene. As some fire hydrants ran dry in high-elevation areas and a key reservoir was empty for repairs, a slow process for requesting tankers and a lack of available escort vehicles hampered the response. The report suggests the LAFD should have anticipated water supply issues based on wind forecasts and pre-positioned resources accordingly. It also highlighted the effective use of backyard pools as an alternative water source.</p>

The strikes targeted a location selling heavy machinery, which the Israeli military claimed was being used to rebuild infrastructure for Hezbollah. This attack is part of a pattern of near-daily Israeli airstrikes in the region since the end of the 14-month Israel-Hezbollah war, which concluded with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November. Israel maintains that these actions are necessary to prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding its military capabilities following the conflict.</p>

          <p>To combat the ecological damage caused by invasive black carp in Louisiana, officials and advocates are promoting a novel solution: eating them. The voracious, mollusk-eating fish disrupts the native food web and reproduces rapidly, making it a significant threat. French chef Philippe Parola is leading an effort to convince Americans to add the nutritious, protein-rich fish to their diets, despite challenges like its free-floating bones and low market price for fishers. This culinary approach is part of a two-pronged strategy that also includes developing AI-powered software to detect and monitor the invasive species more effectively.</p>

          <p>The extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies has become a major sticking point in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown negotiations. These subsidies, which lower insurance premiums for millions of Americans, were expanded during the pandemic and are set to expire at the end of the year. Democrats insist on extending them before funding the government, warning of dramatic premium hikes for families as open enrollment begins November 1. Republicans argue the issue can be addressed later and are pushing for a clean funding bill, creating a stalemate that is preventing a resolution to the shutdown.</p>

The strikes, which killed two people, are seen as part of Russia's recurring strategy to cripple the nation's power grid ahead of winter to undermine public morale.

The incident is one of several where individuals have lost their jobs following online naming-and-shaming campaigns related to Kirk's killing.
