        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a four-day strike, NJ Transit engineers approved a new deal, bringing relief to commuters who rely on the system to reach New York City and Philadelphia. While the strike is over, train service will not resume until Tuesday to allow for safety checks and equipment repositioning. NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri noted the deal is fair and fiscally responsible, reflecting concessions made through a work rule agreement. During the strike, commuters faced crowded buses and PATH trains, with NJ Transit cross-honoring rail tickets on bus and light rail lines. The union argued for higher pay due to the rising cost of living, and the last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983. </p>

          <p>Two security consultants, one of whom recently contracted with the U.S. State Department, were killed in an apparent cartel ambush at a restaurant in Guadalajara, Mexico. CÃ©sar Guzman and Carlos Amador, along with a third instructor, Pablo Cajigal, were targeted after completing a security and intelligence training course for Jalisco state police. Arturo Fontes, a retired FBI agent who worked with Guzman, mourned the loss of his brave colleagues who taught counter-drug classes to Mexican police officers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in England, Wales, and Scotland are expected to decrease in July, marking the first drop in Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that annual energy bills will fall by Â£129 for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. This translates to a typical annual bill of Â£1,720, down from the current Â£1,849. Dr. Craig Lowrey of Cornwall Insight acknowledges that while this is a positive step, prices remain significantly higher than historical levels, potentially leaving many households struggling with affordability. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>America's ongoing child care crisis has intensified a long-standing debate about what constitutes "quality" care, with varying perspectives from parents, providers, and policymakers. Progressives advocate for credentialed teachers and academic standards, while conservatives emphasize nurturing care provided by parents and community caregivers. States are implementing Quality Rating and Improvement Systems (QRIS) to measure and communicate aspects of child care quality, but evidence is mixed on whether these ratings predict better outcomes for children. Experts emphasize the importance of caregiver-child interactions, cultural sensitivity, and family perspectives in defining and assessing quality. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, with metastasis to the bone. The diagnosis follows the discovery of a nodule during a routine physical exam, prompting further evaluation. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S. A Gleason score of 9 indicates that the cancer cells look very different from normal prostate cells and are likely to grow and spread rapidly. Possible treatment options include hormone therapy to slow disease progression and manage symptoms. </p>

          <p>Republicans are implementing policies aimed at reducing childcare funding and pushing women out of the workforce, undoing gains in women's rights. The White House considered eliminating funding for Head Start, a crucial childcare source for low-income families. Conservatives advocate for women to return to traditional domestic roles, influenced by right-wing think tanks. This approach is criticized for perpetuating sexist notions and hindering women's access to education and well-paid employment. The Trump administration's policies are seen as an effort to force women into pregnancy, unemployment, and dependence on men. </p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is poised to revolutionize call centers used by doctors' offices, potentially displacing workers who handle tasks like scheduling appointments and refilling prescriptions. Startups are marketing AI products with lifelike voices to automate patient interactions, raising concerns about job security for call center employees, particularly in countries like the Philippines. While AI may streamline certain processes, questions remain about its ability to replicate the human touch and nuanced understanding provided by human agents. Some argue that AI will complement humans, but others suggest it could lead to workforce reductions. </p>

          <p>The U.S.'s historical failure to protect Jewish refugees during the Holocaust is mirrored in President Trump's plan to send migrants to Libya and Rwanda, countries known for human rights abuses. This proposal violates the 1951 Refugee Convention, which prohibits returning refugees to countries where their lives are threatened. Libya is notorious for migrant abuse, while Rwanda's human rights record raises concerns, leading courts in Israel and the U.K. to rule similar agreements unlawful. The plan is seen as undermining international norms of refugee protection, necessitating vocal opposition to uphold the rights of those fleeing persecution. </p>
