        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Germany's manufacturing index shows slight improvement, the European Union remains concerned about its industrial competitiveness against China. As Brussels and Beijing explore warmer diplomatic ties, the EU's primary goal is to safeguard its manufacturing sector, a cornerstone of its economy valued at over $2.7 trillion. Analysts suggest that Europe's strategy to rebuild its industrial base means it cannot accommodate a large influx of inexpensive Chinese imports. This underlying economic tension is a key factor shaping the future of China-EU relations, balancing cooperation with protectionist measures.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Condemn Passage of Trump's Budget and Tax Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 04:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Democratic leaders have strongly condemned the passage of Donald Trump's major budget bill, describing it as a "dark day for our country." Critics argue the legislation prioritizes billionaires and corporations through permanent tax cuts while harming working-class Americans with cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, and ACA subsidies. Party members are framing the bill as a key issue for the upcoming midterm elections, highlighting its potential to increase the national debt and remove millions from healthcare coverage. The unified Democratic opposition signals a major political battle over the bill's far-reaching consequences.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Trump's Unpopular Budget Bill Passed Due to Republican Capitulation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the passage of Donald Trump's budget reconciliation bill highlights a perversity in American politics, where a widely disliked and devastating measure becomes law. The author contends that despite concerns over its massive cost and deep cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, Republican lawmakers ultimately capitulated to Trump's demands. The piece describes the bill as a transfer of wealth from the sick, poor, and elderly to billionaires and immigration enforcement. It concludes by questioning whether the Republican party will face electoral consequences for supporting legislation that harms their own constituents.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has taken an unidentified North Korean man into custody after he crossed the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The individual was detected and safely guided out of the mine-strewn border area by South Korean troops on Thursday night. Authorities are now investigating the man's motives for crossing, including whether it was a defection attempt. The incident occurs amidst heightened border tensions, which have recently included North Korea sending trash-filled balloons and the South broadcasting propaganda. No unusual North Korean military activity was detected following the border crossing.</p>

          <p>The Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has barred U.S. trading firm Jane Street Group from its securities market, accusing it of extensive market manipulation. The regulator also froze over $566 million in alleged illegal gains, stating the firm used strategies to artificially influence India's Nifty 50 index for profit. SEBI alleges Jane Street made large stock purchases to drive up prices before betting on a decline, then sold off its positions to profit from options trades. The move is part of a broader effort by the regulator to protect retail investors and market integrity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and subsequent fire at a fireworks warehouse in Yolo County, California, have left seven people unaccounted for. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics in the community of Esparto triggered multiple grass fires and prompted mandatory evacuations within a one-mile radius. Two people were confirmed injured, but authorities have not been able to enter the property due to the danger of unexploded materials. Family members have identified some of the missing, including three relatives who were working at the facility. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has been called to assist in the investigation.</p>

Raducanu acknowledges the significant gap between her current ranking and the tour's top players, stating she needs to improve her serve and add more weapons to her game. Sabalenka has been a dominant force, reaching at least the quarterfinals in her last ten Grand Slams with a powerful, first-strike style of play.

          <p>Six months after it began, a strike by bin workers in Birmingham continues, leaving residents to contend with apocalyptic piles of rotting rubbish. The industrial action started in January over council plans to downgrade roles and has since escalated, with recycling and green waste collections also suspended. Residents and students express frustration over the uncollected waste, with some storing recycling inside their homes out of principle. Birmingham City Council, which has the lowest recycling rate of any major authority besides Liverpool, says it remains committed to resolving the dispute with the Unite union.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a major legislative victory, is set to finance many of his key campaign promises through a mix of spending increases and tax cuts. The bill allocates massive funding boosts to immigration control and defense, including the border wall and missile defense systems, while also incentivizing fossil fuel exploration. It enacts $4.5 trillion in tax cuts but also makes significant changes to social programs, with new eligibility rules projected to cause millions to lose Medicaid and SNAP food aid. Critics are concerned about the bill adding over $3 trillion to the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oregon jury has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault and unlawful sexual penetration. The conviction stems from an incident at a 2021 lake house party where McLemore, then a Portland Trail Blazers player, sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman. Prosecutors argued the woman was incapacitated from alcohol and unable to consent, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual. The district attorney emphasized that celebrity status does not grant immunity from prosecution in Clackamas County. McLemore's sentencing is scheduled for the following week.</p>

Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban has sought international recognition despite widespread condemnation of its human rights record, particularly its severe restrictions on women.
