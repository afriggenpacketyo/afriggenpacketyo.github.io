          <h2>Proposed Social Security Bill Unlikely to Eliminate Federal Taxes for Most Beneficiaries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 08:12:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new legislative proposal, described by proponents as a major tax relief bill, is being scrutinized by tax experts who dispute its claims. The bill introduces an additional $6,000 deduction for seniors but does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for the vast majority, contrary to some official messaging. Experts from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center clarify that the changes will primarily benefit middle-income seniors by reducing their taxable income, rather than providing a direct bonus or eliminating taxes entirely. Furthermore, critics argue the legislation could weaken Social Security's long-term funding by reducing its tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is confronting a motion of censure initiated by far-right parliamentarians, though it poses little real threat to her position. The motion, which cites transparency concerns over COVID-19 vaccine contracts, is unlikely to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to pass. However, the debate has provided an opportunity for centrist and left-leaning groups to voice their own grievances, particularly regarding von der Leyen's perceived cooperation with the far-right and backsliding on climate goals. Von der Leyen defended her record and called for unity among pro-European political forces in the parliament.</p>

          <h2>Civilian Volunteers Face Discouragement from Officials at Texas Flood Search Sites</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 08:10:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country, dozens of civilian volunteers are continuing search efforts despite being asked by authorities to stay away. Officials in Kerr County have discouraged unorganized volunteers, citing safety concerns and the need for a coordinated, professional response across the vast search area. They fear that without proper structure, these well-intentioned citizens could become victims themselves, diverting critical resources from the official search and rescue mission. Nevertheless, volunteers, driven by a sense of community duty, have persisted, moving to different locations to assist in finding the missing.</p>

          <p>French Olympic fencer Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of a doping violation after a sports tribunal accepted her novel defense. Thibus tested positive for the anabolic substance ostarine but argued she was contaminated through kissing her partner, American fencer Race Imboden, who was unknowingly using a product containing the substance. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) determined it was scientifically plausible for the substance to be transmitted via saliva over a nine-day period. The ruling overturns a potential four-year ban from the World Anti-Doping Agency, allowing Thibus to continue her career.</p>

          <p>Milan Bergamo Airport in Italy experienced a nearly two-hour shutdown after a man was killed by being ingested into the engine of a taxiing aircraft. The incident involved a Volotea Airbus A319 preparing for departure to Spain.

This marks a significant shift in German fiscal policy, financed by substantial new debt, after the previous government collapsed over budgetary disputes. The plan aims to address dilapidated roads, bridges, and public services while also meeting NATO's defense spending targets, with the defense budget set to more than double by 2029.

Crucially, the inquiry found that senior figures at both the Post Office and the software provider Fujitsu knew their systems were capable of error but maintained the fiction of their infallibility.

The 1954 Johnson Amendment prohibits all tax-exempt organizations from endorsing or opposing political candidates.

          <p>Fast fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong as it faces continued regulatory hurdles with its planned London listing. According to the Financial Times, the move is intended to pressure UK regulators who have not yet approved the company's prospectus. The delay is reportedly due to disagreements between UK and Chinese regulators over the language concerning Shein's supply chain risks, particularly regarding allegations of forced labor in China's Xinjiang region. The dual-track approach highlights Shein's determination to go public despite significant scrutiny over its business practices and supply chain.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in Texas Hill Country has resulted in at least 104 deaths, with dozens of people still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and counselors died. President Trump has issued a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, as state and federal authorities continue extensive search and rescue operations. Officials note the full number of missing persons is likely unknown due to the many campers and RV residents in the area.</p>

          <p>The Philippine government has summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest a travel ban imposed on Francis Tolentino, a prominent senator and ally of President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr. Beijing barred Tolentino from entering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, citing his "egregious conduct on China-related issues." The Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs conveyed that while China has the prerogative to impose sanctions, targeting an elected official for their official acts is inconsistent with mutual respect between sovereign states. The Chinese embassy responded that some Filipino politicians have engaged in "malicious words and deeds" for selfish interests.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets declined on Monday following President Trump's announcement of a new round of tariffs targeting more than a dozen countries, set to take effect August 1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 400 points as investors reacted to the renewed trade uncertainty. The move to impose duties on nations including Japan, South Korea, and South Africa comes as a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs was set to expire. Analysts caution that while markets had been climbing, the escalating trade conflicts and reliance on tariff revenue could pose a significant risk to financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Dutch fishing village of Urk, a new foundation is using modern technology to bring closure to families of fishermen lost at sea decades ago. The group, Identiteit Gezocht (Identity Sought), uses artificial intelligence to search historical press articles and databases, then cross-references weather and current data to predict where bodies may have washed ashore. By combining this research with advanced DNA matching, they aim to identify remains buried in unnamed graves along the North Sea coasts of Germany and Denmark. The effort has already successfully identified one fisherman who had been missing for 47 years.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is now defending the Trump administration's conclusion that no definitive "Epstein client list" exists, a position that contrasts sharply with his own past statements. In 2021 and as recently as October 2024, Vance publicly called for the release of such a list and criticized the government for keeping it secret, echoing conspiracy theories popular in right-wing circles. This reversal highlights the administration's difficulty in controlling the narrative around Jeffrey Epstein, a narrative it partly helped to create. The White House is now battling speculation fueled by its own officials, including Vance himself.</p>

          <p>Mark Zaid, a prominent national security lawyer who represented the Ukraine whistleblower, is suing the Trump administration after his security clearance was revoked in a presidential memo. Zaid was named alongside high-profile political figures like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton in an order that deemed their access to classified information was "no longer in the national interest." Zaid argues the move is unconstitutional political retribution that violates his and his clients' rights and impedes his ability to work on sensitive cases. The lawsuit represents a direct challenge to what critics describe as the administration's growing revenge agenda against its perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, the Republican response has largely consisted of praising President Trump's disaster declaration while avoiding questions about his administration's policies. Democrats have called for an investigation into whether staffing cuts at the National Weather Service, driven by Trump's efficiency initiatives, impacted forecasting and warning systems. However, prominent Republicans like Governor Greg Abbott and Senator Ted Cruz have deflected such inquiries, insisting it is not a time for politics. Critics argue this response prioritizes fealty to Trump over addressing potential systemic failures that may have contributed to the tragedy.</p>

The match is set against a backdrop of bitter legal disputes, with Mbappé recently withdrawing a claim of extortion against PSG but still demanding €55 million in unpaid wages, while PSG has a counterclaim for €98 million. Mbappé's departure from Paris was acrimonious, and his first season at Madrid was trophyless while PSG won the Champions League. The on-field clash is being framed as a story of revenge, money, and power.</p>

          <p>The case of Adriana Smith, a Georgia woman who was kept on life support for four months after being declared brain dead so the fetus she was carrying could gestate, illustrates the grim reality of abortion bans. Though legally dead, hospital administrators, citing the state's restrictive laws, used machines to animate her corpse against her family's grief. This article argues that such laws reduce women to mere instruments of the state, disregarding their personhood and dignity in life and death. The incident is presented as a horrifying example of how anti-abortion policies can lead to the desecration of women's bodies.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Air Force General Dan "Razin" Caine, President Trump's unconventional choice for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who was promoted over dozens of more senior officers. The piece explores Caine's background as a quiet, apolitical, and highly skilled F-16 pilot who has contradicted the president on key issues like immigration and Russia's ambitions. Despite Trump's branding of him as a MAGA-hat-wearing loyalist, Caine is known as a humble professional. The analysis delves into the potential for friction as this deferential but independent general provides advice to a president who demands absolute loyalty and dislikes complexity.</p>

Research on housing affordability reveals that Sunbelt cities have adopted restrictive building policies similar to coastal areas, driving up prices.

Kennedy Jr. over his recent changes to federal COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.

Specifically, the complaint claims he failed to consult a federal expert panel before contradicting evidence that supports vaccinating children and pregnant women. The lawsuit aims to restore the original recommendations and highlights a major conflict between the medical establishment and the current administration's health policies.</p>
