          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million verdict in the defamation case brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. The Second Circuit court panel affirmed that the damages were fair and reasonable, and dismissed Trump's claims of presidential immunity. The ruling prevents Trump from relitigating the truthfulness of Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, as a previous jury had already found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. This decision marks another significant legal defeat for the former president in his long-running battle with Carroll.</p>

          <p>A recent survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low. The probability of securing new employment after a job loss dropped to 44.9% in August, the lowest figure since the survey began in 2013. This data reflects a significant shift from the "Great Resignation" era, as a cooling labor market with slower hiring rates has led workers to cling to their current positions. The report coincides with other concerning economic indicators, including a rise in unemployment expectations and a weak August jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The trial for Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to kill Donald Trump at his golf course, began with a challenging jury selection process. Routh, who is representing himself, had most of his proposed jury questions dismissed by Judge Aileen Cannon for being politically charged and irrelevant. Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for months, acquiring a military-grade rifle and researching Trump's movements. The trial is expected to last a month, with the prosecution planning to use Routh's own writings and extensive forensic evidence to prove he took substantial steps to carry out the assassination attempt.</p>

The diagnosis required surgeons to remove most of his tongue, reconstructing it with tissue from his thigh, which forced him to relearn how to speak and sing. After a year of clear screenings, Blevins has not only returned to performing but has also co-founded a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project" with his wife. The organization aims to provide financial aid and support to other families who are navigating the challenges of a cancer diagnosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in Southern California, temporarily freezing a lower court's order. The initial injunction had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion of unlawful presence. The administration argued the restrictions hindered their ability to enforce immigration laws as part of a mass deportation campaign. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, expressing concern that the ruling enables the government to potentially seize individuals based on their appearance or perceived background.</p>

          <p>Amid rising credit card debt and high interest rates, many Americans are exploring debt relief strategies to manage their financial burdens. This article provides an overview of common methods, including debt consolidation, which combines multiple debts into a single loan, and credit counseling, which offers structured debt management plans. More aggressive options like debt settlement, where a reduced payoff amount is negotiated, and bankruptcy are also discussed. The article advises that debt relief is most suitable for those whose debts are growing faster than their payments or who face income disruptions, while cautioning consumers to understand the long-term credit implications.

          <p>Twenty-five years ago, Turkish-born florist Enver Simsek was murdered in Nuremberg, becoming the first of ten victims of the neo-Nazi terror group known as the National Socialist Underground (NSU). For over a decade, his family endured the humiliation of being the primary suspects in the investigation, while the NSU continued its racially motivated killing spree across Germany undetected. The group was only uncovered in 2011, revealing a significant failure by German law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Simsek's daughter, Semiya, continues to speak out about the family's pain and the many unanswered questions surrounding the terror cell's accomplices and motives.</p>

          <p>China's export growth decelerated in August, increasing by 4.4% compared to the previous year, a significant drop from July's 7.2% jump. This marks the slowest pace of export growth since the beginning of the year, signaling potential headwinds for the world's second-largest economy. The slowdown is partly reflected in trade with the U.S., where Chinese exports fell by 33% amid ongoing tariff disputes. Despite the overall slowdown, China maintained a substantial trade surplus, a point of contention with its major trading partners, including the U.S. and the European Union, due to concerns over job losses in manufacturing sectors.

Slaughter sued after being fired in March, arguing her removal violated the Federal Trade Commission Act, which specifies limited reasons for a commissioner's dismissal.

This article outlines several relief options for federal student loan borrowers, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly payments to as little as zero based on current income. Other options include applying for an Unemployment Deferment or an Economic Hardship Deferment, which can temporarily pause payments.

          <p>This article details the primary factors that lenders consider when determining the terms of a personal loan offer, which many consumers use to consolidate high-interest debt. A strong credit score and a clean credit history are paramount, as they typically unlock lower interest rates. Lenders also closely evaluate a borrower's debt-to-income (DTI) ratio to assess their ability to manage new payments. Additionally, the desired loan amount, the length of the repayment term, and the stability of the applicant's employment and income play significant roles in shaping the final offer. Comparing offers from different types of lenders is recommended to secure the best possible terms.</p>

          <p>A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that Chagas disease, a potentially fatal condition transmitted by "kissing bugs," may be becoming endemic in the United States. While historically prevalent in the Americas, locally acquired human cases have now been reported in eight states, with the insect vector found in 32 states. The disease is caused by a parasite passed through the feces of the infected insect, often entering the body through a bite wound. Without treatment, the infection can lead to serious, life-threatening cardiac and digestive problems years after the initial exposure, prompting calls for increased awareness and prevention.</p>
