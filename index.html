          <p>The Colorado Rockies secured a remarkable 17-16 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates after trailing by nine runs in the first inning. Despite being down 9-0 early and later 15-6, the Rockies mounted a persistent comeback, culminating in a walk-off two-run homer by Brenton Doyle in the bottom of the ninth. This game marked a historic moment in baseball, as it was the first time a team won after allowing nine or more runs in the first inning since 2006. The dramatic win at Coors Field left players and fans in disbelief over the team's resilience.</p>

Although the leak has been located and repairs have begun, the advisory remains in effect for the area from Jameson Beach to the Valhalla Boathouse as a precaution. This incident follows a similar, larger sewage spill on the lake's northern shore last year, which resulted in a significant fine.

          <p>An investigation by Gothamist has uncovered that over 50 signatures on New York City Mayor Eric Adams's petition for his independent re-election bid are fraudulent, including some from deceased individuals. While the Adams campaign submitted nearly 50,000 signatures, far exceeding the 7,500 required, the findings raise questions about the integrity of the signature-gathering process. The campaign stated it expects its contractors to follow the law and will conduct its own review. This development adds another layer of complexity to the mayoral race, which includes several independent and party-nominated candidates.</p>

          <p>U.S. financial markets experienced a turbulent week, ending with a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after hitting a record high on Monday. The volatility was fueled by a confluence of major events, including a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new positions and significant downward revisions for previous months. This report led President Trump to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and intensified market speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. New tariff announcements and major tech company earnings reports from giants like Amazon and Apple further contributed to investor uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine's military has announced successful attacks on key infrastructure targets deep inside Russia, including a major oil refinery in Ryazan and an oil storage facility in the Voronezh region. Additionally, Ukrainian drones reportedly struck a military airfield used for launching drones and an electronics factory that supplies Russia's military. In a separate development, a fire near the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Moscow blamed on Ukrainian shelling, has been extinguished. Meanwhile, reports indicate India plans to continue purchasing Russian oil despite threats of penalties from the United States.</p>

          <p>A recent panel discussion on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" explored the complex dynamics of the relationship between the U.S. and Israel, particularly focusing on President Trump's recent break with Prime Minister Netanyahu over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Panelists analyzed the leverage the Trump administration believes it has, while also noting that Netanyahu's own domestic political pressures limit the extent of U.S. influence. The conversation highlighted the intricate interplay of international diplomacy and internal politics for both leaders. The discussion also touched upon other recent events, including the firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner.</p>

Statistics from the CDC show Black children are significantly more likely to drown in pools than their white peers, a crisis linked to decades of exclusion from public aquatic spaces.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a state policy that removed climate change from official consideration, Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which find solar to be a cheaper alternative to natural gas, rather than by environmental mandates. Streamlined state regulations for smaller projects and consumer demand for energy resilience, as demonstrated by solar-powered towns like Babcock Ranch during hurricanes, have also fueled the boom. However, future growth faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and emerging grid constraints.</p>

The Australian Wallabies showed significant improvement throughout the series after a slow start, which some analysts attribute to a lack of preparation before the first Test.

          <p>A newsletter from The Atlantic highlights the vital role of mail carriers, drawing from a review of a new memoir by a former rural mail carrier in Virginia. The piece reflects on how postal workers provide a sense of order and predictability, particularly during national crises when reliance on federal services becomes most apparent. The collection of articles explores the quiet heroism of daily mail delivery, from the logistical feats required to reach America's most remote communities to the sense of normalcy couriers restore after natural disasters. The theme underscores the profound impact of this consistent, daily service on the fabric of the country.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump commented on the possibility of pardoning music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was convicted in July on two prostitution-related charges. Trump described Combs as "sort of half-innocent" but noted that a pardon would be "more difficult" due to Combs's past hostile statements about him during his political campaigns. The president acknowledged that while judgment shouldn't be clouded, it is hard to ignore such criticism, suggesting it complicates his decision-making process. Combs is currently awaiting sentencing for his convictions.</p>

          <p>After being laid off from his corporate job in New York City, 29-year-old Doug Barnard pursued his passion for travel, eventually settling in Istanbul, Turkey. He founded a boutique tourism company that offers small-group immersion tours to less-traveled destinations like Iraq and Syria, leveraging his popular YouTube travel channel to attract clients. Last year, his tourism business and YouTube channel generated over $164,000 in combined revenue, allowing him to build a new life abroad.

          <p>A new analysis from RentCafe highlights the vast difference in how much apartment space a renter can get for $1,500 per month across the United States. In Manhattan, that budget affords an average of only 216 square feet, while in Wichita, Kansas, the same amount can secure a spacious 1,329 square feet. The least affordable markets are predominantly large coastal cities like Boston and San Francisco, where high demand and limited housing supply drive up costs. Conversely, cities in the Midwest and South offer significantly more space for the money, providing renters with more affordable living options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review in The Atlantic examines Marc Maron's latest HBO Max comedy special, "Panicked," describing it as the culmination of a decade-long trilogy of work that blends personal anxieties with commentary on catastrophic current events. The special sees Maron at his most controlled, using his signature cantankerous and ruminative style to explore topics from his cat's health to his father's dementia and his own childhood trauma. The reviewer notes that while Maron's temperament has softened over the years, his creative voice remains consistent, using comedy not just for entertainment but as a vehicle for self-reflection.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has found Tesla partially responsible for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology, ordering the company to pay more than $240 million in damages. The case involved a driver who, while distracted, crashed at high speed, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. Plaintiffs successfully argued that Tesla's technology failed and that the company's marketing of "Autopilot" was misleading, contributing to the driver's over-reliance on the system. The verdict is a significant legal setback for Tesla, which has often settled similar cases out of court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of over €3,200 per month, creating a severe financial burden for many elderly citizens whose average monthly pension is only around €1,100. This dramatic increase is attributed to rising wages for care staff and a higher number of staff required in facilities. As a result, nearly one-third of nursing home residents now rely on welfare payments, and the system is facing a potential collapse. Germany's Health Minister has called for urgent reform, as the aging population is expected to increase the number of people needing care by 37% by 2055.</p>

The document confirms that emails used to suggest a plot by Hillary Clinton's campaign were actually a composite created and disseminated by Russian intelligence. This finding contradicts the narrative that U.S. intelligence officials manufactured evidence of Russian interference. Despite this, Gabbard has continued her efforts to prove a "treasonous conspiracy" by Obama-era officials, a quest that former intelligence insiders have dismissed as a fiction.</p>

          <p>A new survey from Ally Bank reveals that nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers feel that spending on their social lives is negatively impacting their financial goals. While connecting with friends is important for well-being, many in these generations report overspending on social activities, with an average monthly outlay of $250. Financial experts suggest that the key is to consciously budget for social activities rather than letting them derail financial progress. They also recommend finding free or low-cost ways to socialize and being open with friends about budget limitations to avoid the pressure of overspending.</p>
