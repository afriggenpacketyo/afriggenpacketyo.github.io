          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have announced that nearly 100 people previously listed as missing after the severe flash floods on July 4 have been found safe. The search, now in its third week, continues for only three remaining individuals. The devastating floods along the Guadalupe River resulted in at least 135 fatalities across the state, including 107 in Kerr County alone. Recovery efforts involving over a thousand personnel and volunteers are ongoing as the community grapples with the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for circumventing a 2021 law by restoring Confederate-era names to several U.S. army bases. Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed after different historical soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the original Confederate figures. The House Armed Services Committee voted to block this move, with some Republicans joining Democrats in condemning the action as a blatant disregard for congressional authority. The article details the controversial histories of figures like Braxton Bragg, for whom the bases were originally named.</p>

          <p>This article presents a personal and historical analysis of Oklahoma, arguing that its complex and often violent past is essential to understanding the United States. The author recounts the state's history, from the re-enactment of land runs in schools to the erasure of Indigenous and Black histories, such as the dream of an all-Black state. The piece posits that Oklahoma's story of reinvention, ambition, and dispossession reflects a core American dilemma. It serves as a proving ground for the nation's political and cultural conflicts, making it a crucial lens through which to view America's present and future.</p>

          <p>In an interview discussing her new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her trailblazing career and the political challenges of today. She recounts facing racism, such as an incident with Senator Jesse Helms, and argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in American politics. Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is not effectively countering Donald Trump and warns against the reversal of civil rights progress. Despite these challenges, she remains optimistic about the future of American democracy.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the methods used. The survey suggests this shift is linked to a perception that the program is not targeting dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than anticipated. The poll also reveals that a large majority of Americans, particularly outside of Trump's base, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Overall presidential approval has also seen a decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, is facing a critical upper house election with polls indicating it may lose its majority. The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its partner Komeito are grappling with public discontent over inflation, political scandals, and the rise of anti-immigration sentiment. A significant factor in the election is the surge of the right-wing populist Sanseito party, which is gaining traction with its "Japanese First" rhetoric.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the United States' recent trade strategy with Southeast Asian nations has shifted from fostering partnership to a transactional, rent-seeking model. The author contends that by imposing dramatically higher tariffs and demanding mandatory purchases, Washington is monetizing access to its market rather than promoting mutual economic integration. This approach, while potentially yielding short-term gains for the U.S., is said to undermine the competitiveness and sovereignty of ASEAN members. The article suggests this new strategy transforms the region into a "fee for access" economy, damaging long-term strategic relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Lowy Institute suggests China's influence in Southeast Asia is poised to grow significantly as the United States and European Union reduce their foreign aid budgets. With the Trump administration cutting approximately $60 billion in aid and Europe pulling back $25 billion, China is solidifying its role as the region's largest infrastructure financier. This shift allows Beijing to enhance its strategic position through projects like high-speed rail links. The report concludes that as Western aid declines, China is well-positioned to become the dominant development partner in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Women's Euro 2025 tournament has seen an unusually low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%, sparking analysis into the potential causes. Experts suggest a combination of factors, including increased pressure from the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight, which can negatively impact performance. Additionally, improved data analysis and scouting mean goalkeepers are better prepared, often knowing a player's preferred penalty style. The professionalization of the women's game has also led to physically more capable and smarter goalkeepers, making spot-kicks significantly more challenging to score than in previous tournaments.</p>

          <p>Recent conservative criticism of Superman's portrayal as an immigrant overlooks the character's deeply leftist origins, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created in the 1930s by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the original Superman was a "socialist figure" and a "Champion of the Oppressed." Early comics depicted him fighting corrupt capitalists, tearing down slums, and protecting the poor from authorities. This history contrasts sharply with the later, more patriotic "American way" version of the character, highlighting Superman's evolution as a metaphor reflecting the social and political concerns of each era.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has accused some council officials of deliberately obstructing the work of his party's newly elected councillors. After gaining control of 10 councils in May, Farage claims that in some areas, like Warwickshire, his councillors are being "hamstrung" by existing bureaucracies and that officials are unwilling to cooperate with cost-cutting initiatives. The party has faced its own criticism for decisions such as hiring political assistants in Warwickshire, a move Farage defended as necessary to overcome the obstructionism and implement the will of elected representatives.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: To Counter Trump, Opponents Must Learn from His Political Tactics</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that to effectively counter Donald Trump, pro-democracy forces must learn from his political methods. The author suggests that Trump's success lies in his ability to tell a simple, repetitive story, build a powerful movement outside of party norms, and be undaunted in his political attacks. To succeed, the opposition should adopt a similarly clear and aggressive messaging strategy, focus on building a grassroots movement, and propose its own bold vision for constitutional reform rather than just defending the existing system. The article calls for a more determined and less conventional approach to combat authoritarian trends.</p>

          <p>A wildfire on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, initially allowed to burn under a "control and contain" strategy, exploded in size and destroyed approximately 70 buildings, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge. The Dragon Bravo fire, sparked by lightning on July 4, grew tenfold in a day due to a sudden drop in humidity and strong winds. Firefighters on the scene reported being trapped and lacking adequate resources to combat the rapidly spreading blaze. The incident has raised serious questions about the park's fire management strategy and caused devastating losses for the community.</p>

          <p>Scientists across the United States are describing the severe impact of the Trump administration's deep funding cuts to federal research agencies like the NSF and NIH. The cuts have led to terminated projects, staff layoffs, and a growing brain drain as researchers seek opportunities overseas. Projects affected range from climate change data collection and infectious disease trials to nuclear physics.

Although he was granted bond in his immigration case, a government appeal has kept him detained and shuttled between multiple facilities. His case has drawn alarm from press freedom organizations, who see it as a sign of increasing hostility toward journalists in the United States.</p>

          <p>To counter the United States' "small yard, high fence" technology restrictions, China could pivot to fostering AI innovation and cooperation with nations in the Global South, according to policy analysts. This strategy would involve promoting collaborative creation, equitable technology sharing, and fair data access with developing countries. By co-developing inclusive AI infrastructure and ethical frameworks that address diverse regional concerns, China could build an alternative to the U.S.-led tech ecosystem. Such a move would represent a strategic response to supply chain decoupling and the ongoing tech rivalry with Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While book-to-film adaptations are often met with skepticism, a selection of writers argues that some movies have successfully improved upon their source material. Films like 'Jurassic Park' and 'The Devil Wears Prada' are praised for tightening narratives, strengthening character arcs, and adding iconic dialogue not present in the original novels. Other examples cited include 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' which increased the story's suspense, and 'The Social Network,' which created a more compelling narrative by taking liberties with the facts. These adaptations demonstrate how cinema can elevate a story through different artistic and narrative choices.</p>

          <p>While polls show that 60-70% of Americans desire more than two political parties, the current single-winner electoral system makes it nearly impossible for third parties to succeed. Political analyst Lee Drutman explains that in this system, votes for third parties are often seen as "wasted" or "spoiler" votes, which discourages both voters and ambitious candidates. He advocates for proportional representation with multi-member districts, a system common in other democracies. This reform would allow parties to win seats proportional to their vote share, making elections more competitive and eliminating issues like gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>An increase in pitching injuries, particularly elbow ligament tears requiring Tommy John surgery, is plaguing baseball from youth leagues to the MLB. Experts like Dr. Keith Meister, the Texas Rangers' team physician, attribute the epidemic to an industry-wide obsession with maximizing pitch velocity and spin rate. This trend has trickled down to amateur levels, where young pitchers are pushing their bodies to the limit to secure scholarships and professional contracts, leading to a surge in surgeries for teenagers. Critics argue that until the highest level of the sport prioritizes safety over speed, the dangerous cycle will continue.</p>

The government has declared a national disaster, but the economic fallout is severe, impacting cottage industries and heightening concerns about poverty and access to healthcare.

While the Wallabies showed some fight in the second half of the first Test, their comeback occurred after the Lions had built a commanding lead and began making uncharacteristic errors. The Lions' performance in the first 50 minutes demonstrated a clear superiority in physicality and creativity. Despite the potential return of key players, the undercooked Wallabies, ranked eighth in the world, face a significant challenge against a powerful Lions squad.</p>
