          <p>Taiwan's coastguard has requested additional funding to enhance coastal surveillance after several undetected landings by individuals from mainland China using inflatable boats. This request follows incidents where mainland Chinese residents illegally crossed the Taiwan Strait, landing on sensitive shores. One incident involved a father and son seeking freedom in Taiwan, while another involved a man who claimed to have crossed the strait, raised a Chinese flag, and returned to the mainland. The coastguard is investigating the feasibility of such crossings and assessing the need for improved surveillance capabilities.</p>

          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a UK distributor supplying major supermarkets, has been hit by a ransomware attack, disrupting its operations and potentially leading to food waste. The logistics firm, which serves supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, confirmed the cyberattack, stating that while transport activities remain unaffected, order processing has been halted. Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones, founder of Black Farmer, estimates that pallets of his meat products are at risk of spoilage if deliveries are not resumed promptly.

These changes are aimed at creating jobs, lowering the cost of living, and boosting the U.S. economy.

          <p>Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's visit to China highlights the growing defense and security cooperation between the two nations, which is likely to concern India. Analysts suggest that the recent skirmishes between Pakistan and India, along with the success of Pakistan's Chinese-made fighter jets and missiles, will encourage both countries to strengthen their military ties. Lin Minwang from Fudan University's Centre of South Asia Studies notes that Beijing and Islamabad are likely to seek closer defense ties.</p>

          <p>A family who fought in court to protect their young daughter from her paedophile father has criticized government legislation intended to help others in similar situations. The Victims and Courts Bill includes an amendment to remove parental responsibility from convicted paedophiles, but only if they have abused their own children. This means that families in cases where the paedophile has abused other children would still need to go to family court to remove parental responsibility. The government said it would continue work to make the law "as strong as it needs to be".</p>

          <p>The UK, France, and Canada have issued their strongest condemnation yet of Israel's military actions in Gaza, signaling a significant shift in international support. They call for an end to Israel's offensive, citing the intolerable level of human suffering and dismissing Prime Minister Netanyahu's arguments for continuing the operation. While acknowledging Israel's right to defend itself after the October 7 attacks, the three governments deem the current escalation as disproportionate and insufficient. Netanyahu has responded by accusing the leaders of offering a prize for the attacks and inviting more such atrocities.</p>
