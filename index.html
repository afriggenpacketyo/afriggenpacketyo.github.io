          <p>The anticipation of President Trump's tariff announcement led to a surge in U.S. imports, as businesses rushed to beat the new levies.  However, this frontloading was accompanied by a significant drop in new freight orders, indicating uncertainty and potential economic slowdown.  The situation highlights the complex impact of Trump's protectionist trade policies on the global supply chain.  This is creating a 'wait and see' approach from many businesses.</p>
