          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is seeking to strip former President Joseph Kabila of his immunity from prosecution, alleging his support for the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. Justice Minister Constant Mutamba stated that the Senate has received a request to revoke Kabila's immunity, citing evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Kabila, currently in self-imposed exile in South Africa, denies these accusations. The conflict in eastern DRC has claimed thousands of lives and displaced millions, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A senior official stated that the U.S. military's standards for investigating sexual assault claims will remain unchanged despite a department-wide review into how discrimination claims are handled. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called for a review of equal opportunity programs to ensure discrimination complaints aren't being "weaponized." While Hegseth's directive calls for timely dismissal of unsubstantiated complaints, officials affirm that the standard of proof for sexual assault victims will not be raised. The number of sexual assaults reported across the military fell by nearly 4% last year.</p>

          <p>The crypto community is celebrating President Trump's first 100 days in office, citing a "180 pivot" from the previous administration's stance on digital assets.

Key figures like Jonathan Gould at the OCC and Paul Atkins at the SEC are signaling support for crypto innovation.

          <p>Automakers like Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant year-over-year U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers rushing to purchase new vehicles ahead of potential price increases due to tariffs. However, demand slowed in late April as inventories tightened and prices increased. President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles took effect April 3, and additional levies on auto parts are expected to begin soon. Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that recent changes to the tariffs are helpful but more actions are needed to assist automakers.</p>

The study finds that young people with more friends and intimate social relationships experience a more traditional U-shaped happiness curve.

          <p>The article discusses a growing anti-Me Too backlash, with some commentators claiming that Harvey Weinstein was wrongfully convicted. Right-wing commentator Candace Owens is promoting a series of jailhouse interviews with Weinstein, while Joe Rogan has also expressed doubts about his guilt. This shift reflects a change in how sexual violence is understood in American culture. The article argues that the Me Too movement successfully challenged myths around sexual abuse, but that progress is now being undermined.</p>

It discusses the role of consulting firms owned by private equity companies, such as EAB and Ruffalo Noel Levitz, in helping colleges market themselves and offer financial aid packages. The article highlights the practice of "financial aid optimization," where colleges offer discounts to students who can afford to pay full price in order to maximize revenue.
