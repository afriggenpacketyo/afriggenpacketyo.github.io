          <p>CBS has announced that its flagship late-night program, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," will end its run in May 2026. The network stated the decision is purely financial and not related to the show's content or performance, a move that leaves CBS without a late-night talk show for the first time since 1993. Host Stephen Colbert, who was informed of the decision shortly before the announcement, expressed his gratitude to CBS and the audience during a show taping. The cancellation has drawn public speculation, with some questioning if it is connected to a recent settlement with Donald Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Member of Parliament Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party again following comments she made regarding racism. The suspension and a new investigation were triggered after she defended a controversial 2023 letter in which she differentiated the racism experienced by people of color from the prejudice faced by Jewish, Irish, and Traveller communities. In a recent interview, Abbott stood by her original assertions, stating it is "silly" to claim that racism based on skin color is the same as other types of prejudice. She believes the Labour leadership is actively trying to force her out of the party.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, identifying it as the group responsible for the April attack in Pahalgam, India, that killed 26 people. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, another designated terrorist group. The move was welcomed by India as a significant step in U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. The April 22 attack, which targeted mostly Hindu tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, led to a major escalation of hostilities between India and Pakistan before a ceasefire was reached.</p>

          <p>The German government has resumed collective deportation flights to Afghanistan, sending 81 Afghan men with criminal records back to their home country. This marks the first such operation under the new government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who has advocated for a tougher migration policy. The Interior Ministry confirmed the flight, stating it fulfills a key part of the coalition agreement to deport criminals and individuals deemed a threat. The operation was conducted with logistical support from Qatar, and the deportees received a cash sum to cover initial expenses upon their return.</p>

          <p>India's recent ban on high-frequency trading firm Jane Street has brought the fine line between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into focus. India's regulator, SEBI, accused the firm of a deliberate strategy to manipulate the Nifty 50 index for profit, while Jane Street claimed its actions were standard index arbitrage. Experts note the key distinction lies in intent, or 'mens rea,' and market impact. Arbitrage exploits existing price inefficiencies, whereas manipulation involves actively creating those inefficiencies, often by distorting a less liquid market to profit from a more liquid one, which SEBI alleges occurred in this case.

Critics of the cuts argue they will be particularly devastating for smaller stations serving rural and underserved communities, such as Native American populations, which rely heavily on federal funds. These stations often provide essential services, including emergency alerts in areas where other communication methods fail, raising concerns about public safety.</p>

          <h2>Widespread Cellphone Internet Shutdowns Sweep Across Russia, Citing Security Concerns</h2>

          <p>Dozens of regions across Russia are experiencing widespread and deliberate cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials claim are necessary to counter Ukrainian drone attacks. The disruptions, which began in Moscow in May, have now spread from border regions to Siberia and the Far East, affecting daily life by disabling electronic payments, navigation apps, and other essential services. Digital rights experts warn that using security as a justification for these unprecedented shutdowns normalizes the practice for the public. This could open the door for authorities to abuse these restrictions and further curtail already limited online freedoms in the country.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods. Trump has linked the potential tariffs to the ongoing legal proceedings against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula described the threat as "unacceptable blackmail" and an attack on Brazil's national sovereignty, labeling Brazilian politicians who support Trump's policy as "traitors." The diplomatic dispute intensifies as Trump also posted a letter of sympathy for Bolsonaro, while reports suggest the U.S. is considering sanctions against a key Brazilian Supreme Court justice.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by successfully building and operating his own 7-meter-long submarine. The inventor, identified only as Zhang, said he was fascinated by invention since childhood but was inspired to build a submersible after seeing one on a state television program in 2014. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings, he purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine, and began constructing the vessel in secret. His creation, a sleek black craft, has been seen slicing through a local river, fulfilling a lifelong dream of building a machine that could travel underwater.</p>

          <p>A prominent index tracking China's progress toward a market-based economy has shown a decline, prompting calls from Chinese economists for more pro-market reforms. The report from the National Economic Research Institute revealed that China's overall marketization score dropped in 2023, with the largest deterioration seen in the relationship between the government and the market. Experts are urging action to reverse this trend, highlighting the need to address economic imbalances and what they describe as vicious intra-industry competition. The decline signals increased government intervention in the economy at a time when many are advocating for greater market-led resource allocation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man has shared his harrowing experience with a rare and invasive cancer, Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), to raise awareness and advocate for early diagnosis. His journey began with a persistent itch that was misdiagnosed for over a year as a simple fungal infection. It was only after he requested a biopsy that the aggressive cancer was discovered, requiring extensive surgery and skin grafts. He has since created the largest online resource and support group for EMPD, connecting over 900 patients globally. His story underscores the importance of self-advocacy in healthcare and the urgent need for more research into rare diseases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes volatile fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high and aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a slowdown in the rapid increase of rice prices, which had surged due to poor harvests. Despite this moderation, inflation has now remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that while the trend is moderating, persistent yen depreciation and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs could reintroduce inflationary pressures and pose risks to the economic outlook.

          <p>This analysis questions the official "financial decision" reasoning provided by CBS for ending "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." The article suggests the move may be part of a broader pattern of the network's parent company, Paramount, capitulating to President Donald Trump, especially as a major merger with Skydance awaits federal approval. It highlights a recent $16 million settlement paid to Trump over a lawsuit he filed against the network, contrasting the cost of that agreement with Colbert's salary. The author argues that sacrificing a top-rated, critically acclaimed show erodes CBS's journalistic legacy and independence.</p>

Watters claimed he misunderstood a social media post from the governor, stating, "he wasn't lying. He was just confusing and unclear."

His comments come as Germany leads a significant increase in its defense budget and works to strengthen a trilateral alliance with the UK and France.

          <p>Cristosal, one of El Salvador's most prominent human rights organizations, has announced it is shutting down its operations in the country and moving into exile. The group, founded 25 years ago, cited escalating threats, harassment, and espionage from the government of President Nayib Bukele, a key Trump administration ally. The organization's executive director stated they were forced to choose between "exile or prison," a decision solidified by the recent arrest of one of their leading activists. Cristosal has been an outspoken critic of Bukele's heavy-handed security crackdown, which has led to mass incarcerations and widespread human rights concerns.</p>
