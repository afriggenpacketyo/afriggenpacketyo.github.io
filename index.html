          <p>Clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs are expressing concerns that the president's return-to-office order is compromising patient privacy. According to the article, the order is forcing many clinicians to conduct sensitive conversations in makeshift spaces where they can be easily overheard, potentially violating patient confidentiality. This situation raises ethical and practical issues about providing adequate mental health services to veterans while adhering to administrative directives. The concerns highlight the importance of balancing operational efficiency with the need to protect patient privacy in healthcare settings.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that Gaza is facing a catastrophic humanitarian crisis due to Israel's total siege, which has lasted for over 60 days. Doctors report severe shortages of food, water, and medicine, leading to a surge in preventable illnesses and deaths. Humanitarian groups and European officials accuse Israel of using aid as a political tool, violating international law. The article paints a grim picture of daily life for Gazans, who struggle to obtain basic necessities, with bakeries closed, flour supplies depleted, and the only available food coming from charity kitchens that are often looted. The UN warns that humanitarian support is on the verge of total collapse.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are actively working to safeguard Donald Trump's tariffs, despite increasing warning signs that these policies are destabilizing the economy. The article details how Republican leaders thwarted a Senate resolution aimed at repealing the tariffs, with the White House issuing a veto threat and the House preventing consideration of the resolution. This action comes amid data indicating a contraction in the US economy, which economists attribute to the tariffs. While better economic news emerged later in the week, the situation highlights the deep partisan divide over trade policy and its potential consequences for the economy.</p>

          <p>A new study by Waymo suggests that self-driving cars could significantly reduce traffic fatalities, potentially saving approximately 34,000 lives per year in the US. The article references the study, which analyzed 56.7 million miles driven by Waymo's autonomous vehicles without human safety drivers. The results indicated a substantial reduction in crashes, particularly those involving injuries and pedestrians. While acknowledging caveats such as the limited geographic areas tested and the need for more data, the article argues that slowing down the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles could be costing lives, highlighting the potential benefits of AI in improving road safety.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article asserts that Donald Trump is systematically undermining the Department of Justice (DOJ) through politically motivated investigations, rewarding allies, and eliminating internal opposition. The article accuses Trump of using the DOJ to target political opponents and reward loyalists, citing examples such as the investigation of Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. It also claims that Trump is marginalizing career attorneys who oppose his will, thus eroding the DOJ's independence and neutrality. The author argues that these actions threaten the rule of law and undermine American democracy, creating a system where citizens fear arbitrary exercises of power.</p>

          <p>A columnist for The Guardian argues that Donald Trump's policies are creating significant uncertainty and instability in the US economy. The article highlights concerns about tariffs, budget cuts, and immigration policies, all of which contribute to a sense of unknowability for businesses and consumers. This uncertainty, the article suggests, is leading to a decline in consumer sentiment and potentially hindering economic growth. While acknowledging that some economic data remains strong, the columnist warns that the long-term effects of Trump's policies could lead to soaring prices and empty shelves if a more settled policy position is not reached.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president marked a significant shift in the structure of his administration. The article suggests that Vance's selection signaled a move away from a coalition government to a royal court, where loyalty and sycophancy are prized above all else. The author contends that this shift has eliminated checks and balances, leading to a more reckless and unrestrained presidency. The selection of Vance, according to the article, demonstrated that Trump's second term would be characterized by a lack of skepticism and a willingness to act on his impulses.</p>

The article reports that China lodged a protest with Japan, urging them to stop illegal activities and prevent similar incidents. Japan, in turn, reiterated its protest over the airspace violation and demanded preventative measures. The incident has further strained relations between the two countries and underscores the ongoing territorial dispute over the islands.</p>

          <p>This article argues that US geography has given the US unrivaled security. In threatening war with both Canada and Mexico, Donald Trump is obliterating America’s greatest strategic advantage. It notes that US troops are now on the southern border and Mexican drug cartels have been officially labeled as foreign terrorist groups, providing the legal pretext for the president to order US soldiers to enter Mexican territory and destroy them. Any unilateral US military intervention in Mexico would be reckless.</p>

          <p>This article reports on Native American women are bringing back facial tattoos, stating that the practice was once common among the south-eastern Indigenous nations, but after colonization the tradition faded away for many. Now, through efforts like those from the Inchunwa Project, a community-rooted collective that is working to revitalize the tattoos, south-eastern Indigenous people across the country are breathing new life into the practice. Receiving her inchunwa was not something Faithlyn Taloa Seawright did lightly, but when the moment “just felt right”, she knew it was time.</p>

          <p>This article reports on a landmark $4bn settlement to address nearly 7,000 claims of sexual assault in juvenile facilities and foster homes across Los Angeles. While many of the claims centered around MacLaren children’s center, some victims say the money will never rectify a system that hurt vulnerable children and protected their abusers. While the reforms will help children currently in the foster system and that money will soon flow to other victims that could benefit from financial support after a lifetime of trauma, closure would not come until those responsible for abuse were held accountable.</p>

          <p>This article reports that Professor Scott Galloway said that somewhere between 10% and 30% of people who get Social Security right now should not receive it, because they don’t need it.

Galloway suggests this not just as a way to reduce economic inequality in the U.S., but also as a potential solution to cuts costs in a program that faces insolvency issues due to shifting demographics.</p>
