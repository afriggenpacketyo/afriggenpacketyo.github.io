          <p>The New York Times reports on the growing trend of consumers using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) loans to finance grocery purchases. This shift in consumer behavior may indicate a change in spending habits or, more concerningly, highlight increasing financial strain among households. The rising reliance on BNPL options for essential goods like groceries could suggest that individuals are struggling to manage their budgets amid economic pressures. While BNPL offers convenience, its increased usage for basic needs raises questions about the overall financial health of consumers.</p>

          <p>CBS News reports that eight people were injured in Boulder, Colorado, during an attack on a peaceful demonstration advocating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, allegedly used Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower, resulting in burn injuries to the victims, who ranged in age from 52 to 88. The FBI is investigating the incident as a targeted act of terrorism, with the suspect facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crime charge. Witnesses reported that Soliman shouted "Free Palestine" during the attack, and court documents reveal he admitted to planning the attack for a year and wanting to kill Zionist people.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times reports on the controversial handling of a case involving a Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s deputy convicted of using excessive force. Despite a jury finding Deputy Trevor Kirk guilty of a felony, the U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles, Bill Essayli, requested a dismissal of the felony charge, leading to a misdemeanor plea deal and a lighter sentence. This decision prompted resignations from federal prosecutors and raised concerns about the independence of the Justice Department. The case involved an incident where Kirk threw a woman to the ground and pepper-sprayed her, and the reversal of the conviction has drawn criticism and scrutiny.</p>

          <p>CBS News explores the reasons why opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) this June could be a wise financial move. With potential rate cuts looming, securing a fixed interest rate now can protect against future market volatility. A long-term CD guarantees a steady interest rate, regardless of market changes, and offers the potential to earn significant interest over time. Savers can earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest, depending on the CD term and rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yahoo News reports that the predicted collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies in four billion years is now considered unlikely within that timeframe. New research, based on simulations using data from NASAâ€™s Hubble and the European Space Agencyâ€™s Gaia telescopes, suggests only a 2% probability of a collision in the next five billion years. While close encounters may occur, a full collision and merger is expected to take place in eight to ten billion years, and the inclusion of the Large Magellanic Cloud in the simulations altered the predicted outcome.</p>
