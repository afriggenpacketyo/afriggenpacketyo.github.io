          <p>President Trump announced he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be repositioned to undisclosed regions following what he termed "highly provocative" statements from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. The move comes amid a tense war of words, with Medvedev threatening the U.S. over ultimatums regarding a ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump emphasized the gravity of words and their potential for unintended consequences, highlighting the escalating rhetoric between the two nuclear powers as a deadline for Russian de-escalation approaches.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has announced her resignation, creating a significant vacancy on the central bank's rate-setting committee. Kugler, a Biden nominee whose term was set to expire in 2026, will return to a professorship at Georgetown University. Her departure gives President Trump an opportunity to appoint a new governor, potentially shifting the balance on the Federal Open Market Committee, where Kugler had recently expressed hawkish views in support of holding interest rates steady amid concerns about tariff-related inflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), following the release of a jobs report showing a significant slowdown in hiring. In a social media post, Trump made baseless accusations that the data was manipulated for political purposes and called for her immediate replacement. The move came after the July report showed only 73,000 jobs were added and included major downward revisions for May and June, painting a much weaker picture of the labor market.</p>

          <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein and their families have expressed outrage after his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas.

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla partially liable in a wrongful death lawsuit involving its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $200 million in punitive damages and $129 million in compensatory damages. The case concerned a 2019 crash where a Model S using Autopilot ran through an intersection, killing 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon. The plaintiffs argued that defects in the self-driving technology were a contributing factor, and the verdict is seen as a significant legal test for Tesla amid ongoing scrutiny over its vehicles' safety.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent wave of tariffs appears to follow a clearer strategy than previous actions, using the threat of steep duties to compel countries into bilateral deals with commitments to buy more U.S. goods. Nations that offer sufficient concessions, like the EU and Japan, face a lower 15% tariff, while others are hit with rates of 30% or more to increase pressure. However, this approach is fraught with economic and legal risks, including a weak jobs report suggesting an economic slowdown and a pending appellate court case that could potentially invalidate the entire tariff policy.</p>

          <p>A report from the Tech Transparency Project found that Google has removed more than 50 organizations focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from a public list of groups receiving its most substantial political contributions. This move is part of a larger purge of 214 groups and comes as Google and other tech companies face political pressure to scale back DEI initiatives. While Google stated its contributions change annually, the removals align with a broader pullback from DEI commitments amid cost-cutting and a shifting political landscape.</p>

          <p>Toyota has announced pricing for the 2026 Grand Highlander, with most trims of the popular three-row SUV seeing a nominal price increase of just $500 over the previous model year. The entry-level LE trim will now start at $41,360 before destination charges. This modest price adjustment keeps the Grand Highlander competitive against rivals like the Chevrolet Traverse and Kia Telluride. The vehicle is a carryover model with no significant changes, aside from a minor cosmetic update to the Hybrid Nightshade edition.</p>

          <p>President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, visited a controversial US- and Israeli-backed aid distribution site in Gaza, stating the trip was to help craft a plan to deliver food and medical aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) sites have been heavily criticized, with the UN reporting hundreds of Palestinians killed nearby, a figure the GHF disputes. The visit was denounced by some Gazans as a "media stunt" and by human rights groups who accuse the militarized aid system of turning distribution into "regular bloodbaths."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing intense criticism after former NFL player Lawrence Taylor, a registered sex offender, was featured at a White House event launching a revived Presidential Fitness Test for children.

          <p>The latest federal jobs report suggests the U.S. labor market has significantly weakened, with economists describing it as "very soft" and showing a "high degree of stagnation." Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, and previous estimates for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000 jobs. Experts point to headwinds from President Trump's tariff policies, which create business uncertainty, and a falling labor force participation rate as contributing factors to the slowdown, which is now more pronounced than previously thought.

          <p>A UK Supreme Court ruling has limited the ability of millions of motorists to claim compensation for hidden commissions on car loans, siding with finance companies in two of three key test cases. The decision reverses a lower court ruling that could have led to widespread payouts. While the financial regulator is still considering a redress scheme for those with specific "discretionary commission arrangements" before 2021, the court's decision significantly narrows the path to compensation for many who may have been overcharged on their vehicle financing.</p>

Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the moves as "unacceptable imperialist aggression" and an attack on the country's sovereignty. Analysts suggest the actions are politically motivated, tied to the geopolitical rivalry with China and support for Trump's ally, Bolsonaro, rather than purely economic concerns.</p>
