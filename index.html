          <p>Lawyers for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez assert she remains in her role, arguing that as a presidential appointee, only President Donald Trump has the authority to fire her, not White House staff. This legal challenge follows a White House notification of her termination, which her attorneys deem "legally deficient." Monarez reportedly resisted pressure to "rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives" and dismiss dedicated health experts, particularly clashing with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over vaccine policy. This incident marks the latest development in a significant leadership upheaval at the CDC, raising questions about political interference in public health agencies.</p>

          <p>Nvidia surpassed Wall Street expectations for its quarterly earnings and revenue, projecting continued robust sales growth above 50% for the current quarter, signaling persistent strong demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company's data center division is integral to the global AI expansion, with an estimated $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending anticipated by the end of the decade. Although data center revenue slightly missed some estimates and H20 chip sales to China were absent, Nvidia's overall revenue still climbed 56%. The firm also authorized an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in its future trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Will Smith is facing accusations of employing artificial intelligence to generate a fake crowd in a YouTube video that allegedly depicted scenes from a recent tour performance. Sharp-eyed fans identified several purported inaccuracies, including distorted facial features and a disembodied arm within the audience, leading to widespread online speculation. Smith had posted the clip, captioned, "My favorite part of tour is seeing you all up close," prompting critics to question the authenticity of the footage. This incident has ignited debate about the use of AI in entertainment and the potential for misleading digital content.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that focusing on China's fundamental "needs" rather than its perceived "wants" is essential for de-escalating the US-China rivalry and fostering global stability. It argues that Beijing's foreign policy and domestic actions are primarily driven by critical internal constraints, such as maintaining economic growth, ensuring food and energy security, and preserving social order, which are paramount for the Communist Party's legitimacy. The article highlights that slowing economic growth and significant energy reliance motivate China's push for indigenous innovation and diversified supply chains. This "needs-first" perspective could offer deeper insights into China's vulnerabilities and provide avenues for more effective international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Armagh musician Martin Rafferty from Northern Ireland has successfully broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing continuously for over 24 hours. This impressive feat was made even more remarkable as Rafferty accomplished it despite having a broken thumb, enduring challenging conditions, particularly during the cold early morning hours.

          <p>Microsoft announced the termination of two employees for allegedly breaking into President Brad Smith's office during a protest organized by "No Azure for Apartheid." The group opposes Microsoft's alleged involvement in Israeli military operations in Gaza, specifically claiming the company's Azure cloud infrastructure was used to store Palestinian phone calls. Microsoft stated the employees were fired for "serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct," including unlawful entry and placing listening devices. The company is currently investigating the incidents and collaborating with law enforcement, while Smith has pledged a third-party investigation into how its technology is being used.</p>

          <p>A $1.2 billion contract for constructing and managing a large immigration detention camp at Fort Bliss, Texas, has sparked controversy due to its award to Acquisition Logistics LLC, a small firm lacking visible experience in operating correctional facilities. The Pentagon's refusal to disclose contract specifics or justify the selection over more experienced bidders has led to a formal complaint and scrutiny from Congress. This opaque process is indicative of the Trump administration's accelerated deportation efforts, which increasingly involve military resources.

Once grappling with an epidemic that saw one in eight infants infected, the nation established robust prevention infrastructure, offering free antiretroviral therapies and comprehensive prenatal and maternal care. This sustained political commitment and domestic investment enabled Botswana to become the first country with a high HIV prevalence to attain the World Health Organization's Gold Tier status for eradicating vertical transmissions.

          <p>A rigorous new study from Stanford economists indicates that generative artificial intelligence is having a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the US job market. Since 2022, early-career employees, aged 22 to 25, in fields highly exposed to AI such as software engineering and customer service, have experienced a 13% decline in employment. In contrast, more experienced workers in the same sectors and individuals in less AI-exposed occupations have maintained or increased their employment. The research suggests AI excels at "codified knowledge" but is less capable of replicating the "tacit knowledge" and soft skills acquired through years of practical experience, necessitating career adaptation.</p>

Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among those receiving the maximum reduction, while 26 other models are eligible for a £1,500 discount. This £650 million scheme, spanning three years, aims to significantly lower the upfront cost of EVs, making them more competitive with petrol and diesel counterparts, and thereby accelerate adoption ahead of the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales.

          <h2>'The Summer I Turned Pretty' Creators Urge Fans to Cease Online Abuse Towards Cast</h2>

          <p>The creators and author Jenny Han of "The Summer I Turned Pretty" have issued a plea for fans to "act normal online" and cease the online abuse directed at cast members, particularly amidst the fervent anticipation for the series finale. Lead actress Lola Tung and actor Gavin Casalegno have been targeted, largely due to strong fan divisions over their characters' romantic entanglements. Han specifically condemned harmful imagery, such as a woman being "slapped or choked," underscoring that the show is fictional but the individuals portraying the characters are real. These warnings highlight a concerning trend of online toxicity within dedicated fan communities.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods has increased its full-year sales and earnings guidance following a stronger-than-expected performance in its fiscal second quarter. The company now projects comparable sales growth of 2% to 3.5%, fueled by a robust 5% rise in comparable sales during the recent quarter. Net income for the period reached $381 million, or $4.71 per share. This revised outlook accounts for current tariffs, which the company has managed through targeted price adjustments. Furthermore, Dick's confirmed its acquisition of Foot Locker is slated for next month, a strategic move aimed at establishing it as the leading athletic footwear retailer in the US.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the University of Chicago reveals that climate-driven wildfires are significantly reversing decades of clean air progress in the US and Canada, causing particulate pollution to surge to levels not witnessed in years. Canada's record-breaking wildfire season severely degraded its air quality, with widespread impacts extending into parts of the United States, especially the Midwest. The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) identifies particulate pollution as the foremost external threat to human life expectancy, comparable to the effects of smoking. Researchers link the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme wildfires to human-caused climate change, underscoring the long-term public health consequences of persistent CO2 emissions.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and Fox have secured a "short-term extension" in their ongoing carriage agreement dispute, thereby averting an immediate blackout of Fox channels for subscribers. This temporary resolution was reached just before a critical deadline that threatened to remove networks such as Fox Sports, Business, and News from the streaming platform. YouTube had previously criticized Fox's financial demands as excessively high, while Fox accused Google of leveraging its market influence unfairly. The extension facilitates continued negotiations, preventing service disruption for viewers ahead of significant sporting events, but underscores the persistent challenges in the dynamic streaming and broadcast industry.</p>

          <p>The high-profile trial of pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has concluded in Hong Kong, with the court reserving its verdict, which could be delivered as late as October. Lai, 77, has been in custody since 2020 under Beijing's controversial national security law, facing charges of "colluding with foreign forces" and "publishing seditious materials" via his former Apple Daily newspaper. The prosecution presented 161 articles and Lai's public statements as evidence, while his defense maintained these actions were legitimate exercises of free speech. The case is widely seen as a stark example of eroding press freedom in Hong Kong and has drawn strong condemnation from Western governments, including US President Trump and British Prime Minister Starmer.</p>

          <p>Harvard University is actively confronting a significant issue of grade inflation and a noticeable decline in student academic engagement, with average GPAs hovering around 3.8 despite a reported decrease in coursework. A university committee report highlighted that many students prioritize competitive extracurricular activities over their academic studies, paradoxically leading to increased stress as they seek to distinguish themselves. Professors, influenced by pressures to support student mental well-being, have inadvertently contributed to this trend, making an A grade almost a default. Harvard is now implementing new policies, including emphasizing class attendance and standardizing grading practices, in an effort to reinstate academic rigor and foster meaningful learning.</p>

          <p>Mexican senators resorted to a physical altercation during a contentious debate concerning alleged opposition support for US military intervention against drug cartels. The incident saw opposition leader Alejandro Moreno confront and physically push Senate president Gerardo Fernandez Norona, sparking a brawl. This confrontation followed accusations that the PRI and PAN parties had advocated for US intervention, claims they deny. Both involved senators are also facing unrelated controversies. The broader context includes President Trump's directive for the Pentagon to consider military action against Latin American cartels, a proposition that Mexico has unequivocally rejected, asserting its refusal to accept US military forces on its sovereign territory.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing significant amendments to its contentious tax regulations concerning self-catering holiday accommodation. Currently, properties must be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower business rates instead of higher council tax. The proposed changes would allow for an average of 182 days let over multiple years, and permit up to 14 days of charity donations to count towards this target. This initiative responds to widespread criticism that the existing 182-day rule is detrimentally affecting the tourism sector and imposing undue financial pressure on businesses. A public consultation on these proposals is open until November 20. (not investment advice)</p>
