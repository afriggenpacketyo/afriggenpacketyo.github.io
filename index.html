The project, located in Abu Dhabi, will be powered by 5 gigawatts of electricity and built by Emirati AI firm G42 in collaboration with U.S. companies. Concerns have been raised about potential risks to U.S. AI dominance and the transfer of sensitive technology to a country with close ties to China.

          <p>Chris Brown was arrested in England for allegedly assaulting a music producer at a London nightclub in February 2023.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic explores the ongoing debate about the role of rules and restrictions in children's literature, referencing historical perspectives and modern viewpoints. The discussion ranges from whether children should only be exposed to fairy tales and fables to the question of how much horror they can handle. The article highlights the decline in children reading for fun and suggests that a hyperfocus on analysis in education may be stifling their enjoyment of books, arguing that adults should allow children to engage with literature more organically.</p>

          <p>Republicans are advancing a megabill to enact President Trump's agenda, featuring $3.8 trillion in tax cuts and increased spending on defense and immigration enforcement. To offset costs, the bill proposes slashing health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. Key sticking points include disagreements over state and local tax deductions and Medicaid cuts. The bill would also curtail clean energy tax credits and tighten eligibility for food stamp programs, while boosting military spending and border security.</p>
