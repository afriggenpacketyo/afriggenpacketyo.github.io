          <p>The U.S. Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, marking the fifth-largest prize in the game's history. No ticket has matched all six numbers since May 31, allowing the prize to grow significantly over numerous drawings. A potential winner could opt for annuity payments over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. Despite the astronomical odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million, the massive prize continues to attract widespread participation across 45 states.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has announced his intention to sign an executive order mandating voter identification for all elections nationwide, a move he has previously attempted. This declaration, made on social media, also included calls for eliminating most mail-in voting and exclusively using paper ballots. A prior executive order with similar voter ID provisions was blocked by a federal judge who ruled that the president lacks the authority to regulate elections, a power delegated to Congress and the states. Public opinion polls, however, indicate broad bipartisan support for requiring voter identification.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," details a paradigm shift in chronic pain research, emphasizing a "bedside to the bench" approach. This method prioritizes patients' real-world experiences to guide laboratory studies, a reverse of the traditional process. Researchers are now able to map the unique neural signatures of an individual's pain, creating objective biomarkers for a subjective experience. This has led to groundbreaking treatments like deep brain stimulation (DBS), which can predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for millions of sufferers.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the advancement and proliferation of ballistic missile capabilities are fueling a new, multipolar arms race, increasing the global risk of nuclear conflict. The author suggests that while the fundamental logic of war remains unchanged, the technology has radically altered the potential scale of human suffering. The article warns that the world is moving toward a state of perpetual conflict, reminiscent of historical norms before the "long peace." It concludes that this dangerous trajectory poses a significant threat to the global strategic environment.</p>

          <p>A poignant six-year photography project captures the bedrooms of children killed in school shootings, left untouched by their grieving families. The images aim to create a "portrait of a person who's not there," conveying the enduring pain and permanent void left by their absence. The parents and the project's creators, journalist Steve Hartman and photographer Lou Bopp, hope these powerful visuals will resonate with the public. They intend for the project to foster empathy and inspire meaningful change to address the epidemic of school gun violence in America.</p>

          <p>An analysis details how former President Donald Trump's actions, including his attempt to remove Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the Federal Reserve's long-standing political independence. Critics argue that politicizing the central bank could undermine the U.S. financial system, which relies on the Fed's credibility to manage monetary policy without political interference. While Trump's administration frames these moves as necessary reforms to an institution they blame for inflation, experts warn it could lead to economic instability similar to countries where leaders dictate monetary policy.

          <p>A report from Arizona details the lethal reality of indoor heat, particularly for low-income and vulnerable residents when air conditioning fails.

It connects these deaths to "energy poverty," where households cannot afford to repair AC units or pay high electricity bills, a problem exacerbated by rising costs and policy changes. Experts warn that as climate change intensifies heatwaves, such preventable deaths could surge among the elderly, sick, and financially strained.</p>

          <p>The recent release of transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with the Justice Department has sparked criticism over unasked follow-up questions, particularly regarding Jeffrey Epstein's powerful associates. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that some Epstein associates were serving in Donald Trump's cabinet, but the interviewer did not press her for names. Critics and victims' attorneys argue this represents a missed opportunity for transparency and accountability, suggesting the disclosures were more performative than a genuine pursuit of truth. The handling of the interview has intensified scrutiny over the investigation into Epstein's network of influence.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, highlights the forgotten history of how surfing was introduced to the U.S. mainland. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—demonstrated the sport while attending a military school nearby. They famously rode waves on surfboards they crafted from local redwood, captivating local residents and planting the seeds for the sport's future popularity. This act of "surf diplomacy" predates the more widely known efforts of Duke Kahanamoku, who later popularized surfing globally in the 20th century.</p>

Rhode Island's new surcharge, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax," applies to non-primary residences valued over $1 million, significantly increasing property tax bills for affluent summer communities. Proponents see it as a way to address budget shortfalls and housing affordability crises, while critics argue it unfairly penalizes seasonal residents who contribute significantly to local economies without heavily using municipal services.

          <h2>Trump Administration Reverses Stance on mRNA Vaccines, Sowing Doubt and Restricting Access</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant policy reversal from his first term, Donald Trump's administration is now actively dismantling public trust and access to mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time vaccine skeptic, has canceled grants for further mRNA research and replaced key CDC advisory members with critics. The administration has also altered recommendations for children and pregnant women, which could end insurance coverage for the shots. This shift undermines what Trump once called a "medical miracle," creating a chilling effect on vaccine development and public health initiatives.</p>

          <h2>Dangerous 'Killfies' Remain a Global Problem, with India Recording the Highest Number of Incidents</h2>

          <p>Despite public awareness campaigns, India continues to lead the world in deaths and injuries resulting from people taking dangerous selfies, often called "killfies." Recent analyses of news reports show India accounts for over 40% of such incidents globally, with common danger zones including waterfalls, cliffs, and encounters with wildlife. Researchers note that the victims are predominantly men, and tragically, attempts to rescue a person who has fallen often lead to more casualties. Psychologists attribute the trend to a desire for online validation that overrides personal judgment, a phenomenon amplified by social media.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch has announced a significant shift in climate policy, pledging to remove all net-zero requirements for oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea. If elected, her government would focus solely on maximizing fossil fuel extraction, arguing it is "absurd" to leave resources untapped while other nations drill. This move directly contrasts with the current Labour government's commitment to ban new exploration licenses and pursue a transition to renewable energy. The plan has been criticized by environmental groups as reckless and inconsistent with the UK's legally binding 2050 net-zero target.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly contemplating a last-minute transfer bid for Aston Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, before the upcoming deadline. The club has been actively seeking to strengthen its goalkeeping position and has also been in negotiations for Belgian keeper Senne Lammens. However, Martinez, a World Cup winner with extensive Premier League experience, represents a more seasoned and high-profile option. The potential move comes as United's head coach, Ruben Amorim, acknowledged the immense pressure currently faced by the team's goalkeepers.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the first death from whooping cough in the UK this year, involving an infant whose mother had not been vaccinated during pregnancy. Health officials emphasize that vaccination between 20 and 32 weeks of pregnancy is crucial for providing passive immunity to newborns before they can receive their own first jab at eight weeks old. The tragic death highlights growing concerns over declining vaccine uptake for childhood diseases and increased vaccine hesitancy post-pandemic. Officials are urging pregnant women and parents to adhere to recommended vaccination schedules to prevent such severe outcomes.</p>

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has created severe shortages and record-high prices, even in its native Japan. The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, has surged, and retailers are struggling to keep the powder in stock. Japan's aging farming community cannot keep up with the labor-intensive cultivation process, creating a production bottleneck. In response, major beverage companies are creating dedicated matcha divisions, and the Japanese government is considering subsidies to encourage more farmers to grow tencha.</p>

          <p>As UK schools begin a new term, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of attendance from the very first week. New data reveals that over half of the pupils who missed school during the first week of the 2024 term went on to become "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with perfect initial attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-Covid levels. The government is launching initiatives, including attendance and behavior hubs led by exemplary schools, to support struggling schools and reverse this trend.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party faces historically low public approval and criticism of being "weak," some strategists see reasons for optimism. A key factor is the growing unpopularity of Donald Trump, which could motivate voters through "negative partisanship." Potential presidential candidates are adopting more aggressive stances, and recent polls show a slight Democratic lead for congressional elections. Strategists suggest a recovery plan focused on opposing Trump, addressing "kitchen table" economic issues like affordability, and organizing for midterm victories. The party is currently engaged in a necessary internal debate over policy and messaging to reconnect with working-class voters.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the long history of Black resistance against racial fascism in America provides essential lessons for confronting today's authoritarian threats. Drawing on Toni Morrison's analysis, the author posits that fascism is not new to the U.S. but is deeply rooted in its history of racism. The article suggests that the Black community's enduring belief in democratic ideals, diverse methods of resistance, and sustaining faith offer a powerful model for all Americans. It calls for a broad-based fight against injustice, inspired by the historical struggles that have consistently pushed the nation closer to its founding principles.</p>
