          <p>Bryan Kohberger, who was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being relentlessly taunted by other inmates. According to a report, inmates are yelling at him through cell vents, leading Kohberger to complain to prison guards about the harassment. Prison experts suggest that complaining could worsen his situation by labeling him a "rat" and that the loss of control could be mentally taxing for him. The article notes the high-profile nature of his crimes makes him a target within the maximum-security facility.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is warning consumers that sunscreen products in mousse form may not provide effective protection against harmful UV rays. The agency issued warning letters to five companies, including popular brands Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., stating their products are unapproved over-the-counter drugs. Additionally, the FDA highlighted a safety risk, noting that the packaging of some products resembles whipped cream canisters, which could lead to accidental ingestion. The companies have been given 15 days to address the violations identified by the agency.</p>

          <p>Texas House Democrats, who left the state to break quorum and block a special session focused on redistricting, are now discussing their return. They consider their actions a success for having nearly derailed the session and a Republican-led effort to pass new congressional maps. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has stated a second special session will commence with the same agenda. The political standoff has drawn criticism from Republicans, who accuse Democrats of dereliction of duty, while Democrats maintain they are fighting against partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani has widened his lead in the New York City mayoral race, positioning him ahead of established figures like former Governor Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams. The Siena poll shows Mamdani with a significant 19-point lead over Cuomo, his closest competitor. As the frontrunner, Mamdani is facing increased scrutiny, particularly regarding his residency in a rent-stabilized apartment, which opponents are using to challenge his credibility on housing affordability. In response, his campaign is focusing on broader Democratic concerns, framing the election as a stand against President Trump.</p>

          <p>The legal conflict between Priscilla Presley and her former business partner, Brigitte Kruse, has escalated with a new $50 million lawsuit filed by Kruse. The suit alleges fraud and breach of contract, claiming Presley undermined their joint ventures and exploited her daughter Lisa Marie Presley's death to gain control of her trust. Kruse and her associate assert they invested millions to revitalize Presley's brand, only to be betrayed. This lawsuit is a countersuit to one Presley filed last year, in which she accused Kruse of fraud and elder abuse, claims Kruse has denied.</p>

          <p>President Trump downplayed the significance of a reported Russian-led cyberattack on the U.S. federal courts' electronic document system. When asked about the breach, he responded, "Are you surprised?" and commented that hacking is something Russia is skilled at, adding that the U.S. is "actually better at it." The breach, revealed just days before his scheduled meeting with Vladimir Putin, reportedly compromised sealed records. Trump indicated that he might bring up the issue during their discussion but did not commit to making it a central point of the conversation.</p>

          <p>Walmart has expanded its employee discount program to include 10% off nearly all grocery items, such as milk and meat, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. This move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about higher consumer prices, and it extends a benefit previously limited to produce and seasonal food items. The expanded discount, one of the most requested benefits by employees, aims to provide financial relief to its workforce. The initiative could also boost Walmart's sales by encouraging employees to shop in-house and serve as a tool for worker retention.</p>

          <p>Researchers predict that global reindeer populations could decline substantially by the end of the century as a direct result of climate change. A new study highlights that the North American population, also known as caribou, is at the highest risk and could see its numbers plummet by up to 80% by 2100. The research, which analyzed 21,000 years of data, found that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses a more severe threat. This decline could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and accelerated carbon release from Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service for fresh groceries, including meat, produce, and eggs, to more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The move aims to encourage more customers to use Amazon for their regular grocery shopping, with plans to reach over 2,300 locations by year's end. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25 and is part of Amazon's broader strategy to overhaul its grocery business. The announcement led to a notable drop in the stock prices of competitors like Instacart, Kroger, and Walmart.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced record-breaking container volumes in July, a direct consequence of companies rushing to import goods from China to get ahead of tariff deadlines. Shippers front-loaded their cargo, leading to the busiest month in the port's 117-year history, with import levels reaching an all-time high. However, this early peak has led to a subsequent slowdown, with freight rates from Shanghai dropping significantly since June. The data illustrates the tangible impact of trade policy on supply chains, as importers, particularly in the retail sector, adjust their strategies to mitigate the financial effects of tariffs.</p>

Companies like Microsoft, PayPal, and UPS have reported using AI for functions such as customer service, logistics, and software development, leading to significant savings and a reduced reliance on human workers. While some executives frame AI as a supplement to human roles, data suggests a negative impact on employment growth in AI-exposed industries.

          <p>Nearly one in five student loan borrowers aged 50 and older are now seriously delinquent on their payments, a sharp increase from pre-pandemic levels. This trend coincides with the Trump administration's resumption of collection activities after a nearly five-year pause. Older Americans often face this debt from borrowing for their children's education or returning to school later in life. While the Department of Education has temporarily halted the garnishment of Social Security benefits for defaulted loans, experts warn that other collection actions, like wage garnishment, are expected to resume soon.

This forecast prompted a social media post from Trump suggesting the bank's CEO should get a new economist.

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to cut billions of dollars in foreign aid. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the nonprofit organizations who sued the administration did not have the legal standing to bring the case under the Impoundment Control Act. This decision sidestepped the core constitutional question of whether the executive branch can withhold funds already appropriated by Congress. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration in its efforts to redirect foreign aid funding toward its own priorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's federal takeover of the Washington D.C. police force is a tactic reminiscent of historical fascism, creating a sense of crisis to justify an expansion of power. The author contends that Trump is manufacturing a narrative of extreme danger in D.C., despite official data showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low. This move is presented as a pretext for potentially extending federal control over police in other major cities, regardless of actual crime statistics.
