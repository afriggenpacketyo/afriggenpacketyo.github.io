          <p>A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, both 70. The couple was found dead in their Los Angeles home during a welfare check, having suffered gunshot wounds to the head. Police believe the murders occurred during a burglary on July 10 when the victims returned home and a struggle ensued. Kaye had been a respected member of the "American Idol" production team since 2009, and the show's spokesperson released a statement expressing devastation over the tragic loss.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported the lowest number of border encounters ever recorded for the month of June, with just 25,228 nationwide. The southern border saw only 6,072 apprehensions, a figure 15% lower than the previous record low in March. The Trump administration is crediting its stringent enforcement policies for the dramatic decline, which officials are calling the "Trump effect." Alongside the drop in crossings, the agency noted a significant increase in the seizure of drugs like methamphetamine and heroin, highlighting a multi-faceted approach to border security and enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard troops from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after they were deployed by President Trump to address protests. The deployment, which was made over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, was intended to protect federal immigration agents and property. Newsom criticized the move as making the Guard "political pawns" and has called for the remaining federalized troops to be returned to state control. The administration maintained the deployment was necessary to quell disorder, leading to a legal battle over presidential authority.</p>

          <p>TV chef Si King, of the Hairy Bikers, has returned to the site of the Sycamore Gap tree for the first time since it was illegally felled in September 2023. King, who described the act as murdering a "sentinel of time," had avoided the location due to his anger and grief. The visit was part of a BBC documentary, where he observed the green shoots now growing from the stump and reflected on the personal significance of the landmark. He shared that he would have visited the tree to mourn his late partner, Dave Myers, had it still been standing.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Michael Bernard Bell, 54, for the 1993 murders of two people outside a bar. This marks the 26th execution in the United States in 2025, surpassing the total for all of 2024 and making it the highest number since 2018. Bell was convicted of fatally shooting Jimmy West and Tamecka Smith in what authorities described as an attempted revenge killing where he targeted the wrong individuals. Florida has been the most active state in carrying out executions this year, accounting for eight of the nation's total, reflecting a notable increase in its use of capital punishment.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed as "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be diagnosing patients. This follows growing concerns over the roles' responsibilities and several high-profile cases where patients suffered harm after being treated by PAs they believed were qualified doctors. The recommendations aim to clarify their scope of practice within healthcare teams.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at addressing border security and providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants. The legislation would create a seven-year "Dignity Program" for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, requiring them to pass background checks and pay restitution. This legislative effort comes amid the Trump administration's mass deportation program and growing protests against ICE raids.

The historic Victorian glasshouse, which houses a tropical rainforest, requires major repairs due to rusting ironwork caused by its hot, humid internal climate. The project involves moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass with more insulated material, and upgrading the heating system to achieve net-zero emissions.

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has seen a notable increase in officer-involved shootings, with 25 incidents recorded so far this year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. These shootings have resulted in 21 people being struck and nine killed, the highest mid-year total since 2018. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell attributed the rise in part to more encounters with armed or seemingly armed suspects, including those with replica weapons. The trend is occurring even as overall violent crime and homicide rates in the city are declining, prompting concern from police oversight officials.</p>

          <p>During an energy summit in Pittsburgh, Westinghouse interim CEO Dan Sumner told President Trump that the company plans to build 10 of its large AP1000 nuclear reactors across the United States. Construction is slated to begin by 2030, with the project expected to generate $75 billion in economic value nationwide. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, representing a massive expansion of U.S. nuclear capacity. The announcement aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders aimed at quadrupling the nation's nuclear power output by the year 2050. (not investment advice)</p>

Amid intense criticism from some Trump supporters over a Justice Department memo that found no evidence of an Epstein "client list," Bondi pivoted to discussing the war on drugs and human trafficking. Despite calls for her resignation from some corners of the MAGA movement, President Trump has publicly stated she has handled the matter well. The controversy continues to simmer as key allies like Speaker Mike Johnson call for more transparency.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is undermining the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) ability to respond to disasters, citing recent struggles with Texas floods and delayed aid to California. While Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has spoken of redeploying FEMA, critics point to budget cuts, the cancellation of infrastructure grant programs, and the gutting of climate research as evidence of a broader dismantling of federal disaster preparedness. The article contends that these actions are creating a more vulnerable nation by shifting burdens to states without providing adequate resources or support.</p>

          <p>The White House is marking a significant policy shift toward Russia by working with NATO allies to send more advanced weaponry, including 17 Patriot missile systems, to Ukraine. This move follows President Trump's increased frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to negotiate an end to the war. Under the new arrangement, NATO countries will provide the systems to Ukraine and then purchase replacements from the U.S. The Pentagon has also resumed shipments of previously paused munitions, including Patriot and Hellfire missiles, signaling a stronger, more coordinated effort to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been found to have inadvertently breached parliamentary rules by failing to declare gifts within the required 28-day period. The standards commissioner investigated after Reeves herself reported that she had not properly registered complimentary theatre tickets on the register for Members of Parliament, initially only listing them on the ministerial register. While the commissioner noted the breach, he concluded it was inadvertent and is closing the inquiry. Reeves apologized for the oversight, which she attributed to ambiguity over her dual capacity as a minister and MP, and has since updated her office's procedures.</p>

Ahead of a China-EU summit, Brussels is taking a firm stance, with leaders like Ursula von der Leyen stating they "cannot accept" China's role. However, the author suggests this approach is unlikely to change Beijing's position on Moscow and may hinder the EU's efforts to de-risk its supply chains and address its trade deficit with China.

The administration had planned to terminate the program, which provides deportation relief and work permits, arguing Afghanistan's security situation has improved. However, immigrant advocacy groups sued, contending the country remains unsafe and the decision was part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda.
