          <h2>UK Universities Face Scrutiny Over Adequacy of Student Mental Health Support</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:24:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Students are increasingly reporting that UK universities are failing to provide adequate mental health support, describing services as "one-size-fits-all" and difficult to navigate. While the number of students with mental health conditions has nearly quadrupled in a decade, institutions argue they are not replacements for clinical NHS services and face resource constraints. The debate intensifies over whether universities have a formal duty of care, as academics often feel untrained to handle crises and some argue students should be taught more resilience. This growing crisis highlights systemic challenges in funding, responsibility, and the collaboration between higher education and national health services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant departure from presidential norms, Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Federal Reserve, a move seen as escalating his public pressure campaign against Chairman Jerome Powell. Presidents have historically respected the central bank's independence, but Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates and has even suggested he might fire him. This direct visit to the Fed's headquarters is a highly symbolic act that challenges the institution's insulation from political influence. Powell has maintained that his firing is not legally permissible, setting the stage for a potential confrontation over the central bank's autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:14:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-running animated series "South Park" is moving from HBO Max to Paramount+ after creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone finalized a new five-year, $1.5 billion deal. This agreement will bring all previous seasons and 50 new episodes to the Paramount+ streaming service, following a competitive bidding war among major platforms. The move comes as Paramount faces criticism for cancelling "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," a decision the company states was purely financial. The deal ensures new "South Park" episodes will first air on Comedy Central before becoming available for streaming.</p>

          <p>Thai and Cambodian soldiers engaged in an armed clash in a disputed border region near the Prasat Ta Muen Thom temple, marking a significant escalation in tensions. Both nations have accused each other of initiating the conflict. The clash follows Cambodia's decision to downgrade diplomatic relations after Thailand closed border crossings in protest of a landmine blast that injured five Thai soldiers. This incident is part of a long-standing series of border disputes, inflamed by nationalist sentiments, with the most prominent conflicts historically centered around the Preah Vihear temple.</p>

          <p>Amid a nationwide housing crisis, states like Utah are increasingly passing laws to override local zoning rules and compel cities to build more affordable housing. With median home prices soaring, homeownership is becoming unattainable for a growing portion of the population, including middle-class families. These state-level interventions aim to increase housing density by allowing duplexes, smaller homes, and apartments, but they often face strong local opposition from residents and officials concerned about overcrowding and loss of local control. The trend highlights a fundamental tension between state-level economic goals and the "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard) sentiment prevalent in many communities.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, entertained fans but also highlighted growing questions about its purpose and format. The event's relevance was underscored by the conspicuous absence of the league's biggest star, Lionel Messi, who skipped the festivities, potentially facing a suspension for his next club match. While the game serves as a mid-season business and cultural fixture for the league, Messi's no-show suggests top players may prioritize competitive matches over exhibitions. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the need to rethink the event to maintain player engagement and boost viewership.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, affirming a lower court's decision. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the policy, which aimed to deny citizenship to many individuals born on U.S. soil, a principle enshrined in the 14th Amendment. The order, signed shortly after Trump took office, has faced numerous legal challenges and injunctions nationwide. This ruling marks another significant legal defeat for the administration's effort to repeal a long-standing constitutional right, pushing the contentious issue further along the path to the Supreme Court.</p>

Osbourne, along with his bandmates, is credited with inventing the heavy metal genre in the late 1960s as a reaction against "hippy-dippy" music, creating a darker, heavier sound. The band's signature style was defined by Tony Iommi's detuned, powerful guitar riffs—a sound born from a factory accident that cost him his fingertips—and Osbourne's wailing, aggressive vocals. Despite controversy and a life of legendary excess, Osbourne became one of rock's most influential and enduring figures, with Black Sabbath's music leaving an indelible mark on generations of musicians.</p>

Troy E. Nehls, argue it is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, costing an estimated $1.35 billion. However, some conservationists and scientists warn that without the removal of the more aggressive barred owls, the spotted owl faces certain extinction.</p>

          <h2>Studies Warn Many At-Home Health Test Kits Are Inaccurate and Lack Proper Guidance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new studies published in the British Medical Journal have raised serious concerns about the accuracy and reliability of many commercially available at-home health test kits. Researchers who analyzed 30 kits for conditions like bowel cancer and vitamin deficiencies found that many lacked clear information on accuracy, user instructions, and next steps after a result. The studies warn that misleading results could lead to either false reassurance or unnecessary anxiety, potentially placing an additional burden on the NHS. In response, the UK's medical device regulator, the MHRA, has stated it is overhauling safety standards for the growing self-test market.</p>

          <p>USC's star basketball freshman, Alijah Arenas, is expected to be sidelined for at least six to eight months after suffering a serious knee injury requiring surgery. An MRI revealed a slight meniscus tear and a bone bruise, dealing a major blow to the Trojans' upcoming season and raising questions about the top prospect's future with the team. Arenas, who reclassified to graduate high school a year early, was anticipated to play a major role for USC. At best, he might return late in the season, but his status as a potential top draft pick could influence decisions about his return to the court.</p>

          <p>A coalition of Los Angeles business leaders has initiated a ballot measure to completely repeal the city's gross receipts tax, a move they claim will improve the "anti-job climate" at City Hall. Proponents argue that eliminating the tax, which is levied on a company's revenue rather than its profits, would provide relief to businesses and stimulate the local economy. However, city officials are sounding the alarm, warning that the repeal would blow an $800 million hole in the annual budget. This loss of revenue would directly threaten funding for essential public services like police and fire departments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, beating expectations and allowing the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. While domestic consumption also saw a modest turnaround, economists remain cautious, suggesting the pace of growth is unlikely to last. The ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. remain a significant source of uncertainty for the export-reliant economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence, including one that targets what the White House calls "woke" AI. The order requires federal funding recipients to ensure their AI models are politically neutral and free from "ideological dogmas such as DEI." Other orders seek to fast-track the permitting process for energy-intensive data centers and promote the export of American AI technology. The move is part of a broader administration plan to remove regulatory "red tape" but has been criticized as an ideological campaign that echoes long-standing conservative grievances against tech companies for perceived liberal bias.</p>

While not explicitly targeting Beijing, the move is seen as part of a broader U.S. effort to contain China's economic power. However, some experts note that Chinese firms are already ahead, increasingly localizing their production within these countries. (not investment advice)</p>

The vegetation fire, located near the 71 Freeway and Euclid Avenue, quickly grew to 120 acres, forcing the temporary closure of the freeway in both directions as the blaze jumped across it. By early evening, firefighters successfully stopped the fire's forward rate of spread and established a dozer line to clear vegetation. The freeway has since reopened, and crews achieved 5% containment, with mop-up operations continuing through the night.</p>

Over 70% of teens have used AI companions, with many finding the interactions as or more satisfying than talking to human friends because the AI is always available and non-judgmental. Researchers and psychologists are concerned that this reliance on AI could hinder the development of crucial real-world social skills, critical thinking, and emotional resilience. The largely unregulated AI industry is becoming deeply integrated into adolescence, raising fears about its long-term impact on relationships and mental health.</p>

          <p>In the first six months of the second Trump presidency, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is on track to carry out the most deportations in a single year since 2014. Internal figures show nearly 150,000 deportations, projecting an annual total over 300,000 if the pace continues. This reflects the administration's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration, which includes reversing previous enforcement limits and expanding deportation categories.
