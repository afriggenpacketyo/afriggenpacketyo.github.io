          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to declare President Trump's proclamation barring foreign students from enrolling at the university as unlawful and to prevent it from taking effect. The university argues that the proclamation violates the First Amendment and misuses the Immigration and Nationality Act, asserting that Trump's actions are a retaliatory measure against Harvard for exercising its First Amendment rights. Trump's proclamation claims Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international students, citing concerns about information sharing, foreign entanglements, and discriminatory admissions practices, escalating the ongoing feud between the Trump administration and the university. A federal judge had previously blocked a similar plan to revoke Harvard's ability to enroll international students. </p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the attack on a march for Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, has been formally charged with 118 state criminal charges, including 28 counts of attempted murder.

Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty praised investigators and the community, emphasizing the importance of working relationships during times of crisis, and Soliman also faces federal hate crime charges in a separate federal court case. Three victims remain hospitalized as of Thursday, and Soliman is due back in court on July 15.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is alerting social media users about fraudulent advertisements offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. These deceptive ads request personal information and payments through unofficial channels like Cash App, which the DMV never uses. The DMV advises residents to renew their vehicle registration only through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office. State law prohibits the DMV from offering discounted vehicle registration renewals, and the safest way to renew is directly through the official DMV website.</p>

The Department of Justice's investigation will be separate from the LAPD's, and state prosecutors will decide whether to bring criminal charges, releasing a report if no charges are filed.</p>

          <p>Shari Redstone, chairwoman and controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer and is undergoing treatment while continuing her professional and philanthropic activities. The news comes as Redstone navigates a turbulent sales process for Paramount, including a government review of the Skydance Media sale complicated by President Trump's lawsuit against Paramount and CBS. Redstone told the New York Times that she had surgery to remove her thyroid gland, but the cancer had spread to her vocal cords and she continues to receive radiation treatment. The Redstone family controls 77% of the voting shares of Paramount, and the company faces pressures from consumers' shift to streaming, impacting revenue from cable channels.</p>

"Ballerina" offers entertainment through impressive fight choreography, while "Dangerous Animals" generates unease with its suspenseful atmosphere, and "The Ritual" may appeal to those fascinated by exorcism themes, despite its shortcomings. The reviewer notes the summer season approaches as studios release their most commercially viable creations.</p>

          <p>Handwritten notes have revealed Winston Churchill's concern and frustration over the slow progress of securing penicillin supplies in time for D-Day. Despite penicillin being a British discovery by Professor Alexander Fleming in 1928, the UK lagged behind the US in large-scale production, and Churchill expressed disappointment that Britain couldn't produce more. Early in 1944, he complained to his ministers about Britain's inability to produce penicillin at scale, and shortly before D-Day, health officials reported that sufficient supplies had been obtained, mostly from the US, but only for battle casualties. The first true antibiotic would not be fully available to the general public until 1946.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government in England is set to mandate that most new build homes must be fitted with solar panels under changes to be published this year. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this move is "just common sense" and will save the typical household £500 a year on their energy bills. The regulations will require developers to add panels unless the buildings fall under certain exemptions such as being covered by shade, and the government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against introducing burdensome paperwork that could hinder efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>

The company's fiscal 2025 second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings exceeded expectations, with significant growth in AI semiconductor revenue, particularly from custom AI accelerators and networking solutions. CEO Hock Tan anticipates robust AI revenue growth to continue into fiscal 2026, supported by strong demand from existing customers like Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and ByteDance, and the company is raising its price target on the stock to $290 a share from $230. Broadcom's shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy, including dividends and buybacks, also contributes to its positive outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced sanctions on four judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) for "illegitimate" targeting of Israel and the US, requiring their property and interests in the US to be blocked. The sanctions are in response to the ICC issuing arrest warrants for top Israeli officials, including Benjamin Netanyahu, and its investigation into alleged US war crimes in Afghanistan. Rubio accused the judges of "illegitimate and baseless actions" and described the ICC as "politicized," and the ICC responded by saying it "stands fully behind its personnel" and will continue its work "undeterred". Last year, it issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel's former defence minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p>
