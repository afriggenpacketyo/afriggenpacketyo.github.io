            <p>A 17-year-old in Wisconsin, Nikita Casap, has been charged with multiple felonies, including first-degree intentional homicide, in connection with the deaths of his mother and stepfather, whose bodies were discovered in their home in a state of advanced decomposition. Prosecutors allege that Casap confessed to fantasizing about killing his parents and planning to flee to Ukraine, even seeking advice from a Russian contact on living a normal life after the crime. Surveillance footage reportedly showed Casap tending to the body of his stepfather, further implicating him in the crime, and he was apprehended in Kansas after a multi-state pursuit in his parents' SUV. This case has garnered national attention due to the disturbing nature of the alleged crime and the teen's elaborate plans to evade capture.</p>

            <p>Dive teams are continuing their search in the Hudson River for remaining pieces of the helicopter that crashed, killing all six people on board. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is leading the investigation, hoping to recover key components like the main rotor and tail boom to determine the cause of the crash. While the helicopter lacked flight recorders, investigators are exploring theories of mechanical failure, bird strikes, or drone interference. The victims included a Siemens executive, his family, and the pilot, and the crash has prompted calls for increased FAA oversight of sightseeing helicopters in New York City.</p>

            <p>A Louisiana detective, Lt. Barry Ward, has reopened the 1987 cold case of Selonia Reed's murder, focusing on new DNA evidence and inconsistencies in the original investigation. Selonia was found stabbed and sexually assaulted in her car, and the initial investigation had several leads, including Selonia's husband, Reginald Reed Sr., and his friend, Jimmy Ray Barnes. The case remained unsolved for decades, but Ward's renewed efforts led to the indictment of both Reginald Reed Sr. and Jimmy Ray Barnes. Reginald Reed Sr. was ultimately found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, though he maintains his innocence.</p>

            <p>Amazon is considering expanding its healthcare ambitions by leveraging its logistics network to provide emergency medical assistance. In 2023, Amazon piloted "Project Pulse," equipping delivery vans with defibrillators and training drivers in CPR, with positive results in London, Amsterdam, and Bologna. While the project is currently under evaluation, it could represent a significant expansion of Amazon's healthcare footprint, particularly as competitors like Walgreens and Walmart scale back their primary care services. This initiative could enhance Amazon's public image and potentially reshape healthcare delivery by bringing assistance directly to customers' doorsteps.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. This decision follows concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases on gadgets manufactured in China.

The White House stated that the exemptions are intended to allow companies more time to relocate production to the United States, although these electronic goods remain subject to the 20% tariff on China related to fentanyl.</p>

            <p>US TV institution Saturday Night Live has entertained viewers and created comedy stars for 50 years. Now, the stateside staple is to come live from London after Sky announced plans for a "star-studded" UK spin-off, fronted by British comedic talent, to launch next year. Overseen by the US original show's creator Lorne Michaels, now 80, the broadcaster is promising the same "live, fast-paced style" as its American cousin. The launch has been met with a mixture of excitement and skepticism, with some questioning whether the show's format and humor will translate well to a British audience.</p>

            <p>The UK government's decision to take control of British Steel and rush emergency legislation through Parliament is viewed as a temporary measure to prevent the plant's immediate closure. The long-term future of the company, however, remains uncertain, with nationalization looking increasingly likely. The government's intervention aims to secure the necessary raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running, but the complexities of international supply chains and ongoing trade disputes pose significant challenges.
