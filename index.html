        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly blocked Taiwan's president from making a stopover in New York City, a decision believed to be influenced by pressure from Beijing. While Taiwan's presidential office stated there were no current overseas travel plans, the move drew sharp criticism from bipartisan figures who expressed concern that it signals a weakening of U.S. support for Taiwan. A State Department source reiterated the administration's commitment to the long-standing "one China" policy, but critics worry this action makes American leadership appear unreliable and subject to negotiation with China.</p>

          <p>A stone carving discovered near Zhaling Lake in China is being hailed as a significant archaeological find from the era of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China. According to a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, it is the only known stone carving from that period that remains at its original site. The inscription details a journey to a mountain, which scholars believe may be connected to the emperor's legendary and obsessive quest to find an elixir of immortality, offering a rare glimpse into ancient Chinese history.</p>

          <p>In rural Georgia, recent federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are threatening to overwhelm local food banks and worsen child hunger. Hancock County, which already has the highest rate of child food insecurity in the nation, relies heavily on organizations like Golden Harvest food bank to supplement meager benefits. With billions projected to be cut from SNAP over the next decade, these essential community resources are bracing for a surge in demand, leaving many vulnerable families facing even greater uncertainty in accessing adequate nutrition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has lodged a formal misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg, escalating a conflict between the Trump administration and the judiciary. The complaint accuses the judge of making improper public comments critical of President Trump and of mishandling a case involving the deportation of Venezuelan men. It specifically cites Boasberg's warnings of a potential "constitutional crisis" and alleges he rushed the government in legal proceedings, highlighting the deepening tensions between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <p>President Trump has significantly shortened his deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, reducing it from 50 days to just 10 or 12, citing a lack of progress and expressing disappointment in Vladimir Putin's actions. During the same visit to Scotland, Trump also announced a major trade agreement with the European Union. The deal avoids a threatened 30% tariff, instead imposing a 15% duty on most EU goods while securing commitments for Europe to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Some economists are describing the new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union as unbalanced and significantly more favorable to American interests. The deal imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most goods imported from the EU, while American exports to the 27-nation bloc will face no tariffs, a disparity that is projected to negatively impact the EU's GDP. Despite the asymmetry, European leaders likely viewed the deal as a better alternative to an escalating trade war and the 30% tariff President Trump had threatened. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is closely examining the legality of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, particularly the use of "roving patrols" by ICE agents in Southern California. During a hearing, judges on the 9th Circuit panel intensely questioned the government's lawyer about the constitutionality of sweeps that critics say rely on racial profiling rather than reasonable suspicion. The case challenges a lower court's injunction that blocked these operations, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court showdown over 4th Amendment protections.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been convicted of witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time an ex-president in the country has been found guilty in a criminal court. The Bogota court determined that Uribe, who led the nation from 2002 to 2010, attempted to illegally influence a witness in a separate investigation into his alleged connections to right-wing paramilitary groups. The highly politicized verdict carries a potential prison sentence of up to 12 years and represents a pivotal moment in Colombia's efforts to reckon with its violent past.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential trade war just days before a deadline threatened by President Trump. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on many EU imports, a rate lower than the 30% initially proposed, and includes a European commitment to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy. While this agreement provides some stability, the administration still faces outstanding negotiations with other major partners, including China and Mexico, and the overall legality of the tariff strategy remains under challenge in federal court.</p>

          <p>St. Agatha Catholic School in Portland, Oregon, is at the center of a controversy after it rescinded the enrollment of a child whose parents are a same-sex couple, just weeks before the school year was set to begin.

The action has triggered significant backlash from the community and raises broader questions about discrimination and the policies of religious institutions regarding LGBTQ+ families, with many calling for a reversal of the decision.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic analyzes how President Trump's policy positions and public statements are profoundly shaped by what he consumes on television. Using his recent comments on starvation in Gaza—where he concluded the images were real because "you can't fake that"—the piece argues that Trump often bypasses official intelligence in favor of media narratives. This reliance on television, especially Fox News, makes him highly susceptible to manipulation and narrows his understanding of complex issues, with significant consequences for both domestic and foreign policy.</p>

Legal experts argue that while the verdict did not create new legal precedent, it served as a powerful reminder to media outlets that even for public figures, there are limits to newsworthiness, and publishing graphic, private material can lead to severe consequences.</p>
