          <p>The FBI is actively searching for Donald Henson, a Pennsylvania man who allegedly committed an "act of terror" by intentionally driving his car at high speed into the main gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh office. After the crash, Henson reportedly exited the vehicle, placed an American flag on the damaged gate, and fled the scene on foot. Authorities noted that vulgarities and a reference to suicide were scrawled on the car. Officials believe Henson, a former military member who had recently made a complaint at the office, may be dangerous and could be experiencing a mental health issue.</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, a co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company, stating that its parent corporation, Unilever, has eroded the ice cream brand's independence to engage in social activism. This decision follows a 2022 dispute where the company unsuccessfully tried to prevent Unilever from selling its products in West Bank settlements, an action Ben & Jerry's felt contradicted its core values. Greenfield expressed profound disappointment, asserting that the brand known for its progressive stances has been silenced for fear of challenging those in power. Unilever's subsidiary, Magnum Ice Cream Company, which now owns the brand, disagreed with Greenfield's perspective but affirmed its commitment to the company's mission.</p>

          <p>Oliver Steadman, a 28-year-old former Labour councillor, has been formally charged with blackmail and communications offenses in connection with the Westminster "honeytrap" scandal. The case involves a series of unsolicited, flirtatious WhatsApp messages sent to men working in politics, which in some instances led to the exchange of explicit images. Steadman is accused of making unwarranted demands for the phone numbers of up to 12 individuals and sending unsolicited indecent images to five victims. He was suspended from the Labour party following his arrest and subsequently resigned from his council position in Islington, London.</p>

          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino remains optimistic about the Kansas City Chiefs' prospects despite their 0-2 start to the 2025 season, their worst since 2014. Marino attributes his confidence primarily to quarterback Patrick Mahomes, whom he considers the best in the league and a strong leader capable of rallying the team. He acknowledged that injuries to key offensive players and a suspension have contributed to their early struggles but believes the team can overcome this adversity. The Chiefs have historically defied slim playoff odds, and Marino feels they will find a way to score points and get back on track.</p>

          <p>Executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, a company that owns dozens of strip clubs, have been indicted on charges of bribing a New York state tax auditor to avoid paying over $8 million in sales taxes. The indictment alleges that over a decade, the auditor received complimentary trips, meals, and up to $5,000 per day for private dances at the company's clubs in exchange for favorable audit outcomes. New York Attorney General Letitia James stated the executives shamelessly used their clubs to evade their tax obligations. RCI Hospitality and five of its executives face a 79-count indictment including conspiracy, bribery, and tax fraud.</p>

          <p>Germany offers a range of social benefits that are attractive to foreigners, particularly when compared to the United States. Public universities in the country are generally tuition-free for both domestic and international students, requiring only a small semester fee for administrative costs. The nation also mandates health insurance, with costs shared between employer and employee, and provides a legal minimum of 20 paid vacation days per year, plus public holidays. These policies stand in contrast to the U.S. system, where high tuition fees are common and there are no national requirements for paid leave.</p>

This declaration is seen as a noteworthy change, running counter to China's prevailing assessment of U.S. intentions.

At DHS, for example, agents who once focused on trafficking cases have been redirected to immigration enforcement and deportations.

Economists suggest that government policies, including increases in the minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions, are being passed on to consumers by businesses, contributing to the rising costs.

          <p>Thomas Partey, a former midfielder for Arsenal, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges of sexual assault involving three different women. The Ghanaian international denied five counts of sexual assault against two women and an additional charge of sexual assault against a third woman during an appearance at Southwark Crown Court. The alleged offenses occurred between 2021 and 2022 while he was playing in the Premier League. Partey, who now plays for Villareal in Spain, was granted bail until his trial, which is scheduled to begin in November of the following year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts predict a significant shift in how Chinese companies raise offshore capital, with a growing preference for yuan-denominated bonds over U.S. dollar bonds. This trend is driven by persistently high U.S. interest rates, which make dollar-based borrowing expensive, compared to the relatively cheaper funding available in the offshore yuan market. The issuance of these "dim sum bonds" in Hong Kong is on track for a record year. This move aligns with Beijing's broader goals of internationalizing the yuan and supports the increasing number of Chinese firms expanding their operations globally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's affinity for the British royal family, influenced by his Scottish mother's admiration for their pageantry, has been a consistent theme throughout his life and political career. This fascination is evident in his upcoming second state visit to the UK, an honor no other U.S. president has received. Observers note that Trump has long sought the status and legitimacy associated with royalty, from reportedly offering Prince Charles a club membership to his public comments about Princess Diana. His engagement with the monarchy is seen as a way to achieve a sense of ultimate acceptance and to generate the high-profile media attention he craves.</p>

Despite his release, he remains under investigation for McCann's disappearance, though he has never been charged in the case and denies any involvement.

          <p>A new archaeological study suggests that hunter-gatherer societies in southern China and Southeast Asia were practicing mummification as early as 12,000 years ago. This timeline significantly predates the earliest known examples from ancient Egypt and Chile's Chinchorro culture. Researchers from several international institutions analyzed 54 pre-Neolithic burials and found evidence that many bodies had been intentionally smoke-dried over long periods, often in a tightly bound, crouched position. This discovery challenges previous understandings of the origins of complex mortuary practices and indicates a sophisticated cultural tradition among these ancient peoples.</p>

          <p>As millions of Americans face significant premium increases for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans, the Trump administration is promoting less comprehensive, high-deductible "catastrophic" health plans. The administration has expanded eligibility for these plans, which feature lower monthly premiums but require consumers to pay over $10,000 in deductibles before most coverage begins. This policy shift comes as enhanced COVID-era subsidies that made ACA plans more affordable are set to expire at the end of the year. While a bipartisan group of lawmakers is trying to extend the subsidies, the administration is pushing catastrophic plans as an alternative for those who may lose their financial assistance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term is characterized by a systematic effort to expand presidential authority and weaken the checks and balances designed to limit it. A key example is the firing of Cathy Harris, a member of the independent Merit Systems Protection Board, an act currently being challenged in court but provisionally allowed by the Supreme Court. The administration argues that the president should have the authority to remove any executive branch officer at will, a departure from over a century of civil service protections. This approach has also been applied to inspectors general and heads of other independent agencies, raising concerns about a return to a political spoils system.</p>

Researchers note a significant surge in gun-related incidents on K-12 school properties since the pandemic, often stemming from escalated disputes. Additionally, politically motivated violence has been rising, with data showing an increase in threats against public officials over the past decade.</p>
