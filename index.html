          <p>The U.S. Senate has entered a "vote-a-rama," a rapid series of amendment votes on a significant Republican tax and spending bill. The legislation, a key part of President Trump's second-term agenda, proposes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. With a slim majority, Republican leadership faces a challenge uniting their party to pass the bill before a self-imposed July 4th deadline, especially as the Congressional Budget Office projects it will add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade. The process highlights deep partisan divides and internal GOP tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

This comes amidst ongoing political tensions with China, which views him as a separatist and may attempt to name its own successor.

The models range from lightweight versions to a powerful 424 billion parameter model, with Baidu claiming its 300B model outperforms a key competitor.

Many of these popular retirement destinations, like The Villages in Florida and Sun City West in Arizona, are in warm, low-tax states but still demand significant nest eggs, with some estimates exceeding $3 million. The report calculates the necessary savings to cover 25 years of expenses, adjusted for local costs of living.

          <p>Google has made its first commercial commitment to fusion energy, announcing a partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a company spun off from MIT. The tech giant plans to purchase 200 megawatts of clean power from CFS's forthcoming grid-scale fusion plant, ARC, which is expected to be operational in the early 2030s. This agreement is a significant bet on the future of fusion, a process that aims to generate zero-carbon electricity by replicating the reactions that power the sun.

However, economists caution that persistent service inflation and volatile external factors, such as energy prices and geopolitical events, could still disrupt this progress.

Analysts note that Beijing's primary fear is a strategic disengagement by its trade partners, prompted by U.S. policy.

          <p>Prominent Wall Street strategist Tom Lee has been appointed chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, with the goal of transforming the company into a major publicly traded holder of ether (ETH). The bitcoin miner announced a $250 million private placement to fund an ether acquisition strategy, making ETH its primary treasury reserve asset. Lee stated that the growth of stablecoins, which predominantly transact on the Ethereum blockchain, should drive up the value of ETH. This move signals a growing trend of companies looking beyond bitcoin for their crypto treasury strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder James Wood made baseball history by being intentionally walked four times in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels. This rare occurrence has not been seen in Major League Baseball since Barry Bonds was given the same treatment in 2004. The strategy highlights the immense respect opposing pitchers have for Wood's power, as he already has 22 home runs this season. Despite the walks, Wood managed a hit and a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings, showcasing his impact even when denied a chance to swing.</p>

While acknowledging the region's political turmoil, often fueled by U.S. intervention, the book argues that Latin America's historical focus on "the common good" provides a powerful model for strengthening democracy in an era of rising authoritarianism.</p>

While having great-grandparents provides families with a valuable connection to history and a sense of lineage, it places immense strain on the middle generations.

However, over time, public opinion has shifted, and many now appreciate their unique character, historical significance, and the bold ambition they represent. This evolution in taste demonstrates how perceptions of architectural beauty can change, turning once-maligned landmarks into cherished parts of a city's identity.</p>
