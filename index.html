            <p>Manchester United's manager, Ruben Amorim, plans to utilize young players to navigate the remainder of the Premier League season, prioritizing rest for senior players ahead of European competitions. With United struggling in 14th place in the Premier League, Amorim aims to give opportunities to players like Chido Obi, Harry Amass, and others. Bruno Fernandes and Diogo Dalot are reportedly suffering from fatigue, prompting the need for fresh legs. Amorim acknowledges that while it's not the ideal time to introduce young players, necessity dictates their involvement and potential for surprising performances.</p>

            <p>A man has died while attempting to cross the English Channel, according to Kent Police. The RNLI and Border Force responded to a medical emergency on a small boat, but the man was pronounced dead. This incident underscores the increasing dangers faced by migrants attempting to reach the UK by sea, with over 9,000 people having made the crossing so far this year, a significant increase compared to previous years. The Home Office has vowed to crack down on people-smuggling, but the crossings continue despite government efforts.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction restricting the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive personal information within the Social Security Administration (SSA). The judge cited concerns over the broad and unfettered access DOGE sought, questioning why a more targeted approach wasn't used. This ruling follows previous legal challenges and concerns about DOGE's data practices across multiple federal agencies, including claims of dubious data usage and potential violations of privacy laws. The restrictions do not apply to non-DOGE SSA staff or DOGE members using anonymized data with proper training.</p>

            <p>Maine Democrats are attempting to amend the state constitution to codify the Maine Human Rights Act (MHRA), which allows transgender athletes to participate in girls' sports. This move comes amidst ongoing conflict with the Trump administration, which opposes the policy. While Democrats support the amendment, Republicans are pushing to remove "gender identity" from the MHRA. A recent survey suggests that a majority of Maine residents disagree with allowing trans athletes in girls' sports, even as one school district defies the state to comply with Title IX.</p>

            <p>A large study published in Frontiers in Oncology suggests that medical cannabis may have potential in treating cancer symptoms and potentially fighting the disease itself. The analysis, which examined over 10,000 studies, found strong support for cannabis in treating cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss, and nausea. It also indicated that cannabis might have the ability to kill cancer cells and stop their spread. While some experts remain skeptical about cannabis's cancer-fighting abilities, the study's authors hope it will encourage the reclassification of cannabis to facilitate further research.</p>

            <p>A common dolphin calf was killed by bottlenose dolphins in Cardigan Bay, Wales, in an attack witnessed by people on a dolphin-spotting trip. This type of attack is becoming more common as climate change causes an increase in common dolphin numbers in the area, leading to more interactions with resident bottlenose dolphins. Cetacean experts suggest the attacks may be a form of "play" for the bottlenose dolphins. The incident has been described as incredibly rare to witness in person.</p>
