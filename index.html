          <p>Huawei has applied for a patent on ternary logic for integrated circuits, potentially improving AI chip efficiency and mitigating the impact of US sanctions.  Ternary logic, using a -1, 0, and 1 system, could reduce transistor count and energy consumption in chips.  The patent application comes as advanced chip designs approach physical limits.  It remains unclear whether this technology can be commercially viable on a large scale.</p>
