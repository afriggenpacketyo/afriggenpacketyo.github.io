          <p>A man in Washington, D.C. is facing federal assault charges after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection officer. The incident occurred amidst heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city, which has been initiated by the Trump administration. According to court documents, the man confronted the officer verbally before the alleged assault and later admitted to the act while in custody. This event unfolds as local officials dispute the administration's justification of rising crime for the federal intervention, pointing to statistics that show a decrease in violent crime.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has permitted the Trump administration's decision to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the humanitarian nonprofits who sued were not eligible to bring the case, stating only the Government Accountability Office has the standing to challenge such actions. This decision allows the administration to continue freezing funds designated for global health initiatives, including HIV/AIDS prevention. Critics highlighted in the article warn that these cuts will have a devastating human impact, potentially leading to a significant number of preventable deaths globally.</p>

          <p>Olympic record-holder Michael Phelps has issued a detailed public critique of USA Swimming, citing "weak leadership" and poor operational controls for what he sees as the organization's decline. In a lengthy social media post, he expressed concern for the sport's future and stated he would be hesitant to have his own children compete under the current system. Phelps pointed to a drop in performance at recent international competitions and a failure to adequately support athletes. He has volunteered to be a resource for change and recommended a full, independent review of the organization to re-center its focus on the athletes.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the 2025 Leagues Cup suggests the tournament is not a reliable measure of the competitive balance between Major League Soccer (MLS) and Mexico's Liga MX. While MLS teams have dominated statistically in recent years, the article points out their significant home-field advantage, as all games are played in the U.S. This format forces Mexican clubs into strenuous travel schedules, a disadvantage not faced by their American counterparts. The article notes that in the more balanced Concacaf Champions Cup, Liga MX teams have historically outperformed MLS clubs, suggesting the Leagues Cup results may not reflect the true hierarchy of North American soccer.</p>

          <p>Google is facing a potential court-ordered divestiture of its Chrome browser, a situation intensified by a public $34.5 billion bid for the browser from competitor Perplexity AI. This development comes as a federal judge is expected to decide on remedies after ruling that Google holds a monopoly in the search market, with the Department of Justice advocating for the sale of Chrome. The uncertainty is a major challenge for parent company Alphabet, which is simultaneously investing billions in AI. Analysts are speculating on the valuation of Alphabet's various components, like YouTube and Waymo, in the event of a forced breakup.</p>

          <p>A man from New York has been arrested and charged with cyberstalking for allegedly leaving threatening voicemails for the widow of slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The suspect, Shane Daley, reportedly made the calls hours after Thompson was fatally shot in December, leaving profanity-laced messages calling the CEO a "capitalist pig" and warning his wife. Investigators linked Daley to the calls through his cellphone number and said he admitted it was possible he made them while drinking. The acting U.S. Attorney condemned the alleged actions as vicious and outrageous, vowing to hold the suspect accountable for increasing the family's suffering.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) independent watchdog reveals that all of the agency's hospitals are experiencing "severe" staff shortages, which have increased by 50% this fiscal year. The inspector general found that 94% of VA facilities face a severe shortage of doctors and 79% have a severe shortage of nurses, with psychology being the most frequently reported shortage. This report comes as the VA is undergoing a department-wide reduction of 30,000 workers under the Trump administration. The VA's press secretary disputed the report's reliability, calling it subjective, though it did not contest the loss of thousands of mission-critical healthcare workers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to new rankings from Sportico. This marks a dramatic turnaround for the team, which was ranked last in the league with a valuation of $930 million just a decade ago while in St. Louis. The surge in value is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium and the surrounding entertainment district in Inglewood. This valuation reflects the franchise's successful monetization of its new home and its strong corporate and fan-based revenue streams in the Los Angeles market.</p>

The Mendenhall River crested at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing previous records and inundating parts of the city, prompting some evacuations. This annual event, caused by the release of melted snow and rainwater from the basin, has worsened in recent years, destroying homes and causing widespread damage. In response, officials installed temporary barriers this year to protect hundreds of properties, though a permanent solution is still years away.

          <p>Researchers are predicting a substantial decline in reindeer populations across the Arctic by 2100, with some North American caribou populations potentially plummeting by up to 80%. A study led by the University of Adelaide used ancient DNA and computer models to find that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses a more severe threat. The global reindeer population has already decreased by nearly two-thirds in the last three decades. Scientists warn that the loss of these animals could have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and the release of carbon from Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and dangerous Naegleria fowleri infection, commonly known as a brain-eating amoeba, in a patient who is now in intensive care. The infection possibly occurred after the individual was water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks. This amoeba is common in warm freshwater, but infection is extremely rare and happens when contaminated water is forced up the nose, allowing it to reach the brain. While devastating for the individual, health officials emphasize that such cases are not common, with only 167 reported in the U.S. since 1962.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining about 2%, as investors grow more confident that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. This optimism for smaller companies, which often rely on borrowing to finance operations, contrasted with a slight decline in the tech-heavy Magnificent 7 index. The potential for lower interest rates is seen as a major benefit for these smaller, economically sensitive firms. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, a shift driven by recent economic data showing cooler inflation and weaker job growth.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's criticism of Goldman Sachs for its forecast, a broad consensus of Wall Street economists agrees that consumers will face higher inflation due to tariffs. As pre-tariff inventories are depleted and higher duty rates take effect, experts predict a steady increase in consumer prices through the end of the year. Economists from firms like JPMorgan Chase and UBS expect the tariffs to add up to 1.5% to inflation, though they do not anticipate this will deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. The general view is that the inflation increase will be temporary but could dent consumer spending and GDP growth in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

The EU's executive branch has warned that famine is unfolding in the region.

          <p>The Habit Burger & Grill is escalating its marketing rivalry with In-N-Out by updating a billboard near Los Angeles that trolls the iconic chain's placement in a national fast-food ranking. After beating In-N-Out in USA Today's poll for the best fast-food burger, Habit altered its sign to show its rival dropping from second to fourth place. The campaign also takes a jab at In-N-Out's eastward expansion to Tennessee, with Habit's CMO stating they are "proudly Californian and not going anywhere." This move represents a pointed marketing tactic in the competitive Southern California burger market where both chains are headquartered.</p>
