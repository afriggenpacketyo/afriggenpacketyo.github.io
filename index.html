          <h2>Trump Suggests Tariff Reductions on Chinese Goods Amid Trade Discussions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:29:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated the possibility of reducing tariffs on goods from China as top trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. This meeting is viewed as a crucial step toward de-escalating the trade war that has destabilized financial markets. Trump expressed optimism about the discussions, while China conveyed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. Despite this progress, analysts caution that systemic issues remain, and any tariff cuts are likely to be minor, with lengthy negotiations expected to fully resolve the trade disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which compensated for a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports rose by 8.1%, while imports saw a slight decrease of 0.2%. Despite the overall export growth, shipments to the U.S. fell by over 21%, and imports from the U.S. also declined by nearly 14%. Analysts suggest that transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs may have contributed to the export surge, but expect trade data to weaken in the coming months.</p>

          <p>A mines developer suggests that developed nations are realizing the need to diversify tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions. China's export restrictions on tungsten and other metals have caused panic in the industry, prompting companies to seek alternative sources. US defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by 2027, further driving the need for diversification. China accounted for the vast majority of global raw tungsten ore mined last year, highlighting its dominance in the market.</p>
