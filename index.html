          <p>This article examines the business and political reasoning behind MSNBC's potential rebranding to "MSNOW." It suggests that while there are clear commercial motives for the change, the move could also be influenced by corporate apprehension regarding potential retaliation from a future Trump administration. The analysis delves into how media companies navigate the politically charged environment, balancing brand identity with perceived political risks and the broader implications for journalism.</p>

          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared the end of a measles outbreak that infected 762 people, the largest in the state in over three decades. The outbreak, which resulted in two deaths and nearly 100 hospitalizations, was contained after 42 days with no new cases. Despite this success, experts warn that declining vaccination rates and a record number of non-medical exemptions for schoolchildren leave communities vulnerable to future resurgences of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration is set to begin transferring documents related to Jeffrey Epstein to the House Oversight Committee this Friday. Committee Chair James Comer extended the initial subpoena deadline, citing the DOJ's cooperation and the vast number of records involved in the bipartisan investigation. The probe seeks to understand the handling of Epstein's case, with requested materials including files on Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and his 2007 non-prosecution agreement.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits exist for buying annuities, a popular retirement planning tool. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, individual insurance companies often impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85, based on risk assessment. The piece advises that the best time to purchase an annuity depends on individual retirement strategy rather than a specific age, balancing factors like payout rates, product availability, and long-term financial goals.

          <p>The high-profile national security trial of 77-year-old pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai has entered its final stage with the commencement of closing arguments in Hong Kong.

The trial is seen by critics as a key indicator of diminishing press freedom and judicial independence in the city under the national security law imposed by Beijing.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has cautioned that the United States may be underestimating the threat posed by China's progress in artificial intelligence. He expressed skepticism that current export controls on semiconductors are a sufficient or effective long-term strategy to maintain a U.S. lead. Altman noted that competition from Chinese open-source models was a significant factor in OpenAI's recent decision to release its own open-weight models, aiming to prevent the global developer ecosystem from becoming dominated by Chinese technology.</p>

          <p>Southern California and the Southwest are bracing for the most dangerous heat wave of the summer, with temperatures expected to soar into the triple digits for several days. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat and fire weather advisories, warning that the conditions could lead to explosive fire behavior and a high risk of heat-related illnesses. Officials are urging residents to stay hydrated, limit outdoor activities, and prepare for potential emergencies as temperatures are forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal.</p>

          <p>This article breaks down the significant cost of carrying a large credit card balance in the current high-interest-rate environment. With an average APR of around 22%, a $25,000 debt would accrue approximately $5,500 in interest in a single year, meaning most of a minimum monthly payment goes toward interest rather than principal. The piece outlines strategies to reduce this burden, such as paying more than the minimum, using a balance transfer card, or consolidating debt with a personal loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a direct response to Republican redistricting efforts in Texas, California Democrats have unveiled a proposal to redraw the state's congressional districts to favor their party. The plan, which would require a state constitutional amendment and voter approval, could potentially give Democrats an additional five U.S. House seats. This move escalates a national partisan battle over gerrymandering ahead of the midterm elections, as both parties seek to secure a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>The recent transfer of academy graduate Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa to Newcastle for £40 million has highlighted widespread fan frustration with the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). The sale provides "pure profit" for Villa's accounting, helping them comply with spending limits, but fans of both clubs lament that the rules incentivize selling homegrown talent. This situation underscores the financial pressures on ambitious clubs trying to compete with the established elite, who have larger revenue streams to support their spending.
