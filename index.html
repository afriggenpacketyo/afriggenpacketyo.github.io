          <p>Volkswagen has reduced its annual profit guidance after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit, citing the significant impact of U.S. import tariffs. The German automaker's quarterly profit and sales revenue both fell short of analyst expectations. The company now anticipates its operating return on sales to be between 4% and 5%, a decrease from the previously forecasted 5.5% to 6.5%. This adjustment reflects broader challenges facing European carmakers, including competition from Chinese brands and ongoing trade policy uncertainty with the United States.

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon nine months after a severe jaw injury where his bottom teeth were caved in. Ahead of his fight against Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, Whittaker described the unsettling injury and his subsequent recovery, which involved surgery to remove several teeth and install implants. The 34-year-old Australian fighter, currently ranked fifth, stated that while regaining the title is a goal, his primary motivation is now setting an example for his children and other athletes.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, a significant diplomatic step amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The formalization is planned for the U.N. General Assembly in September, making France the largest Western power to take this position. The move was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority but condemned by Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stating it "rewards terror." The United States also expressed strong rejection of the decision, highlighting the growing international pressure on Israel regarding the war and humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is attempting to minimize disruption as resident doctors begin a five-day strike over a long-standing pay dispute. Health Secretary Wes Streeting has pledged to keep services running by ordering hospitals to cancel treatments only in exceptional circumstances, with senior doctors covering for their striking colleagues. The British Medical Association (BMA) warned this approach could risk patient safety by stretching staff too thin. The strike is the 12th of its kind, with the BMA arguing that pay has fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008 despite recent raises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association (FA), Mark Bullingham, has stated there is no need to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system. Amid speculation that football's law-making body, Ifab, might consider using VAR for decisions on corner kicks or second yellow cards, Bullingham expressed concerns about creating more interruptions in the game. The FA, which holds a vote on Ifab, believes the current application of VAR—used for goals, penalties, direct red cards, and mistaken identity—is sufficient. This stance suggests any proposal to widen VAR's scope would face significant opposition.</p>

          <p>Authorities on the Isle of Man have confiscated more than 200 counterfeit Labubu dolls from two stores in Douglas, citing safety concerns. The Office of Fair Trading determined the popular collectible toys were imitations and posed a choking hazard to children. The high demand for Labubu dolls, part of the Pop Mart 'Monsters' series, has led to a market flooded with fake products that often fail to meet safety standards. Officials are urging consumers to be cautious, noting that authentic dolls have specific features, such as nine teeth, which are often incorrect on the fakes.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in southern Mexico are struggling to combat an outbreak of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that infects livestock and has prompted the U.S. to bar Mexican cattle imports.

While a U.S.-supported plant to produce sterile flies for eradication is under construction, it won't be operational until next year.

          <p>During a joint visit to the Federal Reserve's headquarters to survey a renovation project, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly disagreed on the project's cost. Trump claimed the cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, stating it included a separate building completed five years ago. Despite previously suggesting the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell, Trump stated Thursday it was not necessary. The president reiterated his desire for the Fed to lower interest rates but said he felt "good" about his relationship with the chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced another round of severe flash flooding, with heavy rainfall causing roads to close and at least one home to be swept away by rushing water. The area is particularly vulnerable to flooding due to burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the hillsides of vegetation. This event follows deadly floods earlier in the month that killed at least three people. Video on social media showed walls of muddy water and debris coursing through the community as the region contends with a potent summer monsoon season.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to directly observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered a rare effect where friction did not increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds actually slid more easily. This counterintuitive phenomenon was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The findings could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale machines and devices.</p>
