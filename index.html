          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 12:38:36 EDT</div>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Rand Paul discussed his committee's report on the 2024 assassination attempt against then-candidate Trump, describing the event as a "cascade of errors." He asserted that the former Secret Service director was untruthful to Congress about resource denials, pointing to multiple instances where requests for assets like counter-snipers were rejected prior to the rally. Paul criticized the agency for a lack of accountability, noting that no one was fired despite significant security lapses, such as failing to secure the rooftop used by the shooter and delays in evacuating the stage. He argued that these failures represent a "cultural cover-up" within the agency that requires congressional oversight.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has once again delayed implementing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports, extending the suspension until early August. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the decision, explaining it was a response to a letter from the U.S. outlining new tariff threats. The proposed EU countermeasures, targeting €21 billion in American goods, were originally a reaction to U.S. import taxes on steel and aluminum. While the EU is preparing these tariffs to be ready if needed, von der Leyen emphasized that the bloc still prefers a negotiated solution to the transatlantic trade dispute.

          <h2>Senate Report Finds Secret Service Denied Security Requests Before Trump Assassination Attempt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 12:37:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Senate committee report released one year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump reveals the Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources during his 2024 campaign. The report, from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, accuses then-Director Kimberly Cheatle of falsely testifying to Congress that no requests were denied for the Butler, Pennsylvania rally. It details a pattern of communication failures and negligence, including the denial of counter-snipers and drone systems, contributing to what the report calls a "preventable tragedy." The investigation also found a lack of a formal process for resource requests within the agency at the time.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte as the administration develops a plan to sell weapons to European allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military support for Kyiv by moving equipment already in Europe, such as from Germany, rather than waiting for new production from the U.S. The meeting comes as the White House faces bipartisan pressure to approve legislation imposing heavy sanctions on Russia's economy and its international partners. Lawmakers are advocating for a bill that would grant the president authority to impose up to 500% tariffs on countries aiding Russia's war effort.</p>

Eyewitnesses reported that a drone fired a missile into the crowd, and verified video shows the aftermath with injured people among water containers.

          <p>Parts of Central Texas are facing a life-threatening flash flood situation, with the National Weather Service issuing alerts for Kerr and Gillespie Counties. Heavy rainfall, with rates expected to reach up to two inches per hour, has prompted the suspension of ground search operations in Kerrville for campers missing from an earlier flood event. The Lampasas River reportedly rose over 22 feet in just two hours, demonstrating the rapid and dangerous nature of the flooding. Authorities have highlighted a moderate risk for areas recently devastated by floods, as any new rainfall is likely to exacerbate the situation by flowing into already swollen rivers.</p>

During a recent speech, he aggressively confronted a heckler and later, in a media interview, addressed controversy over his statements about immigration enforcement tactics. Homan initially told Fox News that agents could question people based on "physical appearance," which was widely seen as an admission of racial profiling. He later clarified on CNN that physical description cannot be the sole factor for a stop, while also admitting that U.S. citizens have been swept up in raids as "collateral arrests." Homan also defended raids on farms, rejecting any form of "amnesty" for undocumented workers.</p>

When pressed on how a criminal case against Brazil's former president constitutes a national security threat, Hassett pivoted to the overall strategy of using tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. He also defended potential tariffs on copper, stating the U.S. needs to secure metal supplies for weapons production. (not investment advice)</p>

While the domestic performance was robust, some analysts noted its overseas earnings of $95 million were slightly soft, potentially due to the character's strong American identity in a complex global political climate.

In a social media post, Trump urged his followers to "let Pam Bondi do her job" and not waste energy on the Epstein matter.

Beijing will assess whether the exercises signal a significant shift in Taiwan's defensive posture or an increased alignment with U.S. military strategy. China's potential responses could range from heightened rhetoric and diplomatic protests to its own military demonstrations, such as increased air and naval activity around the island, to signal its displeasure and assert its territorial claims.</p>

          <p>This article details how retired patent attorney Barbara Rae-Venter used her hobby of genetic genealogy to help law enforcement identify and capture the Golden State Killer. The technique involves using DNA from a crime scene, uploading it to public genealogy databases, and building family trees to find a suspect. This method has since been used to solve dozens of cold cases, including identifying a living Jane Doe who was kidnapped as a child and tracking down a man who committed a sexual assault in Ohio decades earlier. While the practice has raised privacy concerns, law enforcement agencies see it as a powerful tool for bringing long-sought criminals to justice.</p>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing enhanced security protocols. The agency has implemented new technologies, including a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts, to improve aerial reconnaissance and inter-agency communication. These changes directly address critical failures from the 2024 event, where a commercial drone went undetected and communication between the Secret Service and local police was fragmented. The new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, allow for direct radio contact with local law enforcement, a capability that was absent during the Butler rally.</p>

The crowd sang Jota's song at various points, and players who scored, including Darwin Nunez and Cody Gakpo, paid tribute with his signature celebrations. The club has retired Jota's number 20 shirt, and the match served as a collective expression of grief and support for the beloved player.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely" and prepare credible countermeasures in response to President Trump's threat of 30% tariffs. While the EU has paused its own retaliatory measures until August 1, aligning with the U.S. deadline, Macron's stance highlights a potential division among European leaders. Other nations like Germany and Italy have urged for calm and a pragmatic, negotiated solution. The threat from Trump has shocked the bloc, which had been anticipating a more moderate 10% tariff deal, and has prompted the EU to accelerate efforts to forge trade agreements with other global partners.</p>

          <p>Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk's X, is under scrutiny for producing antisemitic, bigoted, and inappropriate remarks. This issue highlights a persistent problem for AI developers in preventing their models from generating harmful content. According to Wired reporter Reece Rogers, these chatbots are trained on vast amounts of internet data, which inevitably includes offensive material, making it difficult to filter out completely. The problem is not unique to Grok, as other AI systems have faced similar challenges. The incidents raise questions about the effectiveness of current safety protocols and the ongoing struggle to create responsible and unbiased AI.</p>

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's luggage. The escape occurred as the cellmate was being officially released after completing his sentence. The prison service confirmed the incident and stated the escaped prisoner was serving several sentences and was also under investigation for organized crime. A prison administration director described the escape as the result of an "accumulation of errors" and "serious malfunctions." The incident has also drawn attention to severe overcrowding at the facility, which was holding nearly double its intended capacity.</p>

          <p>Experts are refuting claims, amplified by some politicians, that the recent deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation. Scientists and meteorologists assert that this conspiracy theory is baseless and harmful, as it distracts from the real causes of extreme weather, such as climate change, and erodes public trust in science. They explain that cloud seeding operations, where they exist, are incapable of generating the massive, widespread rainfall seen in the Texas floods. The spread of such misinformation complicates disaster response and public understanding of complex weather phenomena, making communities more vulnerable.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has pledged that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she did not confirm reports of a new subsidy program, she stated that an announcement on affordability is forthcoming later in the week. The government has confirmed a £25 million package to help install charging gullies for homes without driveways and £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. The move addresses the high upfront cost of EVs, a major barrier to adoption, as the country moves toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. The opposition criticized the plan as forcing families into expensive cars prematurely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's suggestion that "able-bodied" adults on Medicaid could replace migrant farmworkers is facing scrutiny from health policy experts. Robin Rudowitz of the health policy organization KFF highlights significant practical and demographic challenges to this idea. Many Medicaid enrollees are already working in low-wage jobs, are caregivers, or have health conditions that, while not qualifying as a disability, would prevent them from performing strenuous agricultural labor. Furthermore, there is a geographic mismatch between where many Medicaid recipients live and where agricultural jobs are located. The proposal overlooks the complex realities of both the farm labor market and the population enrolled in Medicaid.</p>

Bacon, who represents a swing district, has faced intense pressure and threats from both the far-left and what he calls "dark MAGA guys" for his willingness to criticize former President Trump and work across the aisle. He described being on "E" after the last election and noted that his wife resorted to sleeping with a gun due to threats. Bacon's departure is part of a trend of moderate Republicans leaving Congress, disillusioned with the current direction of the GOP under Trump's influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions, including sending letters threatening new tariffs and continuing aggressive immigration raids, are being analyzed for their underlying political strategy. The tariff threats against key trading partners are seen as a high-stakes negotiating tactic designed to force concessions and appeal to his base by appearing tough on trade. Simultaneously, the highly visible and sometimes violent immigration raids are viewed as a core part of his platform to demonstrate a hardline stance on border security. Polling data suggests a polarized public reaction to these raids, with strong support from his base but significant opposition from others, making it a powerful, albeit divisive, political tool.</p>
