          <p>A person walking on a beach in Walton County, Florida, discovered 25 kilograms of cocaine, valued at nearly half a million dollars, that had washed ashore. The drugs were distinctively packaged with an image of the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The local sheriff's office issued a public warning, advising people not to touch any suspicious packages and to report them immediately due to their potentially harmful contents. This incident is the latest in a series of similar discoveries along Florida's coast, where large quantities of illicit drugs have been found in unique packaging.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper secured his place in the next round of Wimbledon after his opponent, Sebastian Baez of Argentina, retired due to an injury. Draper was comfortably leading the match 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could not continue after slipping on the baseline. As the new British number one following Andy Murray's retirement, Draper carries the nation's hopes but acknowledged it was not the ideal way to win. He will face 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic in the second round.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK Parliament have voted to approve changes to the nation's welfare system, altering the eligibility criteria for benefits like Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment. The bill passed with a government majority of 75, despite 49 MPs from the ruling Labour party voting against it in a significant rebellion. The government states the reforms are intended to make the welfare system more sustainable and encourage employment by allowing benefit recipients to try working without losing support. The legislation will now proceed to the committee stage for further debate.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The provision would have imposed a heavy tax on projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a potential $7 billion burden to the industry. While industry groups were relieved by the removal of the punitive tax, they remain critical of the overall bill, which still phases out key investment tax credits that have supported the growth of renewable energy in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

Website owners using Cloudflare's services will now have to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their content, and a new 'pay per crawl' model will allow them to charge for access. This change aims to restore power to content creators, who have seen their traffic and ad revenue decline as AI models use their work without compensation or attribution.

In response, Trump threatened to use the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a program Musk once led, to investigate and potentially cut federal subsidies to Musk's companies like SpaceX and Tesla.

Lululemon stated it takes the protection of its intellectual property seriously and will pursue legal action when necessary.

However, political analysts are skeptical about its potential for success, citing the structural challenges that have historically prevented third parties from gaining traction in the U.S. The 'winner-takes-all' electoral system, massive campaign funding requirements, and the tendency of major parties to absorb popular third-party ideas are significant hurdles.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that President Trump's tariff policies are a key reason the central bank has not yet cut interest rates. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell stated that without the inflationary pressure caused by the tariffs, the Fed would likely have already eased its monetary policy. He emphasized that the Fed remains in a data-dependent, 'wait-and-see' mode and would not rule out a rate cut at the upcoming July meeting, though it is not guaranteed. The remarks highlight the significant impact of trade policy on the nation's economic outlook and the Fed's decision-making process. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate-passed Republican spending package proposes to permanently increase the maximum child tax credit to $2,200, up from the current $2,000. While this aims to provide relief for families, policy experts point out that the change would not benefit the lowest-income households. Because the credit is only partially refundable, families who do not earn enough to have a significant federal tax liability cannot claim its full value. According to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, this structural limitation means that approximately 17 million children from the poorest families will not see any additional benefit from the proposed expansion.

With home equity loan and HELOC rates averaging around 8%, they offer a more affordable borrowing option compared to credit cards, which have rates above 21%. The article outlines five smart uses for a $100,000 equity loan: paying off high-interest debt, funding strategic home renovations to boost value, investing in a diversified portfolio, starting a business, or financing education. However, it cautions that this strategy turns equity into secured debt, putting the home at risk if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts point out that the research used data from the 1980s, a period with much higher infant mortality, and that the vaccine formulation has since changed. Furthermore, the study's own authors published a more recent paper that found no negative effects. The global health community has widely condemned the funding cut, warning it could lead to a resurgence of deadly childhood diseases.</p>

The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 Democratic attorneys general, who argued the plan would cause 'devastating consequences' to public health services. The judge found 'no rational basis' for the administration's plan, which included laying off some 10,000 employees and restructuring agencies like the CDC and FDA. The court order blocks HHS from proceeding with the overhaul, stating the executive branch lacks the authority for such wholesale changes without Congressional action.</p>
