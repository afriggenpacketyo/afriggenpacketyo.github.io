          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Representative Abe Hamadeh for reelection, highlighting Hamadeh's "America First" stance. Trump previously endorsed Hamadeh before the 2024 GOP primary and later issued a dual endorsement with another candidate, Blake Masters. Hamadeh introduced a resolution to limit the types of flags displayed in House facilities, allowing only the American flag, state flags, and flags of visiting foreign dignitaries. Hamadeh stated that Congress should embody the American people, explaining his resolution to ban foreign and ideological flags. Hamadeh has inspired many to serve the country, as he said in a letter to Trump on the president's 79th birthday. </p>

The article questions why Republican members of Congress tolerate such treatment and do not speak out or resign. The lawmakers who privately blanch at Trump’s authoritarian impulses presumably entered politics with the idea of doing good. </p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 subvariant, named "Nimbus," is spreading in California, causing concerns about a potential summer wave. This subvariant, known for causing "razor blade throat" symptoms, is becoming increasingly dominant nationally. Wastewater surveillance in Southern California indicates varying levels of coronavirus activity, with some areas reporting high levels. The rise of Nimbus coincides with objections from medical organizations regarding recent moves by the Trump administration on vaccine policy, which some experts fear will make vaccines harder to access. </p>

          <p>The FCC is delaying the implementation of multilingual wireless emergency alerts, despite a unanimous vote two years ago to require alerts in 13 languages and American Sign Language. Currently, alerts are only available in Spanish and English, leaving nearly 68 million Americans who speak another language at home potentially uninformed during emergencies. Democratic Congress members and nonprofits attribute the delay to an executive order signed by President Trump, requiring agency reports to be approved by a Trump administration official before publication. FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez suggests that this order might be the reason for the delay, emphasizing the urgency of providing critical information in languages people understand. </p>

          <p>Scotland's ban on biodegradable waste in landfills, effective at the end of the year, will lead to the export of up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England. The ban aims to reduce methane emissions but faces a capacity gap due to insufficient incinerators. Concerns exist regarding the environmental impact of transporting waste and the lack of progress in domestic recycling rates. The Scottish government views the waste export as a short-term solution while increasing incineration capacity. </p>
