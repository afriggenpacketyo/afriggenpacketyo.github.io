          <p>Barry Morphew, the husband of Suzanne Morphew, has been arrested for first-degree murder in connection to her death, marking the second time he faces such charges. Suzanne Morphew was last seen on Mother's Day in 2020 and her remains were found in September 2023, with her death ruled a homicide by unspecified means with tranquilizers for wildlife found in her remains. Barry Morphew had previously filed a lawsuit against law enforcement, claiming wrongful charges, but it was dismissed in 2024 and now he is in custody in Arizona awaiting extradition back to the San Luis Valley. The El Paso County Coroner's Office determined the cause of death and manner of death as, "Homicide by unspecified means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication."</p>

          <p>The median home sale price in the U.S. reached a record high of $396,500, but buyers are paying less than the median asking price. High mortgage rates and low inventory of affordable homes have made it difficult for Americans to enter the housing market, with first-time homebuyers decreasing significantly since 2010. Redfin data indicates sellers may be flexible on pricing due to increased inventory and economic uncertainty, but homes in desirable locations still sell at or above asking price. The real estate market is still shifting, with pricing strategies becoming more important for sellers.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court sided with the oil and gas industry in a challenge to California's emission standards, reviving a lawsuit against the state's drive for electric vehicles. The court ruled that fuel makers had standing to sue over California's strict emissions standards, arguing that the state was abusing its power to combat climate change. This decision follows actions by President Trump and congressional Republicans to disapprove regulations allowing California to enforce new "zero emissions" requirements. Environmentalists fear this decision sets a dangerous precedent that protects corporate interests and greenlights lawsuits from industry and polluters.</p>

Under the Republican proposals, there would be just two repayment plan choices for borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026, compared with roughly a dozen options now.

          <p>Comparing a $10,000 CD and a money market account reveals similar interest-earning potential, but with key differences. CD rates are fixed based on the lender and term length, while money market accounts have variable rates. Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms. Savers should weigh the guaranteed interest of a CD against the potential for higher, but variable, returns from a money market account to determine the most profitable option.

          <p>A federal appeals court denied President Trump's request to delay oral arguments in his appeal of the $83 million defamation case with E. Jean Carroll. Trump and the DOJ sought the delay to appeal an earlier ruling regarding government substitution in the case. The oral arguments will proceed as scheduled, and the 2nd Circuit previously upheld a separate $5 million damage award to Carroll. Trump is appealing a 2024 verdict ordering him to pay former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll $83 million for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her accusation that he sexually assaulted her.</p>

While protein can be beneficial for muscle building and satiety, experts question the necessity of excessive protein consumption for the average person. Food companies use protein as a marketing tactic to make their products more attractive, but consumers should be wary of the health claims associated with these products.</p>
