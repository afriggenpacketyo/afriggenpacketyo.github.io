        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has issued sanctions against Francesca Albanese, the United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories. This action follows her vocal criticism of Israel's military conduct in Gaza, which she has described as genocidal, and her support for International Criminal Court actions against Israeli officials. The move has been condemned by human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch as an attempt to silence a UN expert for performing her duties. The sanctions represent a significant escalation in the U.S. campaign to counter criticism of Israel's nearly two-year-long war in the region.</p>

          <p>A one-year-old boy has died in Bakersfield after his mother allegedly left him and his two-year-old sibling in a car on a day with 101-degree temperatures. The mother, Maya Hernández, was reportedly getting a lip filler procedure at a medical spa, and the children were left in the vehicle for an estimated 90 minutes. The car's engine, which had been left running for the air conditioning, automatically shut off after an hour. The infant was found unresponsive with a body temperature of 107.2 degrees, and Hernández, 20, now faces charges of involuntary manslaughter and murder.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has been taken back into custody as prosecutors investigate him on charges of insurrection. The detention follows his controversial declaration of martial law last December, an act the Constitutional Court deemed a betrayal of public trust. A court approved a second arrest warrant over concerns that Yoon might destroy evidence related to the investigation. The 64-year-old faces potential life imprisonment for his actions, which included sending armed soldiers to parliament to prevent lawmakers from overturning his decree.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness reveals that some of the world's least-developed countries, including Somalia and Haiti, are paying millions to lobbying firms with ties to Donald Trump. This spending is an apparent effort to offset the impact of deep cuts to U.S. foreign humanitarian assistance under his administration. The report indicates that these nations are increasingly vulnerable and have begun bartering access to crucial natural resources, like minerals, in exchange for potential humanitarian or military support. This situation creates a dynamic where desperate countries may agree to unfavorable and exploitative deals.</p>

The article notes that this trend is forcing a strategic pivot from the Labour government, which is now taking the threat from Reform UK more seriously than its traditional opposition.

          <p>A new report from the anti-poverty organization Oxfam reveals a staggering level of wealth inequality across Africa. According to the findings, the continent's four wealthiest individuals hold a combined fortune of $57.4 billion, which is more than the total wealth of the poorest 50% of Africa's population, or approximately 750 million people. The report argues that government policies biased against the poor, coupled with ineffective tax systems, allow the super-rich to accumulate vast wealth while hindering poverty reduction efforts. Africa now has 23 billionaires, a significant increase from zero in the year 2000.</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans has been released back into the wild in Huntington Beach after making a full recovery from poisoning. The birds were among nearly 200 seabirds rescued by the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center during Southern California's most severe toxic algal bloom in nearly a decade. The bloom produced high levels of domoic acid, a neurotoxin that sickened and killed numerous marine animals, including sea lions. The successful release of the rehabilitated pelicans marks a moment of hope after a difficult period for coastal wildlife.</p>

          <p>Recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas have yielded vastly different outcomes, underscoring the importance of community preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where recent wildfires created high-risk "burn scars," deadly floods were destructive but anticipated, allowing for some level of readiness. In contrast, severe flooding in Texas caught officials by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll. Experts note that a community's recent experience with a specific disaster, like the fires in New Mexico, significantly informs its response and resilience to subsequent related events, such as predictable flooding.</p>

The official suggested that a temporary 60-day ceasefire might be attainable within a couple of weeks but stated that a lasting peace is "questionable." According to the official, Israel will not agree to a permanent settlement unless Hamas is completely disarmed and removed from power. This stance highlights the significant gap between the warring parties and tempers hopes for a swift conclusion to the nearly two-year-long conflict.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies that moved manufacturing to Southeast Asian (ASEAN) nations to circumvent U.S. tariffs are now facing renewed economic uncertainty. The Trump administration has threatened to impose high tariffs on goods from the region, targeting what it views as a transshipment strategy by Chinese exporters to evade duties. This policy ambiguity has left many Chinese business owners in a state of limbo, unsure whether to invest further in their Southeast Asian facilities or scale back.

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to lead to higher prices for American consumers, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a vital component in a vast array of products, including electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. The tariff will likely increase manufacturing costs, which companies are expected to pass on to consumers. While the administration argues the tariff will reshore a critical industry, critics warn of its inflationary impact on everything from home repairs to the cost of maintaining the nation's electric grid.

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic and remains nearly a year lower than 2019 levels. While the virus was the initial driver of the decline, the persistent gap is now primarily caused by drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The recovery has been particularly slow for Black and Hispanic Californians, widening racial and ethnic disparities in longevity. The findings suggest that while the most acute phase of the pandemic is over, its ripple effects and other public health crises continue to significantly impact the state's mortality trends.</p>

After posting a message stating he was not suicidal to preempt any false reports from prison, he responded to a follower by alleging that House Speaker Mike Johnson had blocked Donald Trump from pardoning him. The claim was met with skepticism, as the House Speaker holds no authority over presidential pardons. This final public statement is consistent with the pattern of falsehoods that defined Santos's brief and controversial political career.</p>
