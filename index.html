          <p>Rock Springs, Wyoming, a town once proud of its diverse immigrant history, is now publicly confronting a dark chapter: the 1885 massacre of 28 Chinese laborers by a mob. Archaeological digs are uncovering artifacts from the burnt-down Chinatown, while a new, prominent statue, "Requiem," has been dedicated to commemorate the victims and the town's 56 nationalities. The article highlights the irony of this acknowledgement occurring in a county that recently voted overwhelmingly for a president with anti-immigrant policies, sparking debate among local officials about current immigration enforcement versus historical recognition. This effort aims to shed light on a violent past, even as contemporary immigration issues persist.</p>

          <p>As China approaches its "super golden week" holiday, a crucial indicator for domestic consumption, retail prices for hairy crabs have experienced a significant decline. Industry insiders attribute this downturn to increased production, a shrinking market for gift-giving, and overall weak household spending. The article reports that prices are down by approximately 20 yuan per kilogram compared to the previous year, with expectations for further reductions as supply increases. This trend in a prized seasonal delicacy suggests broader consumption doldrums, raising concerns about the strength of domestic demand despite the upcoming extended holiday period.

The article highlights Starmer's renewed attacks on Nigel Farage, whom he labeled "grubby" and "unpatriotic" for allegedly talking down the country and focusing on personal gain. Starmer also criticized Reform UK's proposed immigration policies, particularly the abolition of indefinite leave to remain, arguing they would "tear this country apart."</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that a potential return of Donald Trump to power could fundamentally alter US-China relations, moving beyond traditional ideological frameworks. It critiques the long-held Western "convergence theory," which posited that industrializing societies would naturally become more similar, arguing it oversimplifies cultural complexities and power dynamics. The author proposes an emerging "reverse convergence," where the United States might adopt a more pragmatic approach to political legitimacy and matters of war and peace, aligning more with China's methods rather than seeking to impose liberal democratic values. This analysis points to a significant, albeit nascent, shift in the underlying nature of the bilateral relationship.</p>

The E3 countries stated they had no choice but to activate the "snapback" procedure, reinstating sweeping economic and military penalties a decade after their initial lifting. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the sanctions as "unfair, unjust, and illegal," while maintaining that Iran has no intention of developing nuclear weapons.

          <h2>Venezuela's Maduro Orders Civilian Military Training Amid Rising Tensions with US</h2>

          <p>Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has ordered the training of thousands of civilians for a "non-declared war," intensifying tensions with the United States. This move follows US navy strikes on alleged drug boats in the South Caribbean, which Maduro has condemned as aggression. The article highlights the call-up of the National Bolivarian Militia, a civilian force, and the military's instruction of locals in handling arms. Experts suggest the militia's role might be to act as a "human shield" rather than engage in direct battle, aiming to increase the human cost of any potential US military action. This comes amid deteriorating US-Venezuela relations and US non-recognition of Maduro's re-election.</p>

European captain Luke Donald maintained a pragmatic stance despite the commanding lead, acknowledging the formidable strength of the US team and avoiding complacency. The article also highlights a neck injury sustained by Viktor Hovland, which could potentially impact the final day's lineup, adding another layer of complexity to the competition.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Donald Trump's Unfiltered Rhetoric Suggests a Sense of Invincibility</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's increasingly unfiltered public statements and actions, suggesting he exhibits a growing sense of invincibility. It highlights instances like his claims on autism, his harsh criticism of opponents at a memorial service, and a combative UN address, arguing that Trump interprets professional disapproval as validation of his authenticity rather than a liability. He consistently reframes inconsistencies as strategic brilliance and views indictments as personal vindication, thereby cultivating an image of being beyond normal political or legal consequences. This analysis explores how Trump's rhetoric, whether discussing global peace or late-night television, consistently projects an aura of untouchability, defining his unique political persona.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, in his new book "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30 years as a "swing justice," stating "The cases swung, not me." He expresses deep concern about the current state of American discourse and the tone of some Supreme Court opinions, advocating for more respectful conversation. The article highlights his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage, influenced by the plight of children with gay parents, and abortion, where he reconciled personal moral opposition with legal principles of liberty. Kennedy also critiques originalism, arguing for an evolving understanding of constitutional liberty.</p>
