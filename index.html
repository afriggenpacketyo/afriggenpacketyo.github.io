          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing workers across Missouri and Illinois have initiated a strike after rejecting a new four-year labor agreement. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union stated the walkout is a stand for respect and dignity, demanding a contract that reflects their skills and contributions to national defense. While the union had previously recommended an earlier offer, members rejected the latest proposal over concerns about pay and benefits. Boeing has expressed disappointment but confirmed it has a contingency plan in place to continue supporting its customers during the strike.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, columnist Timothy Garton Ash reflects on his earlier prediction that keeping Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate would pave the way for a Donald Trump return. He argues that the Democratic establishment and liberal media were too slow to acknowledge Biden's visible decline, a fact most Americans had already recognized. The author suggests a combination of fear of losing access, party tribalism, and deference to the presidency prevented a necessary change in leadership. He concludes that the party must now learn from this, embrace younger talent, and listen more closely to voters to recover.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth look at Manchester United's pre-season tour, evaluating the changes implemented by new manager Ruben Amorim. It details his tactical adjustments, including a three-man defense that shifts in possession, and his management style, which emphasizes player responsibility and a more relaxed environment compared to his predecessor. While observing positive signs in player fitness and morale, the analysis remains cautious, noting that the team's true progress will only be judged by competitive results. The piece also touches on squad weaknesses and the ongoing stadium regeneration project.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic state legislators has fled Texas to prevent the Republican-controlled legislature from achieving a quorum needed to vote on a new congressional map. Democrats argue the proposed map is a partisan gerrymander designed to unfairly expand the GOP's majority in the U.S. House. They accuse Governor Greg Abbott of prioritizing this political maneuver over pressing issues like disaster relief for recent flood victims. In response, Governor Abbott has threatened to invoke a legal opinion that could lead to the removal of the absent lawmakers from their offices.</p>

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), only 12 people have been rescued, with dozens still missing. The incident highlights the extreme dangers of the migration route from the Horn of Africa to Gulf states, which the IOM describes as one of the world's most perilous. Officials are conducting a large-scale search and rescue mission, while emphasizing the need for legal migration pathways to prevent such tragedies.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Manchester City's summer transfer activity, suggesting the club is preparing for a significant tactical evolution under Pep Guardiola. The hiring of Pep Lijnders, a key figure from Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool, is seen as a major indicator of this shift. The new player signings, such as Rayan Cherki and Omar Marmoush, are noted for their direct dribbling and ball-carrying abilities, contrasting with City's traditional emphasis on intricate passing. This move towards a more vertical, transition-focused style of play is interpreted as Guardiola's adaptation to the changing dynamics of the Premier League.</p>

This creates a permanent disconnect where a government operates on inertia, unable to solve major crises, while protest movements on both the left and right grow in frustration.

          <p>In a brief exchange with a reporter, former President Donald Trump expressed his approval of actress Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad campaign upon being informed that she is a registered Republican.

          <p>Chinese biotech companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the industry and demonstrating its growing maturity. Innovent's expected profitability is partly driven by strong sales of its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide, which is anticipated to generate substantial revenue. This development signals that leading Chinese biotechs are becoming financially self-sufficient and no longer solely reliant on investor funding. The success reflects their ability to create value for patients and the Chinese healthcare market. (not investment advice)</p>
