        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing a lawsuit challenging an Illinois law that allows mailed-in absentee ballots postmarked by election day to be counted up to two weeks later. The arguments focus on whether the plaintiff, Republican Representative Mike Bost, has standing to challenge the law, rather than the law's constitutional validity. Bost argues that the law unconstitutionally extends the election period, causing financial injury due to the cost of staffing a campaign past election day. The ACLU supports Bost's appeal on standing grounds, emphasizing the importance of consistent rules for challenging election laws. The case could have broader implications for election law challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis indicates that global solar and wind power generation has exceeded coal power generation for the first time, driven by record growth in solar generation (31%) and wind generation (7.7%). This milestone suggests a potential shift away from polluting energy sources, even with rising electricity demands. The analysis highlights China and India as leaders in renewable energy adoption, contributing to emission reductions in those countries, whereas the U.S. and Europe face challenges due to policy shifts and sluggish renewable growth. Experts emphasize the importance of continued investment in renewables to meet increasing electricity demand and displace fossil fuels. Optimism surrounds the potential for renewables to grow and displace fossil fuels on a global scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making a false statement and obstructing a congressional investigation. Comey's legal team plans to file a motion to dismiss the case, arguing malicious and selective prosecution, citing President Trump's public calls for Comey's prosecution. The case stems from Comey's 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The judge has set a trial date for January 5, expressing skepticism about the complexity of the case. The case has also caused turmoil in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, with accusations of political interference.</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to introduce "pharmacy kiosks" at One Medical locations, starting in December, allowing patients to conveniently obtain prescriptions after their appointments. The self-service kiosks will carry a wide range of commonly prescribed medications, accessible via a QR code from the Amazon app. This initiative aims to address the issue of unfilled prescriptions by providing immediate access to medication at the point of care. The initial rollout includes One Medical locations in Los Angeles, with plans for further expansion in 2026. Amazon Pharmacy, launched in 2020, acquired One Medical in February 2023, integrating online pharmacy services with in-person primary care.</p>

          <p>A soybean farmer in Illinois, who supported President Trump, is feeling the strain of China's boycott of U.S. soybeans amidst the ongoing trade war. China, the largest consumer of soybeans, has halted purchases from American farmers, leaving farmers like Gaffner anxious and uncertain. While the Trump administration considers a financial aid package for farmers, Gaffner emphasizes that trade is preferable to aid, fearing the loss of established trade routes with China. The situation impacts not only farmers' bottom lines but also the local rural economy, with concerns for future generations.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has dismissed calls for a separate House vote to ensure timely military pay during the ongoing government shutdown. He argues that the House already passed a funding bill addressing this issue, placing the onus on the Senate to act. Johnson accuses Democrats of political posturing, while Democrats insist on including an extension of enhanced Obamacare subsidies in any funding measure. Military service members are among those required to work without pay during the shutdown, though they are expected to receive backpay once the situation is resolved. The military's next payday is on October 15, marking the first potential missed paycheck for troops.</p>

          <p>France is experiencing a severe political crisis, marked by the resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu and difficulties in passing the budget. Financial markets are reacting nervously, with higher risk premiums on French government bonds. Despite the crisis, Germany remains calm, emphasizing the importance of the Franco-German friendship. Macron's influence on the international stage is waning, but France remains a key player in Europe. The crisis could affect joint projects, such as the development of a joint fighter jet. The rise of far-right parties in both countries adds to the challenges.</p>

          <p>A major artificial Christmas tree importer warns of potential shortages due to trade war tariffs and weaker consumer demand. The National Tree Company has reduced its product imports by 25%, leading to potential supply issues and higher prices. CEO Chris Butler advises consumers to purchase holiday decorations early to avoid shortages. The warning comes amid concerns about reduced orders from retailers. The company is in discussion with the Trump administration to address the situation. The article also notes a decrease in container arrivals from Asia carrying holiday goods.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch announced a plan to abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes in England and Northern Ireland. The move aims to help millions achieve homeownership and unlock a fairer society. Badenoch claimed the plan would be funded by £47bn in planned savings from cuts to welfare, foreign aid, and the Civil Service. The announcement was part of a broader policy blitz aimed at differentiating the Conservatives from their opponents. Critics question the feasibility of funding the plan through proposed savings. The announcement has received mixed reactions.</p>

Police confirmed that Mr Daulby was shot by a police bullet which penetrated through the door of the synagogue. Al-Shamie, wearing a fake bomb vest, was shot dead by police outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation synagogue.
