The boy’s father paid tribute to his son, who he described as a “sweet and charming boy” who was “always smiling and laughing.” The incident involved a single-decker Stagecoach bus near the A&E entrance. The bus company and the local NHS trust expressed their condolences, and Kent Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the tragic event and appealing for witnesses.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has voided a lower court's criminal contempt order against Trump administration officials. The original order was issued by a district judge who found officials had willfully disregarded his directive to halt the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The 2-1 appellate decision represents a significant victory for the administration, which had argued the judge overstepped his authority. The ruling highlights the ongoing, intense conflict between the executive and judicial branches over immigration policy and presidential power.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a stern warning to U.S. courts considering challenges to his tariff policies, claiming they have had a “huge positive impact” on the stock market. He argued that a ruling against the tariffs at this stage would be impossible to recover from and could trigger a severe economic downturn comparable to the Great Depression of 1929. The comments come as a federal appeals court hears arguments on the matter, with legal challenges centered on whether the tariffs exceed the emergency powers granted to the president.

          <p>Bitcoin's historical four-year price cycle, which has long been dictated by its 'halving' events, is showing signs of breaking down. This shift is attributed to new market dynamics, including the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted significant institutional investment and altered typical price patterns. Analysts note that factors like a more supportive regulatory environment and reduced risk of major crypto-related collapses are also contributing to this change. While volatility is expected to remain, the era of predictable 80% crashes following market peaks may be over. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James as part of an investigation into her handling of civil cases against Donald Trump and the NRA. The probe is reportedly examining whether the civil rights of Trump or NRA executives were violated. A spokesperson for James condemned the move as a “weaponization of the justice system,” a criticism Trump himself has leveled against her. The subpoenas represent a significant escalation in the political and legal battles surrounding the high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>A deadline imposed by President Trump for Russia to end its war in Ukraine is set to expire, with the administration threatening to impose “secondary tariffs” of around 100% on Russia's trade partners. This move represents a significant escalation of pressure on Moscow, reversing an earlier, more conciliatory approach. U.S. and Russian officials are reportedly working on a last-minute deal to halt the conflict, though Trump has recently expressed disappointment with the progress.

The blaze ignited along the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties and remains 0% contained as of Friday morning. Firefighting efforts are being hampered by extreme heat, with temperatures forecast to reach 100°F, and dry conditions. The fire is one of several currently active across California, where experts say climate change has contributed to longer and more destructive wildfire seasons.</p>

          <p>A High Court in South Africa has ordered that the remains of former Zambian President Edgar Lungu be returned to Zambia for a state funeral, ruling against the wishes of his family. Lungu, who died in South Africa while receiving medical treatment, had a tense relationship with his successor, and his family wanted him buried in South Africa. The Zambian government insisted on its right to honor him with a state funeral in Lusaka and took the matter to court. The judge ruled that the state's right to honor a former president outweighs the family's personal wishes.</p>

          <p>The UK fashion retailer River Island has received court approval for a restructuring plan that will allow it to close 33 stores to avoid insolvency. The company warned it was at risk of running out of cash by the end of August due to multi-million pound losses driven by a customer shift to online shopping and higher operating costs. In addition to the store closures, the plan involves rent reductions at 71 other branches and redundancies at its head office. The move is intended to align the company's store footprint with current customer needs and secure its future.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has announced it will transition its controversial “Visit Rwanda” partnership away from commercial sponsorship. Instead, the relationship will now focus on football development through the club's youth academy in Kigali. The decision follows months of criticism and pressure related to the Rwandan government's widely reported support for the M23 rebel group in the neighboring DR Congo. While the contract's end date of 2028 remains, this change marks a significant response to concerns raised by human rights groups and the club's own fans.</p>

          <p>The competition to acquire Assura, a major landlord for the UK's National Health Service, has escalated as a U.S. private equity firm, KKR, urged the board to accept its offer. This comes as the UK's competition watchdog has stepped up its investigation into a rival £1.7 billion takeover bid from Primary Health Properties (PHP). The watchdog's probe is determining whether the PHP deal would substantially lessen competition in the primary healthcare real estate market. The situation creates uncertainty for Assura, which owns over 600 properties housing GP practices and hospitals across the UK.</p>

          <p>The price of gold futures surged to a record high after it was revealed that the U.S. will impose a 39% tariff on imports of certain cast gold bars from Switzerland. This policy clarification is a significant blow to the Swiss precious metals industry, which dominates the global refining market. The tariff makes it economically unviable to export these products to the U.S., a major and historic trading partner. The move has roiled commodity markets and is part of the Trump administration's broader, aggressive tariff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

While many fear being forced from their homes again, some also directed anger at Hamas for failing to negotiate an end to the war.

          <p>A stark contrast has emerged between the U.S. approach to climate change and a growing international legal consensus. The world's highest court recently affirmed that nations have a binding legal obligation to protect the climate, but the U.S. government announced plans to rescind the EPA's 2009 endangerment finding, the legal basis for most federal climate regulations. This article argues that the U.S. is moving in the opposite direction of the global community, abdicating legal responsibility for climate harm. This divergence sets up future legal battles and isolates the U.S. on the world stage.</p>

The company now projects negative same-store sales for 2025 and has lowered its revenue forecast, citing a “really, really rough quarter.” Executives attributed the poor performance to multiple factors, including challenges with a new loyalty program, weak consumer sentiment, headwinds from tariffs, and operational issues in its stores. The significant downward revision has severely shaken investor confidence in the company's trajectory.</p>
