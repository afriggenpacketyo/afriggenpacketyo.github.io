          <p>Ukraine and Russia convened for a second round of direct peace negotiations in Istanbul, focusing on a potential prisoner exchange. While both sides agreed to exchange sick and heavily wounded prisoners, as well as those under 25, they remained divided on key issues such as an unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine has proposed a 30-day ceasefire, which Russia rejected, preferring to discuss a "lasting peace" under conditions that Ukraine views as capitulation, including territorial concessions and military limitations. Despite the limited progress, the talks underscore ongoing efforts to find a resolution to the conflict, although significant obstacles remain. </p>

          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime. According to court documents, Soliman confessed to planning the attack for a year, waiting until his daughter's graduation to carry it out. He allegedly told investigators he wanted to kill all Zionist people and used Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower, resulting in injuries to eight people. The attack is being investigated as an act of terrorism, with authorities recovering multiple unlit Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer containing gasoline. </p>

          <p>The debate surrounding women in combat roles continues, with the Army recently implementing gender-neutral basic fitness standards for most combat specialties. This decision follows Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's insistence on maintaining high standards for combat roles, despite the integration of women into these positions since 2015. Captain Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, shares her experiences and challenges the notion that standards were lowered for women. Vanasse emphasizes that lethality involves more than just physical fitness, including tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership. </p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that shares of off-price retailer TJX are currently undervalued and represent a buying opportunity. Despite exceeding expectations in its first quarter fiscal 2026 earnings report, TJX stock has experienced a recent dip. Cramer believes this decline is an anomaly, as TJX has demonstrated the ability to maintain or cut prices amid rising costs for other retailers. JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss also raised the firm's price target for TJX, citing confidence in the company's global market share gains and strong inventory position. (not investment advice) </p>

Critics argue that the elections could lead to a partisan judiciary vulnerable to corruption and organized crime. Turnout was expected to be lower than in previous national elections. </p>

The dollar has come under pressure since Trump’s tariff policies were implemented. Concerns about the economic impact of the trade war have intensified, particularly after Trump announced a 50% tariff on steel. (not investment advice) </p>
