          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator revealed a capital raise of 1.35 billion euros, supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, aims to bolster Eutelsat's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state is set to become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. Eutelsat has also secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation, positioning itself as a strategic player in military communications and cyber-resilience. </p>

          <p>Pro-Palestinian activists broke into RAF Brize Norton and used repurposed fire extinguishers to spray red paint into the engines of two military planes, claiming they also caused further damage with crowbars. The group, Palestine Action, referenced RAF flights over Gaza from its base in Cyprus, asserting that the supply planes had been put "out of service" while they were able to "evade security and arrest." The Ministry of Defence condemned the vandalism of Royal Air Force assets and is working with the police on the investigation. RAF Brize Norton serves as the hub for UK strategic air transport and refuelling, including flights to RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.</p>

          <p>MPs are set to decide on the future of a bill that could legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, with a final stage vote in the House of Commons. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, proposes allowing terminally ill individuals to end their lives under specific conditions, including being over 18, living in England or Wales, and having a prognosis of fewer than six months to live. The bill has undergone revisions, including replacing the High Court judge approval with a three-person panel and clarifying palliative care options. The Isle of Man passed its Assisted Dying Bill in March 2025, while Jersey is also considering similar legislation.</p>

          <p>As missile attacks persist in Israel, residents are increasingly concerned about the impact of the conflict with Iran on the war in Gaza and the fate of hostages still held there. Life in Tel Aviv is disrupted by frequent alerts from Israel's Home Front Command and air raid sirens warning of incoming ballistic missiles from Iran. While most missiles are intercepted, some have hit buildings, causing damage and raising fears among Israelis. Despite the fear, many Israelis are trying to maintain normalcy, but the situation is described as unsettling, especially with concerns about the increasing deadliness of the missiles.</p>

Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the welfare bill but argued that cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit should not be part of the solution. The government's bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit. The government expects to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030 through these reforms, while Foxcroft said she could not support cuts to disabled people's finances.</p>

Additionally, the operational use of ChatGPT contributes to energy consumption, with an application handling 11 million requests per hour producing approximately 12.8t of COâ‚‚ per year. Research indicates that models requiring deeper reasoning and more polite prompts generate more emissions, highlighting the environmental implications of AI usage.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart Shares Decline Following Criticism of 'Blind Boxes'</h2>

          <p>Pop Mart International Group's shares experienced a decline after the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, criticized its business model of selling 'blind boxes.' The newspaper warned against the addictiveness of these collectibles, which use unpredictable rewards to encourage repeat purchases. Minors are particularly susceptible, prompting calls for stronger regulations to protect them. The People's Daily's stance reflects the thinking of China's policymakers, who have previously issued directives to curb addiction to blind boxes among young children.</p>

          <p>China has expressed its willingness to collaborate with the United States on anti-drug efforts and the repatriation of illegal immigrants, which are key priorities for U.S. President Donald Trump. During a meeting between Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong and U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue, Wang emphasized the need for "mutual respect" from Washington. Both sides expressed a commitment to practical collaboration in law enforcement areas, with the aim of achieving outcomes that benefit both countries. The two nations held several meetings last year to discuss closer cooperation and have established anti-drug hotlines to share information.</p>

          <p>Right-wing populists are expressing anger towards cities, from Los Angeles to London, due to their liberal elites, immigrants, net-zero policies, and outspoken municipal leaders. Conservative populism often reveres the nation state, countryside, and traditional family, while cities represent fluid loyalties and complex politics. Many big cities have shifted politically since the 1990s, becoming strongholds of the center-left, leading to a sense of defeat among the right. The article suggests that urban resistance to right-wing populism is valuable as an act of defiance and encouragement to others.</p>
