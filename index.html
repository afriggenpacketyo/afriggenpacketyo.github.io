          <p>A Sacramento television station, ABC10, was struck by gunfire in a drive-by shooting, with no injuries reported. A 64-year-old suspect, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, was arrested and faces both local and federal charges, including interfering with a radio communications station. A handwritten note found references prominent political and media figures and Jeffrey Epstein, suggesting a possible political motive. The incident has drawn condemnation from officials, including California's governor, as an attack on democracy and the free press.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reflects on her presidential campaign, attributing some of its struggles to limited time and friction with then-President Biden's staff. She recounts a distracting pre-debate phone call from Biden and details her vice-presidential selection process, noting Pete Buttigieg was her first choice but was deemed a political liability. Harris also describes Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro as having an "unrealistic expectation" for the VP role, a characterization his spokesperson has disputed. The book provides her perspective on key moments, including a widely criticized gaffe on "The View."</p>

          <p>Alaa Abdel Fattah, a leading British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist and political prisoner, has been pardoned and released after almost six years in an Egyptian prison. He was arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news," a charge widely seen as politically motivated. His release follows a request from the National Council for Human Rights and an extensive hunger strike by his mother that brought international attention to his case. While his family celebrates his freedom, his release highlights the ongoing detention of tens of thousands of political prisoners under President Sisi's government.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 00:00:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Europe's foreign policy is adrift, caught between an unpredictable United States and a strategically assertive China. Previously, Europe's approach to China was largely economic and followed Washington's lead, but the unreliability of the transatlantic relationship under Trump has forced a difficult reckoning. The author posits that Europe must now define its own China policy on issues like trade, technology, and security without a clear "north star" from the U.S. The war in Ukraine further complicates this, as China's implicit support for Russia creates a direct security interest conflict for Europe, leaving it in a precarious geopolitical position.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scholar Advocates for a Unique Foreign Relations Framework Independent of Western Theories</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zheng Yongnian, a prominent academic in China, is urging the country to develop its own unique foreign relations knowledge system, distinct from dominant Western international relations theories. In an interview with People's Daily, he argued that such a framework is strategically necessary for China to effectively explain its foreign policy and global role. This call aligns with Beijing's Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar world order based on sovereign equality and shared development.

          <h2>Resident Expresses Concern Over Invasive Bamboo Overrunning Native Plants in Public Park</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Reddit user highlighted the ecological threat of invasive species by sharing a photo of invasive bamboo overwhelming native pawpaw trees in a public park. The post drew sympathetic comments, reflecting broader concerns about non-native plants damaging local ecosystems, property, and the economy. Invasive species cost the U.S. an estimated $26 billion annually by destroying infrastructure, harming crops, and spreading disease. Experts suggest that one of the most effective preventative measures is for individuals to cultivate native plants in their own gardens, which supports local wildlife and prevents the spread of invasive varieties.</p>

          <p>The military-led governments of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger have jointly announced their immediate withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC). In a shared statement, they condemned the court as an "instrument of neo-colonialist repression" and stated they would no longer recognize its authority. This move echoes past criticisms from other African leaders about an anti-African bias at the ICC, as nearly all of its cases have involved the continent. The three nations, which have strengthened ties with Russia, intend to establish their own "indigenous mechanisms" for justice amid escalating regional violence.</p>

          <p>Porsche's stock price dropped by over 7% after the company announced that delays in its electric vehicle (EV) rollout would negatively impact its 2025 earnings projections. The German automaker is slowing its transition to EVs due to weakening demand and will extend the production of its combustion engine models into the 2030s. This strategic shift reflects broader challenges facing European carmakers, including intense competition from Chinese EV brands and a slowing luxury market. Porsche cited U.S. import tariffs and the decline in China's luxury market as contributing factors to its reduced profit margin forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes a eulogy delivered by Stephen Miller for Charlie Kirk, characterizing it as a perfect encapsulation of the Trump administration's ideology. The speech framed political conflict in stark, moralistic terms, depicting Trump's supporters as forces of pure good and their opponents as irredeemable evil destined for destruction. The author contrasts Miller's Manichean worldview with Barack Obama's past calls for unity, arguing that Miller's rhetoric aims to deepen national divisions rather than bridge them. The analysis concludes that the speech used the tragedy of Kirk's death as a pretext to escalate a state-sponsored war on perceived political enemies.</p>

Writer Jack Thorne, known for "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," praised the real-life journalists whose work exposed a troubling relationship between the press, police, and politicians. Thorne highlighted that unlike the Post Office story, which gained traction through dramatization, the phone hacking scandal was a case where journalism successfully held its own industry to account. The series aims to explore the complex details of the scandal from the perspective of both the investigating reporter and a police detective.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's decision to reject stripped-down AI chips from Nvidia marks a significant turning point in the global tech landscape. The U.S. strategy of allowing sales of less powerful chips was intended to slow China's progress while maintaining its dependence on American suppliers. However, Beijing's refusal signals a shift from accepting technological inferiority to prioritizing the development of an indigenous, self-sufficient semiconductor industry. The author contends that U.S. restrictions have inadvertently strengthened the case within China for complete technological independence, viewing it now as a national necessity rather than a distant goal.</p>

This centuries-old form of ecological stewardship, dating back to the 11th century, helps maintain the health of the forest and its other animal inhabitants.

          <p>The annual Fat Bear Week competition has commenced, with 12 brown bears from Alaska's Katmai National Park and Preserve vying for the title of the fattest bear. The online public vote celebrates the bears' successful pre-hibernation weight gain, a crucial factor for their winter survival. This event, which has grown from a single-day contest in 2014, allows people worldwide to learn about the park's ecosystem and its inhabitants via livestreams. For the bears, getting fat is essential, as they can add up to 700 pounds and rely entirely on these fat stores to survive the long hibernation period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant policy change for the H-1B visa program, raising the application fee for employers to $100,000. This new fee applies only to new applicants, not renewals, and is a one-time payment required before an H-1B petition can be filed. The H-1B program allows U.S. companies to employ highly skilled foreign professionals, particularly in STEM fields, when qualified American workers are unavailable. The tech and finance industries, which rely heavily on these visas, will be significantly impacted by the massive fee increase. (not investment advice)</p>

These candidates will undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The selection comes at an uncertain time for the agency, with budget cuts and the planned retirement of the ISS, but officials expressed confidence that the new astronauts will be part of America's return to the Moon.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 20:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order labeling antifa a "domestic terrorist organization," directing his administration to investigate and thwart the group's alleged illegal operations. The move follows the assassination of Charlie Kirk, though officials have not established a link between the killing and any left-wing groups. Legal experts note that the U.S. lacks a specific statute for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations, making the order's practical legal impact unclear. Antifa is generally understood as a decentralized movement of anti-fascist activists rather than a formal, structured organization, which complicates enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing federal funding for animal testing, having canceled nearly $28 million in grants as it pushes for alternatives. This effort is driven by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. leading the charge. While activists celebrate the move to end what they see as cruel and wasteful experiments, some scientists and patient advocates express concern. They argue that animal research remains crucial for developing life-saving drugs and that alternative testing methods are not yet advanced enough to fully replace it.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that the FDA will recommend pregnant women limit their use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, due to a potential link to autism. This contradicts the consensus of major medical groups like ACOG, which maintain the drug is the safest pain reliever for pregnant women and that no causal link has been established. The FDA's actual notice to physicians was more measured, calling it an "ongoing area of scientific debate." The announcement also included FDA approval for the drug leucovorin to treat some autism symptoms, despite limited research on its effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air, nearly a week after the show was suspended following comments the host made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which Disney said was to avoid "inflaming a tense situation," sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, drawing criticism from Hollywood figures and civil liberties advocates. The initial suspension came after the FCC chairman threatened to review ABC's broadcast licenses. While Disney has reversed its decision, some major affiliate station groups like Sinclair have stated they will not immediately resume airing the show.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed President Trump to dismiss a Democratic commissioner from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and has agreed to hear a broader case concerning the president's authority over independent agencies. This decision sets the stage to potentially overturn a nearly century-old precedent, *Humphrey's Executor*, which has historically shielded such agencies from political interference. The dissenting justices warned that this ruling could undermine the independence and bipartisanship of institutions designed by Congress to be insulated from presidential control. The court will hear arguments on the matter in December.</p>

However, the country faces steep challenges as a late entrant, including fierce competition and the need to develop a deep support ecosystem of suppliers and infrastructure. While progress has been made, experts say success will depend on overcoming logistical hurdles and creating sustainable, long-term policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Pierson was reportedly attempting the Palisades Traverse, a highly technical and demanding route that crosses five peaks over 14,000 feet. He was last known to be heading toward Inyo County after separating from a hiking partner in early August and was officially reported missing on September 10. Search and rescue teams have been scouring the area near Temple Crag, a landmark on his planned route, but have so far been unsuccessful in locating him.</p>
