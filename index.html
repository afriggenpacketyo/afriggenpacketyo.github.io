          <p>U.S. airlines are aggressively competing for international business-class customers by introducing upgraded suites and enhanced amenities. American Airlines is launching new business-class suites with sliding doors and wireless charging, while United Airlines is introducing "Polaris Studio" seats with ottomans and larger 4K screens. This trend reflects airlines' strategies to attract high-paying customers amid weaker demand for lower-priced tickets. The upgrades are aimed at providing a more luxurious experience and attracting corporate clients who may not be permitted to purchase first-class tickets, but the upgrades may not come cheap for customers.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams has been awarded â‚¬100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The court found that Mr. Adams was defamed by allegations that he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a claim Adams denies. The BBC argued it was fair and reasonable reporting on a matter of public interest, but the jury found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith. Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable and criticized its alignment with the British state in Ireland, while the Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that President Donald Trump can terminate the protected status of approximately 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela while an appeal of the president's order is ongoing. Trump had directed the Department of Homeland Security to end "categorical parole programs" that shielded these immigrants from deportation. This decision allows the administration to proceed with its plans to remove protections for these immigrants while the legal challenges continue, leaving their future uncertain.</p>

          <p>Smoke from Canadian wildfires is expected to move over the U.S., impacting air quality in the Upper Midwest and potentially reaching as far as the East Coast. Over 90 fires are burning out of control across Canada, leading to air quality alerts in parts of Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Satellite imagery shows a large smoke plume stretching 3,000 miles from Montana to the Atlantic Ocean, and air quality is expected to be unhealthy for sensitive groups in several cities. This event is reminiscent of the 2023 Canadian wildfires that caused widespread air quality issues across the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for its aggressive actions against Harvard University, including stripping the university of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification and demanding five years of video footage of protest activity. These actions are viewed as an attempt to nationalize a private university and suppress free expression. The administration justifies its actions by citing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, but critics argue that proper enforcement procedures have not been followed. The moves have sparked concerns about academic freedom and the potential for similar actions against other institutions.</p>

          <p>United States export restrictions targeting Chinese plane makers will likely delay China's efforts to develop its own jet aircraft engines. The restrictions affect technologies linked to jet engines that could be used in Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China's (Comac) civilian aircraft. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned the US actions, while analysts believe China will now increase its investment in developing a domestic jet engine. The restrictions may slow down the production of China's C919, its first single-aisle passenger jet, which has been in commercial operation for two years.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has described Gaza as "the hungriest place on Earth," highlighting the dire humanitarian situation amid ongoing conflict. A German Middle East expert has called for an arms embargo on Israel, citing concerns about the humanitarian crisis. The expert argued that criticism of Israel is insufficient and that concrete actions, such as a weapons ban and adjustments to trade relations, are necessary. These comments come amid increasing international scrutiny of the situation in Gaza and its impact on the civilian population.</p>

Despite the positive financial results, Costco leaders acknowledged challenges related to tariffs, which have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments. The company is working to mitigate the impact of tariffs by rerouting goods, sourcing more private-label items domestically, and negotiating prices with suppliers. Costco is trying to maintain competitive prices and attract customers through its membership model, discounted gas, and bulk discounts.</p>

          <p>Experts are criticizing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, arguing that genetic research has been more fruitful. They claim the apparent rise in autism rates is mainly due to broadened diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, not environmental factors. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism and are developing gene therapies that could improve the lives of those with profound autism. They fear that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental toxins could divert funding from promising genetic research.</p>

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs has been hailed as a victory for the separation of powers and the rule of law. The court found that Trump did not have the authority to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The decision emphasized that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce. The ruling blocks the IEEPA tariffs nationwide, but the administration has appealed the decision.</p>
