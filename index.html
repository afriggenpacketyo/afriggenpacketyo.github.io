          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, recently released from detention, asserted his determination to continue speaking out against President Trump's policies. Mahdawi, a green card holder, was detained during his citizenship interview under a rarely used law, sparking concerns about First Amendment rights. He maintains that his activism for justice and peace should not be misconstrued as undermining U.S. policy, referencing his leadership in protests against the Israel-Hamas war and his denouncement of antisemitism within the movement. Mahdawi's lawyers argued his detention was retaliatory for protected speech, and a judge ordered his release, though the case remains open for review. Optimism score does not reflect any financial advice.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to convert Alcatraz back into a federal prison has been met with disbelief and criticism, with tourists and local officials questioning the practicality of the idea. The former prison, now a popular tourist attraction, is in a state of disrepair, lacking basic amenities and requiring extensive renovations. Critics point out the high costs associated with running a prison on an island and the vulnerability to escape attempts. The article notes that the city of San Francisco, already facing a budget deficit, relies heavily on tourism revenue from Alcatraz, making the proposal even more unpopular. </p>

          <p>Secretary of Education Linda McMahon sent a scathing letter to Harvard University, criticizing the school's handling of antisemitism, plagiarism scandals, and the hiring of controversial figures like former Mayors Bill de Blasio and Lori Lightfoot. McMahon stated that Harvard has "made a mockery" of higher education and advised the university to refrain from applying for future federal grants, asserting that they will not be provided. The letter also questioned the origins of students engaging in violent behavior and expressing contempt for the U.S., while criticizing the university's remedial math program and instances of "ugly racism." Harvard responded by stating that the administration's demands would impose improper control and that they would continue to defend against illegal government overreach.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which was used to justify deporting Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime does not direct their actions or movement to the U.S. The release of the memo further undermines the Trump administration's rationale and raises questions about the criminal investigation opened against media outlets that reported on the intelligence findings. The administration defends the policy, stating that it works to deport violent criminals to keep America safe.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport. Schumer cited a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors to the chaos. He also questioned the FAA's decision to offer bonuses to air traffic controllers at certain towers but not to those in Washington, Philadelphia, or New York. The problems at Newark have been attributed to a shortage of air traffic controllers and equipment outages, with one runway under construction further limiting capacity.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation hurts public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools.

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to trim the IRS workforce has resulted in almost one-third of its tax auditors leaving the agency through March, according to a report from the U.S. Treasury Department's watchdog. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts have led to a significant loss of revenue agents, who perform audits, potentially impacting the federal government's ability to collect tax revenue. Critics argue that reducing the auditing force could lead to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, ultimately costing the government more than it saves. The analysis also questions the effectiveness of DOGE's efforts, given that the tax agency is responsible for collecting the bulk of the nation's revenue.</p>
