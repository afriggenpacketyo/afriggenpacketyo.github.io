          <p>China's leading chip manufacturers, SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, experienced a sharp decline in stock prices following warnings about potential challenges in the latter half of the year, attributed to ongoing US-China trade tensions. SMIC anticipates a revenue decrease in the second quarter due to production fluctuations impacting average selling prices. Hua Hong Semiconductor also voiced concerns about the uncertain business environment, citing customer demand, procurement costs, and supply chain issues. Despite these concerns, Hua Hong expects a revenue increase for the second quarter. Optimism is tempered by geopolitical factors affecting the industry.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is under fire for allegedly blocking bonus payments to laid-off employees, despite the bonuses being earned for high performance in the previous year. The department's decision to only pay bonuses to active employees as of June 2 prevents those who were laid off or took buyouts from receiving their expected compensation. The decision has sparked outrage among current and former employees, who feel it is unfair to deny them bonuses they worked hard to earn. HHS initially called the reporting fake news but later clarified that all awards it is obligated to pay, including to separated employees, will be honored.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress and the White House are preparing a budget that prioritizes extending tax cuts for the wealthy while proposing deep cuts to discretionary programs like education, health, and housing. The plan aims to eliminate waste and fraud but lacks concrete strategies for achieving significant savings, relying on unrealistic expectations. Critics argue the budget will disproportionately harm the poor and underfund crucial long-term investments in areas such as energy, scientific research, and healthcare. The proposed cuts have sparked concern among some Republicans and led to accusations of dishonest budgeting practices.</p>

The debate centers on whether a single judge should have the power to halt a federal policy nationwide or if injunctions should be limited to the specific plaintiffs in a case.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, despite calls from the opposition and some members of the ruling party. The decision reflects concerns that a tax cut would strain the government's fiscal resources. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi reiterated that the consumption tax is a key revenue source for debt-ridden Japan and that reducing it would be inappropriate. The ruling coalition plans to outline items for a new economic package before the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

Slot confirmed that Conor Bradley will start at right-back against Arsenal as he prepares for Alexander-Arnold's exit. He acknowledged that while it's disappointing to lose a good player, the team will adapt and another player will step up.</p>

Experts estimate losses to be close to $1 billion or more a year, and cargo theft is expected to increase in 2025.
