          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed UN investigators that the U.S. maintains legal responsibility for Venezuelan migrants deported to its CECOT mega-prison. This contradicts public statements from both governments, which had claimed the men were beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The revelation comes from court filings by lawyers representing the migrants, who argue the Trump administration has been dishonest with the courts and the public regarding its control over the individuals. The case challenges a controversial deal where the U.S. paid El Salvador to house the migrants.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly kept its policy rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' predictions of a cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably moving toward its 2.5% target. This decision comes despite recent data showing inflation at a four-year low, prompting disappointment from the country's treasurer. The move caused a dip in the S&P/ASX 200 index and a strengthening of the Australian dollar amid a broader national economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully improved hearing in children and adults with a genetic form of deafness, according to a clinical trial. The therapy works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene into the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial showed considerable hearing improvement after six months, with younger participants responding best. The treatment was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for future therapies for other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

Driver distraction is a major factor, with a high percentage of drivers admitting to using phones or engaging in other activities while in parking lots.

The South Korean tech giant is struggling to meet the demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential for the artificial intelligence systems dominated by Nvidia. The company has reportedly fallen behind competitors like SK Hynix in securing orders from Nvidia, contributing significantly to the disappointing earnings forecast. Weakness in its chip foundry business and the impact of U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China were also cited as factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with the e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partnership was misleading. The lawsuit, filed by a former student, claimed a cybersecurity boot camp was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to refund tuition to hundreds of students and implement more transparent practices. The move is a significant development amid growing scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that the Trump administration's priorities, reflected in its latest budget and policy bill, are dangerously misplaced. The author criticizes the focus on immigration enforcement, such as the ICE raid in MacArthur Park, while cutting funding for medical research and weather forecasting agencies like NIH and NOAA. The piece contends that these actions create a "political agenda of provoking fear" and ignore real threats like climate change and public health crises. The author suggests the government's actions are a "silly military parade" that fails to address the country's actual needs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have cut tens of thousands of jobs in August. The VA now states that staff reductions achieved through a hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition will be sufficient to meet its goals. The department is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year. The initial plan had drawn criticism, with some lawmakers arguing that significant cuts would inevitably impact veterans' care and benefits.</p>

The new route, W121, lies just 4.2 nautical miles from the unofficial median line separating mainland China and Taiwan. China's Civil Aviation Administration claims the adjustment is a technical measure to ease air traffic pressure and improve safety. However, the unilateral activation of flight paths in the sensitive region is viewed by Taipei as a potential security risk and a source of increased tension.</p>

The review confirmed that no one entered Epstein's cell at the time of his death and that no credible evidence was found to warrant investigations against uncharged third parties.

The funds will be redirected toward investing in drones and other smart systems better suited for the future of warfare.

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons has warned that a massive influx of drugs is destabilizing the prison system in England and Wales. Criminal gangs are using methods like drones to smuggle contraband to inmates, who are often bored due to overcrowding and a lack of rehabilitative activities. According to the report, the "uncontrolled levels of criminality" are overwhelming inexperienced staff. A survey found that 39% of prisoners said it was easy to get drugs, a situation the watchdog says hinders rehabilitation and poses a national security threat.</p>
