          <p>A political standoff is underway in Texas as Democratic state representatives have left the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan. Former President Donald Trump has publicly supported the effort, claiming Republicans are "entitled" to five additional congressional seats based on his electoral performance in the state. In response to the events in Texas, Democratic governors in states like New York and California have indicated they may pursue their own partisan redistricting efforts. The situation highlights the intense national battle over gerrymandering ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir's stock surged after the company reported its first-ever billion-dollar revenue quarter, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. The software analytics firm raised its full-year financial forecast, attributing the strong performance to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and government contracts. U.S. commercial revenue nearly doubled year-over-year, and CEO Alex Karp described the results as a "once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter." The positive earnings report signals robust growth in the AI sector and strong investor confidence in the company's trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance, signaling confidence in its cost-reduction strategies and strong business performance. The pharmaceutical giant also reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by sales of its Covid products and other key drugs. The updated outlook accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and existing tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The company's ability to raise its forecast despite these pressures suggests a resilient operational and financial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions between the United States and India have escalated as the Trump administration threatens to impose substantial tariffs on Indian exports. The pressure stems from Washington's demand that New Delhi cease importing Russian oil and comply with sanctions on Iran, actions the U.S. claims are funding Russia's war in Ukraine. Indian officials have defended their trade policies as sovereign decisions crucial for their national interests and have criticized the U.S. for weaponizing trade tariffs. This diplomatic friction marks a significant downturn in a historically strong strategic partnership, with experts suggesting calm negotiation is needed to manage the relationship.</p>

In contrast, Taco Bell continued its strong performance with a 4% same-store sales growth, driven by popular new menu items. The company is implementing leadership changes at KFC to address its domestic challenges in a difficult consumer environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The political standoff in Texas over a Republican redistricting plan has raised significant legal questions about the governor's power to compel absent lawmakers to return. After more than 50 Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum, Governor Greg Abbott threatened to have them arrested and removed from office, citing a nonbinding attorney general opinion. However, political science experts and the state constitution suggest that such actions have little legal standing, as Texas DPS lacks out-of-state jurisdiction and removal from office typically requires a legislative vote. The conflict underscores the constitutional limits of executive power in a legislative dispute.</p>

          <p>As Japan marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there is a growing urgency to preserve the stories of the aging survivors, known as "hibakusha." With the average survivor now over 86 years old, their numbers are rapidly declining, creating a challenge for passing on firsthand accounts of the nuclear attacks. To address this, museums and a new generation of "successors," including young people, are actively working to convey the horrors of the bombings to tourists and the world. Their efforts aim to ensure the message of peace and the devastating reality of nuclear weapons are not forgotten.</p>

          <p>This article provides a timeline of former President Donald Trump's various public statements about the possibility of seeking a third term in office, a move prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. While Trump has often joked about running again and suggested he might be "entitled" to another term, he has more recently downplayed the idea, stating he intends to be a two-term president. Despite the constitutional barriers, some supporters have advocated for an amendment to allow it. Experts suggest that such talk may be a political strategy to maintain influence and counter the perception of being a lame-duck president.</p>

The study found that 71% of Gen Z workers prefer a hybrid model, citing the importance of in-person connection, mentorship, and a clearer understanding of their role within an organization. Experts suggest that feelings of loneliness and a desire for career development, which can be more challenging in a remote setting, are driving this preference.

          <p>The United Nations is sounding the alarm on a severe hunger crisis in northern Nigeria, where millions, including at least 5 million children, are facing acute malnutrition. The crisis is driven by a combination of protracted insecurity from jihadist groups and bandits, which prevents farming, and dwindling international aid funds. Displaced villagers report being unable to cultivate their land due to constant threats of violence and kidnapping, leading to a collapse of the rural economy. Analysts argue that the root cause is a failure of governance and security, which has left communities vulnerable and dependent on aid that is now disappearing.</p>

In a letter to the new FAA administrator, she is requesting data from recent evacuations and an update on congressionally mandated safety tests that were due in May.

          <p>In an escalation of the state's redistricting battle, Texas Republicans have formally voted to authorize the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on a new electoral map. Governor Greg Abbott ordered state troopers to locate and return the absent members, though the civil arrest warrants are only enforceable within Texas. The more than 50 Democrats, who are currently in Illinois, aim to block a plan that could create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats.

          <p>One year after massive student-led protests led to a change in government in Bangladesh, the family of Abu Sayed, a 24-year-old student shot and killed by police, is still demanding justice. Sayed's death, captured on live television, became a pivotal moment in the uprising that ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. While an interim government is in place and a tribunal has been established, the process is slow, and a sense of disillusionment is growing across the country. For Sayed's parents, the pain remains raw as they wait for accountability for their son's death.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his search for the next Federal Reserve chair has been narrowed to four individuals, confirming that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in the running. While Trump did not name the remaining candidates, former Governor Kevin Warsh and National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett are considered likely contenders. The announcement comes after Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's surprise resignation, which gives Trump another opportunity to appoint a member to the Fed's board. The president has been openly critical of current Chair Jerome Powell and has aggressively pushed for lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>The cleanup is ongoing across Scotland after Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, left thousands of homes without electricity. As of Tuesday morning, 22,000 properties, primarily in the Highlands, Moray, and Aberdeenshire, were still without power after gusts of up to 90mph caused widespread, tree-related damage. Power company SSEN has restored service to 50,000 homes but expects some complex repairs to extend into Wednesday and Thursday. The storm also caused significant travel disruption, with numerous train routes and roads closed due to fallen trees and debris.</p>

          <p>Independent MP and former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has criticized his former colleague, Communities Secretary Angela Rayner, for approving the sale of eight community allotments since the general election. Allotments, small plots of land rented for growing produce, are legally protected from development without ministerial consent. Corbyn, an avid allotmenteer, warned that selling these "precious green spaces" is perilous, especially when many people lack access to gardens. A government spokesperson stated that sales are only approved when "clearly necessary," but the decision has drawn criticism for sacrificing community assets, in some cases for housing developments.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is reportedly directing prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury to investigate the origins of the FBI's 2016 Trump-Russia inquiry. This criminal probe follows long-standing grievances from former President Trump and his allies, who have alleged misconduct by intelligence and law enforcement officials. The move is likely to intensify concerns that the Justice Department is being used for political purposes, as multiple previous investigations have already concluded that the original FBI inquiry was properly justified, despite some procedural flaws.
