          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants involved in the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot cases. Tillis's opposition is likely to prevent Martin's nomination from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire on May 20. Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, signaled that Martin's nomination was in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney responded to President Trump's repeated suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state by declaring that Canada is not for sale and never will be.

While emphasizing the importance of a continued partnership, Carney made it clear that Canada intends to maintain its sovereignty and negotiate with the U.S. on its own terms.</p>

          <p>During an Oval Office meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's suggestion of Canada joining the U.S., emphasizing that Canada is "not for sale, ever." Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada, which has caused strain in U.S.-Canada relations, already tense due to trade tariffs. Carney stressed the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two nations, focusing on trade and security talks conducted on Canada's terms. Trump, however, remained open to the idea of acquiring Canada despite Carney's rejection.</p>

          <p>In response to a missile strike near Israel's main airport by Yemen's Houthi militia, Israeli fighter jets bombed the main international airport in Sanaa. The strikes targeted civilian planes, the departures hall, the runway, and a military air base. The Houthis, backed by Iran, have declared an 'air blockade' on Israel and vowed to retaliate. This NY Times article notes that the conflict between the Houthis, the US, and Israel strengthens the group's political standing in Yemen, which is already facing a severe humanitarian crisis, and that the Houthis are adapting by using smuggling operations to maintain access to weapons and supplies. </p>

          <p>A new report details that Senator Chuck Schumer and his allies are working aggressively to stretch a Senate map that offers precious few opportunities for Democrats to reclaim a majority in 2026, recruiting deep into the country’s most conservative corners to find viable candidates in red states. Despite this, Democrats have grown more bullish about their midterm prospects as President Trump’s approval rating has sagged. However, Democrats also confront the brutal reality of a map where all but two of the 22 Republican seats up for election are in states that Mr. Trump carried by at least 10 percentage points in 2024.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy anticipates that U.S. onshore oil production has likely peaked and will begin to decline due to recent low crude prices, potentially affecting the nation's energy security. The drop in oil prices, influenced by recession fears and increased OPEC+ production, has led Diamondback to reduce its oil drilling activities. While the company plans to increase its spending on natural gas production, the overall outlook suggests a challenging period for U.S. oil producers. Despite the concerns, U.S. crude oil prices rose more than 4% to nearly $60 per barrel Tuesday as domestic production is expected to decline.</p>

          <p>An equipment failure at the air traffic control facility that oversees Newark Liberty International Airport caused a temporary loss of radar and communication with aircraft, leading to significant delays and cancellations. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association stated that controllers were unable to see, hear, or talk to planes during the outage. The FAA is working to improve the reliability of the telecommunications equipment and some controllers have taken time off to recover from the stress. United Airlines has announced it will cut flights from Newark to help alleviate the strain on the system.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough, nearing his 99th birthday, is releasing a new film titled Ocean, which he considers one of his most important works, emphasizing the ocean's role in combating climate change. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Attenborough's lifetime and warns that time is running out to save it. It also shows graphic footage of the damage caused by bottom trawling and its contribution to carbon dioxide emissions. Despite the bleak outlook, Attenborough remains optimistic about the ocean's capacity to recover with global protection efforts.</p>

While design, development, and brand management will remain in America, production will continue overseas to maintain affordable prices. Mattel has been diversifying its global manufacturing for nearly a decade to reduce its dependence on China, aiming for no single country to account for more than 25% of its sourcing within two years.</p>

          <p>While inflation has not yet declined to policymakers' target level, some pockets of the U.S. economy have seen prices fall recently. Consumers have seen prices deflate for airfare, produce, household goods, electronics and gasoline, for example, according to the consumer price index, an inflation gauge. However, economist Mark Zandi warns that these lower prices are not here to stay, and that the tariff situation could cause the opposite to happen. Zandi urges consumers to enjoy these lower prices, because they're not here to stay, and that they're going away pretty quickly, over the next few weeks and months.</p>

The company is still worth owning as a geopolitical hedge and for its long-term trends, but the stock may struggle to gain traction in the near term, due to some operational issues in Coterra's operations in Culberson County, Texas.</p>

The same order specifically targeted the Smithsonian Institution, claiming that it had “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” with “narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”</p>
