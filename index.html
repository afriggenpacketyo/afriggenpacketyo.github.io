          <p>The United Kingdom hosted several European foreign ministers for critical discussions on the war in Ukraine, focusing on repelling Russian aggression, bolstering European security, and securing a lasting peace. The meeting, the sixth of the "Weimar+" group, included representatives from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the EU. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy is expected to announce sanctions targeting those supporting the Russian invasion, underscoring the urgency of collective security in light of Washington's policy shift under President Donald Trump's new term. Lammy emphasized the need for allied protection of sovereignty, peace, and Ukraine in this "once-in-a-generation moment.</p>

          <p>Germany and Israel are marking the 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic relations, a milestone overshadowed by the ongoing war in Gaza. Israeli President Isaac Herzog is visiting Berlin to commemorate the occasion with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, including a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial. Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged Germany's special responsibility for Israel's security, echoing Angela Merkel's concept of "reason of state." Despite growing criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians continue to assert Israel's right to defend itself following the 2023 Hamas attacks, though fulfilling this maxim remains challenging due to humanitarian concerns and international law obligations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports of the Trump administration potentially accepting a luxury plane from the Qatari royal family have sparked ethical debates regarding the acceptance of gifts from foreign powers. US presidents have a long history of receiving gifts, ranging from Queen Victoria's Resolute Desk to animals, with most items being processed through a complex bureaucratic system. Under US law, gifts valued over $480 are considered gifts to the United States and must be logged and disposed of by the White House Gift Unit. While foreign leaders often use gifts to strengthen relationships, ethical concerns arise when gifts appear to influence official acts, highlighting the need for transparency and adherence to constitutional guidelines.</p>

          <p>The United States and China concluded a round of trade talks in Geneva, with both sides signaling progress toward easing trade tensions. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer described the outcome as a "deal," while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the discussions were constructive and an "important consensus" was reached. The White House issued a statement announcing a "China Trade Deal," but details were scarce, leaving financial markets and businesses awaiting specifics. These negotiations mark the first significant attempt to de-escalate tensions following President Trump's imposition of heavy tariffs on Chinese imports and China's retaliatory duties on American products, which have disrupted trade and impacted the global economy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin to a personal meeting in Turkey to discuss a ceasefire, amidst ongoing efforts to mediate peace. Zelenskyy expressed hope for a ceasefire starting Monday and stated his willingness to meet Putin in Turkey on Thursday, following calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for Ukraine to accept Russia's offer of direct talks. This proposal comes after European leaders advocated for a 30-day truce, which Moscow effectively rejected, instead pushing for direct negotiations. While the Kremlin has not confirmed Putin's attendance, Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a lasting ceasefire to pave the way for diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is hosting President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva of Brazil and other Latin American officials in Beijing, signaling China's intent to maintain a strong presence in the region amid US efforts to strengthen its own influence. This move underscores China's role as an economic partner and a geopolitical counterweight to the United States. While official statements may not explicitly target President Trump, the implications are clear, as Latin American countries seek independence and self-determination. China's growing trade relationship with Latin America, particularly in commodities, reflects a strategic effort to diversify alliances and reduce dependency on Washington.</p>

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, currently detained in The Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, is running for mayor of Davao City in Monday's midterm elections. Despite his detention, Philippine law allows candidates facing criminal charges to run for office unless convicted and having exhausted all appeals. The elections are pivotal for the political future of Duterte's daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, who faces an impeachment trial in the Senate. The outcome of the elections could determine the dominance of the Duterte family in Philippine politics and influence the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>House Republicans released a plan to cut Medicaid by $880 billion over a decade to fund tax cuts, sparking strong opposition from Democrats who warn that millions of Americans will lose healthcare coverage. The proposal includes work requirements for able-bodied adults and stricter eligibility verification processes. While Republicans claim these measures will eliminate waste and abuse, Democrats argue they are an attack on vulnerable populations. The legislation also rolls back Biden-era green energy programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposals would cause 8.6 million people to become uninsured, leading to a significant political battle over healthcare.</p>

The council claims the slide was part of a draft version that was never shown to children and was removed following professional feedback.

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, despite facing charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court, remains highly popular at home. He is expected to win another term as mayor of Davao City in the upcoming midterm elections. His arrest and extradition to The Hague have divided the Philippines, with some supporting the international investigation while others view him as a victim of political persecution. His case has become a campaign tool, with supporters rallying for his return and criticizing the current administration.</p>

          <p>Britain is increasing its defense spending, aiming to improve local jobs and prosperity, with Barrow-in-Furness serving as a potential model. BAE Systems, a major employer in Barrow, is expanding its operations due to increased military spending, partnering with local and national governments to rejuvenate the town. This strategy aims to address infrastructure problems, attract workers, and stimulate economic growth. The government hopes to replicate this model across Britain, ensuring that defense spending benefits poorer regions and generates positive effects on local communities.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another system outage, causing widespread delays and cancellations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that the outage was due to a momentary failure of a backup air traffic control system, prompting a 45-minute ground stop. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the number of flights will be temporarily cut to address the airport's ongoing issues, and a new direct line from Newark to the Philly TRACON is being built to improve air traffic control. Passengers expressed frustration with the repeated disruptions.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at restricting federal payments to abortion providers could face opposition from moderate House Republicans. The measure would make "large groups who provide abortion services" ineligible for federal Medicaid dollars. Concerns have been raised about the definition of these groups and the fact that the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. Several moderate Republicans have indicated they may oppose the final bill if the provision is included.</p>
