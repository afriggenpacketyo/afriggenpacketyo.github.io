          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pursuit of AI talent continues with plans to hire Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, after an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Sutskever's $32 billion AI startup. Gross and Friedman will join Meta, contributing to AI product development under Alexandr Wang, while Meta gains a stake in NFDG, their venture capital firm. Zuckerberg's aggressive recruitment tactics highlight the intense competition for AI expertise among major tech companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, all vying to develop advanced language models and achieve artificial general intelligence. This move follows Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI to secure Wang and other top engineers, escalating the AI talent war and underscoring the strategic importance of AI development in the tech industry. The company aims to bolster its AI capabilities with these strategic hires.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, initially a Category 3 hurricane, weakened to a tropical storm after making landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca. Despite the downgrade, officials warned of continued dangers from intense rains, predicting life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. President Claudia Sheinbaum reported that while there were no immediate reports of deaths, some damage occurred, including flooded streets and damaged boats and buildings in Oaxaca. The state-owned utility company CFE reported power outages affecting over 123,000 users in Oaxaca, with service partially restored by late morning, while Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara noted significant damage to roads and highways. Residents have begun cleaning up debris, and authorities remain vigilant about the risk of further flooding.</p>

          <p>Maternity services at two Leeds hospitals have been downgraded from "good" to "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), citing significant risks to women and babies. The CQC's unannounced inspections substantiated concerns from staff and patients regarding quality of care and staffing levels, leading to a warning notice requiring immediate action for improvement. Concerns included inadequate risk management, unsafe environments, and a blame culture that discouraged staff from raising concerns, with the BBC having spoken to 67 families who reported inadequate care. The CQC will closely monitor the trust's services, including through further inspections, to ensure patient safety during the implementation of improvements, while the trust has committed to making improvements including recruitment and addressing cultural issues.</p>

The homeowner, ZoÃ« Cadman, expressed her surprise and gratitude on social media, highlighting Doodle's bravery in protecting the home. This incident follows a similar event earlier in the year where a black bear crashed through the ceiling of a Kentucky home, underscoring the increasing encounters between humans and wildlife.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise rates. This figure exceeded economists' expectations and surpassed April's reading of 3.5%, marking the 38th consecutive month that inflation has exceeded the BOJ's 2% target. The BOJ held rates at 0.5% after its recent monetary policy meeting but indicated that wage increases are being passed on to selling prices, supporting core inflation. While Governor Kazuo Ueda suggested further rate hikes once there is more confidence in underlying inflation approaching 2%, the bank forecasts a potential weakening of inflation due to an economic slowdown.

The incident occurred amidst heightened anxiety in Los Angeles due to increased immigration enforcement actions in immigrant communities. The Dodgers' denial followed reports of numerous DHS vehicles with masked officers near the stadium, leading to protests and a police presence. This incident comes after criticism of the Dodgers for not speaking out in support of the immigrant community amid the recent raids, leading the team to announce plans to assist affected communities later in the week.</p>

          <p>A national security expert suggests that bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant might not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The exact depth and protective measures of the facility, believed to be 300 feet inside a mountain and reinforced with concrete, are not fully known. While attacking Iran's nuclear enrichment program could cripple its nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it, as the Iranian government possesses the knowledge, experience, enriched uranium, and centrifuges to resume operations elsewhere. Despite the International Atomic Energy Agency's resolution stating Iran has breached its non-proliferation agreements, continued military strikes are not seen as a viable solution for achieving an Iran without nuclear weapons.</p>

Lively's motion to keep the messages confidential was denied, with the judge noting that Lively had indicated Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the film's working environment.

          <p>Memphis Mayor Paul Young was targeted in a stalking and attempted kidnapping incident, with a man charged after allegedly scaling a wall and knocking on the mayor's door. Police recovered a taser, gloves, rope, and duct tape from the suspect's vehicle, raising concerns about the potential for violence. The incident follows politically motivated shootings in Minnesota, prompting Young to emphasize that political violence cannot become the norm. The mayor highlighted the link between angry online rhetoric and real-life violence, noting the increasing levels of threats reported by state and local officeholders in recent years.</p>

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being reimagined as a space for healing, art, and reparative history, aiming to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation is collaborating with a narrative studio to explore participatory forms of interpretation, inviting people to connect with the weight of the site through feeling rather than just understanding. The project includes a site-specific sculpture memorializing "hush harbors," gathering places where enslaved people worshiped and resisted, and brings together descendants of enslavers and the enslaved for dialogue. The new exhibit features everyday objects telling the stories of free Black families in post-Emancipation Alabama, aiming to make history personal and reflect human dignity.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, the UK's potential involvement is being scrutinized, with questions arising about whether it will be drawn into the conflict. Despite calling for de-escalation, the UK's influence is limited, especially after recent strains in relations with Israel and its exclusion from advance notification of Israeli actions. The UK possesses strategic assets in the Middle East and Indian Ocean, including the Diego Garcia base and RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could play a role in any potential US-led military action. The article analyzes how these assets might be involved, considering the legal constraints on UK military involvement and the ongoing diplomatic efforts by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.</p>

The last official U.S. timeline was in July 2024, when it was estimated Iran could enrich enough uranium for a weapon in one to two weeks.
