        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100 international aid organizations have issued a joint statement warning of "mass starvation" in Gaza, attributing the crisis to the Israeli government's ongoing siege. The groups, including Doctors Without Borders and Oxfam, report that aid workers themselves are now lining up for food and that children are suffering from record rates of acute malnutrition. The statement highlights the severe depletion of essential supplies and the deadly risks involved in distributing aid, with the Gaza Ministry of Health reporting a rising death toll from famine. The dire humanitarian situation is described as a result of restrictions and delays imposed on aid entering the territory.</p>

This initiative tokenizes ownership of funds, aiming to create more efficient and seamless transactions by reducing the friction found in traditional markets. Major fund companies like BlackRock and Fidelity have already joined the project, which builds on the growing acceptance of digital assets. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds offer a yield, making them an attractive option for large investors to park cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger is scheduled for formal sentencing after pleading guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students: Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves. The hearing will feature victim impact statements from the students' families, who have expressed divided opinions on the plea deal that spared Kohberger the death penalty. While the agreement outlines four consecutive life sentences without parole, the judge is not bound by its terms. The case, which drew national attention, relied on DNA evidence, surveillance footage, and cell phone data linking Kohberger to the crime scene.</p>

          <p>Shortstop Ethan Holliday, the No. 4 overall pick in the MLB draft, has agreed to a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies that includes a record-breaking $9 million signing bonus for a high school player. The 18-year-old from Oklahoma comes from a prominent baseball family, as he is the son of former All-Star Matt Holliday and the younger brother of Baltimore's Jackson Holliday. This bonus surpasses the previous high school record and matches the fourth-highest for any draft pick since 2012. Holliday's impressive pedigree and outstanding high school performance have positioned him as a top prospect in professional baseball.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has concluded its investigation into the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The final report identifies the primary causes as the aircraft being significantly overweight with moose meat and the drag created by a set of moose antlers affixed to the wing strut. Investigators noted that this combination, along with turbulent wind conditions, likely resulted in the plane having insufficient power to clear the terrain. The report also highlighted that carrying antlers externally requires FAA approval, which was not documented for this aircraft.</p>

Council Chairman Phil Mendelson has indicated he would have "no problem" with the Washington Commanders changing their name back to the Redskins, a move recently advocated by President Donald Trump. Mendelson suggested that previous opposition to the team returning to a D.C. stadium site was more related to former owner Dan Snyder than the name itself. This follows Trump's statements threatening to block a deal for a new stadium at the RFK site unless the name is reverted. The team, now owned by Josh Harris, changed its name in 2020 amid racial tensions and has stated it is moving forward with the Commanders moniker.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores How Expanded Presidential Powers Could Be Wielded by Future Administrations</h2>

          <p>This article examines the long-term implications of the Trump administration's broad assertions of executive power, questioning how a future Democratic president might use these same authorities. The analysis suggests that while a new administration could reverse many policies, such as by firing Trump-appointed officials or reconstituting dismantled agencies, the damage may be difficult to undo completely. The author posits that these expanded powers are inherently more destructive than creative, making it easier to dismantle institutions than to rebuild them. This could lead to a volatile 'pendulum' of policy swings between administrations, ultimately favoring a conservative agenda of reducing government size.</p>

          <p>The appointment of David Geier to an HHS role investigating the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink has drawn intense scrutiny due to his history of publishing controversial and methodologically flawed research. Geier and his late father were known for promoting a discredited theory linking a vaccine preservative to autism, using data from the same database he is now tasked with examining. Critics point to a fundamental statistical error in several of their papers that invalidates their conclusions. This appointment by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time supporter of Geier's work, has raised concerns that the position will be used to resurrect debunked claims.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as 'El Hotzo,' of charges related to online posts he made following the 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Prosecutors had accused him of condoning a criminal offense for posts that joked about the attempt, arguing they constituted hate speech. However, the judge ruled that the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and did not demonstrate an intent to disturb public order. The court affirmed that in a liberal democracy, it is desirable for people to be able to argue about different opinions, even controversial ones.</p>

Finch, who still lives at home and cannot drive, has faced criticism about his lack of experience but dismisses it as ageism. He became interim leader after Reform UK emerged as the largest party in the May local elections. In an interview, Finch stated he was inspired by his party's platform and believes his appointment demonstrates that merit, not identity, is what matters for leadership roles within the party.</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered by a schoolboy on a remote Scottish beach has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a remarkable history. Originally HMS Hind, the ship was a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in 1749 that participated in the American War of Independence. After its military service, it was sold and renamed, beginning a new life as a whaling ship in the Arctic. Archaeologists and local researchers used dendrochronology and archival records to piece together its identity, tracing its journey from naval battles to its eventual wreck off the island of Sanday in 1788.</p>

A key point of contention is the dumping of cheap Chinese electric vehicles in the EU market. Adding to the tension are China's export curbs on essential rare earth minerals and its tacit support for Russia, which recently led the EU to sanction Chinese firms for the first time.</p>

The judge cited a psychological assessment concluding that Phillips was under "extreme emotional distress" at the time of the killing as a key reason for the lenient sentence.
