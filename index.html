          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, world leaders are calling for restraint and de-escalation. The strikes, which Israel claims targeted Iran's nuclear program, have heightened regional tensions, especially considering that leading nuclear scientists and high-ranking military officials were reportedly killed. U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer and French Foreign Minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot emphasized the need for diplomacy and stability, while German chancellor Friedrich Merz affirmed Israel's right to defend itself but urged both sides to avoid escalation. Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim condemned the attack, and China offered to assist with de-escalation efforts, while Russia condemned the strikes as unacceptable violations of sovereignty. </p>

          <p>Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations it claims were related to Iran's nuclear program, which has sparked market fears of a broader conflict. The strikes resulted in the deaths of Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and two leading nuclear scientists, Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi. Iran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has vowed to retaliate, stating that Israel will face a bitter fate as a result of the attacks. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted and that there was no increase in radiation levels at the Natanz site.</p>

          <p>Private schools have lost a High Court challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Lawyers representing families and schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The court ruled that Parliament made the policy after full debate and as a manifesto commitment, and the government is entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. The government estimates the policy will generate Â£1.8 billion annually by 2029/30, which will be used to improve standards in the state sector.</p>

NIHE chief executive Grainia Long anticipates the number of those seeking help will continue to rise and has expressed concern for households vulnerable to exploitation, especially those with children, while also noting that the supply of appropriate housing is limited.</p>

He is one of several protesters facing federal charges related to the protests, which have intensified following the deployment of U.S. marines and the national guard to LA.

          <p>Christian music star Michael Tait, known for his hit song "God's Not Dead," faces allegations of sexual assault from three men, with four others alleging inappropriate behavior. Tait admitted to leading a "double life" involving alcohol, cocaine, and unwanted touching of men in a statement that appears to respond to an earlier report detailing similar allegations. The allegations contrast with Tait's public image, cultivated over nearly four decades, as a role model of Christian piety. The men who have come forward claim that Tait's alleged drug use and abusive behavior were the "biggest open secret in Christian music."</p>

The NSNSD has been instrumental in projects such as improving lighting at the Grand Canyon and reducing snowmobile noise at Yellowstone.

          <p>The California Public Health Department has reversed its decision to suspend the license of Brier Oak on Sunset, a Hollywood nursing home, after determining that the two AA violations occurred outside the required 24-month window. The state investigation found that staff oversights at Brier Oak led to the deaths of two residents in 2022 and 2024. Despite the rescission, license suspension efforts are still proceeding against six other Los Angeles County facilities. A judge recently awarded $1.29 million in arbitration to the family of one of the deceased residents, finding that the facility was severely understaffed and should not have admitted her.</p>

          <p>The author argues that U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla's recent manhandling by federal agents during a press conference is indicative of the anti-Mexican sentiment prevalent in MAGA America. Padilla, a son of Mexican immigrants, was forcibly removed for attempting to question Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about immigration raids. The author connects this incident to a long history of anti-Mexican sentiment in the U.S., fueled by stereotypes and political rhetoric. They contend that the obsession with the Mexican flag at protests reflects a deep-rooted fear of Mexicans as invaders, despite their assimilation and contributions to American society.</p>

San Diego County will launch a program targeting behavioral health majors, with loans forgiven for graduates working in the field for five years or more. Several states are exploring similar initiatives, but challenges remain, including high startup costs and concerns about unintended consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A military parade celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary in Washington, D.C., costing $45 million, has drawn criticism for prioritizing spectacle over honoring the service members themselves. The author, a 25-year Army veteran, argues that the focus should be on the men and women in uniform, not the equipment. He cites other recent events, such as Trump's graduation speech at West Point and his Memorial Day message, as examples of the commander-in-chief's failure to properly honor the military. The author emphasizes the importance of a modest acknowledgment of the military's unique role in defending the country, while also recognizing the sacrifices of civilians and other forms of service.</p>

          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully taking apart buildings to salvage reusable materials, is gaining momentum as a climate solution. This approach keeps waste out of landfills and reduces the carbon footprint associated with new construction. While deconstruction and reuse industries have emerged in cities like Portland and Boulder, challenges remain in scaling the practice, including the need for local infrastructure to process and distribute salvaged materials and the higher costs compared to traditional demolition. Some local governments are implementing policies to incentivize or require deconstruction, with Boulder, Colorado, reporting that over 83% of construction waste has been diverted from landfills since adopting a deconstruction ordinance in 2020.</p>
