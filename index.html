          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's urgent plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, some already on planes. The judge deemed the "wee hours" holiday weekend effort "extraordinary" but justified, as lawyers argued it bypassed legal protections and denied children the right to seek humanitarian relief. While the Justice Department claimed the repatriations were requested by Guatemala and families, attorneys contested this, highlighting the risk of abuse or persecution upon return. This article details a critical legal intervention safeguarding migrant children's rights and challenging the administration's aggressive immigration policies, emphasizing the need for due process.</p>

          <p>During his administration, Donald Trump undertook an extensive redecoration of the Oval Office, infusing it with his signature "Trump touches" characterized by numerous gold accents. The article highlights the addition of gold trimming across the ceiling, door frames, and fireplace, alongside an increased display of gold trophies and personalized items. This aesthetic overhaul, reportedly paid for personally by Trump, sparked divided opinions, with supporters viewing it as a symbol of a new "golden age" and critics labeling it "vulgar." The redesign is presented as a reflection of Trump's real estate background and a notable departure from previous presidential styles, leaving a distinct mark on the nation's center of power.</p>

Comprising at least 20 vessels, the convoy aims to "open a humanitarian corridor and end the ongoing genocide of the Palestinian people," transporting essential supplies like food, water, and medicine. This marks Thunberg's second attempt to reach Gaza after a previous deportation by Israel. The mission highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where famine was officially confirmed in August, and challenges the Israeli maritime blockade, drawing international attention to the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared Washington D.C. a "crime-free zone" on Truth Social, attributing the change to his federal crackdown. This article reports on Trump's posts, which cited recent arrest figures, including an MS-13 gang member and individuals for assault on federal officers and sexual assault. The declaration follows his invocation of a public safety emergency two weeks prior, placing the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying National Guard troops and federal agents. Preliminary data reportedly showed a 40% drop in robberies and auto break-ins, reflecting a substantial increase in enforcement activity.</p>

          <p>Will Smith delivered a dramatic pinch-hit, walk-off home run, securing a 5-4 victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Arizona Diamondbacks and preventing a three-game sweep. This article highlights the team's "fight" after manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration over recent performances. Despite Yoshinobu Yamamoto's strong pitching being nearly squandered by a late-game three-run blast from Tanner Scott, the Dodgers rallied. Smith, who had been in a slump, hit a 420-foot missile, marking a crucial moment for the team as they aim to solidify their position in the National League West standings heading into September.</p>

          <p>Sergio Gor, a close aide to Donald Trump who published his books and fundraised for his campaign, has been appointed as the next U.S. Ambassador to India, also overseeing relations with other South and Central Asian countries. This article highlights the mixed reactions to his appointment, especially in India, due to strained relations over Trump's tariffs and the broad regional mandate that could expose India to Washington's overreach on issues like Kashmir. Experts question Gor's limited diplomatic experience but acknowledge his direct access to Trump could be an asset in policy logjams, though it may also be perceived as a slight by Delhi.</p>
