          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action, labeling it a terrorist organization. Cooper stated the group's activities, which include claims of responsibility for property damage and violent disorder, go beyond legitimate protest, citing a manual that allegedly encourages creating cells and evading law enforcement. The ban has led to over 700 arrests, sparking criticism from rights groups like Amnesty International, who argue the measure is a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression. Palestine Action is challenging the ban in court, with a hearing scheduled for November.</p>

          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet under the hood of a 2015 Ford Edge he was repairing. The wallet belonged to a retired Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan who had lost it 11 years earlier while working on the vehicle's electrical systems. After finding the owner through Facebook, the mechanic mailed the wallet back, which still contained $15 in cash and $250 in Cabela's gift cards that the company confirmed are still valid. The well-traveled wallet was returned to its owner after the car had accumulated over 150,000 miles.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, rapidly intensified into a Category 5 storm before slightly weakening to a powerful Category 4 with 150 mph winds. The storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may lead to re-strengthening. While its outer bands are impacting the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches and warnings of flash flooding, its core is forecast to remain at sea. Current projections show the hurricane passing north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands before curving away from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a conceptual design for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a revolutionary single, rotating "scissor wing." This design aims to overcome the traditional conflict between low-speed lift and high-speed drag by adjusting the wing's angle based on speed. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the fuselage at Mach 5, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This innovative approach could solve a long-standing aerodynamic challenge that even NASA has explored.</p>

          <p>James Craig, a dentist from Aurora, Colorado, was found guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her. Over several weeks, he allegedly laced her protein shakes with substances including arsenic and potassium cyanide, leading to her death in March 2023. The investigation revealed that Craig had researched undetectable poisons online and was having an affair with an orthodontist he met shortly before his wife fell ill. Despite the defense's arguments that he was suicidal and purchased the poisons for himself, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

These reasons include a lifetime of repressing personal desires to be "good," perfectionism stemming from childhood trauma, and having poor boundaries developed from being parentified as a child. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can serve as a catalyst, as can the grief from a recent significant loss, which often triggers a re-evaluation of life and relationships. The article suggests self-advocacy is key to avoiding these emotional breaking points.</p>

          <p>The Republican governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of their states' National Guard troops to Washington D.C. This action is in support of the Trump administration's initiative to address what it has declared an emergency regarding crime and homelessness in the capital. West Virginia is sending 300-400 troops, South Carolina is deploying 200, and Ohio is contributing 150 military police. The move comes as President Trump placed the D.C. police under federal control, a decision that has drawn criticism and protests from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's transformation from a tropical storm into a powerful Category 5 hurricane occurred through a process known as rapid intensification, where its wind speeds increased by over 58 mph in just 24 hours. This explosive growth was fueled by perfect conditions, including very warm ocean waters exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit and low wind shear. Climate change is making such events more common by heating the oceans, which provides more energy for storms. While this rapid strengthening complicates forecasting and emergency planning, Erin is currently projected to curve away from the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has stated that Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire is complicating efforts to end the war, ahead of his visit to Washington D.C. His comments follow President Donald Trump's recent shift in position, now advocating for a direct peace agreement rather than a preliminary ceasefire after meeting with Vladimir Putin. Reports suggest Putin's offer involves Ukraine ceding the Donbas region in exchange for Russia freezing other front lines. European leaders have expressed concern that Trump may pressure Zelensky into accepting unfavorable terms, while Trump has publicly advised the Ukrainian leader to "make a deal."</p>

Some parents recommend meticulous planning, such as buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items in advance to freeze for later use. Other tactics include organizing the fridge to use items with the nearest expiration dates first, batch cooking meals like bolognese to save time and money, and portioning out snacks into daily bags to prevent them from being eaten all at once. Local food pantries that provide surplus food for a small fee have also become a vital resource for many families.</p>

The Met Office reports that this summer is on track to be one of the warmest on record, leading to drought conditions in some regions.

This led to the body being exhumed after nearly a year, but by then it was too decomposed to determine a cause of death.

          <p>Villa Baviera, a German-style village in Chile, is grappling with its dark past as Colonia Dignidad, a secretive cult that collaborated with the Pinochet dictatorship. The colony, led by the abusive Paul Schäfer, was a site of forced labor, sexual assault, and the torture of political prisoners. Now a tourist destination, the Chilean government plans to expropriate part of the land to create a memorial for the regime's victims. This plan has divided the remaining residents, some of whom see themselves as victims and fear displacement, while victims' families and other former residents support the creation of a site of remembrance to prevent such atrocities from being forgotten.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma delivered a statement victory, stopping veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their headline fight. Itauma sent Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hook, and the referee waved off the contest just 119 seconds into the bout. This impressive win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0, with 11 of those victories coming by knockout. The performance strengthens his position as a major rising star in the heavyweight division and a potential future title contender, while raising questions about the 37-year-old Whyte's future in the sport.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, moving beyond Westernized dishes to offer authentic, diverse regional cuisines from areas like Hunan, Sichuan, and Xinjiang. These brands, having achieved success in China's competitive domestic market, are using Singapore as a launchpad for global expansion, testing their concepts on the city-state's diverse population. By providing immersive dining experiences and showcasing the sophistication of Chinese gastronomy, they are challenging old stereotypes and potentially serving as a form of soft power. This culinary wave may help soften China's global image at a time of geopolitical tension.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" chronicles the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, capturing his last major burst of creativity. The collection includes hits like "Burning Love" and soulful ballads such as "Separate Ways," recorded during the dissolution of his marriage. The article reflects on this period, highlighting a missed opportunity for Presley to co-star with Barbra Streisand in "A Star Is Born," a role that friends believe could have revitalized his career. Instead, this era marked a time when the rock and roll pioneer became increasingly disconnected from the musical culture he helped create before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Sunderland started their return to the Premier League with a decisive 3-0 victory over West Ham, marking their first win in the month of August in the top flight since 2010. After a significant summer spending spree of around £132 million on new players, the newly-promoted club delivered a strong performance that defied preseason predictions of a quick relegation. Goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor secured the win at a jubilant Stadium of Light. The result provides an optimistic start for a club that has spent the last eight years in the lower divisions of English football.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern Gaza Strip ahead of a renewed offensive targeting what it describes as Hamas's final stronghold in Gaza City. The Israeli agency for civilian affairs, COGAT, stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment for this purpose would resume through the Kerem Shalom crossing. The announcement did not specify a timeline for the relocation but follows increased Israeli military operations on the outskirts of Gaza City. This development comes as families of hostages held in Gaza call for protests to demand an agreement for their release.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, Marah Abu Zuhri, who was evacuated to Italy for medical treatment due to severe emaciation, has died. She suffered a cardiac arrest less than 48 hours after arriving at a hospital in Pisa, which reported she had experienced severe weight and muscle loss. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and potential famine conditions. She was part of an Italian government program that has brought over 180 sick and injured Palestinians to Italy for care since the start of the war.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. Samsung's wider range of products at various price points also contributes to its gains. Apple is expected to respond with a slimmer iPhone model and potentially its own foldable device by 2026.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues for the urgent need to uphold and strengthen the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which is currently under threat from deregulation efforts. While the act has successfully helped some species recover, many marine mammals like the North Atlantic right whale remain critically endangered. New threats, including climate change, ship strikes, and pollution, are causing populations like the West Coast gray whales to crash. The author contends that weakening these protections for the sake of energy development or fisheries is short-sighted, as the health of marine mammals is a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean and the planet.</p>
