          <p>A U.S. envoy for Donald Trump visited a contentious Israeli-backed aid distribution site in Gaza, accompanied by the IDF, to "learn the truth" about its operations. The visit has been labeled a "media stunt" by some Gazans, as it occurs amid reports of hundreds of Palestinian deaths near these sites, a figure disputed by the site's operators. International journalists are blocked from independently entering Gaza, making verification of claims from either side difficult, while the UN warns of mass starvation in the territory.</p>

Popular incentives now include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity, reflecting a more professionalized and competitive environment for high-net-worth management.</p>

          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, even as profits declined nearly 44% from the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's financial performance was bolstered by record production levels, particularly a notable 8% jump in U.S. output. The recently finalized acquisition of Hess Corporation is expected to further boost earnings by the end of the year and contribute to significant cost-saving measures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed considerable weakness as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of forecasts and marking a significant slowdown. Compounding the concerns, job gains for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating that hiring was much weaker than previously thought. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, fueling speculation that the Federal Reserve may face increased pressure to cut interest rates amid escalating trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A persistent malvertising campaign on Facebook is exploiting the reputation of popular cryptocurrency brands and using images of celebrities to trick users into downloading malware. According to security researchers, the deceptive ads lead to convincing clone websites that prompt visitors to download a fake "desktop client." This client then installs a malicious system on the victim's device, designed to evade detection by traditional security software while stealing information.</p>

          <h2>Storm Floris Named by Met Office, Forecast to Bring Strong Winds and Rain to UK</h2>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, the sixth named storm of the season, which is expected to hit the country on Monday. The storm is forecast to bring heavy rain and strong winds, with potential gusts of 60-70 mph in northern coastal and hilly areas. Because trees are in full leaf at this time of year, there is an increased risk of them being toppled, which could lead to travel disruptions and power outages.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans have unveiled a new congressional map that aggressively redraws district lines to favor their party, potentially giving them five new seats. The plan, which follows a request from Donald Trump, packs Democratic voters into fewer districts while creating new, heavily Republican areas. Critics and voting rights groups argue that the map is an extreme gerrymander that illegally diminishes the voting power of the state's growing Hispanic and other non-white populations.</p>

          <p>Two Federal Reserve governors who voted against holding interest rates steady this week have publicly explained their reasoning for dissenting. Both Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller argued for an immediate quarter-point rate cut, stating that the central bank's "wait and see" approach is overly cautious. They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary and that delaying a rate cut poses a significant risk to the labor market and overall economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Swiss government and business community have expressed shock and regret after the U.S. imposed a surprisingly high 39% tariff on Swiss imports. The Alpine nation had expected a rate closer to 15%, similar to deals struck with the EU and Japan, making the announcement a "devastating" blow to its export-reliant economy. While officials are seeking a negotiated solution before the August 7 implementation date, the move has already caused the Swiss franc to slide and hit the stocks of major exporters.</p>
