          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:25:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has won a significant arbitration case against Exxon Mobil concerning the rights to Hess Corporation's oil assets in Guyana. The ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce dismisses Exxon's claim of first refusal, removing a major obstacle to Chevron's planned $53 billion acquisition of Hess. While Exxon expressed disagreement with the decision, it stated it would respect the outcome, which provides clarity and a positive outlook for the major energy deal to proceed. The resolution of this dispute has been closely watched by the energy sector.</p>

          <p>A recent Hollywood auction saw iconic movie memorabilia sell for staggering prices, highlighting the high value of cinematic history. The "Rosebud" sled from "Citizen Kane" was sold for nearly $14.75 million, making it one of the most expensive props ever auctioned. Additionally, a bullwhip used by Harrison Ford in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" and once gifted to Princess Diana fetched $525,000, underscoring the strong market for culturally significant film artifacts. The event demonstrates the enduring power and financial worth of nostalgia in popular culture.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has introduced a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for all visitors requiring non-immigrant visas, effective from the 2025 fiscal year. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and is intended to be reimbursed if the visitor complies with all visa conditions, though experts express skepticism about the ease of reimbursement. The new requirement has raised concerns among travel associations due to a lack of clarity on its implementation and collection process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran UK politician Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party again after reiterating controversial comments about racism. The suspension follows a BBC interview where she stood by her 2023 remarks differentiating racism against people of color from prejudice faced by Jewish, Irish, and Traveller communities. A government minister denied claims the Labour leadership wants her out, stating that an internal investigation is underway and due process will be followed. This development adds to ongoing tensions within the party regarding antisemitism and internal discipline.</p>

          <p>Russian authorities have arrested a dual U.S.-Russian citizen at a Moscow airport, accusing her of attempting to smuggle a Colt pistol and ammunition in her luggage. The woman, who was traveling from the U.S. via Turkey, was stopped during a customs check in the "green lane" for passengers with nothing to declare. This arrest occurs amid heightened tensions and a history of Russia imprisoning American citizens, adding another layer to the strained diplomatic relations between the two countries.

          <p>The European Union has approved a new package of sanctions against Russia that includes lowering the price cap on its crude oil, aiming to further restrict Moscow's war revenues. The original G7-EU cap, set at $60 per barrel, will be reduced to a new dynamic level, reportedly just above $47 at current prices. This measure is part of the EU's 18th sanctions package and is designed to intensify economic pressure on Russia while trying to maintain stability in global oil supplies amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>
