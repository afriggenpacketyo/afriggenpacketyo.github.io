            <p>Seattle Mariners outfielder Victor Robles has suffered a fractured shoulder after colliding with the outfield wall while making a highlight-reel catch. An MRI confirmed a small fracture in the humeral head of his left shoulder, sidelining him for at least 12 weeks, and potentially jeopardizing his entire season if surgery is required. The injury occurred during a game against the San Francisco Giants, where Robles made a leaping catch before slamming into the wall, forcing him to leave the field on a cart. Robles had been performing well this season, batting .273 with three stolen bases in 10 games.</p>

            <p>The offshore yuan experienced a significant drop, reaching a record low against the US dollar, following the announcement that the United States would implement additional tariffs on imports from China. China's central bank allowed the yuan to weaken, setting its daily fixing rate below a key threshold for the first time since September 2023. This move reflects market concerns over escalating trade tensions between the two countries. A Goldman Sachs report suggests that the People's Bank of China might tolerate a mild depreciation of the yuan in response to the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A public feud has erupted between Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, with Musk calling Navarro a "moron" and Navarro suggesting Tesla is merely a car assembler. The dispute centers on tariffs and Tesla's reliance on foreign parts. However, Tesla is significantly more vertically integrated than most automakers, manufacturing many of its own components. Data suggests Tesla uses a high percentage of American-made parts, making Navarro's claims questionable. While tariffs may disrupt the auto industry, analysts believe Tesla will be less affected than its rivals.</p>

            <p>A federal appeals panel expressed sympathy for veterans' claims that the VA has failed in its duty, but also raised concerns that a trial judge may have overstepped his authority in ordering the agency to build more housing on its West Los Angeles campus. The panel heard arguments regarding a complex class-action case where a judge invalidated leases of VA land to private entities and ordered the agency to construct thousands of housing units for disabled veterans. The appeals court stayed that order after the government appealed and scheduled it for an expedited hearing. The panel will have multiple issues to decide.</p>

            <p>Consumers in Canada and Denmark are increasingly boycotting American products in response to President Trump's tariffs and policies. Canadians are using apps to identify and purchase local alternatives to US goods, while Danes are canceling subscriptions to US streaming services and seeking out European alternatives. The boycott is driven by dissatisfaction with Trump's trade policies and actions, such as his desire to acquire Greenland. However, experts believe the economic impact of the boycott may be limited, as past boycotts have often faded over time.</p>

            <p>A new Universal theme park will be built in the UK on the site of the former Kempston Hardwick brickworks near Bedford, expected to open in 2031. The government has confirmed the multi-billion-pound investment, estimating it will generate 28,000 jobs and £50bn for the UK economy by 2055. The park will include a theme park, a 500-room hotel, and a retail complex. The park will be the first Universal-branded destination in Europe. Universal has already bought 476 acres for the project, but could buy more land to increase the plot to about 700 acres, which would enable it to link the site with transport routes.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's access to presidential events after the White House blocked the news agency in a dispute over the term "Gulf of America". District Judge Trevor McFadden said the administration's restriction on AP journalists was "contrary to the First Amendment", which guarantees freedom of speech. The dispute arose when the AP refused to adopt the administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the "Gulf of America" in its coverage, following an executive order by President Donald Trump.</p>

            <p>The State Department is facing criticism for cutting over $1.3 billion in foreign aid, including terminating USAID contracts supporting food, water, and medicine delivery to Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Lebanon. The World Food Programme (WFP) warns that these cuts could amount to a "death sentence for millions." A State Department spokeswoman defended the decision, stating that most funding to the WFP remains active and that some programs were terminated due to concerns that funding was benefiting terrorist groups or due to the administration moving away from cash-based assistance.</p>

Industry whistleblowers believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relablled. Data suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce. The Department for Transport said they "take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information".</p>

The Army celebration has fueled speculation that President Donald Trump will try to turn the event into the kind of grand military parade he wanted in his first administration. If a parade were to take place, it would significantly impact the city's infrastructure, according to city officials.</p>

            <p>As Tesla shares plummeted for a fourth straight day, CEO Elon Musk let loose on President Donald Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro. Musk wrote, "Navarro is truly a moron" in response to the trade advisor's remark that Tesla is more of a "car assembler" than a car manufacturer. Musk's attacks on Navarro represent the most public spat between members of Trump's inner circle since the president took office in January. For the Tesla CEO, the name-calling appears to be tied to business conditions. (not investment advice)</p>
