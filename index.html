Proposed legislation could restrict access to subsidies for making and using rechargeable batteries, potentially undermining the industry's competitiveness.

          <p>Video footage from French President Emmanuel Macron's arrival in Hanoi shows what appears to be his wife, Brigitte Macron, pushing his face away, sparking online speculation. Macron's office initially denied the video's authenticity before confirming it was genuine, later dismissing the incident as a harmless joke between the couple. Sources close to the president downplayed the event, attributing it to a moment of decompression before the start of a week-long Southeast Asian tour. The incident occurred as Macron began a trip to Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, aimed at promoting France as an alternative to the US and China amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Police are investigating a village shop in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, for displaying a portrait of Enoch Powell alongside excerpts from his controversial "Rivers of Blood" speech. The shopkeeper, Elizabeth Griffiths, stated she intended to highlight the need for strong leadership, but authorities are treating the display as a "hate incident." The investigation follows concerns about the offensive nature of Powell's anti-immigration rhetoric, which sparked a national outcry when first delivered in 1968. The incident raises questions about freedom of expression versus the potential to incite hostility and prejudice.</p>

          <p>Five years after the anti-police protests following George Floyd‚Äôs death, initiatives to address officer mental health are gaining traction. The protests exacerbated the already poor mental health of officers, leading to increased resignations and burnout. Departments are creating wellness units, providing mental health debriefings, and offering training programs like Brazilian jiujitsu. The goal is to reduce the stigma of seeking help and equip officers with coping skills to manage the cumulative stress and trauma of their jobs.</p>
