          <h2>UK Government Considers Extending Sugar Tax to Milkshakes and Lattes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 03:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), to include milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy substitutes. This proposal aims to reduce sugar consumption, particularly among children, by incentivizing manufacturers to lower sugar content in these beverages. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium intake, but the government now believes the health benefits do not outweigh the harms from excess sugar. The consultation period runs until July 21, and the SDIL has raised £1.9 billion since its introduction in 2018. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox after footage emerged of a band member appearing to say, "The only good Tory is a dead Tory.

Counter-terrorism police are assessing the footage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution. The group also addressed footage appearing to show a band member shouting "up Hamas, up Hezbollah" and said they do not support either group. </p>

          <p>BP reported a lower-than-expected first-quarter net profit of $1.38 billion, impacted by a recent strategic reset and a drop in crude prices.

          <p>Donald Trump engaged in a charm offensive with The Atlantic, a magazine known for its liberal stance, to secure an interview and potentially favorable coverage. The interview, which came about after Trump received a call on his cell phone from the Atlantic reporters, covered a range of topics, with Trump comparing his first and second terms. He stated that in his first term, he had to "run the country and survive," while in his second term, he runs "the country and the world." Despite the seemingly cordial interactions, Trump later attacked the reporters on social media, highlighting the complex relationship between Trump and the media.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a victory in the recent federal election, marking a turnaround attributed to President Trump's threats of annexation and imposition of tariffs. Trump's repeated statements about making Canada the 51st U.S. state and his trade policies significantly influenced voters. Carney's campaign focused on the need for strong leadership to address these external pressures. Although domestic issues such as affordability and immigration were also factors, Trump's influence dominated the election discourse, with voters expressing concerns about Canadian sovereignty and economic stability.</p>

          <p>Following the Liberal Party's victory in Canada's federal election, Prime Minister Mark Carney called for unity in the face of ongoing threats and tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump. Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader earlier in the year, presented himself as an experienced leader capable of navigating the crisis posed by Trump's policies. He warned that Trump is attempting to undermine Canada's sovereignty and economy. The Liberals did not secure a clear majority, indicating a divided electorate and posing challenges for Carney in leading Canada through a potential trade war with the US.</p>

The cost and cash action plan includes investment reductions and potential redundancies across its global operations.

The new engine rules will retain 1.6-liter V6 turbo hybrids but simplify them by removing the MGU-H and upping the electrical capacity. This has led to Audi coming in, Ford partnering with Red Bull, Honda staying, and General Motors entering next year. The new engine rules required further changes to the chassis rules and moveable aerodynamics, reducing drag on the straights so the cars were in the braking zones for longer.</p>
