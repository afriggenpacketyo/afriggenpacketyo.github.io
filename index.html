          <p>Ryan Hemphill, a lawyer, has been charged with multiple counts of sexual assault against six women he met online over a five-month period.

He is also accused of threatening the women to prevent them from reporting the incidents. Authorities believe there may be additional victims and Hemphill is currently held in Manhattan Criminal Court.</p>

          <p>Police shot and killed a 30-year-old armed man at Toronto's Pearson International Airport after responding to a dispute call near Terminal 1 departures.

The incident caused temporary travel disruptions, including road closures, but flights continued to operate normally.

          <p>Intel reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations but issued disappointing guidance for the upcoming quarter, leading to a stock drop in extended trading. The company plans to cut operational and capital expenses, including job cuts, to improve efficiency. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who recently took over, acknowledged the need for improvements to regain market share, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector where Intel lags behind Nvidia. The company expects $17 billion in operational expenses in 2025, down from $17.5 billion, and $18 billion in capital expenses, down from $20 billion.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, revealed that the simple act of saying "Please" and "Thank you" to chatbots like ChatGPT incurs significant costs in electricity and server usage. While seemingly trivial, these polite additions to prompts contribute to tens of millions of dollars in expenses. Every interaction with a chatbot demands computational resources, and extra words increase the load on servers. The cost is deemed worthwhile by Altman, suggesting a value in user experience despite the financial implications.</p>

          <p>“The Accountant 2” subtracts much of what made the original film successful, diminishing the character of Christian Wolff, played by Ben Affleck, into a stereotypical action figure.

While the jokey scenes between Chris and his brother Braxton, played by Jon Bernthal, provide some entertainment, the overall plot and character development are weaker.

          <p>The Trump administration's National Security Council (NSC) is experiencing significant dysfunction, characterized by firings, disregard for the law, and prioritization of loyalty over expertise.

The chaos has marginalized the NSC in foreign policy decision-making, with major decisions reached without a traditional NSC process. The situation stems from Trump’s impatience with process and distrust of National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.</p>

          <p>DNC chair Ken Martin has proposed requiring party officials to remain neutral in primary elections, challenging activist David Hogg to choose between his vice-chair post and his plan to unseat "out of touch" Democrats. Martin officially presented the neutrality pledge, days after Hogg announced plans to spend $20m to primary “out-of-touch” and “ineffective” Democratic incumbents. If approved, the resolution would force Hogg to choose between remaining a national party vice-chair or stepping aside from Leaders We Deserve, which he co-founded.</p>
