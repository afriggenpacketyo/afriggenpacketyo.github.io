          <p>The Vatican may serve as a neutral location for peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, with Pope Leo XIV signaling willingness to mediate following Pope Francis's death. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni spoke with the Pope about steps to build peace in Ukraine, after requests from US President Trump and European leaders to assess the Holy See's willingness to host talks. Pope Leo has confirmed his willingness to facilitate discussions, emphasizing "peace" in his initial address, reflecting both spiritual detachment and concrete global politics. This shift comes after Pope Francis faced criticism for not explicitly condemning Russia's aggression earlier in the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has continued releasing people charged with being in the country illegally to non-governmental shelters along the US-Mexico border, even after suggesting that providing aid to immigrants might violate smuggling laws. Shelters, which provide lodging and transportation, were alarmed by a letter from FEMA raising concerns about illegal activity and demanding detailed information. Despite the letter, ICE continued to request shelter services, placing organizations in a difficult position. FEMA has suspended payments during its investigation, requiring shelters to provide detailed service lists and sworn statements denying knowledge of smuggling violations.</p>

          <p>In a recent case involving members of the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards, the Supreme Court has effectively granted President Trump increased authority to remove high-level officials, potentially undermining independent expertise within the executive branch. This decision, delivered in a concise, unsigned order, has been criticized for overruling established precedent without thorough deliberation. The ruling enables the president to consolidate power and adopt a "move fast and break things" approach to constitutional law. The author argues that this decision risks emboldening the administration to act outside traditional constitutional norms.</p>

          <p>Venezuela is staging elections for a governor and legislators to represent Essequibo, a territory internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's move aims to bolster his domestic support and assert claims over the oil-rich region, despite the area's English-speaking, Guyanese-identifying population. This action reignites a long-standing dispute, with Guyana tightening border security and the International Court of Justice ordering Venezuela to refrain from electing officials for the area.

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Successful Children</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article introduces "emotionally safe parenting," a style focused on emotional attunement, resilience, and connection, contrasting it with authoritative, authoritarian, and gentle parenting. It emphasizes accepting a child's emotions, responding without shame, viewing misbehavior as a stress signal, and taking responsibility after conflicts. Emotionally safe parents prioritize creating an environment where children feel secure expressing their authentic selves. The article suggests that this approach involves inner work by the parent, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame, ultimately fostering trust and understanding.</p>

          <h2>Russia Launches Major Air Assault on Ukraine, Undermining Cease-Fire Efforts</h2>

          <p>Russia has launched one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. The attack underscores the failure of cease-fire negotiations, as President Putin continues to impose conditions unacceptable to Ukraine, and President Trump appears to be withdrawing from diplomatic efforts. The Ukrainian Air Force reported shooting down approximately two-thirds of the missiles and nearly all the drones, though the attacks are straining Ukraine's air defenses. This recent escalation has led to a rise in civilian casualties, despite ongoing discussions for a truce.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warming towards Syria and its leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After hundreds of Israeli airstrikes on Syria, aimed at preventing hostile groups from gaining power, Trump met with al-Shara and announced plans to lift sanctions. This shift in American foreign policy has led to a near halt in Israeli strikes and raised concerns in Israel about the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. The situation underscores how Trump's foreign policy decisions are reshaping the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, releasing a total of 1,000 prisoners each, marking a rare instance of cooperation amid ongoing conflict. The exchange followed talks in Turkey, though it failed to produce a ceasefire, as Russia continued its offensive with drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. These attacks resulted in numerous casualties and damage, prompting President Zelenskyy to urge Western partners to increase sanctions on Russia. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down Ukrainian drones and pushed back troops in the Kursk region.</p>

          <p>Starr County, Texas, once a Democratic stronghold, voted Republican for the first time in 132 years in 2024, exemplifying a broader political realignment. This shift reflects the decline of localized, tradition-based politics and the rise of ideological sorting, particularly among working-class Hispanics. The area's history of machine politics, centered on local elections and patronage, was disrupted by national polarization, leading voters to align with parties matching their cultural beliefs. The analysis suggests this realignment challenges the Democratic Party's traditional coalition and requires a reassessment of its strategies.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floydâ€™s murder, the Black Lives Matter movement faces a backlash, with the politics of "white grievance" championed by President Trump. Key initiatives, such as Black Lives Matter Plaza, have been dismantled, and the Justice Department has abandoned oversight of police forces accused of racial bias. While the movement sparked significant social change, it now faces challenges, including declining public support and allegations of mismanagement within the Black Lives Matter Foundation Inc. Despite these setbacks, some argue that the fight for racial justice persists, and Black activism remains essential for American democracy.</p>

However, critics argue that other sources, like construction, are far more polluting and that targeting small bakeries is misplaced. Bakers fear that switching to cleaner fuels will increase costs, making the affordable pav less accessible to the working class.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump's actions are not random but represent a deliberate strategy to undermine American democracy by reverse-engineering its institutions. Trump and his allies aim to repurpose the powers of the judicial, legislative, and executive branches, turning watchdogs into personal instruments. This approach involves using laws against laws, pitting police forces against each other, and exploiting existing structures to dismantle the social contract. The author contends that this creates an "autoimmune disorder" within American democracy, where its strengths are used to destroy it.</p>
