        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, many maritime insurance underwriters are avoiding providing coverage to vessels linked to the U.S., Israel, or the U.K., with some refusing coverage at any price. Insurance rates for vessels are rising, with rates now ranging from 0.25% to 0.5% of ship value, particularly for U.S.-affiliated ships. The uncertainty in the region has also led underwriters to shorten the required notification period from 48 hours to 24 hours. Concerns about Iran blocking ships and China's appetite for Iranian oil are influencing the insurance market, which is closely monitoring the situation for potential de-escalation. The situation remains volatile, with the market in a wait-and-see mode as underwriters assess political developments. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has weakened the ability to sue federal law enforcement officers for violating constitutional rights, potentially emboldening misconduct. Recent incidents involving the arrests of elected officials protesting immigration policies highlight concerns about law enforcement overreach. The court's conservative majority has limited the scope of *Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents*, a 1971 decision that allowed individuals to sue federal officers for Fourth Amendment violations. These rulings grant greater immunity to federal officials, undermining accountability and potentially leading to increased constitutional violations. The decisions align with the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration and perceived enemies, raising concerns about the erosion of constitutional protections.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is currently detaining approximately 59,000 immigrants, a record high, with nearly half lacking a criminal record. This surge reflects the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement efforts, contrasting with previous policies that prioritized serious criminals and recent arrivals. ICE is conducting large-scale operations across the U.S., supported by various federal law enforcement agencies, and has increased arrests in the interior of the country. Concerns are rising about conditions in ICE detention centers due to overcrowding, with officials exploring options to convert military bases into temporary holding centers. The administration has requested additional funding from Congress to expand detention capacity.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains that Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, 1865, marks the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned of their freedom. This day followed multiple African American liberation movements and allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and identities as both African and American. By the 1870s, Baltimore City held a parade in honor of the holiday, reflecting the city's large free pre-Civil War population and its role in the Underground Railroad. Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, suggesting visits to museums to understand the lived experiences of freedom. Learning about the history behind Juneteenth helps us understand collective ancestry and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities, Tehran faces limited options, including military escalation or diplomatic negotiations, each with significant risks. Military responses, such as attacking U.S. forces or closing the Strait of Hormuz, could provoke further American intervention. Diplomatic options involve either accepting stringent U.S. demands or risking additional military action. The situation presents an opportunity for a dramatic transformation of the Middle Eastern strategic landscape, potentially strengthening a regional coalition against Iran and reducing proliferation risks. The author argues that both Netanyahu and Trump deserve credit for taking daring action and must continue pressing the advantage to achieve a diplomatic agreement that ensures Iran can never again develop nuclear capabilities for military purposes.</p>

The Eaton sale is motivated by concerns that the magnitude of earnings beats has shrunk, potentially making it tougher for the stock to perform as well as it did in 2024.

          <p>Rising housing supply and slowing demand are causing home prices to cool off faster than anticipated, with national home price increases at 2.7% in April, the smallest gain in nearly two years. While New York, Chicago, and Detroit saw the biggest increases, prices in previously hot markets like Tampa and Dallas are now falling. Higher mortgage rates are keeping potential monthly payments high, pricing out many buyers, particularly first-timers. The supply of homes for sale is rising, but remains below pre-pandemic levels, preventing major price declines. While prices are weakening, they are not at risk of the major declines seen during the subprime mortgage crisis.</p>

          <p>Thousands of complaints have been lodged over alleged voting irregularities in Poland's presidential election, challenging the victory of right-wing conservative Karol Nawrocki. The Supreme Court has received over 50,000 complaints, claiming irregularities in the count to the detriment of Nawrocki's opponent, Rafal Trzaskowski. Opposition leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski accused the governing coalition of seeking to question the election result, while Prime Minister Donald Tusk called for clarification. The Supreme Court has until July 2 to investigate the complaints, with the Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs (created by PiS) deciding on the validity of the election, raising concerns about impartiality.</p>

          <p>President Trump emphatically used an expletive on camera to express his frustration with Israel and Iran, who appeared to be violating the ceasefire agreement he had just announced. He told reporters that the two countries "don't know what the f*** they're doing," marking a departure from traditional presidential decorum. While Trump has been known to use coarse language in public appearances, this explicit utterance was a new development. Presidential historian Russell Riley noted that Trump has seldom felt bound by the normal constraints of the office. The use of profanity, particularly this specific curse word, has typically been avoided by American presidents in public forums.</p>

The share of Americans describing themselves as not financially secure has increased, reaching 77% this year. Gen Xers were the most likely to say they are not where they want to be financially, and women feel less confident about their financial position than men.

Activists are claiming this as a victory, stating that they managed to move one of the most powerful people in the world out of the city center. The wedding, which is expected to have a star-studded guest list, has attracted protests from various groups, including those fighting over-tourism, climate change activists, and opponents of Bezos' support for Donald Trump.

          <p>The US has approved lenacapavir for HIV prevention, but experts are worried that cuts to the health budget will undermine the drug's potential to reduce infections. Experts say that cuts to domestic health institutions and foreign aid are likely to jeopardize efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US by 2030. Lenacapavir, described as a "miracle" drug by UNAIDS, provides six months of protection against HIV infection. Concerns are growing about whether the defunding of US public health agencies will hinder the delivery of lenacapavir to those who need it most. The Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has affected key public health agencies and programs, potentially impacting vulnerable groups' access to the new PrEP drug.</p>

During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly pitched himself as an anti-war president and a peace broker, promising to put “America first” by ending US involvement in risky and expensive overseas conflicts.

          <p>Quebec provides universal childcare for less than $7 a day, a model that has been successful in offering high-quality early education, supporting families, and boosting the government's tax revenue. The program, inspired by US research, has led to high female labor force participation rates, a smaller gender pay gap, and reduced child poverty. Experts suggest that the US can learn from Quebec's approach, which involves public investment, universal access, and high parental involvement. While challenges remain, such as ensuring equal access and addressing staff shortages, Quebec's model demonstrates the potential for a publicly supported childcare system to benefit families and the economy.</p>
