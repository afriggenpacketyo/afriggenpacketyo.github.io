          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% rise in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The growth occurred even with the U.S. imposing tariffs, though both countries later agreed to reduce some levies following a trade truce. Despite the profit increase, manufacturing activity in China fell more than expected, and retail sales growth slowed. Exports to the U.S. also plunged, but overall exports surged due to increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Federal prosecutors stated Jenkins took $75,000 in bribes, while Jenkins claimed there was no connection between the payments and the badges he handed out.

          <p>Bill Saporito critiques President Trump's demand that retailers like Walmart "eat the tariffs" on goods from China, arguing it defies basic business principles. The author emphasizes that retailers will inevitably have to raise prices, despite pressure from the administration to absorb the costs. The article suggests that businesses are afraid to acknowledge the reality of tariffs for fear of reprisal, while small and medium-sized businesses are more transparent about passing on the costs to consumers. The author concludes that denying the economic impact of tariffs is self-defeating for businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, overtaken by Germany, despite its net external assets rising to a record high. The increase in Japan's gross external assets was partially due to a weaker yen, which boosted the value of its foreign-currency holdings. While Japan's total external assets rose significantly, Germany benefited from a larger current account surplus. The United States, in contrast, has a substantial net external liability, indicating that its foreign debts far exceed its overseas assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a delay in the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, extending the deadline to July 9 to allow for further negotiations. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire for serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs due to frustrations with trade negotiations, causing market instability. Both sides expressed readiness to advance talks, highlighting the importance of the EU-U.S. trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

The speech, written on the advice of the Canadian government, is anticipated to diplomatically affirm Canada's independence and identity. Prime Minister Mark Carney, recently elected on an anti-Trump platform, has emphasized Canada's historic ties and constitutional monarchy.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery, honoring fallen soldiers while also injecting personal boasting and partisan attacks. While he paid tribute to the sacrifices of military veterans and their families, Trump also used the occasion to criticize his predecessor and promote his own achievements. He praised the military, emphasized his return to office, and made an anti-immigration statement, reflecting his political agenda. The remarks followed a morning of social media posts that included disparaging remarks about judges and undocumented immigrants.</p>
