          <h2>China Announces Policy Easing Measures Amid Trade Concerns</h2>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, to bolster economic growth amidst trade tensions. The measures aim to increase liquidity and support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, with the intention of mitigating the impact of tariffs and boosting employment. However, some economists suggest that these measures may have limited impact on domestic credit demand, and new fiscal policy measures may be needed if economic deterioration continues. The article also mentions that the Chinese yuan has regained some ground after weakening earlier in the month. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk reported a better-than-expected net profit for the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug, but subsequently lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to weaker-than-anticipated Wegovy sales. The Danish pharmaceutical giant's overall revenue met expectations, though Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst predictions, with the company now projecting sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. This adjustment comes amid high demand for GLP-1 weight loss treatments and increasing competition in the weight loss drug market, as other pharma firms develop potential new candidates. The article also mentions Eli Lilly lowering its full-year profit guidance.</p>

This followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., which he claimed was necessary because the American film industry was "DYING a very fast death." Trump blamed Newsom for the industry's decline, citing the California High-Speed Rail project as a wasteful endeavor, but also expressed some fondness for Newsom and mentioned providing water to California during the wildfires.</p>

          <p>As Russia commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in World War II, the national narrative emphasizes Russia as both victor and victim, drawing parallels between that conflict and the ongoing war in Ukraine. The Russian authorities portray the war in Ukraine as a continuation of World War II, framing Russia as fighting against Nazism and fascism in Ukraine and across Europe. However, unlike World War II, where the Soviet Union fought to liberate itself from Nazi invasion, Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, widely seen as an attempt to force Ukraine back into Russia's geo-political orbit.</p>
