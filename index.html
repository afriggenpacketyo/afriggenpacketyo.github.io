          <p>Following an Israeli strike on Iran that killed senior military leaders, Iran launched over 100 drones toward Israeli territory, prompting interceptions by Jordan. Israel stated its attack targeted Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to negotiate a deal, reflecting on past opportunities he offered.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers can potentially lower credit card interest rates without switching cards by calling and directly asking the issuer for a rate reduction, particularly if they have a good payment history. Enrolling in a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency can also help secure lower rates across multiple cards. Additionally, exploring temporary hardship programs offered by card companies and leveraging an improved credit score can provide avenues for rate reduction. Researching competitive offers from other companies can strengthen negotiating power with the current card issuer.</p>

          <p>Following Israel's strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, the Trump administration faces a critical decision on how to prevent a wider regional conflict. The U.S. was reportedly informed in advance but did not participate directly, and is now taking precautionary steps like evacuating personnel from Baghdad. Experts suggest measures including enhancing regional deterrence, countering Iranian proxy activity, leading diplomatic de-escalation, supporting allies without enabling escalation, and offering a regional security framework.
