The district is heavily Democratic, and her victory is expected to help narrow the slim Republican majority in the U.S. House.

          <p>Representatives Maria Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) have introduced the Dignity Act of 2025, a bipartisan immigration reform bill. The legislation would offer a renewable seven-year legal status with work authorization to undocumented immigrants who arrived before 2021, requiring them to pay restitution. The bill, which does not offer a path to citizenship or federal benefits, also aims to bolster border security and mandate E-Verify for employers. It represents a compromise effort to address labor shortages and the status of long-term residents.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy firms will invest over $90 billion in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy. The initiative, revealed at a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, includes building new data centers and an energy innovation training center in the Pittsburgh region. The plan aims to leverage the state's energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear power, to support the high energy demands of AI. The announcement was met with some protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels.</p>

The report explores the personal stories of survivors, the military justification for the late-stage attack, and the moral questions surrounding the firebombing campaign.

          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown University, and the City University of New York (CUNY) faced questioning from a House committee regarding antisemitism on their campuses. The university chancellors and presidents defended their institutions' commitment to protecting free speech while also condemning antisemitism and detailing disciplinary actions taken. Republican committee members accused the schools of inadequate responses, while Democrats criticized the hearings as "political theater" and pointed to the Trump administration's own actions dismantling the Department of Education's civil rights offices. The hearing was periodically interrupted by protesters.</p>

          <p>The UK government secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans to the UK under a clandestine scheme established after a massive data breach by the Ministry of Defence. In 2022, the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghans who had applied for UK assistance were inadvertently leaked, putting them at risk from the Taliban. The existence of the breach and the subsequent £400 million relocation program were concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which has now been lifted by a High Court judge. The Defence Secretary has issued a sincere apology for the "serious departmental error."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms, including a bold, all-gold "Charger Power" look and a navy blue "Super Chargers" uniform. The gold uniform, a first for the team in a game, has drawn mixed reactions online, with some comparing it to Big Bird or a mustard bottle. The navy uniform is a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance. The team will also have the option to wear their popular powder blue pants with their primary home and away jerseys.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Prosecutor-General has formally urged the Supreme Federal Court to find former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of attempting to orchestrate a coup after his 2022 election loss. The charging document accuses Bolsonaro and seven others of forming an "armed criminal association" to "violently overthrow the democratic order." The charges stem from his unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud and the subsequent storming of government buildings by his supporters on January 8, 2023. If convicted, Bolsonaro could face up to 40 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines rather than on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to acquire gold at a discount, use local currency to bolster reserves without depleting foreign exchange, and support their domestic mining industries. Countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines are actively pursuing this approach. The trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire to strengthen reserve buffers against global financial and geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>

He noted that the most significant cuts have targeted the Office for Civil Rights and the Financial Aid Office, which could reduce oversight and processing capabilities. However, Petrilli argues that most students and teachers will not feel a direct impact, as the federal department has a minimal role in the day-to-day operation of local schools. He believes the department will be smaller but will still exist at the end of Trump's term.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also calls for standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity about the roles' responsibilities since they were introduced to ease doctor workloads. The British Medical Association, a doctors' union, believes the review should have gone further.</p>

A key goal of the refurbishment is to make the building net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The ambitious project aims to preserve the Victorian architectural marvel for future generations.</p>
