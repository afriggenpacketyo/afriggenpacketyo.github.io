          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, a former art expert known for his appearances on shows like Bargain Hunt, has been sentenced to two years and six months in jail for failing to declare art sales to Nazem Ahmad, a suspected financier of Hezbollah. Ahmad was sanctioned by the US in 2019 for allegedly laundering money for the terrorist group through an art gallery in Beirut. Ojiri admitted to eight counts under the Terrorism Act 2000, as he was aware of Ahmad's sanctions and ties to illegal activities. The case highlights the increased scrutiny on the art market regarding money laundering and terrorist financing, with regulations requiring the reporting of suspicious transactions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn a court order that reinstated U.S. Department of Education employees who were laid off as part of efforts to streamline the agency. The administration argues that a U.S. District Judge in Boston lacked the authority to mandate the rehiring of over 1,300 employees. These layoffs led to the closure of several offices responsible for enforcing civil rights and overseeing federal student aid applications. The case highlights the ongoing legal battles surrounding the Trump administration's attempts to reshape federal agencies and reduce government staff.</p>

          <p>The stock market demonstrated its sensitivity to employment data with a rally following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, after a previous downturn sparked by a feud between President Trump and Elon Musk. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2% and hourly wages increasing by 3.9% year-over-year, surpassing expectations. This report eased investor concerns about a potential labor market collapse, which is crucial for the consumption-based U.S. economy.

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules for UBS, requiring the bank to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital after its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures aim to enhance UBS's stability and involve fully capitalizing its foreign units, which may reduce share buybacks. While UBS shares initially jumped following the announcement, the bank expressed strong disagreement with the "extreme" increase in capital requirements. UBS stated it will actively participate in the consultation process to find regulatory changes with reasonable cost/benefit outcomes (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices experienced a slight decrease in May, easing from the highs seen in April due to consumer concerns about potential tariff-related price increases, according to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. The index decreased by 1.5% from April to May but remains 4% higher than the previous year. Demand remains relatively strong due to low inventory levels, driven by consumers holding onto vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years. While tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand affect the used car market.</p>

The result suggests that Reform UK could gain a foothold in Holyrood in the next election, potentially challenging the consensus on immigration.

          <p>The article argues that the lack of widespread protests against President Trump's latest travel ban, which targets travelers from several countries, reflects a growing desensitization to his discriminatory policies. The author contends that the ban, ostensibly implemented to prevent terror attacks, is actually a demographic-engineering project aimed at excluding immigrants from specific ethno-religious backgrounds. The article criticizes the arbitrary nature of the ban and suggests it is part of a broader trend of authoritarianism in American politics, highlighting a decline in democratic resistance to such measures.</p>

          <p>President Trump has mandated that coal and gas plants continue operating, even as they face closures due to economic factors. Grid operators report that they did not request these plants to remain open. This decision may result in increased costs for consumers, as they could be forced to absorb the additional expenses associated with keeping these plants running. This action is part of Trump's broader energy policy, which prioritizes fossil fuels over renewable energy sources.</p>

          <h2>Study Raises Concerns About Health Risks of Fecal Transplants</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that fecal transplants, while promising for restoring gut microbiomes, may carry unintended health risks. Researchers found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut environment could negatively impact immune and metabolic functions. The study, conducted on mice, human tissue samples, and a small volunteer group, indicates that microbes introduced via fecal transplants can "terraform" the intestinal tract, potentially leading to adverse effects. Experts recommend a more targeted approach using specific microbes for particular intestinal regions, while further research is needed to fully assess the long-term health outcomes of fecal transplants.</p>
