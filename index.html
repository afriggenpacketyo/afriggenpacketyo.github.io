          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her central role in the world's largest cryptocurrency seizure, valued at over £5.5 billion ($7.4 billion). Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing bitcoin, stemming from a large-scale scam between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 victims in China. Her conviction follows a complex seven-year international money laundering investigation involving multiple jurisdictions, during which she fled China using false documents and attempted to launder money by buying UK property. This case underscores the significant challenge posed by organized criminals using cryptocurrencies to conceal illicit gains, with authorities now focused on preventing the fraudsters from reclaiming the stolen funds.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by former US President Donald Trump, following the suspension of his account after the January 6, 2020 Capitol Hill riot. This settlement, which does not constitute an admission of liability, makes YouTube the latest tech firm to resolve legal action with Trump over his social media bans. Of the total, $22 million will fund a construction project at the White House through a non-profit, while $2.5 million will go to pro-Trump organizations. Meta and X (formerly Twitter) previously settled similar lawsuits with the former president for $25 million and $10 million respectively.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs, found malnourished and alone earlier this year, have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the San Diego County wilderness. The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to encourage natural behaviors. Released on September 18, the animals were intentionally left unnamed to prevent human attachment, a common practice in wildlife rehabilitation. This effort is crucial as wild mountain lion populations in California are significantly lower than previously estimated, facing threats from vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment.</p>

The improvement comes as Beijing intensifies efforts to curb industrial overcapacity amid sluggish domestic demand and global trade disruptions. A private survey, RatingDog's manufacturing PMI, also showed a better picture at 51.2 for September, beating economists' forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

The team's challenge lies in maintaining their recent momentum and finding a new identity to navigate the high-pressure postseason.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Hoyos, a 48-year-old Mexican marine biologist, sustained serious injuries in a shark attack while tagging species near Costa Rica's Cocos Island. The incident occurred on Saturday, requiring a 36-hour journey to a hospital in the capital, where he arrived in stable condition despite severe head, face, and arm wounds. Hoyos was leading a scientific expedition as part of a conservation coalition when a four-meter shark bit him after being tagged. Incidents like this are rare in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, known for its diverse shark population, but a similar fatal attack occurred in 2017.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday morning, though its projected path shows it moving away from the southeastern U.S. The storm, the ninth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has been bringing tropical storm conditions and heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas. While a tropical storm watch for parts of Florida's east coast was canceled, a hurricane watch has been issued for Bermuda, which Imelda is expected to approach on Wednesday. The article warns of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast due to swells from Imelda and Hurricane Humberto.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block the deployment of 200 Oregon National Guard members to Portland to protect federal property. Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield argue that President Trump lacks the authority to federalize the National Guard and that local officials can manage public safety without federal interference. Trump had publicly stated his intention to send "all necessary Troops" to "war ravaged Portland" against "Antifa." This article highlights the administration's claim of lawful authority to protect federal assets, while local officials assert the deployment is an abuse of power and will make residents less safe.</p>

          <p>The US Senate has returned to Washington with less than two days to fund the government, as Democrats and Republicans remain deadlocked and trade blame for a looming shutdown. Republicans, holding a Senate majority, cannot pass a funding bill without Democratic support, requiring 60 votes for most legislation. Democrats are pushing for a counter-proposal that includes extending expiring health insurance subsidies and rolling back Medicaid restrictions, which they deem red lines. This article highlights the political pressure on both parties, particularly Democrats who are keen to challenge the Trump administration's policies after previous compromises, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has dissolved his government following days of deadly unrest that left at least 22 people dead, according to the United Nations. The protests, primarily led by young demonstrators, were sparked by chronic electricity and water cuts, widespread poverty, and demands for Rajoelina's resignation. The country ranks among the lowest in the UN's Human Development Index, with three-quarters of its 30 million people living below the poverty line.

          <p>California and several other Democratic-led states have sued the Trump administration for allegedly withholding hundreds of millions in federal security and disaster relief funding, linking it to their "sanctuary" immigration policies. This lawsuit comes days after a federal judge blocked the administration from imposing similar conditions on grants. Attorney General Rob Bonta criticized the cuts as an illegal attempt to coerce states into federal immigration enforcement, arguing that funding for disaster preparedness should not be tied to immigration. This article notes that the administration has consistently tried to use funding as leverage against states unwilling to cooperate with its immigration crackdown.</p>

He emphasized that China and the US, as "main builders of the post-war international order," must work together for mutual benefit and world peace.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's "campaign of vengeance" against perceived foes, intended to retaliate for past legal and censorship efforts, is proving shortsighted and counterproductive. The article highlights instances where his attempts to silence critics, like Jimmy Kimmel, have backfired, boosting their popularity. Similarly, the prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey is deemed flimsy by even right-wing analysts, with Trump's public demands for conviction undermining the case. The author suggests that while the presidency offers power, Trump's reliance on loyalty over experience and his shift from countercultural rebellion to state-sponsored submission may be beyond his grasp.</p>

          <p>This article provides a "reality check" on President Donald Trump's ambitious 20-point Gaza peace plan, presented with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Trump declared it a step towards "eternal peace," the analysis highlights significant obstacles, including Hamas's likely refusal to disarm and the Israeli government's internal divisions. The plan proposes hostage release for Palestinian prisoners, Israeli troop withdrawal to a security perimeter, and a technocratic administration for Gaza. However, ambiguities and fundamental disagreements between Hamas and factions within the Israeli government mean that achieving a lasting peace will require far more than the current framework.</p>

He differentiates a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, emphasizing that the US can still pay bondholders. Cramer's primary concern, however, is that a shutdown could delay the release of vital economic data, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. This article notes that while a shutdown could furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers and slightly reduce GDP growth, Cramer suggests the market's resilience will likely prevail.
