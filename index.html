          <p>A building fire in Hyderabad, India, near the Charminar monument, resulted in the deaths of 17 people and several injuries. The blaze, which started in a building housing a jewelry store on the ground floor with residential space above, was attributed to a short circuit. The narrow staircase and single exit made escape difficult for the 21 people inside the three-story building. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced financial compensation for the victims' families, while authorities managed to bring the fire under control.</p>

          <p>The New England seafood industry is exploring the consumption of green crabs as a strategy to combat the invasive species' detrimental effects on the shellfish industry and ecosystem. Green crabs, originating from Europe and West Africa, consume a variety of species, including soft-shell clams. While the crabs offer little meat, some companies are finding innovative ways to utilize them, such as creating crab broth powder. This initiative aims to create a market for green crabs and encourage eradication programs to protect shellfish populations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies due to widespread availability of vaccines for pregnant individuals and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants. Hospitalizations for babies under seven months decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children admitted for RSV often require less intensive care. These findings suggest that preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe RSV illness.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary pause in Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, businesses, particularly small businesses, should prepare for a possible return of trade tensions. Existing tariffs remain in place, resulting in an effective tariff rate of around 40% on Chinese goods, which impacts companies relying on materials like steel and semiconductors. Experts advise businesses to explore alternative suppliers, consider relocating assembly to the US, or adjust pricing strategies to account for potential tariff increases. Given Trump's past actions and rhetoric towards China, the current trade environment remains precarious and risky.</p>

          <p>The approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low of 27.4%, a significant drop from the previous month, according to a Kyodo News survey. This decline is attributed to growing dissatisfaction with the government's handling of rising prices and its reluctance to implement consumption tax cuts. The survey indicates that a majority of respondents feel the government's efforts to curb rice price surges are insufficient, with many supporting consumption tax cuts as a solution to the cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <p>The romanticized image of Victorian orchid hunters as thrill-seeking explorers obscures the harsh reality faced by the majority of these individuals. Often poor and ill-educated, these plant collectors were exploited by companies seeking to capitalize on the orchid craze. They faced dangerous conditions, disease, and financial instability while advancing imperial interests but gaining little in return. Letters from these hunters reveal the losses they endured, including health, money, and possessions, highlighting the human cost behind the exotic flowers adorning wealthy homes. The article sheds light on the exploitative labor practices within the Victorian orchid industry.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's ventures, such as intending to accept a Qatari jet and auctioning off dinner opportunities, exemplify what the Founding Fathers sought to prevent: a president profiting from public office. The Constitution includes direct prohibitions on profiteering by the president, including bans on domestic and foreign gifts without congressional consent. Alexander Hamilton argued that leaders might prioritize their financial interests over their duty to the country. The lack of congressional oversight and ineffective courts have made it difficult to enforce these constitutional limitations, raising concerns about the integrity of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Haas has requested a review of the decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, which was deleted due to a red flag caused by a crash. Haas believes Bearman completed the lap before the red flag was indicated and has demanded an explanation from the FIA. Despite video footage and live-timing data supporting Haas's claim, the FIA upheld its original decision. Bearman expressed his frustration, stating that the red light on his dash appeared after he crossed the finish line.</p>
