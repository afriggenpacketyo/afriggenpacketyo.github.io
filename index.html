          <p>China is establishing an independent customs regime in Hainan province by year-end, transforming it into a free-trade port with significantly lower tariffs on 6,600 types of goods. This move, part of Beijing's "dual circulation" strategy, aims to boost domestic consumption and attract businesses with competitive tax regimes and relaxed visa rules. The expanded tariff-free access, covering 74% of taxable imports, could also serve as a buffer in the ongoing trade war with the United States.</p>

          <p>More than 100 aid organizations and human rights groups have condemned the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, urging governments to ensure full aid flow, open land crossings, and implement a ceasefire. They criticize Israel and the Israeli government-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) for the dire shortages of food, water, and medicine. The groups highlight Palestinians being trapped in a cycle of "hope and heartbreak," with reports of shootings at aid distribution centers, while the UN Secretary-General described Gaza as a "horror show."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major German carmakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, rallied after the U.S. and Japan struck a trade agreement that lowered auto tariffs to 15%. This deal has ignited hopes for a similar tariff breakthrough for European auto exporters, which have long sought to reduce U.S. levies. Experts suggest the Japan deal's terms, particularly the absence of export caps, could influence ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and the EU, where President Trump has threatened 30% tariffs if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>Following a "massive" trade agreement with Japan, President Trump has turned his attention to trade negotiations with the European Union, with a looming August 1 deadline for potential 30% tariffs on EU imports. The U.S.-Japan deal, which reduced auto tariffs to 15% without export caps, has fostered optimism among economists that a similar agreement could be reached with the EU. This comes as EU leaders travel to Asia for their own trade discussions with Japan and China, highlighting the complex global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Germany's shadow economy, encompassing undeclared work, has surged to its highest level in nearly a decade, projected to reach €511 billion in 2025. This rise is attributed to a decline in "tax morale" due to perceived poor public services despite high taxes, and an increase in under-the-table work when the official economy struggles. Critics also point to the "Bürgergeld" welfare system as potentially incentivizing undeclared work, with concerns about "mafia-like structures" exploiting the system, prompting calls for better cross-checking and coordination.</p>

          <p>New DNA analysis of 9,000-year-old skeletons from Catalhoyuk, a Neolithic settlement in Turkey, suggests a society centered around women. Researchers found that people buried under the same houses were often related through their mothers, indicating a matrilocal system where men joined the woman's family. The discovery, aided by advanced DNA extraction from inner ear bones, also revealed that female burials contained up to five times more grave goods than male ones. This challenges previous assumptions and suggests a society that valued equality, even potentially practicing child-swapping for resource distribution.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan (2026-2030), economists emphasize the need for long-term structural changes beyond short-term stimulus, particularly focusing on boosting "total factor productivity." Experts argue that institutional reform, rather than just technological innovation, is crucial for sustainable growth, especially given the Communist Party's influence on the economy. Signals from high-level meetings suggest a shift in official performance evaluations to include debt levels, potentially leading local authorities to prioritize consumption over investment and address overcapacity issues.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans to cut foreign aid spending by 40%, reducing it from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, primarily to increase defense spending. A Foreign Office report indicates that Africa will bear the brunt of these reductions, with significant cuts to support for children's education and women's health, raising concerns about increased disease and death risks. While multilateral aid bodies are protected, critics argue these "political choices" will disproportionately harm marginalized communities, especially women and girls, at a time when other nations are also scaling back gender programming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers endured a "dismal defeat" against the Minnesota Twins, losing 10-7, largely due to a shocking bullpen collapse and sloppy defense. In the sixth and seventh innings, the Twins scored six runs with only two hits, capitalizing on a parade of walks and a glaring error. Manager Dave Roberts expressed frustration, calling the performance "rock bottom" for the team's pitching and defense. The loss marks the Dodgers' 11th in their last 14 July games, highlighting a unit struggling with injuries and unreliable replacements.</p>

          <p>Edinburgh's historic Royal Mile, a major tourist attraction, is facing significant challenges due to overtourism, including an abundance of 72 tourist gift shops that displace essential local businesses. Residents express that the area no longer feels like a normal community, with a decline in "useful shops" and a drop in school enrollment. While tourism significantly boosts the city's economy, locals and critics point to issues like anti-social behavior, cleanliness, and the impact of short-term holiday lets, prompting calls for better urban planning and infrastructure investment from a new tourist tax.</p>

          <p>Duck World, a chain of London stores specializing in rubber ducks, is surprisingly thriving despite the broader decline in the UK retail sector. Co-founder Irina Fedotova attributes their success to the iconic appeal of rubber ducks and their popularity among tourists, gift seekers, and collectors, particularly millennials. While facing pressures from inflation and tariffs on China-manufactured products, the business maintains high profit margins. Despite initial skepticism and even accusations of illicit activities, Duck World demonstrates that niche collectibles can stay afloat by tapping into consumer trends like "treatonomics" and social value.</p>

          <p>Chinese and EU leaders are set to meet in Beijing for a high-stakes summit, but their already tense relationship is further complicated by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The EU and China face significant trade friction, including disputes over medical device tenders and Chinese subsidies, with expectations for the summit remaining low. Analysts suggest that U.S. pressure on the EU in its own trade talks could lead Brussels to harden its stance on China, making it difficult for the EU to counter Chinese economic coercion while managing American demands.</p>
