        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish group outlawed in Turkey and elsewhere, has declared it is laying down arms and disbanding after a 40-year insurgency. The group stated that it has "completed its historical mission" and that the Kurdish issue can now be resolved through democratic politics, following a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan. This decision comes after the PKK has been significantly weakened by the Turkish military and amid regional changes. President Erdogan may need Kurdish support for future elections, making this a potentially important step towards a "terror-free Turkey".</p>

This move has sparked controversy, with South African authorities disputing their refugee status, arguing the Trump administration is interfering in domestic political issues. The South African government maintains these individuals are not refugees, but will not prevent their departure. Trump's administration has also cut financial assistance to South Africa, citing disapproval of its land policy and its case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CPI report indicates that President Trump's tariffs may be contributing to a temporary slowdown in inflation by raising global recession fears and reducing American spending. While the import fees are expected to drive prices higher in the coming months, they are currently helping to tamp down inflation. This pullback could make it more challenging for the Federal Reserve to justify holding off on interest rate cuts, particularly if job growth weakens. Some economists, however, caution that a temporary inflation drop-off is not worth a potential economic downturn.</p>

In the United States, an estimated 10,000 additives are allowed in food, including flavors, emulsifiers, pesticides, preservatives, and dyes. The U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior FDA approval under the GRAS system.

The plan would waive unpaid interest each month and provide additional principal reduction for low-income borrowers.

While the FDA states that current evidence does not demonstrate a risk to human health, some research suggests possible links between microplastic accumulation and health problems.

          <h2>Chilling Rice and Pasta Can Unlock a Hidden Superfood, Resistant Starch</h2>

          <p>Food scientists have discovered a way to slow down the digestion of refined carbohydrates by creating resistant starch, a super nutrient found in white rice and pasta. Cooking rice or pasta and then chilling it transforms some of the digestible starch into resistant starch, which has numerous health benefits. It improves gut health, lowers inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, and helps manage blood sugar levels. Gently reheating the grains does not eliminate the resistant starch, making it an easy way to add fiber to one's diet.</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended the plan to accept a luxury Boeing aircraft as a gift, purportedly from Qatar, to replace Air Force One. Trump stated that the plane was a temporary gift to the Defense Department, saving taxpayer money, while critics claim that such a gift could be illegal and raise ethical questions. Opponents cite the Constitution's prohibition of gifts from foreign states and argue that the arrangement is a conflict of interest, while Qatar has stated that the reports describing the jet as a gift "are inaccurate.</p>
