          <p>President Trump announced that Fox News host Jeanine Pirro will serve as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination was withdrawn due to lack of Senate support. Pirro, a former judge and district attorney, has been a staunch defender of Trump and repeated false statements about the 2020 election. She brings decades of legal experience to the role, although her most recent work has been as a media personality. The move is seen as a way for Trump to have a reliable ally in a crucial prosecutor's office.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing increasing pressure to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts, with a Special Congress scheduled to vote on the issue. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues that enforcing skort wearing is sexist and impacts player comfort. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% desire the option to wear shorts. Some players have threatened to boycott games if forced to wear skorts, highlighting the intensity of the debate within the sport.</p>

          <p>A January order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth led to significant curriculum changes at West Point, raising concerns about academic freedom. The order directed the military service academies to remove ideologies deemed ‚Äúdivisive,‚Äù leading to canceled classes and book bans. This article details how West Point leaders initiated a schoolwide push to remove readings focused on race, gender, or darker moments in American history, resulting in resignations and protests from faculty members who felt the changes compromised the academy's commitment to academic freedom. Two tenured professors resigned in protest of the changes.</p>

          <p>President Trump's appointment of Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro as interim U.S. Attorney for Washington raises concerns about the independence of the Justice Department.

The appointment follows the withdrawal of Ed Martin, Trump's initial choice, due to Republican opposition.

          <p>Chris Mason of the BBC analyzes the recent trade deal between the UK and the US, noting that while it is a positive development, it is limited in scope. The deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a broad free trade agreement. While the deal provides some relief for British businesses, some critics argue that it falls short of pre-existing trade conditions. Mason concludes that Prime Minister Starmer can claim a limited win, but ongoing scrutiny of the deal's specifics is necessary.</p>
