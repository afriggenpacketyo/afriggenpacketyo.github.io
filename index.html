          <p>Bitcoin's price surged on Friday, coming within 1% of its record high as investors increasingly view it as a safe-haven asset during the U.S. government shutdown. The cryptocurrency gained 12% this week alone, driven by investor uncertainty after lawmakers failed to secure federal funding. Analysts from Standard Chartered noted that Bitcoin is now trading in response to 'US government risks,' a shift from its behavior during previous shutdowns. The bank predicts the digital asset will soon surpass its all-time high and could eventually reach a price of $135,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reviews Chinese director Lou Ye's film "An Unfinished Film," which follows a movie crew quarantined near Wuhan during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review argues that the film's acclaim stems more from its creators' courage and its acknowledgment of censored events, rather than its artistic merit. It highlights how the movie captures the initial chaos of lockdown but avoids confronting the mass deaths that followed the end of "zero COVID," reflecting a broader societal silence and unprocessed trauma in China. The narrative is considered essential but incomplete.</p>

          <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has welcomed positive statements from Hamas regarding a U.S.-proposed peace plan, emphasizing the need for a complete ceasefire and hostage release. The article reports that Israeli strikes in the past 24 hours have resulted in 66 Palestinian deaths, bringing the total to over 67,000, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The World Health Organization's Director-General also expressed support for the peace initiative, stating that "the best medicine is peace," highlighting the urgent need for a resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Opinion polls indicate that the right-wing populist ANO party, led by former Prime Minister Andrej Babis, is leading in the Czech Republic's parliamentary election with over 30% of the vote. A victory for Babis, who opposes continued military aid to Ukraine, could shift the country's foreign policy and align it more closely with Hungary and Slovakia in challenging EU positions on Russia. The outcome is seen as a pivotal decision for the nation's direction, with current Prime Minister Petr Fiala framing it as a choice between an Eastern or Western path for the country's future.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, making her the likely first female prime minister in the country's history. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her election is seen as an effort by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses, though her regular visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine could strain relations with neighboring Asian countries and create diplomatic challenges.</p>

          <p>Rail operator Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches following the death of Bethan Roper in 2018. The 28-year-old was killed when she struck her head on a tree branch after leaning out of a droplight window on a moving train near Bath. The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR for failing to act on a risk assessment conducted two months prior that had identified the danger posed by such windows. The regulator described the death as a "preventable tragedy" resulting from the company's inaction.</p>

          <p>One month before Election Day, the influence of President Donald Trump and the ongoing federal government shutdown are central issues in key races across the United States. Gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia are being viewed as early referendums on Trump's second-term agenda and as crucial indicators for the 2026 midterms. The article highlights how candidates in these states are leveraging or deflecting connections to the president, with the shutdown becoming a major point of contention and blame. Other significant contests include the New York City mayoral race and a California redistricting proposition.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the first-ever rock samples returned from the far side of the moon by China's Chang'e-6 mission reveals a significant temperature difference between the moon's two hemispheres. A team of scientists from China and Britain found that minerals from the far side appear to have formed in lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This discovery provides new insights into the moon's thermal asymmetry and its formation, helping to explain long-observed differences in topography and volcanic activity between the two sides.</p>

Ben'Ary expressed concern that his abrupt removal in the midst of important cases, including the prosecution of a suspect in the 2021 Kabul airport bombing, shows leadership is more focused on punishing perceived enemies than on protecting national security.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering the creation of a new one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump's image to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him fist-pumping after his 2024 assassination attempt on the other. The coin's creation may be possible under a 2020 law signed by Trump, though it could face legal challenges, as federal law generally prohibits living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, creating a potentially contentious situation.</p>

          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice was originally a tomb guardian statue from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). The theory is based on stylistic similarities to mythical zhenmushou beasts and lead isotope analysis indicating the copper came from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate the 2.8-tonne statue may have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form, though some Chinese scholars are disputing the claim.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with the challenge of meeting new mandates for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which are considered crucial for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. While some airlines are investing heavily, others, like Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary, are skeptical, calling the targets unrealistic due to insufficient supply and high costs. The article highlights the developing fissure in the industry and the geopolitical and economic challenges hampering SAF production, including Shell halting a biofuel plant and the US slashing incentives, creating a "lumpy transition" toward greener flying.</p>

The party's success, even in elections for local integration councils, is attributed to its direct outreach, its Russia-friendly stance, and its appeal to voters with stricter views on German citizenship and culture.</p>
