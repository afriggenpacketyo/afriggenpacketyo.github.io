          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 23:36:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million initiative to open 'Best Start' family hubs in every local authority across England by April 2026. These hubs are designed to provide comprehensive support for families, offering services that range from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The plan aims to support an additional 500,000 children in disadvantaged areas, building on a model similar to the earlier 'Sure Start' centres. While the government touts it as a way to improve life chances for children, the opposition has questioned the novelty of the plan, suggesting it may rebrand existing services.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its premiere, the classic film "Jaws" is being celebrated for its monumental impact on Hollywood and filmmaking. Directed by a young Steven Spielberg, the movie, adapted from Peter Benchley's novel, became the highest-grossing film of its time despite a notoriously difficult production on Martha's Vineyard. Key figures from the film, including actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, have revisited the experience, sharing memories of the challenging shoot that ultimately created a cinematic blockbuster. The film's legacy continues with anniversary screenings and a new exhibition at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.</p>

          <p>Monica Sementilli has been found guilty of murder and conspiracy in the 2017 killing of her husband, celebrity hairdresser Fabio Sementilli, and was sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors argued she orchestrated the murder with her lover, Robert Baker, to benefit from a life insurance policy and other assets. The case against her was built on extensive circumstantial evidence, including an affair, suspicious activity on the day of the murder, and secretly recorded conversations. While her defense claimed she was innocent and that Baker acted alone out of obsession, the jury delivered a guilty verdict after a lengthy trial.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 50 fatalities, with dozens more, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, catching communities by surprise and leading to over 160 air rescues and the evacuation of hundreds. Officials noted that the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, and the region's geography makes it particularly susceptible to such rapid and dangerous flooding. The event has prompted a federal disaster declaration and a massive ongoing search and rescue operation involving state and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani pitched two dominant, scoreless innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out three batters and showing promising signs in his return to the mound. However, the team's bullpen could not maintain the lead, with long reliever Justin Wrobleski giving up five runs in a 6-4 loss to the Houston Astros. The game highlighted the Dodgers' current reliance on a tenuous pitching depth while they await the return of injured starters Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell. Despite the loss, Ohtani's performance provided a positive glimpse into the potential of the team's fully healthy starting rotation.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow, titled "Mark Twain," delves into the life of the iconic American author, Samuel Langhorne Clemens. An excerpt from the book recounts Twain's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, a journey he undertook to expand his earlier articles into the full-length work, "Life on the Mississippi." The passage highlights his profound connection to his past as a steamboat pilot, a profession he considered the pinnacle of freedom and independence. Despite the changes to the landscape and his own fame, Twain found a deep sense of belonging and nostalgia in the pilot house, reaffirming his youth as a magical touchstone for his life and work.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has introduced new regulations aimed at standardizing the work of its central decision-making bodies, a move some analysts interpret as a sign that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more power. The rules apply to central commissions and leading groups, many of which were established or empowered under Xi's leadership. According to state media, these top-level organs are now directed to focus on major strategic planning, deliberation, and oversight. This formalization of the policy process could suggest a shift in governance style and potentially hint at Xi's long-term succession planning.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country highlights the region's geographic vulnerability, making it one of the deadliest places in the U.S. for flash floods. According to experts, the area's steep hills, shallow soil, and unique geology contribute to rapid water runoff, causing rivers like the Guadalupe to rise with terrifying speed. The Balcones Escarpment, a geologic fault line, can force warm, moist air from the Gulf to rise and condense, leading to intense downpours. This combination of factors, exacerbated by climate change, creates a high-risk environment known as "Flash Flood Alley," where shallow creeks can become deadly torrents in minutes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Young people in the UK are finding it increasingly difficult to secure summer or part-time jobs, often due to a lack of previous work experience. Career experts advise applicants to highlight transferable skills from other activities, such as volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities, to demonstrate qualities like teamwork and communication. They also recommend keeping CVs simple and to the point, tailoring cover letters to specific job ads, and not being afraid to drop off CVs in person at smaller businesses. Despite the competitive market, experts stress that employers do not expect extensive resumes from young applicants.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's foreign policy is being characterized by some political scientists as an application of the 'Madman Theory,' where a leader cultivates an image of unpredictability to gain strategic advantages. This approach, which relies on a highly centralized and personality-driven decision-making process, has been used to pressure allies, such as demanding increased NATO defense spending. However, critics question its effectiveness against adversaries like Russia and Iran, suggesting it could backfire by promoting instability and undermining trust in U.S. negotiations. The doctrine's success may be limited if adversaries perceive Trump's actions as predictable character traits rather than strategic unpredictability.</p>

          <p>The Lifetime ISA (LISA), a UK savings vehicle, is designed to help individuals under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus on contributions up to £4,000 annually. While some users have successfully used it to fund home purchases, the product faces criticism for its restrictive rules. Key complaints focus on the financial penalty for early withdrawals and a property price cap of £450,000, which has not been adjusted for rising house prices. Critics, including financial experts, argue these flaws make the product unjust and deter potential savers, calling for reforms to the system.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people participated in a 15-mile "Run Against ICE" through Los Angeles to protest federal immigration raids that have recently intensified in the region. The run wound through immigrant communities like Koreatown and MacArthur Park, with participants expressing outrage and solidarity with those affected by detentions and deportations. Organizers, including labor unions and immigrant rights groups, planned the event to be a visible and outspoken demonstration against what they see as unacceptable and terrifying enforcement tactics. The protest followed several high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents over the July Fourth holiday.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to public health and scientific research funding by the Trump administration are impacting the future of HIV research in the United States. According to Dr. John Brooks, former CDC official, these reductions threaten to reverse significant progress made in recent years, particularly in prevention. While treatments for current patients remain available, the cancellation of funding for vaccine and cure research, along with reduced support for prevention programs, could lead to a rise in new infections. This development jeopardizes the national goal, set during Trump's first term, of eliminating the HIV epidemic by 2030.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. The departure of Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, will shrink the already narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212. This move could create additional challenges for House Speaker Mike Johnson in passing legislation, a difficulty already evident during recent votes on a major spending bill. Green stated he is leaving public office to start a private sector business focused on helping America compete with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>An executive order from President Donald Trump aims to curb the use of Chinese-made drones, but industry experts suggest that China's dominant position in the market makes this a difficult task. Chinese firms are world leaders in the drone industry, and their products are deeply integrated into global supply chains. Analysts and commercial drone operators note that there are very few non-Chinese alternatives available, and a ban would likely lead to increased costs and operational challenges. While the order reflects ongoing US efforts to counter China's technological rise, its practical implementation is seen as a significant hurdle.</p>

Critics, including former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the statement as misleading and partisan. The legislation does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher-income individuals. Opponents argue the email misrepresents the bill's actual provisions and is an unprecedented use of a traditionally apolitical agency for political messaging, calling it "blatant misinformation" and a "lie."</p>

The conflict involved a surprise Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, followed by Iranian retaliatory strikes.

          <p>A new study reveals that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester and preconception period, is linked to adverse birth outcomes. Researchers found that these environmental stressors were associated with babies being smaller in the womb and at birth. The effects were nearly doubled for women living in climate-vulnerable neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have less access to air conditioning or filtration. Medical experts are calling for greater awareness of these climate-related risks for pregnant people and advise simple precautions like staying cool and wearing masks during smoke events.</p>
