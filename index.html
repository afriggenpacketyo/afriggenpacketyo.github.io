          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the CuauhtÃ©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in injuries to at least 19 people and the death of two. The ship, which was on a goodwill tour, reportedly experienced mechanical issues and drifted into the bridge, causing significant damage to its masts. Emergency services responded to the scene, transporting the injured to hospitals as authorities investigated the incident. New York City officials assured that the bridge did not sustain major structural damage, though the ship's navigational pilot reported mechanical problems prior to the incident.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings for Chicago for the first time ever. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, lifting dust from exceptionally dry farmland. This event is reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era, and follows a similar dust storm in 2023 that resulted in a deadly 72-vehicle crash, and is being called a haboob due to its origins with thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>British newspapers are dominated by coverage of an upcoming UK-EU summit, with some framing it as a potential "surrender" to the EU, while others emphasize potential benefits for the UK. Several papers highlight Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's warning to Prime Minister Keir Starmer against compromising on Brexit. Other headlines include the establishment of a new Home Guard to protect critical infrastructure and a choir of Post Office scandal victims seeking justice. Rising temperatures and aggressive seagulls also made headlines, and the Sunday Telegraph led with the prime minister's defence of his upcoming expected deal with the European Union.</p>

          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, resulted in one death and several injuries, prompting the FBI to investigate it as an "intentional act of terrorism." The blast caused significant damage to nearby buildings, and authorities evacuated residents from homes in Twentynine Palms as a precaution. The clinic confirmed that its staff was unharmed and that stored embryos were safe, while government officials condemned the violence and pledged support for the investigation. The FBI is treating this incident as a major bombing investigation in Southern California.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid are causing concern among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare coverage. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans claim the cuts aim to eliminate fraud without affecting coverage, many Medicaid recipients fear losing access to essential services and medications. Some also fear that the proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients could jeopardize their care and recovery efforts, particularly for those with substance use disorders.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomacy in the Middle East has largely sidelined Israel, as demonstrated by his engagement with Syria's new leader and promises to lift sanctions. This marks a departure from decades of U.S. foreign policy where Israel held a central position. While the U.S. maintains its support for Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating deals with Gulf states and addressing conflicts in Iran and Yemen without Israel's direct involvement signals a shift in priorities. Some analysts suggest Trump has lost interest in working with Prime Minister Netanyahu due to perceived stalemates in the region.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work programs, collaborating with councils and private companies to assign tasks to offenders. Offenders would not receive wages, but the money earned would go to a fund for victims' groups. The initiative comes as prisons face overcrowding, aiming to provide a more impactful form of punishment.</p>
