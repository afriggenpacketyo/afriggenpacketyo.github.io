          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, formed over the Caribbean and is expected to deliver significant rainfall, between 5 to 10 inches, to the southern Dominican Republic, southern Haiti, and eastern Jamaica through Saturday. Forecasters emphasize the uncertainty of its exact path and slow speed, warning of potential significant flash flooding and landslides in these regions. Although the storm is projected to gradually strengthen and could become a hurricane by Friday, it is currently not anticipated to have major impacts on the mainland United States. Hurricane and tropical storm watches have been issued for the southwestern peninsula of Haiti and Jamaica, respectively, highlighting the immediate concerns for these islands.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faces growing scrutiny regarding the funding for a planned White House ballroom, which President Trump asserts is "100% paid for by me and some friends." Although a comprehensive donor list remains undisclosed, a list of attendees for a dinner about the project included major tech and cryptocurrency firms such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Coinbase, Ripple, and Tether. Notably, court documents revealed Google's parent company, Alphabet, is contributing $22 million to the Trust for the National Mall, a non-profit managing donations for the project. This opaque funding mechanism has raised significant concerns about potential quid pro quo arrangements, especially given some of these companies hold lucrative contracts with the administration.</p>

          <p>A 21-year-old semi-truck driver, Jashanpreet Singh, was arrested following a deadly eight-vehicle collision on the 10 Freeway in Ontario, California, that killed three and injured four. Department of Homeland Security officials confirmed Singh, an Indian national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 via the U.S.-Mexico border. He faces charges of driving under the influence of drugs causing bodily injury and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, with bail set at $250,000. The incident highlights broader concerns, as the U.S. government paused worker visas for commercial truck drivers in August and California faces a lawsuit for allegedly failing to comply with federal safety and immigration requirements in issuing commercial driver's licenses.</p>

          <p>New York's final mayoral debate was dominated by intense personal attacks and bickering between candidates Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, largely overshadowing substantive policy discussions. Cuomo repeatedly challenged Mamdani's experience and ideas, while Mamdani countered by raising Cuomo's past failures and sexual harassment allegations, which Cuomo dismissed. The debate also featured contentious exchanges on recent ICE raids and how candidates would engage with former President Trump. Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa added sharp, often humorous, commentary, but observers noted that the 90-minute event likely did little to change voter perceptions, with candidates primarily reinforcing their existing platforms ahead of the election.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its controversial drug interdiction campaign, for the first time attacking and destroying two boats on the Pacific side of South America, resulting in five deaths. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth equated alleged drug traffickers to the 9/11 terror group, asserting "no refuge or forgiveness – only justice." This widening scope, following previous Caribbean strikes that killed at least 32, raises significant legal and ethical questions. The Guardian article reveals the CIA provides the bulk of intelligence, and White House officials are employing a dubious legal theory of "non-international armed conflict" with "designated terrorist organizations" to justify lethal force, despite expert skepticism and widespread condemnation from civil liberties groups.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging the company systematically violated state anti-discrimination laws by mistreating thousands of pregnant and disabled warehouse employees. The complaint asserts that Amazon placed these workers on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and unlawfully retaliated against them, sometimes leading to termination for not meeting "rigid productivity requirements." Amazon, however, denies these accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and does not automatically place pregnant workers on leave. This legal action, stemming from a years-long investigation, adds to past scrutiny and federal probes into the company's treatment of its sprawling frontline workforce.</p>

Furthermore, such an approach risks alienating countries in the Global South.

Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, a figure comparable to the 2024 presidential election at this point, which is notable given the esoteric nature of redistricting. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed the measure, highlighted its importance for safeguarding democratic principles.

This escalating crisis is attributed to persistent rising inflation, over $1 billion in cuts to federal food aid programs, and the ongoing government shutdown, which is withholding SNAP payments.

          <p>President Trump and his legal team have asked the Justice Department for approximately $230 million to settle two federal damage claims related to past investigations into his 2016 campaign's alleged Russian interference and his handling of classified documents. This unprecedented request raises significant conflict of interest concerns, as top Justice Department officials, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, previously served as Trump's or his co-defendant's criminal defense attorneys in these very cases. Experts question the legal basis and the exorbitant sum, calling for recusals, while Trump has stated he would donate any compensation received.</p>

The National Crime Agency (NCA) considers such groups a "severe and serious online threat," noting under-reporting and the young age of perpetrators and victims. Christina described her daughter's rapid deterioration and the immense difficulty of extracting her from the group's influence, highlighting the psychological manipulation involved.

          <p>A family of three was successfully rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island where they sheltered in a barn for nearly two days. The mother, father, and son were located after the son ingeniously used the boat's marine radio, which had washed ashore, to make a mayday call, alerting authorities. A relative had initiated a search when the family failed to return as scheduled, prompting a multi-agency effort. The Coast Guard praised the family's quick thinking and having quality equipment for their survival, transporting them to an area hospital where one member was initially in critical condition, while the others were stable.</p>

          <p>From next year, menopause screening will be officially incorporated into NHS health checks in England, offered to women aged 40 to 74 every five years. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice, support, and treatments such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), drugs to combat hot flushes, and counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that this measure will bring menopause into the mainstream, encouraging women to open up about symptoms they have "suffered in silence" for too long. While campaigners welcome the move to reduce stigma and improve support, concerns persist about the currently low uptake of health checks in certain communities, potentially limiting the overall positive impact of this change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to deploy dozens of federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a major immigration enforcement operation, reportedly utilizing the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda as a staging ground. This imminent deployment has drawn strong condemnation from California leaders, with Governor Gavin Newsom labeling it "right out of the dictator's handbook" and accusing President Trump of intentionally generating fear. San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie reiterated the city's preparedness to resist what he termed "un-American tactics" aimed at immigrant communities. This action is expected to trigger a significant showdown between federal and local authorities, as community groups mobilize and legal challenges are anticipated against the militarized enforcement.</p>

However, the actions have drawn strong condemnation from UN experts, who stated the "use of lethal force in international waters without proper legal basis violates the international law of the sea" and "amounts to extrajudicial executions."

This comes as the Tony Blair Institute urges the government to prioritize "Cheaper Power 2030" over "Clean Power 2030," advocating for axing carbon taxes on gas. Miliband's department maintains its commitment to lowering bills through clean energy, despite market volatility and rising electricity costs. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategic gamble, however, carries the risk of "self-inflicted pain" through surging global energy prices, potentially impacting U.S. consumers.
