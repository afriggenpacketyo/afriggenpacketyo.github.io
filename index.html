          <h2>Trump Criticizes Republican Supporters Demanding Release of Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 12:59:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has publicly rebuked a segment of his own political base for demanding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, labeling them "weaklings" and calling the matter a "Hoax." This reaction comes as his administration declines to make more documents public, creating a rare and significant rift with some of his most ardent supporters. The president's frustration highlights the deep-seated belief among many in the MAGA movement that the Epstein case involves a high-level conspiracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump created market uncertainty by reportedly telling Republican lawmakers he intended to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, only to publicly deny it hours later, calling such a move "highly unlikely." The incident reflects ongoing pressure from the White House for the central bank to lower interest rates, a move Powell has so far resisted. The initial reports caused markets to dip, underscoring the sensitivity of the Fed's independence from political interference. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS "48 Hours" report delves into the highly unusual case of Linda Duffey, who admitted to shooting her husband in 2007 but claimed it was a tragic accident that occurred while she was mimicking a Bugs Bunny cartoon. This so-called "Bugs Bunny Defense" is considered exceptionally rare, and her story was convincing enough to create division among law enforcement authorities before the case even reached a courtroom. The article highlights the unpredictable nature of the justice system when faced with bizarre circumstances.</p>

          <p>The family of U.S. Army Air Corps Staff Sgt. Michael Musashe, who went missing during a mission over Germany in 1944, has received his long-lost Zippo lighter. The inscribed lighter was discovered after a relative saw it in a Facebook post from a Swiss collector's group. With help from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, the family retrieved the artifact, leading to an emotional moment for the airman's 95-year-old sister, who clutched it as if hugging the brother she lost 81 years ago.</p>

The Trump administration, which has baselessly claimed he is an MS-13 member, returned him to the U.S. to face smuggling charges. If released from jail, he faces immediate detention by ICE and a potential second deportation, making his case a flashpoint in immigration policy debates.</p>

The methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating settlements directly with collection agencies, and seeking assistance from hospital charity care programs.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declared that former Conservative ministers have "serious questions to answer" regarding a major data breach that exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who supported British forces. Starmer criticized the previous government's handling of the 2022 leak, which included obtaining a super-injunction to block reporting and creating a secret, costly resettlement program. The political fallout intensified after a court lifted the injunction, making the full extent of the failings public for the first time.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched a rare airstrike on Syria's Defense Ministry headquarters in Damascus, significantly escalating its involvement in the country's internal conflicts. The attack followed days of violent clashes in southern Syria between government forces and armed groups from the Druze religious minority, whom Israel has vowed to protect. The U.S. Trump administration expressed deep concern over the Israeli action, calling for an end to the fighting as it threatens fragile efforts to stabilize the new post-Assad Syrian government.</p>

Imamoglu is already in pre-trial detention on separate corruption charges his party claims are politically motivated. This new conviction, along with a previous one, could bar him from participating in future elections if upheld, in what critics see as an attempt to eliminate a key opposition figure.</p>

As a critical supplier of the EUV lithography machines required for the world's most advanced chips, ASML's cautious outlook reflects broader concerns across the semiconductor industry.
