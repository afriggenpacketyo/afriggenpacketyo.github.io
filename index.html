          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a distance approximating Taipei and Okinawa. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior seabed knowledge. This breakthrough, detailed in Acta Acustica, marks significant progress for long-range undersea messaging, potentially impacting both civilian and military applications, especially for tasks requiring high data integrity such as coordinating underwater drones.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders aimed at revitalizing the American nuclear energy industry. The goal is to expand American nuclear energy capacity from 100 GW today to 400 GW by 2050. The orders seek to expedite testing of new reactor designs, construct reactors on federal land, and reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to shorten licensing timelines. The administration also intends to support domestic uranium mining and enrichment to meet civilian and defense needs.</p>

A team of scientists used computer simulations to map the potential future spread of Aspergillus, a common group of fungi that can cause aspergillosis. The study found certain Aspergillus species will expand their range, pushing into new parts of North America, Europe, China, and Russia, and that fungal pathogens are also becoming increasingly resistant to treatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed West Point graduates, marking a stark contrast from his previous address amidst conflicts with the military establishment. This time, he faces little resistance, with the Defense Department aligned with his political agenda. Key figures like Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have accelerated Trump's priorities, leading to changes in diversity programs and military culture. This shift raises concerns about the military's apolitical nature and its allegiance to the Constitution rather than any one individual.</p>

The meat industry often prioritizes profit over animal welfare, leading to preventable deaths during transportation and a lack of accountability.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that human tooth sensitivity, which causes pain from cold or dental procedures, can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Scientists discovered that the tooth-like scales of ancient fish likely allowed them to sense their surroundings. This ability was inherited by our teeth, which evolved from that armor, allowing us to sense pain and temperature. The findings shed light on skeletal evolution and explain why we experience toothaches.</p>
