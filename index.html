          <p>At the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Dalian, China, Premier Li Qiang urged countries to collaborate on trade, despite rising tariffs and barriers, emphasizing that globalization is irreversible. He called on all parties not to turn trade into a political or security issue, asserting that engaging in the international economy is a means of reshaping global rules and order. Li Qiang avoided specific comments on U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, focusing instead on the importance of economic cooperation. The event was attended by political leaders from Singapore, Vietnam, and Ecuador, as well as prominent figures from Chinese tech and business sectors.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to state Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani after Mamdani secured a strong lead with 44% of the vote. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign, which resonated with younger voters, and hinted at a possible independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count since no candidate reached the 50% threshold, with comprehensive results expected on July 1. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters, marking a significant shift in the city's political landscape.</p>

          <p>A controversial Republican proposal led by Senator Mike Lee to sell off millions of acres of public lands in Western states, including California, was halted after being deemed extraneous to the budget under the Byrd Rule. The plan aimed to address housing needs by selling up to 3.3 million acres managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. Despite the setback, Lee is attempting to revise the proposal by removing Forest Service land and limiting eligible Bureau of Land Management land to areas near population centers. Environmentalists and public land advocates are celebrating the decision, but are preparing for further debate on the matter.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies reveals significant damage to key Iranian nuclear sites, including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan, following U.S. airstrikes ordered by President Trump. The images show craters along access roads and entrances to tunnel complexes at Fordow, while the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center displays destruction at the surface and tunnel entrances. At Natanz, craters believed to be caused by U.S. ordnance are filled and covered with dirt, with reports indicating the strikes targeted underground centrifuge halls. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that key buildings and underground systems at all three sites were hit, leading American officials to claim that Iran‚Äôs nuclear program has been severely set back.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral Democratic primary is a battle between left-wing outsider Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, reflecting the party's internal divisions. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has gained momentum with a focus on affordability and progressive policies, while Cuomo seeks a comeback after resigning amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani's platform includes free public buses, universal childcare, and rent freezes, but critics question the feasibility of these promises. The race utilizes ranked ballots, making it difficult to predict the outcome, but it is being closely watched as a proxy war between the party's left-wing and moderate factions.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by several months, but did not completely destroy it. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, with the resumption of the enrichment program depending on the time needed to clear entrances and repair supplies. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed these findings, while others insist that the strikes achieved total obliteration of Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

The CCC emphasizes the importance of lowering household bills to incentivize the transition to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are rising, heat pump installations remain below target despite government grants. The CCC also advocates for making electricity cheaper by removing charges related to older renewable energy projects from household bills, which could save households approximately ¬£200 annually, but at a significant cost to the Exchequer.</p>

          <h2>FBI Increases Counter-Terrorism Focus Following Iran Strikes</h2>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, the FBI is sharpening its focus on counter-terrorism efforts and immigration officials arrested 11 Iranian citizens in the U.S., some with alleged ties to Iran's military. The FBI has shifted agents from immigration-related cases back to counter-terrorism, and the Department of Homeland Security has communicated with state and local law enforcement about the heightened threat environment. While there are no specific threats to U.S. soil, authorities are increasing vigilance and outreach to potentially at-risk communities. This shift in focus comes amid concerns about potential Iranian sleeper cells and a history of Iranian-sponsored attacks in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran was in effect, but voiced frustration with both countries for violating the agreement shortly after it was announced. Despite the initial violations, the ceasefire appeared to be holding after Trump intervened, including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The State Department announced the reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and lifted shelter-in-place orders, though travel restrictions for government employees remained in place. Trump expressed his displeasure with Israel for launching strikes on Iran just before the ceasefire was due to begin.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, offering insights into how new stars are born. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study the Milky Way's evolution.</p>

The People's Bank of China plans to establish a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promote yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Beijing is also focusing on expanding access to futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for yuan-settled trades.

Despite the family's efforts to comply with legal processes, Paola faces deportation, highlighting the stricter enforcement policies under the Trump administration.
