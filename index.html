          <p>President Trump discussed his first 100 days in office in an exclusive ABC News interview, covering topics such as the economy, immigration policies, and foreign relations. He defended his administration's immigration strategies and addressed concerns about wrongful deportations, asserting they are being careful in their efforts. Trump also suggested that Vladimir Putin might be "tapping" him along in Ukraine peace talks and criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the war's commencement. Additionally, Trump addressed questions about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, and its cost-cutting measures, claiming billions have been saved. </p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying auto tariffs to provide some relief to carmakers, acknowledging concerns that the levies would negatively impact U.S. manufacturing. While the 25% tariff on imported vehicles remains, automakers will receive partial reimbursements on auto parts tariffs for two years, offering a temporary offset. General Motors postponed its first-quarter conference call to reassess its financial guidance due to the tariff uncertainty, highlighting the industry's sensitivity to trade policy changes. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized the administration's commitment to bringing domestic auto manufacturing back, though analysts suggest the changes may not fully address the long-term challenges facing the industry. </p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the U.S. Border Patrol to cease illegal stops and warrantless arrests in California's Central Valley following raids targeting farm workers and laborers. The order came after agents detained and arrested dozens of individuals, including a U.S. citizen, without reasonable suspicion. The judge found a pattern of violating constitutional rights during detentions and federal law by executing warrantless arrests. The ACLU can now bring a class action lawsuit against the government, and the Border Patrol must provide detailed documentation of stops and arrests in the Central Valley. </p>

Musk's role as an advisor to President Trump and his influence over spaceflight and environmental regulations have also drawn scrutiny. </p>

Despite the lack of a majority, the Liberals secured a fourth consecutive term. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, lost his seat.

          <p>A new study reveals that human wounds heal more slowly than those of other mammals, including chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice. The slower healing rate is attributed to the evolutionary loss of fur, which contains hair follicles that aid in rapid skin repair. Human skin, packed with sweat glands for cooling, lacks the efficient repair capabilities of furry animals. The trade-off between hair and sweat glands allowed our ancestors to engage in physical activity in hot environments and cooled the machinery of our big brains. </p>
