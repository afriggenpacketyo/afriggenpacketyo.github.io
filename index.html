        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court suggested the Federal Reserve board members have protection against presidential firings, while allowing President Trump to remove members of other federal agencies' boards for now. The majority opinion, penned by six conservative justices, said the Constitution vests executive power in the President, allowing removal of executive officers without cause, with narrow exceptions. Justice Kagan dissented, arguing that existing law protects members of bodies like the NLRB and MSPB from presidential removal without good cause. Kagan also criticized the majority's exemption for the Federal Reserve, noting its independence rests on similar foundations as other agencies.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while ensuring the continuation of a strategically important U.S. military base.

Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the base's importance for British defense and security, citing its role in combating terrorism.

          <p>During a White House visit, the President of South Africa made a wisecrack about not having a plane to give President Trump, underscoring the perception of Trump's penchant for gifts. The comment followed the controversy surrounding the acceptance of a free jumbo jet from Qatar. Trump responded insouciantly, stating he would take a plane if offered. The joke highlighted concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the blending of personal enrichment with official duties.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision, rejected a plan to allow Oklahoma to use government money to run the nationâ€™s first religious charter school. Justice Barrett recused herself, leading to the tie. The deadlock upholds a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that blocked the school. The decision sets no nationwide precedent on whether the First Amendment permits states to sponsor religious charter schools, and the question is likely to come before the court again.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. The study compared GLP-1s to DDP-4 inhibitors, another diabetes medication without the same weight loss effect. Women treated with GLP-1s had a significantly lower risk of obesity-related cancer and all-cause mortality. Researchers hope to conduct longer studies, including those without diabetes.</p>
