          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that Donald Trump will undertake a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This visit is unusual, as second-term U.S. presidents are typically not offered a full state visit. The event, which will involve senior royals, is seen by the British government as a significant opportunity for soft diplomacy, particularly concerning the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariffs. A full ceremonial welcome and state banquet are planned, though public-facing events are expected to be limited due to security concerns.</p>

          <p>Lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from a public perception linked to gangs to being celebrated as a unique art form and a force for community healing. The article highlights the intricate craftsmanship of the customized cars and profiles key figures like artist Rob Vanderslice and community leaders Arthur and Joan Medina. Once banned in some areas, lowrider events are now embraced, with car clubs focusing on charity and mentoring at-risk youth. This cultural shift reflects a redefinition of rebellion, now centered on community development and preserving heritage in a region facing economic and social challenges.</p>

          <p>A nonprofit named Healing Justice is bringing together survivors of violent crimes and wrongfully convicted individuals from different cases to participate in healing retreats. Founded by rape survivor Jennifer Thompson, whose testimony led to a wrongful conviction, the organization aims to address the shared trauma experienced by both groups when the justice system fails. Through group sessions and art therapy, participants find common ground, helping victims understand the plight of the exonerated and allowing exonerees to process their unjust incarceration. The program demonstrates a powerful, unconventional path toward recovery for all parties harmed by a single wrongful conviction.</p>

          <p>The White House is defending a new 50% tariff on Brazil, asserting it is a necessary component of a global strategy to bolster U.S. national security by onshoring production. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the administration's goal is to reduce the country's trade deficit, which they view as a national emergency. This justification was met with skepticism, as critics pointed out that the U.S. currently holds a trade surplus with Brazil. The administration maintains that a consistent, worldwide tariff strategy is essential to prevent transshipping and achieve its overall economic and security objectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drake concluded his three-day residency at London's Wireless Festival with a headline set that was cut short after just 40 minutes, leaving many fans frustrated. The rapper appeared to be racing against the venue's strict 21:30 curfew, performing a rushed medley of his hits. Unlike previous nights that featured numerous special guests and longer runtimes, the final show had only three guest appearances. Many attendees expressed their disappointment, with some stating they spent more time queuing to enter the festival than they did watching the performance. The incident has raised questions about the event's scheduling and management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen, the common habit of staying up late to watch television can be detrimental to brain health. He explains that sacrificing sleep prevents the brain from performing its essential nightly 'cleaning' process, which is crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive function. This lack of adequate rest can lead to poor decision-making the following day. Dr. Amen also notes that exposure to blue light from screens before bed suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. He advises prioritizing sleep and using blue-light blockers to maintain optimal brain function and overall well-being.</p>

          <h2>Justin Bieber Releases Surprise Album 'Swag' to Mixed but Intrigued Reception</h2>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," a raw and improvisatory project that leans heavily into his R&B and gospel-blues sensibilities. The album follows a tumultuous period for the artist, including a canceled tour and a new child, and its messy, unpolished sound is seen as a reflection of his life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album features cooled-out grooves, reverbed beats, and even excerpts from his viral confrontations with paparazzi. The review suggests that while some moments are awkward, the album is an authentic and often beautiful exploration of a superstar embracing his quirky, less commercial side.</p>

          <p>Investigators are examining the medical records of Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, the pilot of the Air India flight that crashed in Ahmedabad, following claims he suffered from depression. The preliminary report suggests the crash was caused by the fuel supply to the engines being cut off, focusing the inquiry on pilot action. Colleagues and aviation experts noted the pilot had taken leave for mental health issues and bereavement, though he was medically cleared to fly. The investigation is exploring the cockpit voice recording where one pilot questions the other about the fuel cutoff, raising critical questions about the circumstances leading to the tragedy.</p>

          <p>The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have launched a new, intense offensive on el-Fasher, the last army-controlled city in Sudan's Darfur region. The attack involved storming a major cattle market and a prison, leading to a fierce, seven-hour battle before the army pushed them back. Residents report continued shelling and horrific conditions, with widespread starvation and a lack of medical supplies. The conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with millions displaced and famine looming. The international community's response has been criticized as inadequate, leaving civilians to rely on local volunteers and their own solidarity to survive.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense spending in response to growing global threats. In a speech to the military, Macron stated that freedom has never been so threatened since 1945, citing Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and uncertainty from the United States. The annual defense budget is now set to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal originally planned for 2030, effectively doubling the spending from when he first took office. Macron emphasized that to be free, France must be powerful and feared on the world stage.</p>

          <p>To be considered among the top 10% of wealthiest American households, a net worth of at least $2 million was required as of the Federal Reserve's 2022 survey. This figure is significantly higher than the median household net worth of $192,900, highlighting the vast wealth disparity in the country. The article notes that this threshold is a moving target, likely having increased since 2022 due to stock market gains and inflation. It is estimated that the current figure to break into the top 10% is closer to $2.2 million, a milestone achieved through high earnings, diligent saving, and successful investments.

          <p>A child being treated at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital has died after contracting measles. The hospital has seen a surge in seriously ill children with the virus, treating 17 cases since June, and has expressed deep concern over the rise in infections. This tragedy highlights the dangers of the highly contagious disease, especially for young infants and those with weakened immune systems. Health officials attribute the spike in cases to a decline in MMR vaccine uptake in the region, which is well below the 95% coverage target set by the World Health Organization for community protection.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 after battling an undisclosed illness. A towering and often polarizing figure, Buhari's career spanned from a repressive military dictatorship in the 1980s to a historic democratic victory in 2015. His first term was known for a harsh anti-corruption drive, while his later presidency was marked by economic decline and widespread insecurity, despite his promises to tackle both. Though he retained a loyal following, particularly in the north, his legacy remains complex and fraught with both praise and deep criticism.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," has responded to the death of a 57-year-old Mexican farmworker, Jaime Alanis, following an immigration raid at a California cannabis farm. Homan called the death "unfortunate" but defended the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), stating the agents were "doing their job." Alanis reportedly fell from a greenhouse roof while attempting to evade officers and died from his injuries. The raid, part of an increased immigration crackdown, resulted in around 200 arrests and has drawn scrutiny over the chaotic and dangerous conditions it created for the workers.</p>

          <p>A Senate report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least 10 requests from Donald Trump's security detail for additional resources during his 2024 campaign, prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The requests included enhanced counter-drone systems, more counter-assault personnel, and additional snipers. The report from the Senate Homeland Security Committee accuses the agency of a "disturbing pattern" of failures and criticizes former director Kimberly Cheatle for falsely testifying that no requests were denied. This information adds a new layer to the investigation, suggesting a systemic lack of support preceding the nearly successful attack.</p>
