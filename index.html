          <p>Air Canada suspended all operations after its 10,000 flight attendants went on strike, leaving thousands of travelers stranded globally. The strike, the first since 1985, centers on disputes over wages and unpaid work hours, which the union argues are insufficient given inflation and company profits. In response to the widespread disruption, the Canadian federal government quickly intervened, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration to resolve the contract dispute. This move aims to restore flight services promptly but has drawn criticism from the union as a violation of their right to take job action.</p>

          <p>Students in the UK who started secondary school during the COVID-19 pandemic have opened time capsule letters they wrote to themselves four years ago. The letters, written just after a major lockdown in 2021, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their personal aspirations for the future. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill hope during a disruptive period, provided a moment of reflection for the students as they prepared to receive their GCSE exam results. Their writings captured a unique historical moment, detailing experiences like learning in "bubbles" and their hopes for a post-pandemic world.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. The stated goal is to pursue a direct peace agreement to end the war, a shift from previous discussions centered on a ceasefire. Trump indicated that the proposal includes security guarantees for Ukraine, a development European leaders were reportedly relieved to hear, though details remain vague. The announcement sets the stage for high-stakes diplomacy, with Zelenskyy previously being critical of any negotiations that occur without Ukraine's direct involvement.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration-led crackdown on violent crime in Washington, D.C., has resulted in over 240 arrests and the seizure of 38 firearms. The "Making D.C. Safe and Beautiful" task force, which involves federal teams and National Guard troops, has targeted gang members, robbery suspects, and immigration violators. The operation follows Trump's temporary federalization of the city's police department, a move justified by the administration as a necessary response to rising crime. However, the action has faced criticism from local officials who point to data showing a significant decrease in violent crime.</p>

While the hurricane's core is forecast to remain at sea and is not expected to directly impact the United States, its rapid intensification highlights the potential severity of the current hurricane season.</p>

Brands that found success in China's competitive domestic market are now using hubs like Singapore as a launchpad for global growth, testing their menus before expanding to other countries. This culinary wave is seen by some as a form of "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially softening China's international image and correcting long-held stereotypes about its food culture.

While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's gains reflect its strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points.

          <p>Reports have emerged suggesting that former President Donald Trump's proposed peace plan for Ukraine involves Kyiv ceding the unoccupied parts of the Donbas region to Russia. Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, Trump allegedly relayed to European leaders that this concession could be the basis for a deal, with Putin offering to freeze the current front lines elsewhere in exchange. This position marks a significant break with Ukraine and its European allies, who have consistently opposed changing international borders by force. The revelation adds a contentious new layer to the diplomatic efforts ahead of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's visit to Washington.</p>

          <p>Norfolk Police arrested 13 individuals in Norwich for displaying support for Palestine Action, a group recently designated as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The arrests occurred during a protest outside City Hall, with those detained suspected of violating the Terrorism Act by displaying items in support of a proscribed group. The ban on Palestine Action followed acts of criminal damage, making membership or support a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The proscription and subsequent arrests have been described as concerning by human rights organizations like Amnesty International.</p>

          <p>From a Ukrainian perspective, the recent summit in Alaska between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is being viewed as a significant disappointment and a successful information operation for Russia. Analysts in Ukraine argue that the meeting produced no concrete benefits for their country and instead served to legitimize Putin on the world stage without achieving any meaningful progress toward peace. The optics of the summit, including the formal reception for the Russian leader, have angered many Ukrainians. There are now fears that President Zelenskyy will face increased pressure from the U.S. to accept unfavorable terms.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that former U.S. President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. The comments came after Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which did not result in a ceasefire but shifted focus toward a direct peace agreement. Starmer commended Trump's leadership but emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The UK's supportive stance highlights a key European perspective on the high-stakes negotiations, reinforcing the need for continued pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>A Denver man was scammed out of $17,000 after his call to United Airlines' official customer service number was mysteriously transferred to a fraudster. While trying to rebook a canceled flight, the man, Dan Smoker, spoke with an agent who processed a new ticket and then a fraudulent $17,000 charge under a different merchant name. Call logs confirm he dialed the correct number, but United's internal records show the legitimate portion of the call was much shorter, raising questions about a potential breach in their phone system. The airline is investigating the incident, which highlights a sophisticated new threat for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising adults, particularly those over 60, to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. Maintaining muscle mass, including the heart muscle itself, is crucial with age, and protein plays a key role. Experts recommend consuming at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying, to reap the benefits.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Explain How Hurricane Erin Underwent Explosive Intensification</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's transformation into a Category 5 storm is a prime example of "rapid intensification," a process where a storm's wind speeds increase dramatically in a short period. Meteorologists explain that a combination of low wind shear and passing over exceptionally warm ocean waters created the perfect conditions for this explosive growth. Sea surface temperatures in the storm's path are over 85 degrees Fahrenheit, providing ample fuel. This phenomenon, which is becoming more common due to climate change, makes storms more dangerous and harder to predict, complicating emergency preparedness for coastal communities.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street, with its leadership confirming the future opening of new standalone stores. The brand, which was a cultural touchstone for a generation before its parent company collapsed in 2020, recently held its first catwalk show in seven years to signal its revival. Now owned by online retailer Asos, Topshop faces the challenge of recapturing its "cool" factor and appealing to both its nostalgic millennial base and new Gen-Z shoppers. The return comes at a difficult time for retail, but the brand hopes to fill a gap with its unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his valor during a 1944 mission where, as a pilot, he attacked and destroyed a German U-boat despite sustaining 72 separate injuries. His actions were praised for their "determination, fortitude and devotion to duty." After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions simply as his duty.</p>
