          <p>Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers believes President Trump is exerting extraordinary pressure on higher education, particularly vilified universities like Harvard, to force them to "bend the knee." Summers views Trump's tactics as "extortion," threatening billions in research funds, foreign student status, tax-exempt status, and academic freedom. He argues that if Harvard, a leading university, cannot resist, no other institution can, highlighting a confrontation over American values. The White House counters that it is standing up for students' civil rights, alleging universities like Harvard fail to protect them.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, a Labour minister, faced backlash after referring to the issue of sexual assault gangs as a ‚Äúdog whistle‚Äù during a BBC Radio 4 program. Survivors of grooming gangs accused Powell of dismissing their experiences and undermining the seriousness of child exploitation. Despite calls for a statutory inquiry into historical sexual abuse cases, Labour has resisted, opting for a more flexible approach involving local councils. Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, defended Powell, stating she was "mortified" by the reaction and that her remarks were taken out of context.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a highly damaging element in relationships. This comparison undermines a partner's sense of worth, leading to insecurity and questioning of their value. The phrase often masks a deeper issue: a fear of direct communication about unmet needs. Openly expressing needs without resorting to comparisons fosters healthier relationships. The more secure and emotionally close a person feels in their relationship, the more likely they are to communicate directly.</p>

Plans are underway to improve infrastructure and tap into new water sources, including a reservoir in Oxfordshire. The region's low rainfall necessitates these measures to ensure water security.</p>
