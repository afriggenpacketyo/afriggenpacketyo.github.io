          <p>Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the U.S. is failing to adequately educate young people about personal finance. He cautions against get-rich-quick schemes prevalent on new investing websites, which he sees as promoting financial gambling. Edelman stresses the importance of credible financial information sources, noting the risks of relying on platforms like TikTok for financial education. He highlights the lack of mandated personal finance courses in high schools as a significant problem, but also points to the increasing number of states now requiring such courses, offering hope for future generations.</p>

A recent equipment failure at a Philadelphia facility caused significant flight delays, highlighting the vulnerability of the system. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy unveiled a plan to replace dated radar and communications systems, requiring congressional approval for billions in funding.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's "Too Late" label as the Fed navigates a volatile policy mix with threats to both growth and inflation. Some economists believe Powell is in a no-win situation, with the risk of making a mistake regardless of his actions. While Trump is pushing for rate cuts, Powell is hesitant to act preemptively, citing a solid economy and labor market, potentially leading to criticisms of being slow to respond to economic changes.</p>

          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates are a serious issue that progressives should address, despite the topic being increasingly politicized. It contends that a shrinking population can lead to economic and societal challenges, including a smaller workforce supporting a larger elderly population. The author suggests that policies supporting family formation, such as affordable housing and universal pre-K, align with progressive values and could help stabilize population levels.</p>
