          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have phased out PFAS, or "forever chemicals," from cookware and children's products due to concerns about affordable options. The legislation aimed to prohibit the sale of cookware with intentionally added PFAS by 2030 and phase out PFAS in products for infants, children, ski wax, dental floss, food packaging, and cleaning products starting in 2028. Senator Ben Allen, who introduced the bill, expressed disappointment but affirmed his commitment to addressing the issue. Concerns were raised about the bill's impact on jobs and the economy, as well as the science behind PFAS regulation. The article highlights a disagreement between environmental activists and culinary personalities over the safety and necessity of PFAS in cookware.</p>

          <p>The parents of Joshua Jahn, the 29-year-old who opened fire on a Dallas immigration facility, reported that he experienced delusions of radiation sickness and plastic allergies after returning from a job in Washington state. Jahn killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life in the attack. He had become obsessed with artificial intelligence and withdrawn into computer games, according to his parents. The article notes that authorities previously stated that Jahn left notes expressing anti-ICE sentiments. The records offer no definitive motive for the shooting, but portray Jahn as a troubled young man with mental health issues.</p>

          <p>China has announced the mass production of a four-channel, single-photon detector, known as the "photon catcher," which is designed to detect individual photons. This ultra-low noise device is a key component in quantum communication and quantum radar technologies. It has potential applications in daily communications and national defense, including the detection and tracking of stealth aircraft. The device was developed by the Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province, marking a significant advancement in quantum technology capabilities.</p>

          <p>Air regulators issued violations to two foundries in Paramount, Los Angeles County, after detecting elevated levels of hexavalent chromium, a toxic metal, near the facilities.

The foundries, Pro Cast Industries and Fenico, allegedly failed to conduct compliance tests, properly clean areas, and obtain necessary permits. Hexavalent chromium is a potent carcinogen commonly used in metal coating processes, and the air district may seek settlements or financial penalties from the foundries to ensure the safety of the residents.</p>

          <p>San Cha, an L.A.-based musician and artist, is premiering her experimental opera “Inebria me” at REDCAT, expanding on her album “La Luz de la Esperanza.” The opera follows Dolores, a bride in a deadly love triangle, guided by Esperanza, a genderless spirit. San Cha draws on her background in ranchera music and underground drag scenes to create visually arresting and thought-provoking work. The opera employs the classic narrative structure of the telenovela, but with a queer twist, blending religious aspects with a glamorous, electronic aesthetic.</p>

          <p>The government is advising organizations to prepare for potential cyberattacks by creating backup plans on pen and paper. This guidance follows a recent increase in serious cyberattacks that have disrupted major companies. The National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) recommends a "resilience engineering" strategy, focusing on building systems that can anticipate, absorb, recover, and adapt in the event of an attack. The NCSC has reported a rise in "nationally significant" incidents, with financially motivated attacks and teenage hacking gangs posing increasing threats. Organizations are also encouraged to utilize free cybersecurity tools and services offered by the NCSC.</p>

          <p>A government scheme aimed at improving energy efficiency through home insulation has been found to be widely flawed, with tens of thousands of homes needing remedial work. The National Audit Office (NAO) discovered that 98% of homes with external wall insulation and 29% with internal insulation have issues leading to damp and mold. The NAO cited an under-skilled workforce, businesses cutting corners, and unclear standards as reasons for the poor quality installations. The government has stated that action will be taken to fix the affected homes at no cost to the consumer, with comprehensive reforms to prevent future issues.</p>

          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP) is experiencing a resurgence in political competitiveness after a period of instability and electoral setbacks. John Swinney's leadership has brought stability to the party, and support has fragmented among its rivals.

The party is optimistic about the upcoming election and aims to secure a majority to strengthen its argument for another independence referendum.

Health policy experts warn that the expiration of these subsidies could cause monthly insurance costs to double for many people, making healthcare unaffordable.

Hegseth responded to the criticism with dismissive social media posts, while the Pentagon maintains the policy is necessary for national security.
