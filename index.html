          <p>'The Assessment' is a dystopian film exploring a future where parenthood requires a rigorous week-long evaluation.  The film features strong performances, particularly from Alicia Vikander, but falters in its conclusion. While initially compelling in its exploration of parenthood, authoritarianism, and connection, the film's ending feels underdeveloped.</p>
