          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing a surge in popularity, securing 8.8% of the vote in the recent federal election, nearly double their 2021 result. Opinion polls now place them on par with the Green Party. This rise is attributed to their focus on affordable housing and their peace stance, especially concerning the Russia-Ukraine war, advocating for diplomatic solutions and stronger sanctions. The party has almost doubled its membership and played a role in the election of the new Federal Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, demonstrating newfound influence in the Bundestag.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, even as exports to the United States sharply declined due to President Trump's tariffs. Overall exports jumped 8.1% year-on-year, while imports saw a slight decrease. This redirection of trade is seen as a signal of supply chain adjustments, with Chinese factories capitalizing on tariff pauses in Southeast Asia to fulfill orders destined for the U.S. The data offers temporary relief to Beijing amid concerns about the trade war's impact, though economists caution about potential unemployment spikes.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift away from its protectionist trade policies.

While some experts believe a trade deal could benefit certain sectors, others caution that it could harm domestic manufacturing. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and a trade deal could significantly impact India's economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, drawing criticism from Democrats. Hayden's dismissal followed backlash from a conservative group accusing her of promoting content opposed to Trump's agenda. Democrats condemned the firing, calling Hayden a trailblazer and a dedicated public servant. The Library of Congress holds a vast collection of the nation's books and history.</p>

Trump stated that the tariffs are already at their peak, suggesting a potential reduction. This announcement comes as the U.S. and the UK finalized a tariffs deal, the first since Trump imposed steep levies globally. The upcoming meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials signals a potential de-escalation of trade tensions.</p>
