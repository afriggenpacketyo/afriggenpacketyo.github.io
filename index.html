          <p>Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has launched a new electric SUV, the YU7, with a starting price lower than Tesla's Model Y in China. The company reported receiving over 200,000 orders within three minutes of the launch, causing its stock to surge. While the YU7 boasts a longer driving range and various AI features, it reportedly falls short of Tesla's driver-assist capabilities. This launch intensifies the ongoing EV price war in the competitive Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Microsoft announced it is retiring the infamous "Blue Screen of Death," a system error message that has been a part of the Windows operating system for over four decades. The change, part of a broader effort to improve system resilience following a major IT outage, will replace the blue background with a black one. The new, simplified error screen will feature more condensed text and will be rolled out to Windows 11 devices later this summer, aiming to make unexpected restarts less jarring for users.</p>

          <p>In closing arguments for the trial of Sean Combs, federal prosecutors asserted that the music mogul ran a criminal enterprise built on "violence, power and fear." The prosecution detailed how Combs allegedly coerced his ex-girlfriends, including Cassie Ventura, into nonconsensual sexual encounters, using financial control and threats of blackmail. Prosecutors argued that Combs' inner circle, including staff and security, knowingly facilitated these crimes and covered them up. The government urged the jury to hold Combs accountable for charges including sex trafficking and racketeering.</p>

          <p>Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted for the 2017 murders of nine people in Zama, Japan, has been executed. Shiraishi became known as the "Twitter killer" for using the social media platform to find and lure his victims, who were mostly young women expressing suicidal thoughts. He would then murder and dismember them in his apartment. His death sentence was finalized in 2021, concluding one of the most shocking and high-profile criminal cases in recent Japanese history.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city vulnerable to the "urban heat island" effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a single "cool block." The project, led by GreenRoots, aims to combat extreme temperatures in the densely developed, low-shade neighborhood. Interventions include planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. This urban laboratory provides a potential template for other cities to address rising heat waves exacerbated by climate change, which disproportionately affect urban areas.</p>
