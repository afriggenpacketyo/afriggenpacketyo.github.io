          <p>Karoline Leavitt, President Trump's press secretary, has moved back into the traditional, spacious press secretary's office in the West Wing, previously occupied by Taylor Budowich. This move follows Budowich's departure and signifies Leavitt taking on some of his former duties, alongside Steven Cheung. West Wing office space is a long-standing symbol of influence and proximity to the president. At 28, Leavitt is the youngest person to hold the press secretary role.</p>

          <p>Ahead of its 51st season, Saturday Night Live is undergoing a significant shift in its casting strategy, increasingly recruiting talent from online platforms like TikTok and podcasts. While some veteran cast members remain, new additions include comedians who gained fame through short-form digital content rather than traditional improv or stand-up circuits. This move, spearheaded by Lorne Michaels, represents a nudge towards integrating social-media-friendly faces into the ensemble. The article notes the potential for controversy with one new hire linked to polarizing right-wing personalities.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The President and the Dragon," premiering on Amazon Prime Video, chronicles Jimmy Carter's decades-long mission to eradicate Guinea worm disease. The film details how the former president, inspired by the devastating impact of the parasite spread through contaminated water, made its elimination a life's work. Carter's efforts, focusing on clean water and education rather than medication, dramatically reduced cases from 3.5 million in 1986 to just 14 by his death in 2024. The documentary also touches on Carter's role in ending civil wars in Sudan, emphasizing hope and collective human effort.</p>

          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the pioneering conservationist, has died at 91, leaving behind a revolutionary legacy in understanding chimpanzees. Her groundbreaking work in Tanzania, starting in 1960, challenged scientific beliefs by observing chimps making and using tools, and highlighted their complex social structures. Despite facing cynicism and sexism as a self-taught scientist, her dedication reshaped views on human exceptionalism and inspired generations of researchers. Goodall later focused on global conservation, tirelessly advocating for nature and stressing the urgency of addressing climate change and biodiversity loss.</p>

          <p>French soldiers have boarded the oil tanker Boracay, believed to be part of Russia's "shadow fleet" used to circumvent Ukraine war sanctions. The Benin-flagged vessel, previously detained by Estonia, was anchored off western France after drone disruptions in Denmark. President Macron cited "serious offenses" by the crew, while prosecutors investigate refusal to stop and flag issues. This incident highlights Europe's heightened defense concerns amid Russian incursions and efforts to counter Moscow's obscured shipping operations.</p>

While overall sales were strong, industry experts like Ford CEO Jim Farley anticipate a potential drop in EV market share post-incentive. Automakers are responding by adjusting pricing and offering their own incentives to maintain momentum in the evolving EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

The undercover footage showed officers making racist comments about immigrants and Muslims, being dismissive of sexual assault claims, and reveling in the use of force. Eight officers and one staff member have been suspended, with two more removed from front-line duties. The Home Secretary and London Mayor condemned the actions, calling for swift dismissals and urgent reforms to restore public trust.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $26 billion in federal funding for Democratic-leaning states, targeting transit projects in New York and green-energy initiatives across 16 states. This action, announced by OMB Director Russ Vought, is seen as President Trump using the government shutdown to punish political opponents. Vice President JD Vance also warned of potential layoffs for federal workers if the shutdown persists. Democratic leaders condemned these moves as "blackmail" and partisan, intensifying the political gridlock over the $1.7 trillion budget dispute.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked President Trump's request to immediately remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ruling she can stay in her role for now. The court will hear arguments on her firing in January. Trump had cited mortgage fraud claims, which Cook denies, arguing her removal is politically motivated due to her monetary policy stance. Cook, a Biden appointee, contends her firing is illegal, as presidents can only remove Fed governors "for cause." This decision allows Cook to participate in upcoming interest rate votes.

Despite initial skepticism about screen protectors concealing flaws, the phones showed minimal wear and healthy battery capacities. However, the reviewer cautioned against Temu due to pricing, noting the devices were double the cost of those on the used market, and highlighted the prevalence of fake iPhone listings on the platform. This suggests quality can vary greatly depending on the seller.</p>

In contrast, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the statement "deeply disturbing," asserting that Americans should not be viewed as targets for the military. Trump's directive to "crush violent radical-left terrorism" has led to National Guard troops training in Portland, even as they work without pay due to the government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts a "stagflation-lite" scenario for the U.S. economy, characterized by modestly elevated inflation and unemployment, driven by Trump administration tariffs and interest rate cuts. The report, released before the government shutdown, warns that rising layoffs could lead to a recession, with a full-blown stagflation risk if Trump exerts more control over the Federal Reserve. It notes a deteriorated labor market and rising inflation, forecasting weak GDP growth. Consumer spending is also expected to weaken after a surge in EV purchases tied to expiring tax credits.

          <p>Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin have suspended abortion services, navigating a funding crisis caused by a provision in Donald Trump’s new tax and spending bill. This law blocks abortion providers receiving over $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements from participating in the program for one year, a measure narrowly tailored to target Planned Parenthood. The organization's national office condemned the move as intended to "sow chaos" and restrict healthcare access. While two independent providers remain, the suspension highlights the vulnerability of clinics, especially in rural areas, and the broader impact on essential services like cancer screenings and contraception.</p>
