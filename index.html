          <p>Across the U.S., communities commemorated Juneteenth, the federal holiday marking the end of slavery following the Civil War, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. Celebrations included parades, art shows, and educational workshops, paying homage to June 19, 1865, when the last enslaved people in Texas were freed. Juneteenth became a U.S. holiday in 2021 under the Biden administration, with festivities growing since its national recognition. Events ranged from small gatherings to large parades, reflecting the holiday's increasing significance and widespread observance across the nation. The holiday is a moment of reflection on the history of slavery and the ongoing pursuit of equality.</p>

          <p>India aims to become a global leader in technology and other sectors, but its focus on global ambitions may be impacting its relationships with neighboring countries in South Asia. While India's Neighborhood First Policy aimed to improve regional ties, some experts suggest it has taken a backseat to broader foreign policy goals. Economic instability and political fragility in South Asian countries, coupled with China's growing influence, pose challenges to India's regional role. Some analysts argue that India's unilateral approach and perceived diplomacy of domination have fueled resentment among its neighbors, potentially hindering its global aspirations, as India may benefit economically and strategically from closer regional integration.</p>

          <p>The world is on edge as the conflict between Iran and Israel intensifies, with the potential for direct U.S. military intervention. The Kremlin warned that U.S. involvement would trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," while the U.K. government convened an emergency Cobra meeting. Despite international calls for restraint, both Iran and Israel continue to exchange deadly blows, with no signs of de-escalation. U.S. President Trump has remained noncommittal about potential military strikes, stating that "the next week is going to be big," indicating a volatile and uncertain situation in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The future of HPV vaccination in the United States is now uncertain after the nationâ€™s health secretary dismissed all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). This decision followed growing evidence that a single dose of the vaccine could be as effective as two, a practice already adopted by over 50 countries. The new ACIP members, some of whom have spread misinformation about vaccines, may alter existing guidelines, potentially impacting insurance coverage and healthcare provider recommendations. Experts worry that these changes could reduce vaccination rates and erode public trust in vaccines, especially since HPV vaccination is already seen as controversial by some.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing damage and injuries, prompting strong condemnation and vows of retaliation from Israeli leaders. Israel's defense chief accused Iran of war crimes and threatened to hold Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accountable.

Yeztugo's unique multi-stage approach distinguishes it from other antiviral medications, and it is considered a major scientific breakthrough in the fight against HIV.

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive a Â£150 discount on their energy bills this winter due to changes in the Warm Home Discount scheme. The government is scrapping the property size and energy score qualifications, extending the benefit to 2.7 million additional homes, including nearly a million with children. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some argue that the scheme still excludes those most at risk. The expansion will be funded by energy companies, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills, though the government says savings from cutting company expenditure will offset this rise.

          <p>Julius Malema, a controversial South African opposition MP, has been denied entry to the UK, with the Home Office citing his support for Hamas and statements that could be interpreted as inciting violence against white people. His party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), condemned the decision as an attack on democratic debate and defended Malema's views on economic inequality in South Africa. Malema has been a vocal critic of Western imperialism and advocates for the nationalization of white-owned land. This is the second time he has been denied entry to the UK in recent months.</p>

          <p>Google is expected to lose its appeal against a record 4.1-billion-euro antitrust fine, following an advisor's recommendation to the European Union's top court. The fine relates to a long-running antitrust case concerning Google's Android operating system. The European Court of Justice is likely to dismiss Google's appeal and uphold the fine, which was reduced in 2022 from an initial 4.34 billion euros. This setback highlights ongoing regulatory challenges for tech giants in Europe.</p>

The OfS has published guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech under a new law set to take effect in August. The guidance covers various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, emphasizing the freedom to discuss any topic within legal boundaries. The Union of Jewish Students welcomed the clarification that Holocaust denial is not protected speech, while also ensuring protection against antisemitic harassment.</p>

An anonymous complaint has triggered an investigation by North Norfolk District Council, alleging that the house was not built according to approved designs. Omaze has submitted a pre-application and is preparing a retrospective planning application, but the winner remains unable to access the property. The planning documents indicate the house was built larger than permitted, and a tennis court and swimming pool do not appear to have planning permission.</p>

These companies have released foldables that are lighter and thinner than Samsung's offerings.

          <p>The Bank of England has decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%, hinting at possible cuts as early as August. Inflation remains above the Bank's target rate, prompting caution due to concerns about the impact of the Israel-Iran conflict on energy costs. The Bank acknowledges underlying growth is weak and is closely monitoring the labor market. Despite the pause, expectations for future rate cuts remain, contingent on economic developments and global events. (not investment advice)</p>

Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel has called on the UK government to back the US if it attacks Iran. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey called for any legal advice to be published, adding: "The last thing we need is for the UK to be dragged into another illegal war in the Middle East by the US."</p>

The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released several times over more than a decade.
