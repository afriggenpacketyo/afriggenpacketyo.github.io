          <p>Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski announced the closure of the Russian consulate in Krakow, citing evidence of Russian involvement in an arson attack on a Warsaw shopping center in 2024. This action follows previous closures of Russian consulates in Poznan, leaving only one remaining in Gdansk. The move reflects escalating tensions between Warsaw and Moscow, with European countries increasingly attributing acts of sabotage to Russia as part of hybrid warfare. Russia's Foreign Ministry has vowed an "adequate response" to the closure, further straining relations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has revealed its comprehensive strategy to reduce immigration to the UK, emphasizing a controlled, selective, and fair system. Key proposals include raising the qualification threshold for skilled worker visas to degree-level, expanding eligibility for elite university graduates, and extending the residency requirement for indefinite leave to remain to 10 years. The government also plans to scrap the care worker visa, implement stricter rules for overseas graduates, and increase English language requirements for work visas. These measures aim to address long-term recruitment issues while ensuring firms invest in workplace skills, though the exact impact on net migration remains unspecified.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced the launch of Fox's direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, slated to debut before the NFL season.

          <p>As President Trump emphasizes closer ties with Latin America, China is actively reinforcing its presence in the region, hosting President Lula da Silva of Brazil and other officials in Beijing. China aims to counter what it perceives as a "new Monroe Doctrine" from the U.S., seeking to solidify its economic and geopolitical influence. While Latin American countries value China as an economic partner and potential counterweight to U.S. power, they also harbor concerns about Chinese exporters flooding their markets. Despite these complexities, China continues to expand its trade and investment in Latin America, offering partnerships in technology and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement with China marks progress in strategically decoupling the U.S. from reliance on Chinese products. While a generalized decoupling is not the goal, Bessent emphasized the importance of securing strategic necessities and resilient supply chains, as highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement involves suspending reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, while maintaining tariffs on specific industries like steel, critical medicines, and semiconductors. Bessent also expressed optimism regarding China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of fentanyl precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's interim government has banned all activities of the Awami League (AL), the party of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. The decision follows protests demanding the party's ban and an investigation into its role in last year's deadly unrest. While the AL has not been fully outlawed, the move is intended to safeguard national security and protect those involved in the tribunal. Critics argue that the ban will further polarize the political landscape and hinder opportunities for intra-party reforms.</p>
