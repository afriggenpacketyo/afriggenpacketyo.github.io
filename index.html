          <p>President Trump announced the doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, increasing them from 25% to 50%, in an effort to counter foreign countries offloading low-priced metals in the US. The executive order, effective immediately, aims to eliminate the national security threat posed by these imports, though it excludes the United Kingdom due to a recent trade agreement. Key trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and the EU are anticipating potential economic repercussions, with EU officials considering retaliatory measures. Since Trump took office, steel prices have reportedly risen by 16%, according to the government's Producer Price Index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a significant drop following the announcement of a $33 billion deal by Toyota Group to take the company private. The deal comes amidst increasing pressure on Japanese firms to unwind cross-shareholding ties, with Japan's Financial Services Agency advocating for a reduction in these arrangements. The deal includes a tender offer of $26 billion for shares of Toyota Industries at 16,300 yen apiece, lower than the previous closing price. Analysts suggest the offer is unattractive, noting the offer price was below the midpoint of the valuation range given by independent financial advisers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew less than expected in the first quarter of 2025, with a year-on-year growth of 1.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter and below the estimated 1.5%. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the economy expanded by 0.2%, also falling short of expectations. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to shrinking public spending, weakened consumer demand, and reduced exports. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) expects domestic GDP growth to pick up in 2025, driven by a recovery in consumption and continued strength in public demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The idea that China has stolen millions of American jobs, causing a collapse in manufacturing, has been a common anti-China narrative in US politics. However, some economists argue that cheap Chinese goods have made life more affordable for the average American. The research defending the "China shock" claim is a series of papers by David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson. The debate centers on whether the benefits of cheaper goods outweigh the alleged job losses in the manufacturing sector.</p>
