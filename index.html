        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a significant 44% drop in second-quarter net income, falling to $2.49 billion. The decline was primarily attributed to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the profit dip, the company's adjusted earnings per share and revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations. Chevron anticipates the Hess deal will start contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter and is targeting $1 billion in cost reductions by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil announced a 23% decrease in second-quarter net income to $7.1 billion, a result softened by the impact of lower oil prices.

          <p>Moderna has adjusted its full-year 2025 revenue forecast, lowering the upper end of its guidance due to a delay in COVID-19 vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom. Despite this, the biotech firm reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, with a smaller-than-anticipated loss and higher-than-expected revenue. The company attributes the better-than-expected performance to significant cost-cutting measures, including a 27% reduction in operating expenses compared to the previous year, as it navigates declining vaccine sales.

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a sweeping new tariff plan, issuing an executive order that imposes duties on nearly 70 countries. The tariffs, which range from 10% to 41%, are described by an administration official as the start of a "new system of trade" and are set to take effect within a week. The rates are largely based on trade deficits, with countries like Laos and Myanmar facing the highest levies. This move follows previous delays and negotiations, with the administration having recently secured trade agreements with several key partners to lower their respective rates.</p>

          <p>New York Mets shortstop Francisco Lindor has voiced his opinion that his teammate, star slugger Juan Soto, was a significant snub for this year's MLB All-Star game. Lindor stated that Soto "deserved it" and "definitely should have been there," highlighting his status as one of the league's best hitters despite a slow start to the season. While four other Mets players were selected for the event, Lindor believes Soto's impressive statistics, including 25 home runs and 62 RBIs, warranted his inclusion in the midsummer classic.</p>

          <p>A recent poll from Morning Consult reveals that a majority of Americans are blaming the Trump administration and corporate interests for their financial struggles. Six in ten respondents attribute the rising cost of living to the administration, with similar numbers citing a negative impact on grocery prices and their personal finances. The survey highlights widespread economic anxiety, with over 80% concerned about grocery costs and nearly half believing they would struggle to afford an unexpected $500 bill. Many also fear a looming recession and believe billionaires and corporations have made life harder for average people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new peer-reviewed study suggests that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in Southern California in January 2024 was likely caused by exposure to pesticides. Researchers found hundreds of dead or dying butterflies near a wintering site, exhibiting symptoms of neurotoxic poisoning. Subsequent testing of the insects revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each, including high levels of pyrethroids, a common residential and agricultural pesticide. These findings provide rare, real-world evidence supporting the theory that pesticides are a significant factor in the monarch population's dramatic decline.</p>

For example, a "preferred" aisle or window seat on a February flight from Denver to Orlando could cost an additional $46 each way.

          <p>Recent polling data indicates a complex and evolving political landscape among Gen Z voters in the United States.

Research from Pew shows that the 18-to-29 age group is more evenly split between the two parties than in previous years, with a large segment identifying as independent. This suggests that the rightward shift seen in 2024 has some durability, but also that these young voters feel unmoored from traditional party structures, making them an unpredictable and up-for-grabs demographic.</p>

India has become the largest buyer of Russian seaborne crude, and a disruption to this trade could prompt Russia to respond by shutting down the CPC pipeline, which transports oil from Kazakhstan for Western majors like Chevron and Exxon. Such a move would disrupt global supply and cause a sharp spike in oil prices. This geopolitical maneuvering highlights the complex economic interdependencies and the potential for a new global energy crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman whose 79-year-old mother died in a car crash in Cornwall is advocating for an overhaul of the licensing rules for older drivers in the UK. She believes the current system, which relies on self-declaration of medical conditions and a simple license renewal every three years after age 70, is inadequate and unsafe. Statistics show that while older drivers are a minority, they are overrepresented in road fatalities, and a recent report indicates significant underreporting of medical conditions that could affect driving ability. The debate highlights the tension between maintaining independence for the elderly and ensuring public road safety.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Democratic Party's political standing reveals a complex picture despite historically low approval ratings. While polls show widespread disapproval, this is partly driven by disaffected but loyal Democratic voters, a common trend for a party after an election loss. The party may also benefit from President Trump's own declining popularity and the potential economic impact of his tariffs. However, there are significant causes for concern, as Democrats are in a weaker position regarding party identification than they were in 2017, and face a very challenging path to regaining a majority in the Senate due to the electoral map.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Hong Kong has frozen an HSBC account containing US$1.8 billion, which is central to a legal battle over the inheritance of the late founder of beverage giant Wahaha Group. The lawsuit was filed by three previously unknown extramarital children of the founder against their half-sister, Kelly Zong Fuli, who is the current CEO. The plaintiffs claim a breach of a family agreement to establish trusts for them following their father's death. The court's order will remain in effect pending the outcome of a parallel lawsuit in mainland China, adding a complex chapter to the succession of "China's Coca-Cola."</p>

Dalio, who founded the firm in 1975, will continue to serve as a mentor and remain a significant investor in Bridgewater's funds.

          <p>Having an emergency savings fund acts as a crucial "security blanket" that helps protect long-term retirement savings, according to new research from Vanguard. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out loans or make hardship withdrawals from their retirement accounts. This is especially important for hourly workers, whose volatile incomes often lead them to tap retirement funds for unexpected expenses. Experts recommend automating savings into a liquid, high-yield account to build this buffer and prevent "leakage" from retirement plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The effects of climate change are profoundly altering high-altitude environments, making mountaineering increasingly dangerous. Rising temperatures are melting the snow and ice that act as a "glue" holding rock faces together, leading to a significant increase in rockfalls and wet snow avalanches in ranges like the Karakoram and Himalayas. This forces expeditions to change their schedules, climbing earlier in the season or at night to avoid the most hazardous conditions. The changing landscape not only poses a threat to climbers but also to the local economies in Nepal and Pakistan that depend heavily on mountain tourism.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is forecast to bring strong winds and heavy rain across the country on Monday. It is the fifth named storm of the season and is expected to bring disruptive winds, with gusts potentially reaching 60 to 80 mph in coastal and hilly areas in the north. The storm system is currently developing in the Atlantic and its exact track will determine the most severely affected regions. Due to trees being in full leaf, there is an increased risk of falling branches and potential for travel disruption and power outages.</p>

The policy, driven by Labour minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupation when they were 14. Successful interns will also be fast-tracked for the main graduate Fast Stream program, a move welcomed by social mobility advocates but criticized by some Conservatives as "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>An article reflects on the pervasive surveillance methods of the Stasi, East Germany's infamous state security service, which operated until the fall of the Berlin Wall. Under the motto "we must know everything," the Stasi employed around 90,000 official staff and up to 200,000 informal collaborators to spy on citizens, viewing any form of dissent as a threat. Their tactics included reading mail, wiretapping phones, and psychological intimidation to maintain the Socialist Unity Party's power. A new book by historian Philipp Springer uses rare photos to show the mundane reality of the Stasi's work, emphasizing that these ordinary employees were all cogs in an oppressive authoritarian machine.</p>
