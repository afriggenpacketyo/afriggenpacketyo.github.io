          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial for an alleged coup plot. The decision, issued by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, came after Bolsonaro allegedly violated previous precautionary measures by communicating with supporters through his sons' social media. This development occurs amidst heightened political tensions, including US criticism of the judicial proceedings and sanctions against the presiding justice, creating a complex domestic and international political situation for Brazil.</p>

          <p>Storm Floris has caused significant travel disruption and power cuts across the United Kingdom, with Scotland being particularly affected. Gusts of up to 90mph led to about 50,000 homes losing power, and Network Rail reported over 100 incidents on train lines. The storm, described as the "most damaging summer storm in recent memory" by the electricity network, also forced the cancellation of flights and major events like the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. Clean-up efforts are underway, but authorities warn that disruptions will likely continue.</p>

          <p>The St. Louis Cardinals secured a 3-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers after a tense pitching duel between Sonny Gray and Tyler Glasnow. Both starting pitchers delivered seven strong innings, allowing only one run each before turning the game over to their bullpens. The lead changed hands in the eighth inning before a go-ahead, two-out single by the Cardinals' Yohel Pozo in the ninth inning proved to be the decisive play. The Dodgers' late rally fell short, wasting a solid performance from Glasnow.</p>

          <p>The United States is launching a 12-month pilot program that will require some travelers to pay bonds of up to $15,000 to enter the country. The policy targets visitors with B-1 or B-2 visas from nations with high rates of visa overstays or those deemed to have insufficient security screening. The State Department expects about 2,000 people to be affected, with bond amounts set at $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 based on individual circumstances. This move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to tighten immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's 'Operation Storm,' which effectively ended its war of independence, the event is remembered with starkly different narratives in Croatia and Serbia. Croatians celebrate it as a heroic victory that recaptured occupied territory and led to the war's end, holding a large military parade to commemorate the day. Conversely, Serbians view it as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass expulsion of approximately 200,000 Serbs and numerous war crimes. This deep-seated division highlights the lasting and unresolved ethnic tensions stemming from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.</p>

A major political row has also developed after Reform UK's Nigel Farage accused police of a "cover-up" regarding the immigration status of men in a child sexual assault case, prompting calls for more transparency. Additionally, the Metropolitan Police are warning of potential mass detentions at a planned rally for the banned group Palestine Action, while a new report highlights how wealthy parents avoided a new VAT on private school fees by paying in advance.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of fatally shooting four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. Authorities consider Brown armed and dangerous, believing he fled the scene and may have stolen a vehicle containing camping gear. The small, tight-knit community is in mourning as investigators believe the suspect knew the victims and was a regular at the bar, with the motive still unclear. Family members of the suspect indicated he has struggled with mental illness and PTSD for years.</p>

          <p>Ranchers in Sonora, Mexico, are facing severe economic strain following the United States' suspension of live cattle imports due to concerns over the New World Screwworm parasite. This ban, the third in eight months, has crippled a $1.2 billion export business already weakened by years of severe drought. In response, Mexican ranchers are being forced to sell their cattle domestically at significantly lower prices and diversify into other ventures like beekeeping. The situation poses a threat to the multi-generational ranching industry in northern Mexico as they struggle to adapt to the sudden market closure.</p>

A coalition of nearly 100 countries supports production limits, while oil-producing nations resist. The talks also aim to establish universal design standards and ban harmful chemicals, as the environmental and health impacts of plastic waste continue to grow.</p>

          <p>Less than two years after a liberal coalition ousted the populist Law and Justice party, Poland is showing signs of shifting back towards right-wing populism. The article argues that the new government, led by Donald Tusk, has struggled to dismantle its predecessors' legacy and has failed to present an inspiring future vision, instead often adopting nationalist rhetoric. This trend, seen in other post-populist governments in countries like the U.S. and Brazil, highlights the difficulty of restoring liberal democracy and suggests that without a compelling agenda, such victories may be short-lived.</p>

While some Western militaries have moved away from this type of aircraft, considering them vulnerable in modern warfare, Beijing's development of the KJ-3000 indicates a continued commitment to this strategy.

          <p>Tarantula mating season, which runs from August to December, is leading to increased sightings of the spiders across California as males leave their burrows in search of mates. Experts note that the two most common species in Southern California can be spotted in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas, particularly at dusk. While tarantulas are generally harmless and reluctant to bite unless provoked, they can flick irritant hairs from their bodies if they feel threatened. Officials advise the public to observe the slow-moving arachnids from a distance and avoid disturbing them during their seasonal quest for a partner.</p>

          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the United States is straining emergency services and could force more towns to switch to costly paid departments. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews and save taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. However, their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as the dwindling number of volunteers poses a significant risk to the safety of many smaller communities.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump called the ad the "HOTTEST" out there and lauded Sweeney, whom he described as a registered Republican. The campaign had previously faced backlash from some critics who interpreted its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" as promoting eugenics, a claim the company denies. The president's endorsement turned the controversy into a significant financial gain for the retailer, which had recently faced market challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) indicates that Taiwan's energy reserves would be quickly depleted in the event of a military blockade by China. War-gaming scenarios suggest the island's natural gas would last only 11 days, coal for seven weeks, and oil for 20 weeks. However, the report also concludes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. This analysis highlights Taiwan's critical strategic vulnerabilities while also underscoring the immense risks of such a military action.</p>

Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its tracing process, which can be difficult for those who were gifted bonds or only possess old paper records. NS&I stated it has successfully paid over 99% of winners since 1957 but acknowledges that older, non-digitized bonds are harder to trace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California wildlife officials are issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. Laboratory tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide, which the pigs likely consumed directly or by eating other poisoned animals. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is urging pesticide users to apply baits in ways that are inaccessible to non-target wildlife. They also caution hunters to avoid consuming any game animal with discolored tissue and to report such findings to the state's wildlife health lab.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that increased screening for colorectal cancer among people aged 45 to 49 is leading to a higher number of early-stage diagnoses. This follows recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, which has resulted in a 62% increase in screenings for this age group between 2019 and 2023. While researchers call the findings promising news for early detection, they caution that screening rates for this demographic remain suboptimal and inequitable.
