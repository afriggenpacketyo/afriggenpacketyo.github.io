          <p>Palo Alto Networks is set to acquire Israeli identity security provider CyberArk in a deal valued at approximately $25 billion, paying $45 per share, representing a 26% premium to its previous closing price. Palo Alto's CEO, Nikesh Arora, emphasized that this acquisition aligns with their strategic vision to enter the identity security market at its inflection point, aiming for significant growth opportunities. This substantial merger highlights a key consolidation trend within the competitive cybersecurity sector, as companies seek to broaden their capabilities. While Palo Alto's shares experienced a decline following the announcement, the move is expected to bolster its market leadership and expand its comprehensive security offerings in the long term.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major American companies, including Stanley Black & Decker, Conagra Brands, Tesla, General Motors, and Procter & Gamble, are issuing warnings about hundreds of millions of dollars in increased costs due to impending tariffs. These businesses are preparing for significant financial impacts, with some already implementing price increases or adjusting their global sourcing strategies to mitigate the levies. While U.S. consumers have not yet experienced meaningful inflation, many economists caution that companies may soon pass these rising costs onto shoppers after the upcoming trade talk deadline. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that countries facing high tariff rates can potentially lower them through good-faith negotiations with the U.S. government. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Adidas fell sharply after the German sportswear giant warned of a double-digit million euro impact from U.S. tariffs in the second quarter, anticipating up to 200 million euros in added costs for the second half of the year. While the company has not yet implemented price hikes, it has reallocated its sourcing mix and plans a pricing review once final U.S. tariff rates are confirmed, likely affecting new products first. Adidas maintained its full-year guidance but acknowledged elevated uncertainty from tariffs and broader macroeconomic risks, expressing concern that widespread tariffs could trigger major inflation and affect consumer demand.

          <p>San Francisco Giants outfielder Heliot Ramos committed a significant baserunning blunder during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, which resulted in a crucial double play. Despite the home plate umpire calling an infield fly rule, Ramos was caught trailing too far off second base when the ball was intentionally dropped by the Pirates' third baseman. After the game, Ramos publicly acknowledged the mistake as a "mental error," expressing his frustration and commitment to improving his overall game, including his defense. This miscue contributed to the Giants' 3-1 loss, where they struggled offensively, managing only two hits.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the August 1st deadline for his "reciprocal" tariffs will not be extended, declaring it "A BIG DAY FOR AMERICA!!!" This firm stance follows previous instances where Trump had delayed similar tariff deadlines despite initial assertions, creating market uncertainty. The new import tax rates, some as high as 50% for countries like Brazil, are intended to provide leverage in trade negotiations and generate revenue for the U.S. economy. However, the costs of these tariffs are typically borne by importers, and some nations, including Japan and the European Union, have already secured lower rates through preliminary agreements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a much better-than-expected 3% annual rate in the second quarter, reversing a prior contraction and surpassing forecasts.

Despite the ongoing impact of President Trump's April 2nd "liberation day" tariff announcement, the economic activity showed strength across key areas.

          <p>U.S. medical groups are stepping in to issue their own evidence-based vaccine recommendations, filling a void left by recent changes in official guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the CDC. This initiative, driven by concerns over the politicization of science and an "information crisis," aims to provide clear recommendations for Covid, flu, and RSV vaccinations, especially for vulnerable populations like pregnant people and children. Organizations like the Vaccine Integrity Project are reviewing scientific studies to support these independent guidelines, hoping to restore public trust and ensure continued vaccine coverage.</p>

          <h2>Robert Reich Argues for Silencing of American Media Under Current Administration</h2>

          <p>Robert Reich's opinion article argues that American media is being silenced due to fear of retribution from the Trump administration, citing examples like a Washington Post columnist's departure and Stephen Colbert's show cancellation. Reich contends that powerful corporate owners, including Jeff Bezos and Paramount, are compromising journalistic independence and critical commentary to protect their business interests and gain Trump's goodwill. He warns that such actions, along with similar pressures on universities, undermine democracy by suppressing criticism of the president. Reich stresses the vital role of independent media and academia in informing the public about potential governmental dangers.</p>

          <p>The article explains the recent "meme stock" phenomenon, where shares of companies like Kohl's, GoPro, and Krispy Kreme experience volatile price swings largely unrelated to their underlying fundamentals. These stocks are typically cheap, widely recognized, and often heavily shorted by investors betting on a price decline. The frenzy occurs when large groups of traders, often coordinating on online forums like Reddit, rally to drive the share price up. This collective buying can trigger a "short squeeze," forcing short-sellers to buy back shares to minimize losses, further inflating prices and creating rapid fluctuations.

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific, leading to evacuation orders for millions in Japan, Russia, and Hawaii. Videos emerged showing large waves surging past buildings in a Russian port and damaging a power grid, though most warnings have since been downgraded as initial waves were smaller than first feared. Experts continue to model the impact, noting that the extent of damage depends on the path of energy radiating from the epicenter. This earthquake is tied for the sixth most severe in recorded history, but its impact is less devastating due to its location in a sparsely populated area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume in the U.S. has fallen to its lowest level since May, declining 3.8% last week, despite stable interest rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association attributes this drop primarily to consumer uncertainty about the economy and job market, which is deterring major financial decisions like home purchases. Both purchase and refinance activity decreased, even with slowing home-price growth and increased inventory in many regions. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage remained near 6.83%, with potential for further shifts following upcoming Federal Reserve announcements and government employment reports.

The agreement reportedly includes EU commitments to purchase strategic commodities like gas, oil, nuclear fuel, and AI chips, as well as military equipment from the U.S. This reflects Europe's continued reliance on American support and its efforts to counter China's influence.</p>

          <p>UK housebuilder Taylor Wimpey reported a first-half loss due to higher-than-expected costs for removing combustible cladding from its buildings, a direct response to the Grenfell fire tragedy. The company set aside an additional £222 million, bringing its total cladding remediation provision to £435 million, citing unforeseen defects and increased construction expenses. This financial setback, coupled with a slowdown in sales as first-time buyers struggle with high interest rates, raises concerns for other housebuilders with similar building styles. The firm's sales rate for July also declined compared to last year. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the R&A citing logistical issues for not selecting Turnberry recently, Eric Trump dismissed politics as the "elephant in the room" and insisted the course is impeccable and ready. He expects his father to be out of office before Turnberry might next host, returning to a strictly commercial focus.</p>
