          <p>The Russian Defense Ministry stated that Ukraine launched drone attacks targeting airfields in five regions, resulting in several aircraft catching fire, particularly in the Murmansk and Irkutsk regions. Russia claims to have repelled most of these attacks. Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency has taken responsibility, estimating the damage to Russian strategic aviation at $7 billion, reportedly destroying over 40 planes, including Tu-95 and Tu-22M strategic bombers and A-50 surveillance aircraft. This attack occurred as Ukraine planned to send a delegation to Istanbul for peace negotiations, amidst ongoing reports of Russian drone and missile attacks that killed a dozen Ukrainian soldiers. The situation remains tense as both sides continue military actions. Optimism regarding the situation remains low due to the ongoing conflict and casualties.</p>

          <p>Wesleyan University President Michael Roth, in an interview, expressed concern over increasing scrutiny of Chinese students and intimidation tactics aimed at universities. Roth believes these actions are designed to instill fear and enforce conformity to the current administration's ideologies, which he argues undermines academic freedom and the open exchange of ideas. He acknowledged legitimate criticisms of higher education, such as a lack of intellectual diversity, but emphasized that improvements should come through internal reforms rather than external pressure. Roth also addressed protests related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, distinguishing between legitimate criticism and antisemitism, while defending the importance of free speech on campus. The discussion highlights the challenges universities face in maintaining academic independence amidst political pressures.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain celebrated their Champions League victory with an open-top bus parade in Paris, following widespread disorder across France that resulted in two deaths and numerous injuries. The Ligue 1 club defeated Inter Milan 5-0 to secure their first Champions League title, leading to celebrations marred by violence, including stabbings, traffic incidents, and clashes with police. Despite the unrest, authorities proceeded with the victory parade, attended by a capped 100,000 people, and the players were later greeted by French President Emmanuel Macron. PSG condemned the violence, emphasizing that such acts do not represent the values of the club or the behavior of the majority of their supporters.

          <p>An attack near a food aid distribution center in Gaza resulted in the deaths of over 30 people and injuries to many more, according to Gaza health officials, though the Israeli military denies involvement. Witnesses reported fire from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones, while the U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) claims it delivered aid without incident. The incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas falter, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress. The U.N. and major aid groups have criticized the new aid system, citing Israeli restrictions and security concerns that hinder aid delivery to the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly focusing on short-term Treasury bonds, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy of investing in T-bills, with Berkshire Hathaway owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs in investor flows this year, attracting over $25 billion in assets. This trend reflects a preference for stable yields and less volatility in the short and middle segments of the fixed-income market. The 3-month T-Bill currently offers an annualized yield above 4.3%, making it an attractive option for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>White House budget director Russ Vought dismissed concerns that cuts to benefits in the spending bill passed by the House would lead to premature deaths as “totally ridiculous.” The bill proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), affecting millions of Americans. Vought defended the bill, asserting it would preserve and protect programs while making them more commonsense. Critics, including advocacy groups and medical associations, warn that the cuts will cause hardship and increase mortality, while Democrats condemn the administration's gaslighting and predict the bill will fail in the Senate. The debate highlights the starkly different views on the impact of the proposed budget changes.</p>

Breuer highlighted the Suwalki Gap as a vulnerable area and noted differing perspectives among European states regarding the threat. He also pointed to recent attacks on undersea cables and cyber attacks as indicators of Russia's intent to test NATO's defense lines, signaling a significant shift in Germany's attitude towards defense and Russia.</p>

The Ministry of Justice stated that some prison officers will trial Tasers this summer, but giving them lethal weapons would put them at greater risk.
