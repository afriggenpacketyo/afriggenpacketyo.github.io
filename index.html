          <p>France's government has collapsed after Prime Minister François Bayrou was ousted in a parliamentary no-confidence vote, creating a significant crisis for President Emmanuel Macron. Bayrou's gamble to seek support for deeply unpopular public spending cuts backfired, as opposition parties from the far-left and far-right united against him. This political turmoil forces Macron to find a fourth prime minister in the last twelve months, further complicating efforts to address France's substantial national debt and other pressing domestic issues amid a fragmented legislature.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals that rising temperatures are correlated with increased consumption of products with added sugar among Americans. Researchers analyzed household food purchase data and found that as temperatures rose, so did the intake of sugary items, particularly sweetened beverages and frozen desserts. The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups, potentially due to differences in work environments and health awareness, highlighting a public health concern as climate change continues to drive temperatures higher.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and interest rates at multi-decade highs, many Americans are struggling with significant financial burdens. This article outlines three personalized approaches to tackle overwhelming debt, moving beyond generic advice. These strategies include consulting with a credit counselor for a comprehensive financial plan, working with a debt relief expert to negotiate lower balances directly with creditors, and proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or temporary rate reductions.

          <p>A strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has caused severe disruptions across the London Underground network, forcing commuters to rely on buses, bikes, and other alternative transport. The industrial action, centered on disputes over pay and a demand for a 32-hour work week, has been deemed unaffordable by Transport for London (TfL). While the union argues that a shorter week is fair given TfL's budget surplus, officials and some commuters have expressed frustration over the repeated disruptions to the city's transport system.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Blocking of Foreign Aid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has made an emergency request to the Supreme Court to allow it to block billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The administration argues that a lower court's order forcing it to spend the funds poses a "grave and urgent threat" to presidential authority in foreign affairs. This legal battle is a major test of the executive branch's power over public funds, as aid groups warn that withholding the money could have lethal consequences for life-saving global health programs.</p>

          <p>The collapse of the French government has heightened concerns about the country's massive public debt, sparking fears of a potential new eurozone debt crisis. With sovereign debt at 113% of GDP and the largest budget deficit in the EU, France's political paralysis makes necessary fiscal reforms seem unattainable. Economists warn that while a short-term crisis is not imminent, continued instability in the eurozone's second-largest economy could threaten the stability of the single currency, especially if financial markets lose confidence and the European Central Bank is pressured to intervene.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee are demanding that Federal Reserve nominee Stephen Miran resign from his position as a White House economic adviser before his confirmation proceeds. They argue that holding both roles simultaneously creates an unacceptable conflict of interest and undermines the central bank's independence. Miran has stated he would take an unpaid leave from the White House, but the senators contend this is insufficient and potentially inconsistent with the Federal Reserve Act, which requires governors to devote their "entire time" to board business.</p>

          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts advise that potential homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, which directly impacts the interest rate lenders will offer. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can lead to a lower rate and avoid the need for private mortgage insurance, resulting in significant long-term savings.
