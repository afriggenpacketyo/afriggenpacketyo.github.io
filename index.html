          <p>A cave explorer in southwest China discovered a unique karst cave dating back 480 million years, containing pristine sediment formations never before seen in real life. The explorer, Zhao Jieyu, kept the discovery quiet to protect the cave, but it has since drawn attention from state media and online influencers. Zhao and geologist Zhang Yuanhai warn that the cave's delicate formations are now under threat from visitors trampling on them and taking away crystals. The cave's features include crystal flowers, luminescent "cave pearls," and cone-shaped formations sculpted by mineral-rich water.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi, alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, convened a task force to investigate alleged anti-Christian bias during the Biden administration. The meeting occurred amidst scrutiny of Hegseth's communications, including potentially sensitive information shared via Signal chats. Bondi defended the Justice Department's investigations into events during the Biden administration, citing prosecutions of anti-abortion protesters and concerns about an FBI memo regarding "radical traditionalist" Catholics. The DOJ is focusing on cases that conservatives argue demonstrate anti-Christian bias by senior law enforcement officials. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>The UK government aims to eliminate the driving test backlog by next summer, providing an additional 10,000 tests per month. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander acknowledged that current waiting times are unacceptable and plans to reduce them to seven weeks by summer 2026, missing the original target by eight months. Plans to double training capacity and incentivize qualified examiners to return to the frontline are underway to tackle the delays. The government will also consult on changes to the test booking system, after a record 1.95 million tests were booked last year.</p>

          <p>The FDA is requesting the food industry to voluntarily replace synthetic food dyes with natural alternatives, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals. This move stops short of an outright ban, instead relying on industry cooperation with a "national standard and timeline." FDA Commissioner Marty Makary claims the food industry is eager to remove artificial dyes, citing concerns about potential behavioral changes in children and links to health conditions. The International Association of Color Manufacturers disputes safety concerns, while some industry groups have made voluntary pledges to reduce artificial colors in certain products.</p>

This warning, the second from the Trump administration in a week, comes despite President Trump's earlier promises to quickly end the war. Vance proposed freezing territorial lines, requiring both sides to concede territory, while envoys from the U.S., Ukraine, and Europe met in the U.K. to discuss a ceasefire. The White House had previously welcomed a temporary halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, but the Kremlin considers that agreement expired.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups are suing the Trump administration, alleging their free-speech rights were violated when funding for climate and environmental justice projects was frozen or canceled. The lawsuit claims the administration targeted them over language in grant documents, including terms like "equity" and "socioeconomic," and attempted to force them to use different language. The EPA denies commenting on pending litigation, stating they are "reviewing its grant funding to ensure it is appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with Administration priorities."

          <p>Charlotte Beradt's "The Third Reich of Dreams" explores the dreams of people living under Nazi rule, revealing the psychological impact of authoritarianism. Beradt argues that these dreams reflect attempts by the subconscious mind to make sense of a reality filled with propaganda and fear, exposing a desire to conform to the regime. While some dreams depict collaboration with Hitler, others reveal resistance and rebellion against Nazi oppression. The book highlights how authoritarianism can hijack people's brains and affect their deepest thoughts and emotions.</p>

          <p>Two new documentaries, "Kiss the Ground" and "Common Ground," promote regenerative agriculture as a solution to climate change and other problems in the food system. Regenerative agriculture focuses on improving soil health by reducing synthetic chemicals, eliminating tillage, planting cover crops, and using rotational grazing. While these practices offer ecological benefits, the documentaries oversimplify the complex tradeoffs of agricultural production and make scientifically dubious claims, such as the idea that regenerative agriculture can sequester all of humanity's carbon emissions. Critics argue that reducing meat and dairy production is a more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.</p>

Meta was fined €200 million for its "consent or pay" system, which forced EU users to pay for an ad-free subscription or share their data. The Commission also closed its investigation into another Apple matter around app choices, as Apple changed its browser choice screen and made it easier for users to change default settings.</p>

          <p>France scrum-half Nolann le Garrec apologized for diving during a recent match while playing for Racing 92. He suggested the situation in the match contributed to his reaction, as Racing was trailing and had just had a player sent off. Le Garrec is not the first player to be accused of play-acting this season, with other coaches and players making similar accusations. Rugby's laws expressly forbid players from doing anything that may lead match officials to believe an opponent committed an infringement, or acting contrary to the spirit of good sportsmanship.</p>

Component tests for the crewed lunar mission include thermal evaluations of the Lanyue lunar lander. The agency is set to conduct the first comprehensive assessments of mission components.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The anti-abortion movement is increasingly embracing fetal personhood, with lawmakers in several states introducing legislation that would treat fetuses as people and potentially charge women who have abortions with homicide. Mary Ziegler argues that the anti-abortion movement has always been a fetal-personhood movement and is now more emboldened. While state-level bans on abortion still do not technically punish abortion patients, self-described "abortion abolitionists" are gaining influence, advocating for women to be punished as murderers. This shift is occurring despite the unpopularity of such measures and reflects a focus on influencing judges rather than voters.</p>

          <p>An advertising watchdog, the National Advertising Division, criticized Apple for marketing Apple Intelligence features that were not yet released when the ads were broadcast. Apple has agreed to discontinue a TV ad called "More Personal Siri" that focused on a big AI improvement to Siri. The ad premiered in September and promoted the iPhone 16 with unreleased features, which Apple later delayed. The watchdog recommended that Apple avoid conveying the message that features are available when they are not. Apple is also facing class-action lawsuits over those Apple Intelligence ads.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the limitations of the judiciary's power to enforce its rulings, particularly when the executive branch is resistant. While courts have coercive powers, their effectiveness depends on democratic cultural norms and public opinion. The Trump administration's defiance of court orders in deportation cases raises questions about the constitutional order. The article emphasizes the importance of public opinion, clear directives from the courts, and the political branches in ensuring compliance with court judgments. Ultimately, liberty relies on the hearts of men and women, and the shared commitment to self-government.</p>

Goldman Sachs projects the price will continue to increase, potentially reaching $3,700 by the end of 2025, driven by central bank purchases. This trend mirrors past economic crises where gold has been seen as a reliable store of value.</p>

The shrine is a controversial symbol of Japan's past militarism, and visits by Japanese leaders have drawn criticism from China and South Korea.
