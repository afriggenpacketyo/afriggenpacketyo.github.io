          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff of California for mortgage fraud, according to MSNBC. This development comes despite President Donald Trump's repeated calls for criminal charges against Schiff, a prominent critic. While Hayes found the case weak, a controversial senior DOJ official is reportedly pressing to keep the investigation active. Senator Schiff's lawyer condemned the "politically-motivated allegations" as baseless and urged the Justice Department to close the matter.</p>
