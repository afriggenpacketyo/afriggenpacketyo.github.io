        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has blacklisted Canadian semiconductor research firm TechInsights, designating it an "unreliable entity" and prohibiting Chinese individuals or organizations from sharing information. This move follows TechInsights' report revealing that Huawei's latest AI chips contained components sourced from outside mainland China, which are subject to U.S. export controls. The ban intensifies concerns about the transparency of China's chip industry and the effectiveness of U.S. restrictions, as Beijing pushes for a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain. This action highlights escalating tensions in the global tech sector and Beijing's assertive stance against foreign scrutiny, potentially impacting global technology flows.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and false statements related to a 2020 mortgage. The indictment, presented by a prosecutor appointed by President Trump, alleges James lied about using a Norfolk home as a secondary residence, instead renting it out. James, a prominent antagonist of Trump, claims the charges are "baseless" and a "weaponization of our justice system" driven by political retribution. The case has drawn criticism from Democratic leaders, who view it as an attack on the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered on a Dutch beach in 2004 has been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, 21 years after her death. Her identification resulted from a crucial tip-off following the international police campaign "Operation Identify Me," which uses Interpol's "black notices" to seek public assistance for unidentified bodies. Pommer, known as "the woman with the German keys," was found in unusual attire for a beach walk, and the cause of death remains unexplained as investigations continue. This marks the fourth successful identification through the initiative, offering closure to another family.</p>

          <p>The White House has asserted a "more than 1,000%" increase in assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, a claim not supported by public evidence. An analysis of court records indicates approximately a 25% rise in charges for assault against federal officers, far less dramatic than the government's figures. Despite serious incidents involving ICE agents, the Department of Homeland Security has not provided data to justify its exaggerated statistics.

          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have achieved a breakthrough, discovering that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity when bent. This innovative phenomenon, attributed to flexoelectricity, allows saline ice to produce an electrical response comparable to high-performance ceramic materials used for their electrical properties. The research, which also involved Stony Brook University, opens new possibilities for low-cost energy generation in cold environments. This significant finding suggests a potential pathway for harnessing clean power from readily available resources, offering a novel approach to sustainable energy solutions globally.</p>

Her vision includes reviving Abenomics with a protectionist twist, emphasizing state-led industrial revival and strategic investment in defense and technology. This approach aims to reduce reliance on China and bolster Japan's security autonomy, potentially reshaping its domestic economy, foreign policy, and regional engagement, with mixed implications for Asian partners.</p>

          <p>Battlefield 6, the latest installment in the military shooter series, is generating significant buzz and is seen as a major gamble for publisher Electronic Arts (EA). Developed by four studios, the game aims to surpass its predecessor, Battlefield 2042, by incorporating early fan feedback and restoring a single-player campaign. Despite concerns over the project's scale and EA's recent acquisition by a Saudi-led group, developers are confident in its potential, with analysts predicting strong initial sales. The team is also exploring generative AI for preparatory stages, aiming to enhance creativity without directly using AI-generated content in the final game.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills designed to strengthen California's FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort, which faced significant losses from recent wildfires. The legislation enables the plan to issue bonds for catastrophic claims and secure lines of credit, addressing its financial woes. It also increases legislative oversight by adding nonvoting members from the Assembly and Senate to the plan's governing committee, enhancing transparency. These reforms aim to stabilize California's insurance market and improve its resilience against climate-fueled disasters.</p>

          <p>UK universities have announced over 12,000 job cuts in the past year, with additional cost savings equivalent to 3,000 more positions, according to analysis by the University and College Union (UCU). This comes as four in ten English universities face financial deficits, leading to difficult decisions like redundancies and restructures. The UCU plans a strike vote over a 1.4% pay offer, arguing staff are "demoralised, exhausted and furious," and students are also impacted. The government cites increased tuition fees and upcoming reforms as its response to the sector's challenges.</p>

          <p>Libby Adame, known as "the butt lady," has been convicted of second-degree murder after a second client, actress Cindyana Santangelo, died from illegal silicone injections she administered. Adame was previously convicted of involuntary manslaughter for a similar death in 2019 but continued performing unauthorized procedures. Prosecutors argued she was aware of the dangers, having been warned after her prior conviction. Adame's lawyer claimed she was a consultant for legal procedures in Mexico, not practicing in California, but the jury was not swayed. She faces a significantly longer sentence, highlighting the severe risks of unapproved cosmetic procedures.</p>

          <p>Human heart-monitoring devices are being repurposed to help biologists understand and conserve threatened animal species. At the Smithsonian's Conservation Biology Institute, tiny heart monitors are implanted under the skin of animals like clouded leopards to record vital data such as body temperature, hydration, and heart rate. This technology, donated by Medtronic and originally designed for humans, provides crucial insights into animals' stress levels and adaptability. The data helps assess which captive animals are best suited for reintroduction into the wild and monitors wild populations facing human encroachment, marking a significant leap in animal care and conservation.</p>

          <p>The war in Ukraine is witnessing a new AI arms race, with both Russian and Ukrainian forces deploying AI-assisted weapons for targeting, intelligence, and de-mining. Ukrainian defense forces consultant Serhiy Beskrestnov discovered an intercepted Russian drone using AI to autonomously find and attack targets without signals, making it unjammable. Ukraine's Deputy Defense Minister Yuriy Myronenko confirms AI's indispensability for processing massive frontline data and identifying targets. While developers are cautious about fully autonomous systems due to risks like friendly fire, the technology is rapidly evolving, prompting calls for global rules on AI in warfare, similar to nuclear non-proliferation.</p>

          <p>A congressional stalemate over reopening the government is jeopardizing Affordable Care Act (ACA) health insurance subsidies, set to expire at the end of 2025, potentially affecting millions of Americans. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies, while Republicans demand a government reopening first. For individuals like Lori Hunt, a breast cancer survivor, losing subsidies means her monthly premium would become unaffordable, risking her health and financial stability. Experts warn that without these tax credits, 3.8 million Americans could lose health insurance by 2035, leading to significant financial debt and increased emergency room visits.</p>

          <p>Robert Roberson, sentenced to death for the 2002 death of his daughter, has been granted a stay of execution by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, just one week before it was scheduled. His defense team argues he is innocent, citing new medical expert testimony suggesting his daughter died from pneumonia exacerbated by medication, not shaken baby syndrome. The ruling orders the trial court to review Roberson's arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, which allows convictions to be overturned if evidence is no longer credible. This case highlights ongoing concerns about wrongful convictions based on disputed medical diagnoses.</p>
