          <p>UK small businesses are facing significant challenges following the United States' decision to eliminate the "de minimis" tax exemption for parcels valued under $800. This policy change means these small shipments are now subject to tariffs, which could add 30-50% to the cost of a typical order. Many British firms, particularly those in specialized sectors like hand-dyed wool and skincare, have paused or completely stopped shipping to the US due to unpredictable costs and logistical complexities. Business organizations warn this creates new barriers for small companies competing in the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least 23 fatalities, including four children, and wounded dozens more. The bombardment destroyed a five-story residential building and caused damage to the nearby European Union delegation office and British Council building. European leaders, including EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, expressed outrage, condemning the attack as a deliberate escalation that undermines peace efforts. The strikes occurred following a US-led diplomatic push to end the war, prompting calls for new sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have developed and successfully tested a new vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone that bears a striking resemblance to the "Gimbal" UFO filmed by US Navy pilots in 2015. The experimental aircraft features a unique closed-loop, elliptical wing design with four rotors, giving it the appearance of a flying spindle. This radical aerodynamic structure is designed to enhance flight endurance, stability, and versatility for uncrewed missions. The development represents a significant departure from conventional drone designs and could signal new advancements in aerospace technology.</p>

          <p>Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka has strongly criticized comments made by Jelena Ostapenko to Taylor Townsend following their US Open match. After her defeat, Ostapenko told Townsend she had "no class" and "no education," remarks Osaka described as "one of the worst things you could say to a black tennis player." Townsend, an African-American player, acknowledged the historical stigma associated with such comments but did not believe they had a racial undertone. Ostapenko has since denied any racist intent in her statement.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England and Wales will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children starting in January. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, combined with the existing MMR jab. Until now, parents seeking the vaccine typically had to pay for it privately. Health officials hope the program will protect children from severe complications of the virus and reduce the economic impact of parents taking time off work to care for sick children, which is estimated to cost £24 million annually.</p>

The meeting occurs amidst ongoing border disputes and deep-seated suspicion, but also under shared economic pressure from U.S. tariffs. While a major breakthrough is unlikely, experts suggest that economic necessities may push the two nations toward reluctant cooperation, particularly as India's manufacturing sector remains reliant on Chinese intermediate goods. The summit could be a crucial test of whether Beijing and New Delhi can find common ground despite their adversarial history.</p>

This policy change means that all global parcel imports are now subject to normal duty rates, a move the Trump administration says will be permanent. The administration argues the change will restrict the flow of illegal drugs like fentanyl and generate up to $10 billion in annual tariff revenue. For a six-month transition period, foreign postal services can opt to pay a flat duty per package, but the move is expected to raise costs and disrupt supply chains for many businesses.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber had a historic night, hitting four home runs in a game against Atlanta. He becomes just the 21st player in Major League Baseball history to achieve this feat and the first Phillies player to do so since Mike Schmidt in 1976. Schwarber's performance included a team-record nine RBIs in the 19-4 victory. The four homers brought his season total to 49, giving him the outright lead in the National League and placing him one behind the major league leader as he continues a dominant offensive season.</p>

          <h2>Thai Prime Minister Faces Constitutional Court Ruling That Could Topple Government</h2>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court is set to rule on the fate of suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, threatening to plunge the country into political paralysis. The case stems from a petition by senators who accused her of poor ethical standards over a leaked phone call with Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen, ahead of a border conflict. If the court removes Paetongtarn from office, as it has with previous prime ministers, it could trigger significant political turmoil. For over two decades, Thai politics has been defined by a power struggle between pro-royalist elites, the military, and the Shinawatra political dynasty.</p>

          <p>Police in Colton, California, have reopened an investigation into the 2010 death of a four-year-old boy, Timothy Thomas, after arresting the leaders of a cult-like religious group. At the time of his death, custody of the boy had been signed over to Darryl and Shelly Martin, leaders of His Way Spirit Led Assemblies. The couple was recently arrested on illegal weapons charges as part of a separate investigation into the suspicious disappearance and possible homicide of a former group member. Police are now reviewing new leads regarding the circumstances surrounding the child's death over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>The turmoil at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has intensified as ousted director Susan Monarez refuses to leave her position, creating a standoff with the White House. Her lawyers claim her firing is legally deficient because only the president can dismiss a Senate-confirmed appointee, and she will not depart unless Donald Trump does so himself. Meanwhile, the White House has named HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O'Neill as acting director. The conflict follows Monarez's resistance to what her lawyers call "unscientific, reckless directives," and has been compounded by the resignation of four other senior CDC leaders.</p>

          <p>The UK government has instructed a contractor, Mitie, to remove several job advertisements for an immigration removal centre near Heathrow Airport. The controversial roles, which drew public criticism, included tutors for floristry and balloon craft, as well as a gym manager, with some positions offering salaries close to £39,000. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp called the spending "indefensible," arguing that the focus should be on deportations. A Home Office minister stated that not all the advertised roles were deemed necessary and ordered their removal from recruitment websites.</p>

          <p>Public health officials have identified large, brown cage-free eggs from Country Eggs LLC in San Bernardino County as the source of a salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 95 people across 14 states. The FDA and CDC investigation traced the outbreak to the company's "sunshine/omega-3 golden yolk" eggs, leading to about 18 hospitalizations. The company has agreed to a recall of the affected products, which were distributed in California and Nevada between June and July. Consumers are advised to discard or return any eggs matching the recall description and to sanitize any surfaces they may have touched.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered a new trial for three former Memphis police officers who were convicted on federal charges related to the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in 2023. The decision was made due to concerns of bias after the original trial judge allegedly made prejudicial comments, suggesting the police department was infiltrated by gang members. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith Jr. were convicted of witness tampering but acquitted of violating Nichols's civil rights by causing his death. The fatal beating sparked nationwide protests against police brutality.</p>
