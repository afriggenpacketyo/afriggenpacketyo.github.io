          <p>Germany is enhancing its security and arms cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a strategic trio known as the "E3." This pivot towards European partners is driven by the ongoing war in Ukraine and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to NATO under President Trump. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, mirroring a long-standing friendship pact with France. The alliance aims to bolster European defense capabilities, with the French and British nuclear deterrents potentially playing a larger role in the continent's security architecture should US support waver in the future.</p>

          <p>The CEO of technology firm Astronomer, Andy Byron, has resigned after a video of him embracing the company's chief people officer at a Coldplay concert went viral. The company announced it accepted his resignation after placing him on administrative leave and launching a formal investigation into the matter. The clip, which showed the pair quickly hiding from the concert's large screen camera, prompted public speculation and a comment from Coldplay's lead singer. In a statement, Astronomer emphasized that its leaders are expected to meet a high standard of conduct and accountability, which was not met in this instance.</p>

          <p>During a remarkable third round at The Open, golfer Rory McIlroy experienced a highly unusual incident on the 11th hole. While hitting a shot from where spectators had been standing, his swing unearthed a second, previously buried golf ball that popped into the air. McIlroy, who expressed his disbelief at the bizarre event, went on to bogey the hole, his only blemish in a round that otherwise saw him surge up the leaderboard. Despite the strange occurrence, he finished the day at 5-under par, positioning himself in contention heading into the final day of the championship at Royal Portrush.</p>

          <p>Reports from Ukraine indicate that individuals with pre-existing and severe mental health conditions are being drafted into the military, raising serious concerns about their safety and the well-being of their units. The article highlights the case of a man with a personality disorder who was deemed fit for service, as his diagnosis was not in the central medical database that military doctors consult. Lawyers and human rights advocates point to systemic issues, including recruits' inability to provide timely medical proof and formalistic examinations. Commanders have also reported receiving unfit recruits, including those with serious physical ailments, posing a danger to themselves and their comrades on the front lines.</p>

The 27-year-old England international has been out of favor at Old Trafford since last December and was told to train separately from the first team. Despite United's willingness to offload him, Barcelona sees him as a valuable addition to strengthen their attack, especially after failing to sign other targets. The deal is structured as a loan with an option to buy, a financially advantageous arrangement for the Spanish club given their ongoing economic constraints.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as Operation Valkyrie, is being remembered as a pivotal moment of German resistance during World War II. Led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, the attempt involved planting a bomb in Hitler's military headquarters, but the dictator survived with only minor injuries. The subsequent coup failed due to delays and wavering support, leading to the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. While initially viewed as traitors, the plotters are now honored in Germany as symbols of defiance against the Nazi regime, though historians note their motives were complex and not necessarily democratic.</p>

          <p>Detectives investigating the murder of 15-year-old Rene Graham have released new CCTV footage showing a suspected killer chasing another man with a gun moments after the shooting. Graham was shot in the chest at a music festival in a west London park in July 2024. The footage shows the suspect entering the park and then fleeing, gun in hand, after the attack. Police and the Crimestoppers charity, which is offering a £20,000 reward, are appealing to the public for information, believing that people in the community know the identity of the person responsible for the teenager's death.</p>

          <h2>Deadly South African Building Collapse Was 'Entirely Preventable,' Minister Says</h2>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the building collapse in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers last year, was "entirely preventable." Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated the tragedy resulted from multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and ignoring structural cracks and other defects that were identified up to a year before the collapse. A health and safety officer had even resigned in protest, yet work continued. The minister called for criminal accountability for the negligence, as survivors and families of the victims continue to deal with trauma and financial hardship.</p>

          <p>On "The Ramsey Show," a pregnant stay-at-home mom called for advice on paying off a car loan, but the conversation quickly shifted to her husband's spending habits. She revealed that although her husband earns $156,000 annually, his spending on tobacco and marijuana, which recently spiked to $700 a month, has left them struggling to afford groceries. Host Dave Ramsey challenged the caller's framing of the issue, urging her to confront the problem as a potential addiction that threatens their financial stability and marriage, rather than treating it as a simple budget line item. He questioned her claim of poverty, pointing to their substantial income.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise much quicker than initially expected. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already resumed running, agility drills, and taking swings, reporting that his knee feels great. Doctors told him the injury could have been much worse, potentially requiring surgery, if the timing of the impact had been slightly different. While he was originally expected to miss six weeks, the team is now optimistic he will return to the lineup sooner, providing a much-needed boost to the struggling Dodgers offense.</p>

          <p>The British men's 4x400m relay team from the 1997 world championships were finally awarded their gold medals in a ceremony at the London Diamond League meeting. The team, consisting of Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton, was upgraded from silver after the original winning U.S. team was disqualified. The disqualification followed a 2008 confession from U.S. runner Antonio Pettigrew that he had been doping. After a lengthy reallocation process, the British athletes received their long-overdue medals and a rousing welcome from the home crowd, 28 years after the race in Athens.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secretary of State has revoked the U.S. visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges as the White House increases pressure related to the prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro, a Trump ally, is on trial for an alleged coup attempt, and the visa revocations target the judge leading the case and his allies on the court. The move follows President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports. Brazilian President Lula condemned the action as "unacceptable interference" and an affront to national sovereignty, while the move has sparked nationalist anger in the South American country.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a largely positive week, buoyed by strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data, though concerns over potential new tariffs created some volatility. The June consumer price index showed core inflation slightly below expectations, while the producer price index also came in lower than anticipated, suggesting inflationary pressures are manageable for now. Key companies like Goldman Sachs reported strong results, while others like Abbott Labs saw stock dips despite beating estimates due to cautious forward guidance. Overall, the market continues to anticipate potential Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end, navigating the complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, identified itself as a "small disadvantaged business" in a federal filing just before a funding round valued it at $9 billion. According to the Small Business Administration, this designation is for companies majority-owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made while Musk was leading a government efficiency initiative aimed at cutting federal spending. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box was checked in error and has since been corrected, and that the company has never received any federal benefits.</p>
