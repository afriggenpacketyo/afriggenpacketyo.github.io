          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016. Dyer, who struggled with fame and addiction, had initially planned to leave the facility but reconsidered after reading the letter. He reflected on the pain he caused his family and committed to treatment, marking a turning point in his life. Dyer, known for roles in 'Human Traffic' and 'EastEnders,' acknowledged making 'a lot of bad decisions' and using drugs during his career, but says he is now focused on his family.</p>

Despite her ordeal, she affirmed her faith in the American justice system, thanking supporters for their kindness. Representative Ayanna Pressley and Senator Edward J.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a 'total reset' in US-China trade relations following the first day of high-level talks in Geneva, aimed at de-escalating the trade war. Trump praised the 'very good' discussions and stated that 'great progress' had been made, though he did not provide specific details. Top US and Chinese officials, including Vice-Premier He Lifeng, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, met to discuss reducing tariffs that have brought bilateral trade to a standstill. Despite Trump's optimistic claims, analysts remain skeptical of a major breakthrough, and the US has clarified that it will not unilaterally lower tariffs.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that the oral medication zongertinib shows promise in treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The medication outperformed the standard treatment option, intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, while also carrying fewer risks of adverse effects. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted at 82 sites worldwide and included 188 NSCLC patients, with a majority from Asian populations. Zongertinib targets the HER2 protein, blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for signaling cell growth.</p>

          <p>Sany Heavy Industry, a major Chinese heavy equipment manufacturer, plans to use funds from its proposed Hong Kong IPO to expand its global sales and service networks. The company aims to more than double its overseas revenue to 100 billion yuan in the next three years, driven by strong demand from developing countries in Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa. Sany's globalization strategy focuses on building localized marketing channels rather than constructing new factories. In 2024, overseas revenue accounted for nearly 65% of Sany's total revenue, highlighting the importance of international markets to the company's growth.</p>

Modeled after New York City's High Line, the project aims to become a tourist attraction with benches, public bathrooms, cafes, and event spaces.

The case hinged on text messages between Ryan and Harris, which revealed a pattern of drug use and Ryan's willingness to supply her with anesthetics. The defense argued that Harris had a history of mental illness and drug use, suggesting she may have been responsible for her own demise, but the jury ultimately sided with the prosecution.</p>

The service is fully clothed and platonic, with clients screened and consent forms signed to ensure boundaries are respected.

          <p>Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk returned to Massachusetts after a judge ordered her release from ICE detention. Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate, thanked her community for their support and expressed her faith in the American justice system. She had been detained for six weeks, sparking protests and concerns over her due process and First Amendment rights. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed Ozturk home, vowing to continue fighting for her full exoneration and visa restoration. Ozturk was detained by plainclothes ICE officers in March, and her lawyers argued that her detention was based on an op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by focusing on expanding into lower-tier cities, as competition and pricing pressures intensify in larger urban centers. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales but increased transaction volume, indicating a successful strategy to defend market share. The company has added 665 stores in China, reaching over 1,000 county-level markets. The growth of coffee shops in China is largely concentrated in second and 'new first-tier cities,' reflecting a broader trend of expanding consumer markets beyond the wealthiest urban areas.</p>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments have struggled to gain traction two years after their introduction. Only a small percentage of workers opt for this method, despite its availability and the increasing use of cashless payments in other areas. Experts believe that more benefits are needed to incentivize workers to switch to app-based payments, particularly part-time employees seeking faster access to their wages. Many companies also cite a lack of demand and increased administrative costs as reasons for not adopting the option.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is bracing for a slightly unusual 'atmospheric river' event, bringing widespread rainfall and potential flooding. The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain across Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with isolated spots potentially seeing up to 12 inches. While atmospheric rivers typically originate from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean and land in the Western US, this event is due to a 'cutoff low,' diverting the jet stream eastward. The precipitation could alleviate recent droughts in some areas, but also poses a risk of flooding in low-lying areas.</p>
