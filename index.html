            <p>Liam Hendriks, a prominent All-Star pitcher, has been activated off the injured list after a challenging two years that included battling non-Hodgkin lymphoma and undergoing Tommy John surgery. Hendriks, now with the Boston Red Sox, had his 2023 debut postponed due to his cancer diagnosis, and after returning for only five games, he underwent surgery that sidelined him for the remainder of that season and all of the following year. Before his health issues, Hendriks was a leading closer, achieving 38 saves in 2021 with the Chicago White Sox and earning three consecutive All-Star Game selections. His comeback is a testament to his resilience and determination to return to professional baseball.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen has accused El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele and former President Donald Trump of orchestrating a setup during his meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a U.S. citizen wrongfully deported to El Salvador. Van Hollen claims that El Salvador officials placed glasses resembling margaritas on the table during the meeting to defame him and Abrego Garcia. He asserted that neither he nor Abrego Garcia touched the drinks, and the entire meeting was suspect from the start. Van Hollen's visit aimed to address Abrego Garcia's erroneous deportation and ensure his return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court has ordered.</p>

            <p>A judge has ruled that a former roommate of the slain University of Idaho students can testify about seeing an intruder with "bushy eyebrows" around the time of the murders in the trial of Bryan Kohberger. The defense argued the testimony was unreliable, but the judge deemed it admissible for cross-examination. Kohberger is charged with the stabbing deaths of four students. The judge also ruled on the admissibility of Kohberger's medical diagnoses, stating they cannot be used to explain his courtroom demeanor unless he testifies.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an order preventing the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants without due process, suggesting a potential shift in the Court's tolerance for the administration's immigration tactics. The order came in response to concerns that the government was attempting to circumvent a previous ruling requiring notice and an opportunity to challenge removal. The ACLU argued that immigrants were being moved to a facility and given last-minute notices in English, which many did not understand. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented from the order, indicating a division within the Court.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, according to a CNBC All-America Economic Survey, amid widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and a shift towards pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, he has lost ground among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers. The public disapproves of his handling of inflation and federal spending, although he receives better marks on immigration.</p>

Agencies protecting miners from occupational hazards like black lung have been affected by significant government cuts. Critics argue that these cuts undermine the safety and well-being of miners. The administration's push for coal expansion comes amid concerns about rising cases of black lung and the delay of a new rule on silica dust exposure.</p>
