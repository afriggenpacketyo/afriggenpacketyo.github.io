          <p>Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky met at St. Peter's Basilica during Pope Francis's funeral, marking their first face-to-face encounter since February amidst rising tensions over ceasefire plans. Trump previously accused Zelensky of "gambling with World War Three" by rejecting Washington-led ceasefire proposals. The meeting follows envoy Steve Witkoff's multiple visits to Moscow, where discussions with Vladimir Putin aimed to bridge the gap between Russian and US positions on various international issues, including potential direct talks between Russia and Ukraine, though seating arrangements at the funeral kept the two leaders apart.

          <p>Students at Occidental College initiated a hunger strike to pressure the institution to divest from weapons manufacturers with ties to Israel and to enhance protections for international students amid visa revocation threats. Inspired by a similar campaign at Chapman University, the students also demand pro bono legal support for international students facing visa issues and the expungement of protest-related conduct charges. Occidental's president acknowledged the students' concerns and stated that many initiatives they advocate for are already in place, though the students argue the college isn't doing enough to address their demands.

          <p>S&P Global Ratings lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles due to a nearly $1 billion budget deficit, citing a weakening financial position and an emerging structural imbalance.

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn both successfully made weight for their middleweight contest, with Eubank weighing in under the 12st 1lb limit at the second weight check. This follows Eubank being fined for narrowly missing the weight at the initial weigh-in. The fight takes place over 30 years after their fathers' famous rivalry, though a previous attempt to stage the fight was cancelled due to a failed drugs test by Benn. Optimism score: 80</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, after rejecting previous offers to enter Canadian politics, became Prime Minister and is now leading the Liberal Party in a federal election. The catalyst for his entry into politics was President Trump's threats against Canada, creating a crisis suited to Carney's economic management expertise. Carney, known for his experience in both public and private sectors, aims to secure a full term in office. Optimism score: 70</p>
