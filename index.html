          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price jumped 25% despite the retailer reducing its profit forecast because of expected $50 million hit from tariffs. While the company anticipates full-year earnings per share to fall between $9.50 and $10.50, down from the previous $10.40 to $11.40 range, it raised its revenue outlook. The company now projects net sales growth of 3% to 6%, an increase from the earlier 3% to 5% estimate, however, its operating margin forecast was also reduced. The first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street expectations, with earnings per share at $1.59 versus the expected $1.39, and revenue reaching $1.10 billion against the anticipated $1.07 billion (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized the Republican spending bill, arguing it undermines the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut wasteful government spending. Musk stated that the bill, projected to increase the federal budget deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next 10 years, goes against DOGE's mission of saving taxpayer money. DOGE claims to have saved $170 billion since January through controversial measures like gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development and reducing government staff, resulting in approximately 275,000 government layoffs. Musk, who has pulled back from his DOGE work to focus on his companies, described the federal bureaucracy as "much worse than I realized."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is "continuing and permanent," dismissing the White House's attempt to characterize it as temporary. This ruling came as part of a lawsuit against Musk, DOGE, and President Trump by 14 states alleging constitutional violations due to Musk's sweeping cuts and changes to the federal government without Senate confirmation. The judge, Tanya Chutkan, stated that the states presented a credible argument that Musk holds a continuing position and exercises significant authority without proper appointment by Congress. The judge dismissed Trump as a defendant, citing the President's discretionary power to select officers, but allowed the case to proceed against Musk and DOGE.</p>

          <p>Actor and reality TV star Paul Danan's death has been ruled as a misadventure after he died from combined drug toxicity. The coroner's report indicated that Danan had taken a cocktail of drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and prescription medications, which resulted in fatal respiratory depression. Danan, known for his role in Hollyoaks and appearances on Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Love Island, had struggled with addiction for many years, spending a significant amount on rehab and recovery.

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is suing North Carolina and its State Board of Elections for allegedly failing to maintain accurate voter lists, violating the Help America Vote Act (HAVA). The lawsuit claims the state's voter registration form did not clearly require applicants to provide either a driver's license number or the last four digits of their social security number. The DOJ seeks a court order requiring North Carolina to develop a plan to contact voters with incomplete records and obtain the necessary identifying information within 30 days. The state election board acknowledges the issue, with the new board indicating a willingness to comply with federal law.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as the automotive industry faces regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. This expansion comes amid potential changes to emissions regulations, including President Trump's expected elimination of California's Advanced Clean Cars II rule.

          <p>A federal judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments.

This ruling marks a victory for DOGE, which faced legal challenges in February when it initially sought access to the Treasury Department's payment systems.

The article argues that Trump's self-enrichment resembles corruption seen in post-Soviet republics or postcolonial African dictatorships, citing the brazenness of his actions. The author contends that Trump's tactic is to depict the U.S. political system as corrupt, deflecting attention from his own unethical behavior.</p>

This move raises questions about reciprocity, potential political interference in corporate governance, and the future of foreign direct investment in strategic sectors.

          <p>Japan has celebrated the promotion of Onosato to yokozuna, making him the first Japanese sumo grand champion since 2017. The 24-year-old wrestler, weighing 421 pounds, achieved the top rank after winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament. Onosato hails from Ishikawa prefecture, which was severely impacted by an earthquake and tsunami earlier in the year. He aims to inspire and uplift the region with his performance. His promotion sets the stage for a rivalry with Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, the other current yokozuna.</p>
