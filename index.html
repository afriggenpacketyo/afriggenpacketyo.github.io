          <p>A New York City police officer was killed and another was wounded during a shooting inside a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan. The incident, which also left at least two civilians injured, occurred when a gunman with an AR-style weapon opened fire on the 33rd floor of 345 Park Avenue. The building, which houses offices for major corporations like Blackstone and the NFL, was placed on lockdown. Law enforcement sources reported that the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the attack, neutralizing the immediate threat.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has initiated daily 10-hour "tactical pauses" in fighting within specific areas of Gaza to allow for the secure distribution of humanitarian aid. This measure is intended to help the United Nations and other agencies address the severe hunger crisis by creating safe land routes for aid convoys. While international bodies have welcomed the step as a way to reach starving populations, many, including the U.N., reiterate that a broader ceasefire is necessary to resolve the widespread humanitarian catastrophe. The pauses are localized, with Israeli military operations continuing in other parts of the Gaza Strip.</p>

          <p>A new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union is expected to disproportionately benefit the U.S. while potentially harming the EU's economy. The deal imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods will face no new tariffs in Europe. Economists have described the pact as "asymmetric and unbalanced," forecasting a reduction in the EU's annual GDP. Despite the negative financial impact, the EU likely agreed to the terms to avoid a more severe trade war and reduce market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent visit to his golf courses in Scotland provided an unconventional but valuable opportunity for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to strengthen their diplomatic relationship. The trip, though notionally private, involved very public interactions, including an extended, free-wheeling press conference covering a wide range of global topics. This direct engagement and face time are seen by Downing Street as invaluable for aligning perspectives on key issues like the conflict in Gaza. For Starmer, navigating the president's unpredictable style presents both an opportunity to build rapport and a political risk.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, who transferred to USC for what he hoped would be his last college season, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," which limits athletes to four seasons of competition within a five-year period. The lawsuit argues that the denial is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the pandemic and a previous injury.

          <p>Following the death of Hulk Hogan (Terry Bollea), legal experts are reflecting on the significant impact of his 2016 lawsuit against Gawker Media. The case, in which Hogan was awarded $140 million over the publication of a private sex tape, is seen as a cultural turning point for media law and digital privacy. While it didn't set new legal precedent, it sent a powerful message to media outlets about the limits of First Amendment protections when publishing graphic content. The verdict ultimately bankrupted Gawker and reinforced privacy rights for both celebrities and ordinary people in the internet age.</p>

          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the January wildfires caused approximately $51.7 billion in damage to residential properties within Los Angeles city limits. The analysis focused on about 11,000 parcels, mostly single-family homes, affected by the blazes, with the majority impacted by the highly destructive Palisades fire. The fire devastated wealthy neighborhoods, with many of the destroyed homes having a pre-fire value of over $3.7 million. This figure does not include damage to commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic loss is even greater.</p>

President Trump asserted that televised images of starving children are real, directly contradicting an Israeli military official who labeled them as "fake" Hamas propaganda. This diplomatic friction occurs as Israel faces growing international condemnation, including a report from two Israeli human rights groups that characterizes its military operation as genocide. Israel maintains that it is allowing sufficient aid into the territory but that distribution is being mismanaged.</p>
