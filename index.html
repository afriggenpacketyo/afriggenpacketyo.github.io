          <p>A recent plane crash at Reagan National Airport has been attributed, in part, to a mismanaged execution of 'visual separation.' The crew of an Army Black Hawk helicopter requested and received permission to use visual separation, a common aviation practice that allows pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently. Aviation experts have long warned about the risks associated with mishandling visual separation. The incident highlights the potential for deadly consequences when this practice is not properly executed.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have achieved promising results using an immunotherapy drug, dostarlimab, to treat solid tumors. In a clinical trial, the drug was administered on its own, replacing the standard treatments that often have severe side effects. The trial participants, who had tumors that should respond to immunotherapy, experienced positive outcomes. This approach offers a potential alternative to grisly surgeries and harsh therapies, significantly improving patients' quality of life.</p>
