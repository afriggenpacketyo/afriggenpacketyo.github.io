          <p>Nine months of peaceful protests in Serbia have erupted into violent street clashes between demonstrators and police, with reports of vandalism and the use of tear gas and flares. Protesters allege the violence is a reaction to regime oppression and the use of paramilitaries, while police brutality has also been documented. President Aleksandar Vucic has promised a harsh response, accusing demonstrators of attempting to destroy the state, leaving the country in a precarious state where all outcomes, from further repression to new elections, seem possible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the United States is experiencing a significant collapse in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has surged to a record high, solidifying its position as the world's top apiary producer. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences attribute this disparity to fundamental differences in management practices. The U.S. model often involves large, clustered apiaries with minimal intervention, whereas Chinese methods may offer more sustainable conditions, leading to thriving bee populations in contrast to the massive die-offs seen in America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the European Union's failure to take decisive action against Israel's conduct in Gaza, such as suspending trade agreements, is rooted in structural racism and a colonial mentality. The author contrasts the EU's strong response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with its perceived paralysis over the Palestinian situation, highlighting a stark double standard. The piece calls for an internal reckoning within the EU to confront these biases, arguing that its credibility as a defender of international law is being undermined both at home and abroad.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has denied a preliminary injunction for USC's DJ Wingfield and UCLA's Kaedin Robinson, effectively preventing them from playing in the upcoming college football season. The players had sued the NCAA, arguing that its five-year eligibility rule violates antitrust laws by limiting their potential to earn Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) compensation. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not "commercial in nature" and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny, dealing a blow to the athletes and their respective teams.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the season, is forecast to move up the Atlantic without making direct landfall in the U.S. but is expected to cause life-threatening conditions along the East Coast. The National Hurricane Center warns of dangerous surf and rip currents throughout the week, with the storm maintaining major hurricane strength. Evacuation orders have been issued for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding, and officials are urging the public to stay out of the ocean.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 4-3 loss to the last-place Colorado Rockies in a series opener at Coors Field, ending their winning streak against the team. The Dodgers twice held the lead but were unable to maintain it, with the Rockies securing a walk-off victory in the ninth inning. The winning run was scored after a defensive miscommunication allowed a double, followed by a game-winning single, marking a frustrating start to a series positioned between crucial matchups with the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement and calls for self-deportation are not only affecting undocumented individuals but are also causing some U.S. citizens, particularly those from immigrant families, to consider leaving the country. Citing fear and political uncertainty, some are seeking dual citizenship and exploring options abroad as a "plan B" for their families' safety and future. The article highlights a growing sense of insecurity among citizens who feel their quality of life and safety are at risk in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's AI coding model, Qwen 3 Coder, has rapidly gained popularity on the AI marketplace OpenRouter, capturing over 20% of usage share and second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. Released in July, Alibaba claims its model offers performance on par with the industry leader, attributing its success to improved training data and reinforcement learning. This rise reflects intensified competition in the AI-assisted coding sector, as major Chinese tech firms like ByteDance and Tencent also release tools to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-powered software development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia is suing the Department of Justice over a new rule that ties federal grants for crime victims to cooperation with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is illegally forcing states to choose between forfeiting critical funding for victim services or using local officials to enforce federal immigration law. The states contend the condition is an unlawful attempt to punish "sanctuary" jurisdictions and will erode trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The opening of Camp East Montana, a new migrant detention center at Fort Bliss, Texas, was met with protests from immigration advocates over the weekend. The facility, which can eventually hold up to 5,000 people, is part of the Trump administration's plan for mass deportations, but critics are demanding that detainees be given proper access to legal counsel. Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar criticized the high cost of the facility, arguing the funds could be better spent on community services, while supporters maintain it is necessary for enforcing immigration law.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to fundamentally realign the league geographically, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. He suggested creating Eastern and Western conferences to reduce player travel and create more appealing broadcast schedules, particularly for West Coast games. While such a change would face resistance from traditionalists, Manfred believes it could be beneficial for the sport, with Nashville and Salt Lake City emerging as potential expansion locations.</p>

          <p>An international research team has collected sediment cores from the Antarctic seabed to study centuries of oceanic and climate history. By analyzing the layers of mud, scientists aim to understand the long-term impacts of human activities, such as industrial whaling, on the Southern Ocean ecosystem and the global carbon cycle. The samples will be analyzed for environmental DNA and carbon content to reconstruct past marine life and measure how much carbon was sequestered by whale populations before they were decimated, offering insights into their role in mitigating climate change.</p>

          <p>A 113-year-old landmark church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved 5 kilometers in one piece to save it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining.

This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a broader project to relocate the city, with the local mining company funding the move to ensure the preservation of the culturally significant building.</p>
