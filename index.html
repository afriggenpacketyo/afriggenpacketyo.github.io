            <p>President Trump has directed the U.S. military to assume control over a 60-foot strip of federal land along the southern border, spanning California, New Mexico, and Arizona, to enhance border security and combat illegal immigration. The memorandum, titled "Military Mission for Sealing the Southern Border of the United States and Repelling Invasions," designates the area as a "military installation" or "National Defense Area" to allow for activities like border-barrier construction and equipment deployment. Trump emphasized the need for a more direct military role due to various threats at the border. The Roosevelt Reservation, established in 1907, will be utilized for these military operations.</p>

The day was filled with dramatic shifts, with McIlroy initially dominating before facing challenges from his competitors. Ludvig Åberg also made a notable move, while Scottie Scheffler struggled to gain ground.

            <p>A Los Angeles judge has denied a request from the district attorney to block a resentencing petition for the Menéndez brothers, paving the way for a hearing that could offer them a path to freedom. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, had their case reopened following the emergence of new evidence suggesting sexual abuse by their father, José Menéndez. The prosecutor argued that the brothers have not shown sufficient remorse and still pose a risk to the public, but the judge sided with the defense, setting the stage for a new sentencing hearing. The case has drawn increased attention due to a popular Netflix documentary and renewed scrutiny of the abuse allegations.</p>

            <p>A 50-foot gray whale was found dead on a Huntington Beach shore, adding to the growing number of whale deaths this year. Scientists are investigating the cause of death, as the whale showed no signs of physical trauma. This event follows the deaths of at least 70 whales in Baja California lagoons and three in San Francisco Bay, raising concerns about a potential lack of food or other environmental factors affecting the whale population. Researchers have also noted a significant decrease in the number of gray whales migrating north this spring.</p>

While six police officers were charged in connection with his death, none were convicted. The city of Baltimore reached a $6.4 million civil settlement with Gray's family in 2015.</p>

            <p>Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, did not deny allegations that Russian sensors have been placed in seas around Great Britain to track UK nuclear submarines. While not denying the activity, Kelin dismissed concerns about it posing a threat to the UK. He claimed that the idea of a Russian threat to the UK is "invented" and that the tracked submarines carry "very old outdated nuclear warheads." This admission follows a report detailing the discovery of alleged Russian sensors in British waters.</p>

The FBI reviewed documents allegedly written by the teen, which calls for the assassination of Trump and the start of a revolution to "save the white race," according to federal court documents. Casap faces multiple charges, including first-degree murder.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies have left American shoppers feeling uncertain and prompting some to engage in panic buying. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, have caused concerns about rising prices and potential shortages. While some consumers are stocking up on goods, others feel paralyzed by the constant changes and hope for a policy reversal. Economists predict that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for clothing, electronics, and other goods, potentially impacting consumer spending and economic growth.</p>

The exemptions, backdated to April 5, also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House indicated the exemptions were made to ensure companies had more time to move production to the US.</p>
