          <p>President Trump has threatened Elon Musk with "serious consequences" if Musk decides to fund Democratic candidates in upcoming elections, escalating their public feud. Trump stated he has no desire to rebuild his relationship with Musk after the billionaire criticized the recent budget bill. This comes after Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars backing Trump and other Republican candidates in the past. The dispute began with Musk's criticism of Trump's spending package and has led to personal attacks, with Trump threatening to cancel Musk's government contracts.</p>

          <p>Labour's biggest financial backers are urging Rachel Reeves to avoid making cuts at next week's spending review, instead advocating for wealth taxes to fund Britain's public services.

This pressure comes as Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has also pushed Reeves to consider wealth taxes rather than departmental cuts.

          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, French politicians are turning to remembrance policies, with three new initiatives aimed at recognizing and symbolically healing historical injustices. These include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing and compensating returnees from French Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt" dating back to 1825. While some view this as social maturity, others suggest that symbolic initiatives are easier to pass than structural reforms. These efforts highlight France's ongoing engagement with its complex past.</p>
