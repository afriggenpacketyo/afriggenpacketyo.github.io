        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has successfully passed its welfare reform bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to quell a rebellion within the Labour party. Fearing a defeat, ministers agreed to delay changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) until after a review, effectively gutting the bill of its most substantial cost-saving measures. This move has created a multi-billion pound gap in the government's financial plans and has been described by some MPs as a chaotic and shambolic legislative process. The bill passed with a majority of 75, significantly reduced from the government's working majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Trump over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The lawsuit, which legal experts widely viewed as an attack on the First Amendment, alleged that CBS News deceptively edited Harris's response to a question. Under the settlement, the funds will be allocated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library and legal fees, with no direct payment to him. The agreement does not include an apology from Paramount, but the company has agreed to release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates.</p>

A student in the US college system, Tarvet is approaching the daunting match with quiet confidence, viewing it as an opportunity to win rather than just an experience.

          <p>A group of at least 180 current and former UK military aircrew are pursuing compensation from the Ministry of Defence, claiming their cancer was caused by exposure to toxic fumes in helicopters. The claims relate to aircraft such as the Sea King, Puma, and Chinook, with crew members contracting various cancers, including rare blood cancers. One late flight sergeant, who trained the Prince of Wales, received an out-of-court settlement before his death, although the MoD did not admit liability. Veterans' groups are now urging the MoD to implement cancer screening and raise awareness, while the ministry maintains it believes the emissions pose no health risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive legislative package, which includes tax cuts, border security funding, and defense spending, has cleared the House Rules Committee and is set for a full House vote.

Republicans defended the measure, highlighting provisions like an expanded child tax credit and tax relief on tipped wages as beneficial for working-class families. Despite some conservative opposition, GOP leadership is confident the bill will pass, aiming to get it to the president's desk by July 4th. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the G7's recent agreement to exempt American companies from a new global minimum tax is a significant setback for international tax fairness. The authors, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, contend that G7 governments caved to pressure from the US, undermining a 2021 global accord designed to end the "race to the bottom" on corporate taxes. This exemption allows US multinationals to continue using tax havens, giving them a competitive advantage and incentivizing other companies to relocate their headquarters to the US. The authors call for the deal to be rejected, advocating for a stronger, UN-led system to ensure all corporations pay their fair share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the "Quad," have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. The move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the processing and refining of minerals essential for high-tech industries like semiconductors. In a joint statement, the group expressed concern about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions stemming from dependence on a single country. The announcement was made following a meeting of the nations' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., aimed at strengthening strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision blocks a plan to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, which would have been years ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge stated that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, asserting that district courts cannot prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

The jurors informed the judge they had reached verdicts on four of the five counts but were deadlocked on the racketeering charge, which carries a potential life sentence. After hearing arguments from both sides, the judge urged the jury to continue trying to reach a consensus. Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which include sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution, following a two-month trial with testimony from 34 witnesses.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant change to the company's contract manufacturing business, potentially abandoning a key technology his predecessor championed. The plan involves no longer marketing the "18A" chipmaking process to external customers due to delays and a lack of interest, which could result in a substantial financial write-off. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation "14A" process, where it believes it can better compete with rival TSMC. This potential pivot is part of a broader effort to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker and attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

The episode has exposed deep divisions within the Labour party and left key ministers weakened, with some MPs openly criticizing the handling of the legislation.

          <p>President Trump, accompanied by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, toured a newly constructed migrant detention facility in the remote Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz." The center, surrounded by miles of swamp, is intended to house undocumented migrants and serve as a deterrent to illegal immigration.

The facility, which can hold up to 3,000 people, is part of the administration's broader immigration crackdown, though it has drawn criticism and legal challenges over its location and conditions.</p>

The current figures are a dramatic drop from the peak levels seen under the previous administration, where daily apprehensions sometimes exceeded this new monthly total.
