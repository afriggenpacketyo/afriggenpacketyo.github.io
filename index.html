          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 15:11:28 EDT</div>

          <p>Three major manufacturers, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, have recalled approximately 5 million above-ground pools sold since 2002. The recall follows the deaths of nine children who reportedly used the pools' external compression straps as a foothold to climb in, creating a significant drowning risk. The pools, which are 48 inches or taller, were sold at major retailers like Walmart, Target, and The Home Depot. Owners are advised to secure the pools and contact the manufacturers for a free repair kit that removes the hazardous strap.</p>

          <p>The Ibiza Rocks hotel and music venue has suspended its event schedule after two British men died on its premises in separate incidents this month. A 19-year-old ice hockey player, Gary Kelly, died after falling from a balcony, just two weeks after a 26-year-old man, Evan Thomson, also died at the venue. The venue expressed its devastation and stated that guest safety is its highest priority while it cooperates with authorities.

With the average annual cost of college exceeding these limits, many students face a funding gap.

          <p>Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona marks the end of a long-running saga at Manchester United, where he rose through the youth academy to become a star. This article explores the complex factors leading to his exit, including a decline in form, a breakdown in his relationship with the club, and the need for a fresh start. While Barcelona secured a favorable deal with an option to buy, questions remain about why the relationship at United soured so completely. The move is seen by many as a necessary, albeit sad, step for the 27-year-old to reignite his career.</p>

          <p>Joseph Lee's debut book, "Nothing More of This Land," delves into the rich history and modern identity of the Aquinnah Wampanoag people on Martha's Vineyard, an island often known only for its affluent summer visitors. As a member of the tribe, Lee explores the complexities of belonging to a sacred land that is also a luxury tourist destination. The book examines the challenges of preserving indigenous culture and identity in the face of stereotypes, economic pressures, and the ongoing fight for sovereignty. It provides a vital perspective beyond the island's postcard image.</p>

These foods are central to the MIND diet, a dietary pattern shown to significantly reduce dementia risk. Experts emphasize that while diet is a powerful tool, it should be combined with other healthy lifestyle factors for maximum benefit.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, is scheduled for sentencing after being convicted of federal civil rights violations connected to the 2020 raid that killed Breonna Taylor.

Although his bullets did not strike Taylor, his actions were deemed a violation of her constitutional rights.

It clarifies that there are no simple "big red buttons" for launching a nuclear weapon. Instead, the process is a highly redundant and deliberate sequence involving multiple personnel across separate locations. Launching a missile requires decrypting orders, verifying codes, and the simultaneous turning of keys and levers by at least four different officers, a system designed to prevent any single individual or crew from initiating a launch.</p>

A recent report about a 2003 "birthday book" containing a cryptic message from Trump to Epstein has renewed scrutiny, though Trump has sued, claiming it is fake.
