          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:12:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian psychiatrist Prof. Andrew McIntosh hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by year's end, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began providing ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, charging Â£6,000 for four infusions and psychotherapy. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release a new report on psychedelics, including updated ketamine information. The implementation of ketamine clinics may help people who suffer from severe depression when more traditional treatments have failed.</p>

          <p>Senior officials from the FBI and Homeland Security held a conference call with governors and law enforcement to discuss the implications of U.S. missile strikes in Iran on the threat environment. The FBI is enhancing its posture by increasing personnel in offices and monitoring intelligence sources. Homeland Security issued a bulletin urging the public to report suspicious activity, with Secretary Kristi Noem highlighting the potential for increased threats like cyberattacks, violence, and antisemitic hate crimes. While there is no specific intelligence of a direct threat against the U.S. homeland, the call aimed to ensure states are aware of the current threat environment. The context of the briefing is to notify state officials of the current threat environment after a major military strike. The events after the strike may have significant consequences for the USA.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines around the world highlight the US military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, with varying focuses. The Financial Times emphasizes the US administration's stance that it is targeting Iran's nuclear program, not engaging in war, while acknowledging the attack as a "gamble." The Metro depicts the attack as "Hammered" and notes Iran's warning of "everlasting consequences." The Guardian calls the attack "the most consequential intervention in a conflict in a generation," reporting Iran's vow to retaliate. The Daily Mail focuses on fears of an "Iran terror backlash" in Britain and allied countries. The global community is on high alert after this military intervention.</p>

          <p>After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, scientists feared for the survival of the rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island. Despite the island losing two-thirds of its vegetation, a census revealed that most of the monkeys had survived. Researchers believe they may have huddled together for protection and consumed seaweed deposited on the beach during the storm. The staff managed to preserve decades of research data and biological samples by using generators to maintain critical temperatures, highlighting the resilience of both the research project and the monkeys themselves.</p>

Sala is working with Dominica's government to create a sanctuary for the whales, which has since been established as the first sperm whale reserve in the world. Vega described the experience as both terrifying and rewarding, emphasizing the whales' curiosity and gentle nature. The creation of the sanctuary will help preserve the sperm whale population.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report explores the unique survival strategies of sloths, the world's slowest mammal, highlighting their ability to thrive despite their apparent disadvantages. Zoologist Lucy Cooke explains that sloths' slow movement is an energy-saving adaptation to their vegetarian diet, which consists of toxic leaves that require slow digestion. They spend most of their lives hanging upside down in trees, moving with deliberate slowness to avoid predators. Cooke also challenges conventional wisdom about animal behavior, emphasizing the extraordinary and strange lives of often-overlooked creatures, advocating for a slower, more sustainable way of life inspired by the sloth. This animal has proven itself to be uniquely built to survive.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, or Monkey Island, to understand how environmental stressors impact longevity and overall health. The monkeys, who share 94% of their DNA with humans, have been studied for over 80 years. Hurricane Maria in 2017 devastated the island, but most of the monkeys survived, leading researchers to investigate their resilience. The study revealed that monkeys who lived through the hurricane aged an extra six to eight human years, and those with stronger social bonds were more resilient to the stress. This research could provide insights into human survivability in the face of climate-related trauma.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report highlighted the issue of Social Security overpayments, where beneficiaries may unexpectedly owe large sums of money, even if the error wasn't their fault. Experts recommend regularly checking earnings history, especially before retirement, to ensure accuracy. Recipients should also carefully track income if receiving disability benefits and report any worker's compensation. For those on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), understanding complex eligibility rules is crucial, and it is important to contact Social Security to request a $10 per month repayment program if eligible for a full Medicare Part D subsidy. The goal is to help people avoid unexpected bills from the Social Security Administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch a military strike on Iran's nuclear sites without consulting Congress has sparked controversy and partisan divisions. While Republican leaders were briefed beforehand, Democrats were largely excluded, leading to accusations of unconstitutional behavior.

The administration insists it is not seeking war with Iran but is targeting its nuclear program, though this action risks alienating some of Trump's supporters who oppose foreign entanglements.

          <p>As military strategists assess the damage from U.S. strikes in Iran, concerns are growing about the impact on Isfahan's cultural and architectural treasures. The city, home to one of Iran's targeted nuclear sites, boasts intricate mosques, bridges, and the UNESCO-listed Naqsh-e Jahan Square. The region's 17th-century architecture, characterized by colorful tiling, is at risk. While there have been no reports of damage in central Isfahan, the proximity of the strikes raises fears for the preservation of these historic landmarks. The safety of the region's historical sites remains a significant concern.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to launch military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities was driven by his belief that Iran is close to developing a nuclear weapon. While intelligence agencies have assessed that Iran suspended its nuclear-weapons program in 2003, they also acknowledge that Iran has built up its largest-ever stockpile of enriched uranium. Trump's decision aligns with Prime Minister Netanyahu's view that Iran is stockpiling uranium for weaponization purposes. The decision to use military force was a judgment call based on an intuitive view of the intelligence, and now, it's his to own. The action was taken based on an interpretation of the available information.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack experienced difficulties receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns among hospital staff about the state's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, blamed fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the delay, arguing it created confusion about permissible medical procedures. While Florida's healthcare agency issued guidance clarifying that ectopic pregnancies are exempt from abortion restrictions, the incident underscores the challenges and confusion arising from restrictive abortion laws. Cammack hopes her experience will foster common ground between opposing political groups to ensure women receive necessary care. The situation highlights the complexities of reproductive healthcare.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, experts analyzing satellite imagery say that while damage has been inflicted, the program is not destroyed. Jeffrey Lewis notes that Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium appear untouched, posing a continued concern. David Albright suggests that Iran may have moved enriched uranium before the strikes and could reconstitute the program elsewhere. The assessments contrast with claims from the Trump Administration that Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated. International monitors and cooperation from the Iranian regime are considered necessary to truly end Iran's nuclear program. The experts believe the program has been seriously set back.</p>
