          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder attack during a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime and multiple state charges, including attempted first-degree murder. According to court documents, Soliman admitted to researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube and purchasing the necessary ingredients. He allegedly told police that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were dead, indicating the attack was premeditated and politically motivated. The attack injured 12 people, and Soliman's bond has been set at $10 million.</p>

          <p>FEMA Administrator David Richardson reportedly stated during a staff briefing that he was unaware the U.S. has a hurricane season, causing confusion and concern among agency staff. While a DHS spokesperson claimed it was a joke, the comment amplified worries about Richardson's lack of disaster response experience, especially given recent staff cuts and reduced hurricane preparedness. The incident comes amid forecasts for an above-normal hurricane season, raising questions about FEMA's readiness under Richardson's leadership; the agency's response plans remain unchanged despite earlier indications of a new plan.</p>

          <p>Authorities in San Jose have identified Harry "Nicky" Nickerson, a former student, as the killer of Diane Peterson, a high school teacher who was stabbed to death in 1978. The case remained unsolved for 47 years until a relative of Nickerson disclosed that he had admitted to the stabbing shortly after it occurred. Nickerson, who had a history of violent crimes and committed suicide in 1993, was initially a person of interest but lacked corroborating evidence at the time. The resolution brings closure to a long-standing mystery, though the suspect will never face trial.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Johns Hopkins University reveals a decline in measles vaccination rates across the United States, with 78% of the 2,066 counties studied experiencing a decrease. The MMR vaccination rate fell from 93.92% in the 2017-2018 school year to 91.26% in the 2023-2024 school year, leaving many communities vulnerable to outbreaks. This decline comes amid the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. since 2019, with the majority of cases occurring in unvaccinated individuals; public health officials emphasize the importance of vaccination to achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease.</p>

          <p>A geomagnetic storm that was forecast to produce vibrant displays of the Northern Lights across much of the United States turned out to be weaker than anticipated. Skywatchers who hoped to witness the aurora borealis were largely disappointed, as the expected streaks of colorful light did not materialize to the extent predicted. This serves as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of space weather and its impact on Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election saw a turnout of less than 10%, one of the lowest in the country's democratic history, raising concerns about the legitimacy of the process. With nearly 90% of voters abstaining, the election's outcome is being questioned, as it was intended to be a key component of the ruling party's transformation of Mexican society.

          <p>The UN secretary-general has called for an independent investigation into the killing of Palestinians near an aid distribution center in Gaza. Disputed reports allege Israeli forces opened fire, while witnesses reported being shot at while waiting for food. The Israeli military denied its troops fired at civilians, but the UN is seeking a thorough investigation to determine the facts and hold perpetrators accountable.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine failed to reach an agreement on a ceasefire during recent talks but committed to exchanging sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war, as well as those under 25. The two sides remain deeply divided on how to end the war, with Ukraine insisting on an unconditional ceasefire and Russia demanding military withdrawal from occupied regions. Despite the lack of progress on a ceasefire, the commitment to a prisoner swap provides a small measure of humanitarian relief.</p>

          <p>A runway at Newark Liberty International Airport reopened nearly two weeks ahead of schedule, which had been undergoing renovations for weeks and contributing to flight delays and cancellations. Officials said the resumption of regular runway operations is expected to ease congestion at the airport, which has been struggling with staffing shortages, technical problems and the ongoing construction. The Federal Aviation Administration is working to certify the runway for arriving flights as well.</p>
