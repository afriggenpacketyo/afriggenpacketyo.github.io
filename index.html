          <p>Alaska Airlines requested a temporary, system-wide ground stop for all its and Horizon Air's flights following a significant IT outage on Sunday evening. The Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged the request in an advisory.

The specific cause of the IT failure and the full extent of its impact on airport operations were not immediately detailed.</p>

          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are set to be closed due to severe fire safety hazards, leaving residents homeless and their investments worthless. Flat owners in Beech Rise and Willow Rise report spending up to £1 million collectively on service charges and repairs while the buildings deteriorated under various management companies. Local MP Anneliese Midgley criticized the situation as a failure of the "broken leasehold system," where residents were financially responsible for issues neglected by landlords and developers, resulting in a tragic loss of homes and savings.</p>

          <p>A 158-year-old Northamptonshire transport company, KNP, was forced into liquidation after a ransomware attack believed to have originated from a single weak password. The hacking group, known as Akira, encrypted the company's data and demanded a multi-million-pound ransom, which KNP could not afford, leading to the loss of 700 jobs. This incident highlights a growing trend of ransomware attacks on UK businesses, with the National Cyber Security Centre warning companies to bolster their defenses against such devastating and increasingly common cyber threats.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has strategically pivoted from telecommunications to become a formidable leader in artificial intelligence. The company has developed a comprehensive AI ecosystem, including advanced Ascend processors that compete with Nvidia's, cloud data centers, and industry-specific AI models like Pangu. This transformation, ironically accelerated by U.S. sanctions, has positioned Huawei as a national champion in China's tech ambitions, with a diverse portfolio spanning from smart cars to AI infrastructure, showcasing remarkable resilience and innovation.</p>

          <p>The Singapore dollar (SGD) is increasingly exhibiting features of a safe-haven currency, bolstered by Singapore's strong institutional framework, economic resilience, and prudent policymaking. While it functions as a defensive asset in Asia, its global status is constrained by the relatively small size of its market compared to traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. Experts note that the very monetary policy that provides stability also limits the currency's scale, but suggest the SGD could evolve into a more prominent global safe haven over time.

Bates was convicted of the 1982 kidnapping and murder of 24-year-old Janet White in Bay County, whom he abducted from her workplace. According to court records, he broke into the insurance office where she worked, waited for her to return from lunch, and then took her into nearby woods where he attempted to sexually assault her and stabbed her to death. His attorney has stated they will file further appeals, arguing the execution would be unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Former UFC champion Ronda Rousey has maintained her political stances without apology, revealing she supported Bernie Sanders in 2015 due to his rejection of corporate campaign funds. In a recent interview, she also disclosed a promise made to UFC President Dana White, a friend of Donald Trump, to refrain from speaking negatively about Trump. Rousey explained she felt she owed White for his early support of the UFC. She emphasized the importance of voting, encouraging people to participate in democracy and make their voices heard, especially in local elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to derail the Washington Commanders' plans for a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the NFL team reverts to its former name, the Redskins. In a social media post, Trump stated he might put a restriction on the deal if the name is not changed back, claiming there is a "big clamoring" for the original name. The team dropped the controversial name in 2020 after years of criticism that it was a racist slur against Indigenous people. It is currently unclear how Trump could intervene in the project, which involves redeveloping a federally owned site.</p>

          <p>A Delta Connection flight operated by SkyWest had to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential mid-air collision with a B-52 bomber while on approach to Minot, North Dakota.

The incident, which occurred near Minot Air Force Base, is now under investigation by both SkyWest and the Air Force. It is unclear how close the two aircraft came to each other.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing its worst measles outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 1998, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, a rate far exceeding that of the U.S. The outbreak is concentrated in provinces like Alberta and Ontario, particularly within some Mennonite communities where vaccination rates have historically been lower. Public health officials attribute the rapid spread to rising vaccine hesitancy, fueled by misinformation since the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation highlights the severe public health risk posed by declining immunization rates for highly contagious but preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concern over looming trade tariffs, the stock market is being buoyed by several powerful positive factors, according to this analysis. Strong corporate earnings, coupled with significant pro-business provisions in President Trump's new legislative bill, are creating a robust economic environment. These provisions include extensions of tax cuts, new deductions for workers and businesses, and incentives for domestic investment. The article argues these factors, along with a boom in infrastructure spending and a favorable M&A climate, will continue to propel stocks higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly boosted. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions. Analysis reveals that nearly half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups, are not saving into a private pension. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a strategy to close this growing retirement savings gap.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. The decline is linked to a perception that the program is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is targeting Hispanic people unfairly. Concurrently, the poll shows a strong public desire for the administration to focus more on lowering prices and addressing inflation, with most Americans opposing tariffs and believing the new "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" primarily helps the wealthy rather than the middle class.</p>

          <p>In one of the deadliest days for civilians seeking aid during the war, at least 85 Palestinians were killed at various locations across Gaza on Sunday, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The largest number of casualties occurred in northern Gaza, where witnesses reported Israeli forces fired on massive crowds gathered for a UN aid convoy. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to remove an immediate threat but disputed the casualty figures. The violence comes as Israel issues new evacuation orders for central Gaza, further complicating humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggles continued as they were swept by the Milwaukee Brewers, culminating in a 6-5 loss that marked their 10th defeat in 12 games. The loss was compounded by a potentially significant injury to first baseman Freddie Freeman, who left the game with a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. While X-rays were negative, the injury adds to the team's frustrations during a slump characterized by defensive errors and inconsistent offense. The Brewers became the first team in 20 years to sweep a season series of six or more games from the Dodgers.</p>
