          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported during the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face charges of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to bring migrants, including MS-13 members, from Latin America to the U.S. between 2016 and 2025. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that his client's due process rights were violated, as the government initially deported him to a foreign prison. The case has sparked legal battles, with the Supreme Court affirming the need to handle his case as if he had not been improperly deported. Optimism surrounding the case is tempered by the serious nature of the charges and the potential for a lengthy legal battle.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are engaged in a public feud after a falling out, marked by social media attacks and threats of consequences. Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, while Trump accused Musk of being disrespectful and threatened to cut government contracts held by Musk's businesses. Vice President JD Vance attempted to downplay the spat, attributing Musk's behavior to frustration and hoping for reconciliation. The feud raises questions about the future of their relationship and the potential impact on Republican politics. The public falling out signals a significant shift in the dynamics between the two figures.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has acknowledged Elon Musk's "huge mistake" in attacking President Trump following a public falling out, but attempts to downplay the severity of the situation. Vance hopes Musk will eventually "come back into the fold," despite the intensity of his attacks on social media. Musk accused the Trump administration of concealing information about the president's association with Jeffrey Epstein, which Vance denied. While Musk's recent comments have been critical, Vance defends the budget bill that sparked the conflict and emphasizes Musk's prior contributions to the administration. The situation underscores the complex dynamics within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>England completed a comprehensive clean sweep of the one-day international series against the West Indies with a dominant nine-wicket victory in a rain-affected match at Taunton. Chasing a reduced target of 106, England reached the total in just 10.5 overs, led by an unbeaten 57 from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt. West Indies struggled after losing early wickets and were further hampered by the absence of star all-rounder Hayley Matthews. England's summer continues with T20s and ODIs against India, building on their success in both the T20 and ODI series against the West Indies, showing a strong performance.</p>

          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, found a liver donor in Kristin Johnston, a high school classmate he hadn't seen in 20 years. Johnston volunteered after seeing Register's wife's Facebook plea for a living liver donor. Doctors had given Register a year to a year-and-a-half to live, making a liver transplant his best chance of survival. The surgery involves removing 70% of Johnston’s liver and transplanting it into Register, with both livers regenerating over time.

The investigation focuses on how classified strike details ended up in a commercial messaging app, Signal, shared in chat groups including Hegseth's wife. Investigators are also inquiring whether staff members were asked to delete messages, as the government is legally required to retain federal communications.

Parliament adopted measures to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, compensate returnees from French Indochina, and address Haiti's "double debt." These actions follow a failed attempt to withdraw a controversial retirement age increase, highlighting the legislature's difficulty in enacting structural reforms. While some view these remembrance policies as a sign of social maturity, others suggest they are easier to pass than substantive changes.

          <p>Sir David Attenborough has expressed his deep concern to Prince William about the "unspeakably awful" damage inflicted on the world's oceans by certain fishing methods. In an interview ahead of the UN Oceans Conference, Attenborough highlighted the potential harm of practices like bottom trawling to marine life and carbon sequestration. The UN aims to bring the High Seas Treaty into force, protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030, but scientists worry about the effectiveness of MPAs without addressing destructive fishing practices. The conference seeks to accelerate action on issues affecting the oceans, emphasizing their crucial role in planetary survival.</p>

          <p>A salmonella outbreak linked to recalled eggs from the August Egg Company has sickened dozens of people across seven states, leading to hospitalizations. The company recalled approximately 1.7 million eggs distributed to grocery stores between February and May due to potential salmonella contamination. Symptoms of salmonella poisoning include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, with young children, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems at higher risk. The CDC advises consumers to discard or return recalled eggs and disinfect any surfaces they came into contact with, adding to a string of recent salmonella-related outbreaks involving food. This outbreak highlights the importance of food safety and preventative measures in the food industry.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly half of Americans are making a significant Social Security mistake by not saving enough for retirement. Ramsey's study highlights that a large percentage of Americans are not actively saving for the future, leading to potential financial difficulties in their golden years. He recommends creating a savings benchmark of at least 15% of gross income to ensure a secure retirement. With Social Security benefits typically replacing only a portion of pre-retirement income, Ramsey emphasizes the importance of proactive savings strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
