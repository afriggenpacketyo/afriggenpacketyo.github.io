          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has refrained from endorsing Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, citing a lack of personal acquaintance. While praising Mamdani's successful campaign focus on the cost of living, Jeffries emphasized the need for a substantive conversation about his vision for the city. Jeffries also stated that Mamdani would need to clarify his positions on Israel and antisemitism to gain broader support, particularly within the Jewish communities he represents. This cautious stance highlights the ideological divisions within the Democratic party following the progressive candidate's primary victory.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have advanced a massive legislative package that aims to make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also increasing spending on border security, defense, and energy. The bill, which the House narrowly approved, includes significant policy changes such as new restrictions on Medicaid and the SNAP food stamp program. To offset costs and navigate Senate rules, the proposal involves lowering provider taxes for Medicaid over time and raising the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for five years. The legislation also raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to avoid a potential default later this summer. (not investment advice)</p>

Navratilova supported Rowling on social media, accusing Pascal of telling women to be quiet. A lifelong Democrat, Navratilova has been a vocal advocate for restricting biological males from competing in women's sports, a stance that has sometimes put her at odds with her party's platform while aligning with some conservative positions on the issue.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis for voting against a procedural motion to advance the GOP's major spending and tax bill. Tillis, along with Senator Rand Paul, were the only two Republicans to oppose the measure. In a social media post, Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against Tillis in his 2026 re-election, accusing him of grandstanding. Tillis defended his vote, citing concerns that proposed Medicaid cuts would harm his state's hospitals and rural communities, and stated he had informed Trump of his opposition beforehand.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas and propelled figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan to prominence. Tanenhaus argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party. The article also features commentary from Newt Gingrich, who sees echoes of Buckley's intellectual critique of elites in Donald Trump's political style.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States is dangerously vulnerable to China's control over the global supply of rare earth elements, which are crucial for modern technology and defense systems. The author contends that China has weaponized this dominance, as seen in its recent export controls, and that years of U.S. inaction have exacerbated the risk. The piece calls for a coherent, long-term strategy to treat these critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power, urging for investment in a complete domestic and allied supply chain, from mining to recycling, to counter Beijing's leverage.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a large-scale rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled after over 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the plans due to concerns they would harm disabled and vulnerable people. The government reversed plans to freeze the health component of universal credit and limited cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only. A review of the Pip assessment process will also be launched, a move that has satisfied leading rebels.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Global Health reveals that a significant number of cancer drugs available in four African nations are substandard or falsified. Researchers tested nearly 200 products in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Cameroon, finding that approximately 17% contained incorrect levels of active ingredients. This issue poses a severe risk to patients, as insufficient dosages can lead to treatment failure and disease progression. The problem is attributed to manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by a lack of regulatory oversight and testing capabilities in the affected regions.</p>

          <p>In an interview, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi described the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities from recent U.S. strikes as significant and serious. He stated that key sites for uranium enrichment and treatment were destroyed to an important degree, representing a major setback for Iran's program. Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic talks and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify remaining materials and activities, as the current lack of information creates dangerous uncertainty. He confirmed that before the strikes, Iran had around 400 kilograms of highly enriched uranium, the current location of which is unknown.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan to partner with supermarkets and food manufacturers to encourage healthier eating habits and combat obesity. Rather than imposing mandatory rules, the strategy will involve voluntary collaboration where retailers decide how to promote healthier options, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layouts. Major food retailers will report on their healthy food sales to increase accountability. Health Secretary Wes Streeting framed the policy as a collaborative effort to make healthy eating more accessible, in contrast to what critics from the opposition called a "nanny state" approach.</p>

          <p>Approximately 12,000 Chinese immigrants in Taiwan face a June 30 deadline to provide proof that they have canceled their household registration in China, or risk losing their Taiwanese residency and facing possible deportation. The policy, part of a broader national security push by President Lai Ching-te's administration, has caused distress and uncertainty among affected families, many of whom have lived in Taiwan for decades. Critics argue the implementation is rushed and unfair, forcing immigrants to navigate Chinese bureaucracy and submit sensitive information.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unrecognized unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. The other two key indicators are whether a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. The article argues that healthy relationships require these elements for strong communication, emotional intimacy, and trust, and their absence can lead to resentment and distance over time.</p>

The Buffalo Soldiers were Black U.S. army units active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who, in addition to other duties, fought against Indigenous peoples during America's westward expansion, a complex history that critics say was ignored.</p>

Through personal anecdotes and expert interviews, it reveals how companies intentionally make it difficult for customers to resolve issues, cancel services, or receive refunds, often to protect profits. Tactics include complex phone trees, poorly trained agents with limited authority, and systems designed to disconnect calls. This weaponized inefficiency not only costs consumers time and money but also fosters a broader sense of powerlessness, exhaustion, and declining trust in institutions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision that immediately impacts President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the decision allows the administration to begin planning its implementation in states that are not part of the original lawsuits. This could create a patchwork system where children born to noncitizens are granted citizenship in some states but not others. Legal challenges will continue, and a class-action lawsuit has been filed to protect all noncitizen pregnant women.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are using the primary victory of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic socialist poised to be the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, as a national political attack line. At conservative gatherings and in media statements, Republicans are portraying Mamdani's ascent as evidence that the entire Democratic Party is embracing radical socialism. This strategy aims to energize their base and appeal to moderate voters by linking mainstream Democrats to Mamdani's progressive platform. In response, some Democrats have defended Mamdani against what they call Islamophobic attacks while others have kept their distance.</p>
