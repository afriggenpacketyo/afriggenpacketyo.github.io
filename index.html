          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 18:00:12 EDT</div>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead flourishing in Asia. He credits this phenomenon for the region's significant economic growth and poverty reduction, noting that Asia's success is a direct result of its integration into the global economy. Goldin observes a trend towards a more fragmented and regionalised globalisation, with Asia becoming a central hub as the U.S. shows signs of withdrawal. The article also touches upon the dual nature of globalisation, which brings both benefits like trade and risks like pandemics.</p>

His presence at Arthur Ashe Stadium drew a combination of cheers and boos from the audience when he was shown on the venue's screens. The event experienced a half-hour delay due to heightened security measures implemented for his visit. According to reports, the U.S. Tennis Association requested that broadcasters avoid showcasing disruptions or crowd reactions related to his attendance.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title and sixth career Grand Slam by defeating defending champion Jannik Sinner in a four-set final. The victory allows the 22-year-old to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Sinner. This match was the third major final between the two rivals in the same calendar year, with Alcaraz now leading their head-to-head series. The event was briefly overshadowed by security delays due to the attendance of U.S. President Donald Trump, which pushed back the start time.</p>

          <p>A California state bill, AB 90, aimed at establishing secure overnight parking programs for homeless community college students is unlikely to pass this legislative session. The bill was intended to provide safe spaces, along with bathroom and shower facilities, for a growing number of students living in their vehicles. A 2023 survey indicated that one in four California community college students has experienced homelessness. Despite support, the bill faced opposition from some college districts due to concerns about high implementation costs and feasibility.</p>

The initiative includes five new Defence Growth Deals targeting specific regions in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland for development in areas like marine autonomy, advanced materials, and cyber security. The government anticipates that this long-term investment could generate up to 50,000 new skilled jobs by 2035.

          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant revival, with tourism and business travel returning to pre-pandemic levels. The city's unique position under the "one country, two systems" framework is seen as a benefit, allowing it to host international events like a major Bitcoin conference that would be unlikely in mainland China. The piece points to a booming IPO market, which raised seven times more funds in the first half of the year compared to the previous year, as a key indicator of economic vitality. The author suggests Beijing should further support this by encouraging international engagement.</p>

          <p>Coastal California is set to experience a significant drop in temperatures, with forecasts predicting weather 5 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of year. An upper-level low-pressure system is bringing cooler air, thick marine fog, and the possibility of light showers to regions from the Bay Area down to Los Angeles. This comes as a disappointment to Bay Area residents who endured an unusually cold summer, while Southern California gets a break from recent heat waves. The cool coastal weather contrasts with monsoonal conditions in some inland areas that have seen lightning storms.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly rejected the characterization of the Trump administration's trade tariffs as a tax on American consumers. In an interview, Bessent dismissed concerns from major companies about rising costs, pointing to strong GDP growth and stock market performance as evidence of a healthy economy. His comments follow a federal appeals court ruling that found the president overstepped his authority in imposing the tariffs, a decision the administration is appealing to the Supreme Court. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics has shown a loss of 42,000 manufacturing jobs since the tariffs were announced. (not investment advice)</p>

Marshall, a former OB-GYN, argued that not every person needs every vaccine and that parents and doctors should be empowered to make individual decisions. He expressed distrust in the CDC stemming from its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic but also credited the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed with saving lives. He specifically questioned the necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are warning the government against watering down its proposed Employment Rights Bill, which is expected to become law soon. Union leaders, including the general secretary of Unison, have voiced concerns that recent cabinet changes, including the departure of Angela Rayner, may signal a reduced commitment to the bill's full implementation. The legislation is set to introduce significant new protections for workers, such as a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts. While unions are preparing to campaign against any dilution of the bill, business groups see the reshuffle as an opportunity to address their concerns with the legislation.</p>

          <p>John L. Burton, a formidable and outspoken liberal force in California politics for over six decades, has passed away at the age of 92. As a lawmaker in the Assembly and Congress, and later as the powerful leader of the state Senate, Burton championed progressive causes, including welfare, foster care, and civil rights. Known for his pro-labor stance and colorful, expletive-laden language, he was a key figure in the Democratic machine that shaped San Francisco and state politics. After overcoming addiction, he returned to public service and later founded a nonprofit to advocate for foster youth.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted an event for Republican lawmakers to debut the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, which he dubbed the "Rose Garden Club." The redesign, which features a more manicured, patio-like appearance, quickly became a subject of discussion and criticism on social media. Online commentators unfavorably compared the new look to the outdoor seating area of a chain restaurant. The event itself featured a formal dinner and a speech from the president, but much of the public reaction focused on the aesthetic changes to the historic garden.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced that approximately 300 of its citizens detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia will be released and flown home. The raid, part of a nationwide anti-immigration campaign, saw nearly 500 workers arrested and has reportedly strained diplomatic relations between the two allied nations. South Korean officials expressed dismay over the raid, particularly given recent high-level meetings focused on increasing South Korean investment in the U.S. The incident has prompted calls in South Korea to streamline visa access for its workers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated in an interview that President Donald Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska "gave Putin what he wanted." Zelenskyy argued that the Russian president's primary goal was to secure a high-profile meeting with his U.S. counterpart to project strength, and that this was achieved. His comments came just before Russia launched a record aerial assault on Ukraine. Zelenskyy reiterated his belief that ending the war requires increased pressure on Russia from the U.S. and European allies, particularly by ending the purchase of Russian energy, which he called Putin's "weapon."</p>

          <p>The Universal Postal Union (UPU) reports that postal traffic to the United States has dropped by 81% following the Trump administration's suspension of the "de minimis" trade rule. This rule had previously allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country without being subject to tariffs. The administration ended the exemption to combat illicit goods and reduce the trade deficit, but the move has caused at least 88 national postal operators to suspend some services to the U.S. The UPU is now working on a technical solution to help restore the flow of international mail.</p>

          <p>President Trump has intensified his threats to deploy federal forces to Chicago, sharing a social media post that referenced the "Department of WAR" and an "Apocalypse Now" parody image. While he later told reporters it was "common sense" to "clean up our cities," the rhetoric has drawn sharp condemnation from Illinois leaders, who accuse him of threatening an American city. The threats follow the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. An internal memo indicates the Department of Homeland Security has already requested space for federal agents at a naval base near Chicago.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes the Trump administration's recent military actions against alleged drug traffickers, arguing it turns a failed metaphor into a dangerous reality. The piece condemns the use of military force and extrajudicial killings as a counterproductive strategy that undermines due process and international cooperation. The editorial suggests that designating cartels as terrorist groups sets a dangerous precedent for unilateral military action without oversight. Instead, the article advocates for addressing the root causes of drug demand within the U.S. and focusing on financial disruption and stemming the flow of American arms to cartels.</p>
