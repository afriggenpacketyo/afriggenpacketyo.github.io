          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI, accusing them of monopolistic collaboration that stifles competition for his Grok AI chatbot. The suit claims Apple unfairly favors ChatGPT in its App Store, denying rivals essential user engagement for development. Given Apple's significant smartphone market share and OpenAI's dominance in AI chatbots, xAI argues their partnership illegally locks up markets. This legal challenge is pivotal, as it represents a first opportunity for US courts to define the AI market and apply antitrust principles, potentially shaping the future of artificial intelligence innovation and competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvador native, has been taken into ICE custody for deportation to Uganda, days after his release from federal human smuggling charges. Previously, he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and held in prison for months before returning to the U.S. His attorneys filed a new lawsuit challenging his confinement and potential deportation, leading a Maryland district court to temporarily halt his removal. The Department of Homeland Security alleges Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, which his family denies, while his legal team suggests the Uganda deportation threat is a tactic to coerce a guilty plea. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Governor Wes Moore have advocated for his due process.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken challenges the traditional "sit up straight" advice for posture, asserting that a dynamic approach is far more beneficial for back health. He outlines three crucial guidelines: prioritize continuous movement throughout the day rather than staying in one fixed position; focus on building core and back strength through gentle exercises like yoga, rather than striving for stiffness; and recognize the significant impact of mindset, stress, and psychological well-being on physical pain. This holistic perspective suggests that addressing mental and emotional factors is as important as physical adjustments for improving and maintaining overall back health.</p>

          <p>The UK government has approved a plan to enable about 40 students from Gaza to pursue funded university scholarships in the UK in the coming weeks. Nine students will be supported by the government's Chevening scheme, and approximately 30 others holding private scholarships will also receive assistance. This initiative represents the first opportunity for Gazan students to leave the territory for UK studies since the 2023 Hamas-Israel conflict. The process faces considerable logistical hurdles, including securing Israeli permission for each student's departure and facilitating visa biometric checks in a third country, underscoring the complexities of humanitarian evacuations from a conflict zone.</p>

          <p>Food price inflation in the UK has climbed to 4.2% this month, the highest in 18 months, primarily driven by the increasing costs of chocolate, butter, and eggs. This rise, confirmed by the British Retail Consortium, reflects global supply costs, seasonal food inflation, and higher labor expenses. Poor cocoa harvests, exacerbated by climate change and crop disease, are specifically blamed for the surge in chocolate prices. As household budgets face pressure, consumers are advised to reassess spending. The broader UK inflation rate also saw an uptick, with food prices having increased by approximately 37% over the past five years.</p>

          <p>A BBC study reveals that UK local councils are grappling with a combined debt of £122 billion, equivalent to £1,700 per resident, which grew by 7% last year. To manage these spiraling deficits, councils are resorting to selling off public assets, including schools, care homes, and sports clubs, a practice usually disallowed for funding day-to-day services. Dr. Jonathan Carr-West of the LGIU warns this "payday loans for local government" approach erodes public value. The government acknowledges the "broken" funding system and is pursuing reforms, but councils like Croydon, facing massive debt, argue that current support merely adds to borrowing costs, necessitating a debt write-off.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has responded to significant customer backlash following its contemporary country redesign efforts, acknowledging that the company "could've done a better job sharing who we are." The 56-year-old chain's modernization push, including a minimalist logo and updated interiors, aimed to attract new generations while retaining classic elements like rocking chairs and fireplaces. Despite CEO Julie Felss Masino's assurances that the "soul of Cracker Barrel's not changing," critics voiced displeasure on social media, and the company's stock dropped. Cracker Barrel now vows to maintain its core values of "hard work, family, and scratch-cooked food" and keep beloved traditional features.</p>

Cramer reiterated his belief in the necessity of Nvidia's chips for the "hyperscaler arms race" in generative artificial intelligence, despite concerns about demand. He cautioned against attempting to time the market by selling and re-buying these major stocks, asserting their inevitable return to growth. This perspective encourages conviction over speculative trading in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that while President Trump focuses on resolving the Ukraine conflict, China is subtly extending its influence across Eurasia, a region historically deemed crucial for global power. Trump's tariff policies have inadvertently fostered closer economic ties between China and India, its regional rival, and solidified Russia's role as a major energy exporter to China. These shifts indicate a broader strategic realignment within Eurasia, potentially diminishing American influence over time. The article argues that these geopolitical dynamics underscore China's quiet ascent in a region once considered the key to global dominance, reshaping international power balances.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed reverting the Department of Defense's name to its pre-1940s title, the Department of War, arguing the current name is "too defensive." He suggested the change would reflect a desire to be "offensive, too, if we have to be," citing America's historical military successes under the old moniker. Trump believes the change could happen soon and without Congressional approval, though the original renaming was a legislative act. This move follows previous hints and aligns with his broader rhetoric on national security and projecting strength, prompting discussion on the symbolic and practical implications of such a change for the US military's image.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, incarcerated for the 1989 murders of his parents, was denied parole by California officials after a comprehensive hearing. The parole panel determined he still poses an "unreasonable risk of danger to society," primarily citing his prison conduct, which includes multiple policy violations since 2013, contrary to claims of being a model prisoner. Despite expressions of love and forgiveness from his family, who supported his release, Menendez must now wait three years for his next hearing. The panel empathized with the brothers' long-standing allegations of sexual assault and abuse but concluded that their actions did not warrant release.</p>

The annual Han Kuang war games now feature urban warfare scenarios, while nationwide civil defense drills practice evacuations and emergency responses.

Despite a post-pandemic high in housing inventory, high prices and mortgage rates continue to deter buyers, leading to stagnant home sales. This phenomenon reflects sellers' lingering expectations from the COVID-19 housing boom and their preference to wait for better conditions rather than accept lower offers. (not investment advice)</p>

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has urged accelerated drone adoption, and the US has proposed a "hellscape" drone strategy for Taiwan.
