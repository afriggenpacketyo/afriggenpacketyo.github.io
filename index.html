        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secondary sanctions are a foreign policy tool primarily used by the United States to influence third-party countries and entities that conduct business with a sanctioned nation. Unlike primary sanctions, which restrict a country's own citizens, secondary sanctions leverage the dominance of the U.S. dollar and financial system to pressure others into compliance, threatening to cut off their access to American markets. The article notes their past use against Iran and Venezuela, but also highlights their limitations, as they can be difficult to enforce, risk retaliation, and can be circumvented through alternative currencies or shell companies, making their effectiveness a subject of debate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study reveals that 60% of workers in Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure higher than many regional peers. This trend is attributed to a combination of high inflation outpacing wage growth, expensive housing, and a cultural shift among younger generations prioritizing lifestyle experiences over long-term savings. Experts note that while macroeconomic factors make saving objectively harder, increased consumerism and the use of 'buy now, pay later' services also contribute to the financial strain.

          <p>This article explores the origins of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who, even before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, recognized a critical gap in the Constitution regarding what should happen if a president becomes unable to serve. The amendment provides a clear framework for the transfer of power, a crucial element for maintaining governmental stability during a crisis. The piece delves into the historical context and the dedicated mission to get this vital amendment ratified.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' forecasts of 0.1% growth, according to preliminary data from the Office for National Statistics. This growth was primarily driven by the services sector, although it represents a slowdown from the 0.7% expansion seen in the first quarter. Despite the positive figures, economists express caution, suggesting the momentum is unlikely to continue due to a softening labor market and persistent inflation pressures. The data comes shortly after the Bank of England's recent decision to cut interest rates to 4% to address these economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reported the detention of a Peruvian man in Washington, D.C., after he allegedly threatened to harm himself with a butcher knife during a stop. The incident occurred when federal officers approached the man's food truck on National Park Service property. According to ICE, the individual briefly barricaded himself inside the vehicle before being apprehended and will now be held pending a deportation decision. The event is framed within the context of President Trump's recent initiative to increase federal law enforcement presence to address crime in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>An accident at Coney Beach Pleasure Park in Porthcawl, Wales, resulted in minor injuries for thirteen children and one adult. The incident occurred on the 'Wacky Worm' roller coaster when a cart reportedly derailed from the track, causing a metal railing to fall. Eyewitnesses described hearing a loud bang and seeing children screaming as adults rushed to help them off the ride. The park was subsequently closed to allow for an investigation by police and health and safety officials into the third-party owned ride.</p>

          <p>South Korea's highest court has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, the creator of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the Supreme Court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The court determined that both versions are based on a traditional American summer camp chant that is in the public domain, concluding a long-running legal dispute over the globally popular tune.</p>

          <p>More than 115 education scholars have signed an open letter condemning the Harvard Education Publishing Group for canceling a special issue of the Harvard Educational Review focused on Palestine. The scholars argue the move constitutes censorship and anti-Palestinian discrimination, aimed at silencing academic examination of the ongoing conflict. The publisher abruptly scrapped the issue, citing concerns over the review process, but editors and contributors contend it was due to fears of antisemitism claims and political pressure. This incident is highlighted as an example of the 'Palestine exception' to academic freedom amid broader pressures on US universities.</p>

Speaking on his new BBC podcast, Rooney described the criticism from Brady, a part-owner of the club, as "very unfair." He explained that Brady's single visit to the training ground was on a lighter day before a game and that the NFL's intense, shorter season is fundamentally different from the year-round demands of football.

          <p>A coalition of more than 100 humanitarian groups, including Oxfam and Médecins Sans Frontières, has issued a joint letter demanding that Israel stop the "weaponization of aid" into Gaza amid deepening starvation. The organizations state that since new Israeli regulations were introduced in March, they have been increasingly denied authorization to deliver lifesaving supplies, with dozens of requests rejected. The rules reportedly allow aid to be blocked if groups are seen to "delegitimize" Israel, a condition the NGOs argue compromises their independence. Israel denies restricting aid, stating the rules are for security and to prevent supplies from reaching Hamas.</p>

          <p>A federal court hearing has concluded for a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe are suing to shut down the facility, arguing its construction violated federal law by proceeding without an environmental impact assessment. A key issue in the case is determining who has ultimate control over the site—the state of Florida or the federal government—as this dictates whether federal environmental laws apply. Lawyers for the state and the Trump administration claim it is a state-run facility, while plaintiffs argue its sole function of immigration detention makes it a federal action.</p>

          <p>A New York man has been federally charged with cyberstalking a relative of Brian Thompson, the UnitedHealthcare CEO who was fatally shot in December 2024. Prosecutors allege that 40-year-old Shane Daley left multiple threatening voicemails for the family member just hours after the killing. In the messages, Daley allegedly expressed glee over the shooting, stating it was justified and that Thompson's children deserved to die in a similar way. Daley was arrested and has been released with GPS monitoring ahead of his next court appearance, facing up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing the regulatory process for commercial space launches in the United States. The order directs the Department of Transportation to eliminate or expedite environmental reviews and cancel outdated rules for launch and reentry vehicles. The White House stated that inefficient permitting discourages investment and limits the competitiveness of U.S. companies like SpaceX. However, environmental groups have criticized the move, warning that it puts people and wildlife at risk by deregulating an industry known for powerful and sometimes explosive rocket tests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline corresponds with a growing belief, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Researchers suggest that increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks, such as cancer, is a key driver. The trend is most pronounced among women and young people, with factors like cost and a shift in social norms also potentially contributing to the decline in consumption.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that sunscreens in mousse form may not be effective at protecting users from harmful UV rays. The agency sent warning letters to five companies, including popular brands Supergoop! and Vacation Inc., stating their products are unapproved over-the-counter drugs. The FDA also raised concerns that the products are packaged in containers resembling whipped cream cans, which could mislead consumers and lead to accidental ingestion. The companies have been given 15 days to address the violations identified by the agency.</p>

          <p>The Xiluodu dam, China's third-largest hydropower station, has ceased using Western-made industrial chips in its control systems due to national security concerns. The programmable logic controllers (PLCs), previously supplied by companies like Siemens and Schneider Electric, have been replaced with domestically produced alternatives. This move reflects growing alarm in China over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks, referencing historical examples like the Stuxnet virus, which allegedly targeted Siemens PLCs in Iran's nuclear program. The dam has a total installed capacity of 13.86 gigawatts, making its operational security a high priority.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the family of David Barnes, an American detained in Russia, is hopeful for a prisoner exchange. Barnes has been held in Moscow since January 2022 and is serving a 21.5-year sentence on child abuse charges that were investigated and dismissed in his home state of Texas. His sister expressed hope that improved U.S.-Russia relations could lead to his release, urging his case to be designated as a wrongful detention.

Biden made the comment during a recent interview, attributing it to a since-retracted article.

On the night of August 14-15, 1945, US B-29 bombers dropped napalm that killed over 260 people and destroyed nearly 75% of the city. Survivors recount the horror of the raid, which many now view as an "utterly foolish" act given the war's imminent end.

          <p>U.S. National Guard troops have been deployed on the streets of Washington D.C. following President Trump's order to address what he calls "out of control" crime. The move, which also places the city's police force under federal control, has been met with strong opposition from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who labeled it an "authoritarian push." While the White House reports numerous arrests for various offenses, city data shows that violent crime has actually been on a downward trend. The deployment of 800 troops and 500 federal agents marks a significant federal intervention in the capital's local affairs.</p>
