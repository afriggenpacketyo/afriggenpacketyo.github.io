          <p>London Southend Airport has suspended all flights after a private aircraft crashed upon takeoff, resulting in a large fireball. The Dutch company Zeusch Aviation confirmed its plane was involved in the accident, which occurred as it was departing for the Netherlands. Witnesses described the plane banking sharply and inverting before it hit the ground, and authorities have not yet confirmed the number of casualties. The Air Accident Investigation Branch is working with Essex Police to investigate the cause of the crash.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed U.S. concerns that China's military could leverage his company's advanced chips, arguing that China cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. Speaking ahead of a trip to China, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to establishing American technology as a global standard. Despite billions in potential losses for Nvidia due to these restrictions, Huang is navigating the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing to maintain market access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession, largely driven by a 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. This growth is partly attributed to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential U.S. tariff extensions, a boost that economists warn may fade. While the performance beat expectations, the Ministry of Trade and Industry maintains a cautious outlook, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks from global trade policies.

          <h2>China Signals Renewed Focus on Curbing Excessive Domestic Market Competition</h2>

          <p>China's top leadership is signaling a new policy focus on regulating "disorderly and low-price competition" within its domestic market, raising concerns about what is known as neijuan, or involution. This echoes the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" but occurs in a different economic landscape with weaker growth and a larger role for private firms. The government aims to guide enterprises toward improving quality and facilitating the exit of outdated production capacity to address the issue of excessive competition yielding diminishing returns.</p>

          <p>The death toll from historic flash floods in central Texas has surpassed 130, including at least 27 children from a summer camp, with over 160 people still missing. Search operations have been periodically suspended as new storms bring more heavy rain to the flood-ravaged region. The disaster is being linked to a "toxic cocktail" of factors, including a climate crisis-fueled extreme weather event and the understaffing of federal agencies like the National Weather Service following budget cuts.</p>

However, the FAA clarified that it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition that would warrant a mandatory Airworthiness Directive for any Boeing models.</p>

The tiny pests, which feed on the adhesives in book bindings, have burrowed into a significant portion of the library's collection. To eradicate them, restoration workers are placing the books in an oxygen-free nitrogen environment for six weeks, a process they hope will preserve centuries of cultural and historical heritage threatened by the insects.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG have rapidly captured approximately 10% of the market share in Norway, the world's most EV-friendly country. This growth is notable as Norway, which is not an EU member, has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the U.S. and EU. Analysts attribute the success of these brands to their competitive pricing, advanced technology, and the fact that Norway serves as an accessible entry point into the European market for new manufacturers.</p>

At Purplebricks, a whistleblower alleged that staff were incentivized to secure price reductions on properties that were deliberately overvalued to win business in the first place.</p>
