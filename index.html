          <p>Israeli troops reportedly killed at least 32 Palestinians and wounded dozens more who were seeking food from distribution centers in southern Gaza. Witnesses described indiscriminate fire from tanks and drones, while hospital officials reported most victims were shot in the head and chest. The incident occurred near hubs operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a group backed by the U.S. and Israel as an alternative to U.N. aid distribution. The Israeli military stated it fired warning shots after suspects approached troops in a closed area, denying any incidents occurred at the aid sites themselves.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent during a homeless encampment sweep. The lawsuit alleges city employees failed to check if tents were occupied before clearing the area ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. holiday festivities. Taylor’s death sparked local outrage and a temporary halt to encampment clearings, although the city has since resumed them. The family's lawyers are seeking unspecified damages and calling for more humane treatment of the city's unhoused population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped. While performing her song "Roar" suspended over the audience, the prop malfunctioned, causing a brief but startling dip. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. The incident highlights the risks associated with complex aerial stunts commonly used in modern large-scale concert productions, similar to a recent issue on Beyoncé's tour.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested Jose Luis Mendoza-Gonzalez, a Mexican national, in connection with the death of a 37-year-old Illinois woman. He is accused of decapitating Megan Bos and storing her body in a bleach-filled container in his yard for nearly two months. Mendoza-Gonzalez was initially arrested and charged with concealing and abusing a corpse but was released from custody by a local judge. His subsequent release sparked criticism from local officials, who cited public safety risks and the possibility of him fleeing the country.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, visited the Christian village of Taybeh in the occupied West Bank to condemn an arson attack on the ancient Church of Saint George. Residents blame extremist Israeli settlers for the fire, which occurred amid a surge of violence in the region since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Huckabee, typically a staunch supporter of Israel, called the desecration of a place of worship an "act of terror" and demanded that the perpetrators be prosecuted. The visit underscores growing international concern over rising settler violence against Palestinians and their property.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit seeking at least $20 billion in damages against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit claims the newspaper published a false and defamatory story about a "bawdy" birthday letter allegedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. Trump has denied the letter's authenticity, labeling it a "FAKE." The lawsuit faces a high legal standard, as public figures must prove "actual malice" to win defamation cases in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Health and trading standards officials are expressing growing concern over the use of nicotine pouches, or "snus," among young people in the UK. The products, which are currently unregulated by age, are reportedly causing significant gum damage and leading to nicotine addiction in users as young as 11. Despite being less harmful than smoking, the high nicotine content and lack of regulation pose risks. A proposed Tobacco and Vapes Bill aims to make it illegal to sell these pouches to minors, addressing a legal loophole that allows their widespread availability.</p>

          <p>An investigation has revealed that solar panels installed in English schools under the government's "Great British Energy" initiative were made by Chinese firms. The program, promoted as a project "for the British people," sourced panels from companies Aiko and Longi. This has drawn criticism due to concerns over alleged forced labor in China's solar panel supply chains, particularly in the Xinjiang region. While the companies deny using forced labor, the situation highlights the UK's reliance on cheaper Chinese products and the ethical complexities of global supply chains in the renewable energy sector.</p>

          <p>Drivers at UK airports, such as Edinburgh, are increasingly avoiding expensive "kiss-and-fly" drop-off zones by waiting in nearby lay-bys and side streets. Research shows that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased these fees, with some charging as much as £6 or £7 for a brief 10-minute stop. This practice forces drivers to coordinate pick-ups via phone and rush to collection points to avoid fines. The situation highlights consumer frustration with what many perceive as extortionate charges for a basic service that is often free at major European airports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue a shorter break could help reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and mitigate "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, stress the need for a long break to recharge and plan, and some fear it could concentrate vacation demand, driving up prices. The discussion reflects a broader re-evaluation of the school calendar in response to modern economic and social pressures.</p>

          <p>The global demand for lithium, essential for batteries in electric cars and renewable energy storage, is causing an environmental crisis in Chile's Atacama Desert. Indigenous communities report that intensive lithium mining, which involves pumping vast amounts of brine from beneath salt flats, is drying up wetlands, harming local flora, and disrupting wildlife, including flamingo populations. While the transition to green energy drives this demand, locals argue they are paying the environmental price with water shortages and ecosystem damage.

Critics warn this could backfire if new investors face market volatility, while others point out the need to address the gender gap in investing.

His departure is part of a wider staffing shakeup in Hegseth's office following a scandal involving the sharing of sensitive military plans on the Signal messaging app. In a statement, the Pentagon thanked Fulcher for his service, while Fulcher stated he had completed his planned six months of government service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and is threatening to end the partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. The move is a response to the Mexican government's actions that forced airlines to relocate from Mexico City's main airport, which the U.S. argues violates a trade agreement and unfairly benefits Mexican carriers. Under the new rules, all Mexican airlines must seek U.S. government approval for their flight schedules. The dispute could impact the more than 40 million passengers who fly between the two countries annually. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a case of mistaken identity, his sister is making a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the killing. Mohammed Ali Ege, one of Europe's most wanted men, has been on the run for years after escaping custody in India. Aamir's sister, Nishat Siddiqi, urged Ege to hand himself in, stating he is "not truly free" while living a life of exile. Aamir was stabbed to death in his Cardiff home in 2010 by two contract killers who went to the wrong address.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy kept his chances for an Open Championship victory alive with an eventful third-round 66, leaving him tied for fourth. His day included a bizarre incident where his shot from the rough dislodged another golf ball that had been buried underground, leading to a bogey. However, he immediately recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the next hole, thrilling the supportive home crowd at Portrush. Despite the rollercoaster round, McIlroy finished the day six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler but feels he has given himself "half a chance" for a final-day charge.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on a stronger European security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, known as the "E3." This shift, marked by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about the United States' commitment to NATO under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK could supplement, or even one day replace, the US security guarantee for Europe. The cooperation aims to bolster European defense independence and cohesion.</p>

For Rashford, the move represents a chance to revitalize his career at a top European club. The deal is seen as a low-risk opportunity for Barcelona to acquire a talented player who, if motivated, could be a major asset.</p>

While Australia scored late tries after the Lions made substitutions, their comeback was too late to threaten the result.

          <p>A report from Bank of America has made a striking comparison, suggesting that quantum computing could represent the most significant human breakthrough since the discovery of fire. Analysts argue the technology's ability to perform incredibly complex calculations at near-instant speeds could "warp-speed human knowledge and development." They predict it could revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and logistics, and could also turbocharge the development of artificial intelligence. While major milestones have been achieved, a quantum computer has not yet solved a practical, real-world problem faster than a classical computer. (not investment advice)</p>
