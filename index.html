          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated on September 10, drew tens of thousands of supporters to a stadium in Arizona. President Trump delivered a headline speech, calling Kirk a "martyr for American freedom" and diverging from a message of forgiveness offered by Kirk's widow, Erika. The event, which featured numerous high-profile conservative figures and Trump administration officials, blended the atmosphere of a political rally with a religious service, emphasizing Kirk's legacy and faith. Speakers cast his death as a galvanizing moment for the conservative movement in America.</p>

          <p>During their Sunday night game against the Kansas City Chiefs, New York Giants fans at MetLife Stadium began chanting "We want Dart," calling for backup quarterback Jaxson Dart to replace starter Russell Wilson. The chants grew louder after Wilson threw his second interception of the game and continued as the offense struggled to score in the second half. Head coach Brian Daboll acknowledged the fans' frustration, stating he would be booing as well, but expressed continued confidence in Wilson. The game highlighted the mounting pressure on the veteran quarterback as the team's offense failed to find its rhythm against a tough opponent.</p>

          <p>Christian Horner has officially left his role as team principal of the Red Bull Formula 1 team, agreeing to a severance deal reportedly worth 60 million euros (£52 million). His departure follows a controversial period that began with allegations of sexual harassment, which he was cleared of, but which exposed a power struggle within the team. Horner had led the team since its inception in 2005, overseeing numerous championships. His exit comes after a decline in the team's competitiveness and the departure of other key figures, including legendary designer Adrian Newey, signaling the end of an era for the dominant F1 constructor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to advise pregnant women to limit their use of Tylenol, linking the pain reliever to rising autism rates. This anticipated announcement follows President Trump's recent comments about making a "historic" statement on the issue. Scientific research on a causal link between acetaminophen (the drug in Tylenol) and autism is inconsistent and inconclusive, with medical experts and the drug's maker, Kenvue, cautioning against the claim. Major medical groups still consider acetaminophen one of the only safe pain relief options during pregnancy, highlighting the complexity of autism's causes.</p>

This marks the first visit by House members to China since 2019 and is part of an effort to re-establish military communication channels, which were severed in 2022. The U.S. delegation expressed a desire to open lines of communication on peace and security and to recalibrate the bilateral relationship on diplomatic, economic, and security fronts.

          <p>Reform UK has announced a new immigration plan that would abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), the right for migrants to gain permanent settlement in the UK after five years. Under the proposal, migrants, including many already in the country, would need to reapply for visas every five years under stricter criteria, such as higher salary thresholds. The party, led by Nigel Farage, also plans to restrict welfare access to British citizens only, claiming the measures would save billions. The proposal is part of a broader strategy to address the 3.8 million people who entered the UK under rules established after Brexit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by sociologist Christina Cross, "Inherited Inequality," challenges the long-held belief that promoting two-parent families is a primary solution to racial inequality. Her research reveals that Black children raised in two-parent households still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts and fare only about as well as white children from single-parent homes. Cross argues that the singular focus on family structure, which has influenced decades of policy, overlooks the persistent impact of structural racism on resources like income and wealth. She suggests that resources might be better spent on direct economic support rather than marriage promotion initiatives.</p>

After an inconsistent start to the season, Williams showcased the explosive talent that made him a first-overall draft pick, throwing for four touchdowns and avoiding any sacks for the first time in his professional career. The performance was a crucial validation for the partnership between Williams and new head coach Ben Johnson, whose offensive scheme finally clicked. While the Cowboys' defense is struggling, the game offered a glimpse of the Bears' potential and provided a much-needed sense of optimism for the long-suffering franchise.</p>

          <p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds are both popular investment vehicles, but they have key differences in trading, tax efficiency, and cost that investors should understand. ETFs trade like stocks on an exchange throughout the day, while mutual funds are priced once at the end of the day. A significant advantage for ETFs held in taxable accounts is their tax efficiency, as their structure rarely generates the capital gains distributions common with mutual funds. Furthermore, ETFs generally have lower annual fees, or expense ratios, than their mutual fund counterparts, making them a cheaper option for many investors.</p>

Many strategists and elected officials acknowledge the need to win back working-class voters but have largely focused on changing communication styles rather than adopting more moderate stances on topics like immigration or transgender rights. This reluctance is attributed to the fear of backlash from the party's activist base and the political risks of primary challenges in safe districts.

The Fed's emergency lending authority, which has few legal limits, could be used as a slush fund to direct money to favored businesses or political priorities. Furthermore, as the nation's primary financial regulator, the Fed has the power to effectively "debank" individuals or organizations by cutting off their access to the financial system. These powers, combined with broad judicial deference to the Fed, could grant the administration an unprecedented tool for political influence.</p>

          <p>Achieving a retirement income of $12,000 per month, or $144,000 annually, requires a substantial nest egg, significantly higher than the average American's savings. Using the standard 4% withdrawal rule, a retiree would need approximately $3.6 million in savings to generate this level of income. However, factors like inflation and longevity risk mean the actual number could be even higher to maintain purchasing power over a multi-decade retirement. The article highlights the challenge of planning for a comfortable, upper-middle-class retirement, contrasting this target with the median retirement income of around $55,000 per year.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has indicated he is open to resuming negotiations with the United States, provided that Washington abandons its demand for complete denuclearization. Speaking to the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim stated that if the U.S. seeks peaceful coexistence based on the "recognition of reality," there is no reason not to engage in dialogue, and he mentioned having good memories of President Trump. This statement represents one of his clearest signals for reviving diplomacy, which has been stalled since 2019. Kim also emphasized that North Korea's status as a nuclear state is irreversible and constitutionally enshrined for survival.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights that kindergartners are the most likely students in California to be chronically absent, a problem that can have lasting negative effects on literacy and educational development. In Los Angeles Unified School District, nearly one-third of Latino kindergartners were chronically absent last year. Focus groups with parents revealed that while they value education, they struggle with issues like childhood illnesses and difficult transitions to the school environment, and are often unclear on attendance policies. The report recommends better communication from schools and support for families to address the root causes of these early-grade absences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tangier Island, a small, isolated crabbing community in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay, could be uninhabitable within 25 to 30 years due to accelerating sea level rise and land subsidence. The island has already lost two-thirds of its landmass since 1850, and its population is dwindling as young people leave. Climate change is exacerbating the problem with more frequent and intense storms, threatening a unique way of life that has existed for centuries. While some protective measures like a seawall have been installed, experts estimate a comprehensive plan to save the island would cost between $250 to $350 million, a sum far beyond the community's means.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved an implantable device that uses electrical pulses to treat rheumatoid arthritis in patients who do not respond to medication. The device, made by SetPoint Medical, stimulates the vagus nerve in the neck, which sends signals to the brain and spleen to reduce the production of inflammatory proteins called cytokines. While not a cure for all, a clinical trial showed that 35% of patients in a difficult-to-treat group experienced meaningful improvement in their symptoms. This approval marks a potential turning point for treating autoimmune diseases by leveraging the body's own neural pathways to control inflammation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials are refusing to publicly release a taxpayer-funded seismic safety report for the Gas Co. Tower, a 52-story skyscraper they recently purchased for $200 million. This decision leaves the public and employees in the dark about the building's potential vulnerabilities in a major earthquake and whether costly retrofits are necessary. The tower was constructed with a type of steel frame that showed unexpected weaknesses during the 1994 Northridge earthquake. While county officials insist the building is safe, some structural engineers warn it could be rendered unusable after a large quake without significant upgrades.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducting an aggressive recruitment campaign targeting local police officers, offering six-figure salaries and large signing bonuses to expand its force of deportation officers. The agency has relaxed hiring requirements and is using advertisements that specifically appeal to officers in sanctuary cities. This push comes as both ICE and local police departments across the country struggle with significant staffing shortages. While the generous compensation is attractive, particularly in lower-income states, the effort has sparked resentment among some law enforcement leaders who are trying to retain their own officers.</p>

          <p>Following the destructive Eaton and Palisades fires, a massive federal cleanup operation has been praised for its record speed, clearing nearly 12,000 properties in just eight months. However, many experts and residents now worry that this rapid pace led to lax oversight and potential safety compromises, particularly as officials skipped soil testing for toxic metals. Independent testing by university researchers and journalists has since found elevated levels of lead at properties already declared clear by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This has left homeowners concerned about the safety of their land as they begin the rebuilding process.</p>

This summer, Homeland Security deployed the drones over anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles, marking the first such use since the 2020 George Floyd protests. These high-altitude aircraft are equipped with advanced surveillance technology, including infrared sensors and AI-powered tracking, capable of monitoring scores of individuals.
