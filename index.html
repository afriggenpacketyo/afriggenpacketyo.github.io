          <p>Nearly 2,000 researchers penned an open letter criticizing the Trump administration's actions against scientific inquiry, citing funding cuts, scientist firings, and data access restrictions.  The letter, signed by members of the National Academies, expresses concern over the potential long-term damage to U.S. scientific leadership.  Specific examples cited include the cancellation of research grants on LGBTQ+ issues and layoffs across the Department of Health and Human Services. The White House has yet to respond to the letter.</p>

          <p>Democratic-backed Susan Crawford won Wisconsin's Supreme Court race, defeating Elon Musk-backed Brad Schimel.
