          <p>A 21-year-old Austrian man opened fire at a secondary school in Graz, Austria, killing nine students and a teacher before taking his own life. The incident, which occurred around 10:00 local time, prompted a large police response and a three-day national mourning period. The shooter, a former student who did not graduate, used legally owned weapons in the attack, and authorities are investigating a possible motive after finding a "farewell letter" and video at his home. Witnesses described scenes of panic and confusion as the shooting unfolded. The article highlights the devastating impact on the community and the ongoing investigation into the tragic event.</p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for upcoming elections, young candidates are advocating for increased political inclusion amidst challenges like entrenched party structures and financial limitations. With over half of Malawi's population under 35, youth involvement in politics is a significant issue, particularly with the addition of 35 new constituency seats. Despite the enthusiasm, many young entrants face obstacles, including party endorsements favoring established figures and limited resources for campaigning. Experts emphasize the need for political parties to create fair competition and for young people to develop robust strategies to succeed in the political arena.</p>

          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) has implemented a new rule allowing players to protect their rankings while undergoing fertility treatments. This policy enables players to take time off for procedures like egg freezing and return with a "Special Entry Ranking" based on their recent performance. The rule requires players to be out for at least 10 consecutive weeks and allows the protected ranking to be used for three tournaments upon their return. The WTA's move aims to support players balancing their careers and family planning.</p>

          <h2>AI Creativity Falls Short of Human Sensory Experience, Researchers Find</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 10:04:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that generative AI models struggle to represent concepts that rely on human senses, such as smell and touch, leading to "hollow and shallow" creativity. Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the sensory and motor experiences necessary to fully understand complex sensory meanings, like the concept of a flower. The study suggests that AI's limited ability to represent sensory concepts contributes to its lack of human-style creativity, as AI creates representations by analyzing patterns without personal experience.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's political team has reportedly approached Texas Republicans about redrawing the state's congressional map to protect the GOP's House majority. Discussions are preliminary, with potential targets including up to five Democratic-held seats, but concerns exist about legal challenges and potential Democratic gains. Redistricting before the next census would be unusual but not unprecedented in Texas, with the last instance occurring in 2003. Republicans currently hold a 220-212 majority in the U.S. House, making the Texas seats crucial for maintaining control.</p>

          <p>The European Union is evaluating whether a recent increase in Chinese exports to the bloc is a result of trade diversion caused by high US tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite a significant drop in Chinese shipments to the US and a surge in exports to EU countries like France and Germany, the European Commission states it's "too early to conclude" if this constitutes trade diversion. The EU is monitoring the situation with a new customs surveillance system, but needs more data to establish a trend and determine if EU industries are being harmed.</p>
