          <p>According to a senior Israeli political source, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet has approved a plan to expand the war in Gaza, involving occupying parts of Gaza's territory and displacing Palestinians to the south.

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to multiple labor disputes and a debt crisis, leaving some pilots to work as food delivery drivers. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting second- and third-tier cities. The suspension is primarily due to a lack of profitable routes, with high-speed rail increasingly replacing air travel for shorter distances.</p>
