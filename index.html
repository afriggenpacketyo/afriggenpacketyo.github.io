          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, country singer Gavin Adcock paid tribute to him during a concert in Missouri. Adcock led the audience in a "Charlie Kirk" chant while holding an American flag, telling the crowd that Kirk is "with Jesus." In a social media post sharing a video of the moment, Adcock stated that Kirk's voice is now stronger than ever and will make an impact for centuries. The tribute reflects a specific cultural and political reaction to the killing from within the conservative movement, framing Kirk as a martyr for his beliefs.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated that dozens of political prisoners recently freed as part of a U.S.-brokered deal were forcibly deported from the country. While the release of 52 prisoners to Lithuania was initially seen as a positive step, Tsikhanouskaya described the event not as freedom but as forced exile. Some former prisoners expressed gratitude for the deal, brokered by the Trump administration, but others noted they were near the end of their sentences and would have preferred to remain in Belarus. The opposition is now urging Western governments to demand that President Lukashenko allow these individuals the right to return home.</p>

She declared that the cries of his widow will echo like a battle cry and that his death has ignited a fire within his supporters. Kirk thanked President Trump and Vice President Vance for their support and shared a poignant anecdote about explaining her husband's absence to their three-year-old daughter. Her speech positions her to take on a more prominent role in his Turning Point USA organization, ensuring his work continues.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 21:10:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Missouri state legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan that heavily favors the Republican party, potentially creating an additional GOP-leaning seat. The map, which now awaits the governor's signature, redesigns the Kansas City area district currently held by Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver to be more conservative. This move is part of a broader, Trump-backed mid-decade redistricting effort by Republicans in states like Texas to solidify their narrow House majority ahead of midterm elections. Opponents immediately filed a lawsuit, arguing the new map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that violates state requirements for compact districts.</p>

          <p>A new Harvard study has found a significant correlation between experiences of violence and cardiovascular health in women. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses for two decades, revealed that women who had been stalked had a 41% higher risk of heart disease. The risk was even greater, at 70% higher, for women who had obtained a restraining order against someone. Researchers adjusted for other factors like diet and exercise, concluding that the stress from these traumatic experiences is a distinct risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of women's health.</p>

          <p>As autumn begins, several celestial events will be visible in the night sky, providing opportunities for stargazers. The season officially starts with the astronomical equinox on September 22, when day and night are nearly equal in length. Key events include Saturn reaching its opposition on September 21, making it appear at its biggest and brightest for the year and visible to the naked eye. Additionally, the Orionid meteor shower, originating from Halley's Comet, will be active from early October to early November, peaking around October 22 under ideal viewing conditions due to a new moon.</p>

          <p>In Austria, three nuns in their 80s have defied church authorities by leaving the care home they were placed in and returning to their historic convent near Salzburg. Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita claim they were moved against their will after their religious community was dissolved and the building was taken over by the Archdiocese. With the help of former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their former apartments, which had been left without electricity or water. Despite the archdiocese calling their return "incomprehensible," the nuns are determined to live out their days in their lifelong home.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, artificial intelligence tools, particularly X's chatbot Grok, rapidly spread false information and conspiracy theories. A CBS News analysis found numerous instances where Grok misidentified the suspect before an official announcement was made and generated altered images of the person of interest. Other AI systems, like Google's AI Overview and Perplexity, also produced inaccurate information, with one labeling the shooting a "hypothetical scenario." Experts warn that people tend to perceive AI as less biased than human sources, making the spread of AI-generated misinformation particularly dangerous during breaking news events.</p>

          <p>Political analysis suggests that conservative activist Charlie Kirk and his organization, Turning Point USA, played a crucial role in Donald Trump's improved performance among younger voters in the 2024 election. Kirk's strategy focused on engaging young men and persuading the Republican establishment to invest in youth outreach, which harmonized with Trump's use of platforms like TikTok and podcasts. Exit polling data indicates Trump performed better with voters under 30 than any Republican presidential candidate since 2004, particularly with young men. Kirk's efforts, including a multi-million dollar "Ballot Chasers" program, were credited by the Trump campaign as a significant factor in their victory.</p>

Nasser Faratawi stated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used his multi-story property as a base for an operation in a nearby refugee camp, leaving behind graffiti, destroyed furniture, and rotten food before the building was burned. The IDF told the BBC it was not aware of arson committed by its troops and that a complaint is under review.

The unclaimed funds include benefits like universal credit and pension credit, as well as local aid such as free school meals and social tariffs from utility providers. The primary barriers preventing people from accessing this help are identified as a lack of awareness, the complexity of the application process, and the stigma associated with receiving aid. While some progress has been made in increasing uptake for certain benefits, the report highlights a systemic issue of support not reaching those who are entitled to it.</p>

          <p>Sean Astin, widely known for his role as Samwise Gamgee in “The Lord of the Rings,” has been elected the new national president of SAG-AFTRA, the influential performers' union. Astin, who won with 79% of the vote, succeeds Fran Drescher, who led the union through a major strike in 2023. He will now lead the 160,000-member union as it prepares for new contract negotiations with major studios next year. Key challenges on the horizon include the impact of artificial intelligence, industry consolidation, and the movement of productions overseas, with Astin expressing optimism about securing a fair deal.</p>

          <p>A new report from House Republicans has identified approximately 50 joint academic programs between U.S. and Chinese universities as "high-risk" and is calling for them to be terminated. The report from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party targets partnerships like those between NYU and East China Normal University, and Johns Hopkins and Tsinghua University. Republicans argue these collaborations pose a threat to national security by potentially advancing Beijing's military and technological capabilities. This move represents a significant escalation in the effort to curb academic ties between the two countries amid growing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 rock-mockumentary, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast for one last concert but fails to recapture the magic of its predecessor. While seeing the clueless band members 40 years later provides some smiles, the film's concept of the band being revered by real-life music legends like Paul McCartney saps the satirical tension. The review suggests the movie feels more like a feature-length outtake reel, with gags that don't quite land and missed comedic opportunities. Ultimately, it serves as a nostalgia lap that confirms some classics are best left untouched.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to end humanitarian parole protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. This decision overturns a lower court's order that had temporarily blocked the move. The protections, established under the Biden administration, generally allowed these individuals to live and work in the U.S. for two years. The court acknowledged the risk of irreparable harm but stated it was not sufficient to halt the administration's action, marking a significant victory for President Trump's efforts to dismantle previous immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing giant engages in a pattern of discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims that Uber drivers routinely refuse service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for animal shedding, and fail to accommodate mobility devices. The government asserts that these actions have caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be left stranded. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination and takes action against drivers who violate its accessibility policies, but the DOJ is seeking $125 million for affected individuals.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Senate Bill 79, a landmark piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by allowing for denser housing construction near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, overrides local zoning laws to permit buildings up to nine stories tall adjacent to major transit stops like train and bus stations. Proponents argue the measure is essential for creating hundreds of thousands of new homes in existing communities. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local authorities of their control over responsible development.</p>
