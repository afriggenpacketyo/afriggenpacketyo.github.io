        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kemi Badenoch, a prominent Tory leader, addressed the Conservative Party's significant losses in recent English local elections, cautioning against the assumption that merely changing leadership would solve the party's deep-seated issues. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday program, Badenoch acknowledged the public's frustration and the Reform party's success, while emphasizing the need for a "slow and steady" plan focused on credible policies to regain government by the decade's end. She noted that Reform UK's gains reflected widespread dissatisfaction, but stressed that genuine solutions, not just vote-winning tactics, are essential for fixing the country's problems, while also noting that anything is feasible when asked about Reform UK's leader possibly becoming Prime Minister.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK is exploring legal avenues, including judicial reviews and injunctions, to challenge the government's placement of asylum seekers in hotels within areas now under its local council control. Party chairman Zia Yusuf stated that Reform councillors would use "every instrument of power available" to resist housing asylum seekers, citing concerns over planning regulations and budget allocation. Yusuf defended the idea of housing migrants in tents, pointing to France as an example, and announced plans to deport all illegal immigrants during their first term, while also pledging to cut wasteful spending on diversity and inclusion initiatives. Kemi Badenoch acknowledged Reform's success, attributing it to Nigel Farage's ability to voice public frustration.</p>

          <p>A missile fired from Yemen by Houthi rebels struck near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, causing minor injuries and temporary flight suspensions. Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree declared the airport unsafe for air travel, while Israeli authorities, including Defense Minister Israel Katz, vowed a strong retaliation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened an urgent meeting to discuss the response, as the Israeli Air Force investigates the failure to intercept the missile. The attack, claimed in solidarity with Hamas, marks a rare breach of Israel's air defenses, escalating regional tensions amid ongoing conflicts.</p>

          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's selection of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a fundamental shift in the structure of Trump's administration, moving from a coalition government to a royal court. Klein suggests that Vance's appointment, influenced by figures like Don Jr., Elon Musk, and Tucker Carlson, indicated Trump's preference for loyalists over moderating forces. The article posits that unlike Trump's first term, where he was often checked by advisors and institutions, his second term is characterized by an environment of unchecked power and sycophancy, with the guardrails of the past now gone.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese's re-election as Australia's prime minister was significantly influenced by global turmoil stemming from President Trump's policies, which bolstered anti-Trump sentiment among Australian voters. Despite Albanese's measured approach and avoidance of direct criticism, the negative perception of Trump's policies, particularly his tariff decisions, played a role in the election outcome. Voters, concerned about the cost-of-living crisis, rejected Peter Dutton, the opposition leader, due to his alignment with some of Trump's ideas. The election results underscore a preference for sensible, centrist politics over policies perceived as erratic or poorly considered.</p>

          <p>Dani Bowman and James B. Jones, stars of Netflix's 'Love on the Spectrum,' condemn Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial statements about autism, stating they are damaging and disconnected from reality. Bowman and Jones, both successful individuals on the spectrum, challenge Kennedy's characterization of autistic people as burdens with limited potential. They emphasize the need for opportunity, understanding, and support rather than pity or stereotypes, and call for Kennedy's resignation from his position as Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also note that autistic individuals can have fulfilling lives with the support of their friends and family.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve officials, focused on managing inflation, are likely to maintain steady interest rates, despite pressure from President Trump and some advisors for a rate cut. Recent government data showing a healthy job market and slowly easing price pressures support the Fed's position. However, the uncertainty created by potential tariff changes poses a challenge for economic forecasting. Economists anticipate Powell will prioritize price stability, citing concerns that inflation expectations may be loosening.</p>

          <h2>Professor Suggests Ending Social Security Benefits for Wealthier Seniors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 06:44:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Scott Galloway has proposed ending Social Security benefits for a significant portion of wealthier seniors, arguing that they don't need the support and that it would help reduce economic inequality. He suggests that between 10% and 30% of Social Security recipients, possibly as high as a third, should not receive benefits due to their wealth. Galloway argues that the current system disproportionately transfers wealth from younger generations struggling with debt and stagnant wages to the wealthiest generation in history. This proposal is presented as a potential solution to the Social Security program's insolvency issues, as the Social Security trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2035.</p>

          <p>The US economy faces instability due to President Trump's policies, characterized by uncertainty and weariness among businesses and consumers. Despite strong payroll data, forward-looking surveys reveal anxiety due to ambiguous trade policies, budget cuts, and immigration restrictions. The long-term impacts of these policies, including potential worker shortages, production delays, and rising prices, remain uncertain. The president's actions have damaged relationships with key trading partners and created a climate of fear in the business community.</p>

          <p>Despite President Claudia Sheinbaum's success in navigating relations with President Trump, Mexico faces ongoing domestic challenges that could impact her popularity.

Security remains a critical issue, with high levels of violence and thousands of disappearances.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is presenting a significant challenge to Britain's traditional two-party system, with recent election gains signaling a potential shift in the political landscape. The Conservative Party and the Labour Party are struggling to maintain their dominance as smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, gain traction. Reform UK's surge in support reflects public disenchantment with both main parties, energized by Farage's vigorous campaigning. With five parties now vying for votes, British politics has become deeply unpredictable, potentially transforming Reform from a protest party into a major opposition force.</p>

          <p>Helen Schulman's essay explores the evolving dynamics of marriage as couples age, reflecting on her 33-year relationship with her husband. She humorously notes that she now hates him less, attributing this to time and his industry's collapse, which allowed him to be more present. Schulman acknowledges the challenges of balancing career and family, particularly the unequal distribution of domestic labor, while also recognizing the luck they had. The essay concludes with a sense of gratitude and savoring the present with her husband.</p>
