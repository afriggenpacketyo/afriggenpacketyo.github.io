        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess, overcoming a legal challenge from Exxon Mobil regarding valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The International Chamber of Commerce's ruling sided with Chevron, affirming a long-standing industry practice that asset-level rights of refusal do not apply in corporate-level mergers and acquisitions. This significant win provides Chevron with access to the vast Stabroek Block oil reserves, where Hess holds a 30% stake. Chevron's CEO, Mike Wirth, expressed satisfaction with the outcome, though he anticipates some headcount reductions as the companies integrate for efficiency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German asparagus and strawberry harvests hit multi-year lows in 2025, according to the Federal Statistical Office, primarily due to rising production costs, especially wages. Farmers are increasingly reducing the land allocated to these crops as consumer prices cannot adequately cover expenses, making cultivation unviable for many. This trend is transforming asparagus and strawberries into luxury items, with Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberries dropping significantly to 50%. The article highlights the severe economic pressures facing German agriculture, impacting both producers and consumers.</p>

Claire Freemantle, 48, was initially told she would not face charges, but police reopened their investigation in January. The Crown Prosecution Service indicated she may have experienced an epileptic seizure, though she had no prior diagnosis.

          <p>A five-year-old boy tragically drowned in Lake Chatuge, Georgia, after he wandered into the water near his family’s vacation rental home in Hiawassee. Upon arrival, deputies found the child had just been pulled from the lake, and they immediately began CPR alongside fire personnel. Despite extensive efforts, the child was taken to Chatuge Regional Hospital, where he died later that afternoon. The Towns County Coroner ruled the death accidental, noting the boy fell into the lake and was unable to pull himself out.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduces a new 'visa integrity fee' of at least $250 for all nonimmigrant visa holders entering the United States.

While reimbursements are possible if visa conditions are met, significant challenges and unanswered questions surround the implementation and collection processes. The U.S. Travel Association notes the Department of Homeland Security, tasked with the fee, does not own the visa issuance process, creating further uncertainty.</p>

Overall consumer sentiment increased slightly to 61.8, its highest point since February. Despite this improvement, survey director Joanne Hsu noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation increases. This article highlights a shift in consumer expectations following President Trump's earlier tariff announcements, although new tariffs on individual products may still raise future price concerns.

          <p>Elon Musk's health tech company, Neuralink, which recently achieved a $9 billion valuation after a significant funding round, controversially filed as a "small disadvantaged business" with the U.S. Small Business Administration. This designation typically grants preferential access to federal procurement opportunities for companies at least 51% owned by socially and economically disadvantaged persons. The filing occurred while Musk was leading a Trump administration initiative focused on reducing the size of federal agencies. The article highlights the ethical questions raised by this classification for a company led by the world's wealthiest individual.</p>
