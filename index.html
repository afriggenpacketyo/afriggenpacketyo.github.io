          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the historic Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97, NASA confirmed. Lovell was celebrated for his calm leadership during the 1970 "successful failure," where an in-flight emergency forced his crew to abort their moon landing and return safely to Earth. His distinguished career also included missions on Gemini 7, Gemini 12, and Apollo 8, making him one of the most experienced astronauts of his era.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the Pentagon to develop options for potential U.S. military action against drug cartels that have been designated as terrorist organizations. While officials state that military force is not imminent, the directive follows the administration's official designation of several cartels as global terrorist groups earlier in the year. The move raises questions about the legality and scope of such potential operations, signaling a significant escalation in the administration's strategy against these criminal enterprises.</p>

          <p>Texas Democrats once again broke quorum in the state House, preventing a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan that would likely increase the GOP's congressional seats. Despite threats of arrest and other punitive measures from Republican state leaders, the majority of Democrats remained absent from the special session. This ongoing political standoff highlights the deep partisan divisions over voting rights and representation, with Democrats holding out until the end of the special session to block the maps.</p>

          <p>In a provocative diplomatic move, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly gave an award to President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, intended for a senior CIA official whose son was killed fighting for Russian forces in Ukraine. The gesture is seen as a psychological tactic meant to highlight a sensitive and tragic situation involving a U.S. official's family. The CIA had previously stated that the son's death, while a personal tragedy, was not a national security issue, and there was no indication he had been recruited by Russia.</p>

The move came after the Swiss Precious Metals Association warned that U.S. tariffs on Swiss exports, which apparently included 1kg and 100oz gold bars, could disrupt the international flow of physical gold. The clarification from the administration helped ease market concerns, causing prices to stabilize after the initial surge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), several key factors could impact their borrowing limit this August. The most significant is the home's current market value, as fluctuations in local property prices directly affect available equity. Additionally, changes in an owner's credit profile and shifts in the broader interest rate environment can prompt lenders to adjust credit limits, making it crucial for borrowers to monitor these dynamics.

          <p>The daughter of Bhim Kohli, an 80-year-old man killed by teens in Leicestershire, claims police had information that could have prevented the fatal attack. A report revealed that police knew the identities of youths involved in a prior racial assault that Kohli witnessed, but failed to make arrests until after his death. Ms. Kohli alleges that this delay, attributed to shift patterns and a bank holiday, allowed a dangerous situation to escalate, and she is calling for a new review by the police watchdog.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery, partly owned by Russia's Rosneft, for processing Russian crude oil, a move aimed at cutting funds for the war in Ukraine. However, experts suggest the action is largely symbolic and unlikely to derail ongoing EU-India free trade negotiations. They argue that the greater economic pressure on India currently stems from the threat of high U.S. tariffs, which may paradoxically increase India's desire to secure a trade deal with the EU.</p>

In a social media post, Huckabee provocatively compared the situation to World War II, asking if the UK surrendered to the Nazis and invoking the controversial Allied bombing of Dresden. The ambassador's blunt comments represent a sharp public rebuke of a key ally's position on the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>With national credit card debt at a record high of over $1.21 trillion, this article outlines several methods for consumers to reduce or eliminate interest payments. These include using 0% APR balance transfer cards, enrolling in issuer hardship programs, paying off balances before the statement closing date, and consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan. These strategies can help borrowers break the cycle of compounding interest and regain control of their finances. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that with interest rates expected to fall, a CD laddering strategy allows savers to lock in current high rates on multiple CDs with varied terms. This approach provides both strong returns and the flexibility needed in an unpredictable economy where maintaining access to some funds is critical. By spreading deposits across short, medium, and long-term CDs, savers can continuously reinvest matured funds while benefiting from today's favorable rates. (not investment advice)</p>
