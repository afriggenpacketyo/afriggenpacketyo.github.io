          <p>Israeli forces reportedly killed at least 45 Palestinians and injured hundreds near an aid distribution center in Khan Younis, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry and a local hospital. Eyewitnesses reported that Israeli drones and tanks fired at citizens who were heading to the distribution center on foot or by car. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), supported by Israel and the US, has been distributing aid since last month as an alternative to UN and NGO assistance. UN agencies and major aid groups deny misappropriating aid and have criticized the GHF, arguing that it is inadequate and improperly allows Israel to control aid access, with reports of Palestinians being killed near distribution centers on multiple occasions. </p>

          <p>Kim Woodburn, best known for her role in the Channel 4 cleaning show "How Clean Is Your House" and appearances on "Celebrity Big Brother," has died at the age of 83. Woodburn's manager confirmed her passing, highlighting her kindness, charisma, and strength, and noting the heartbreak of her husband, Peter. She gained fame on "How Clean Is Your House" alongside Aggie MacKenzie, which ran from 2003 to 2009, and was also a regular on "Loose Women" and "This Morning," known for her outspoken views. Woodburn's career included a stint on "I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!" where she finished as runner-up in 2009, and her appearance on "Celebrity Big Brother" in 2017 sparked numerous memes and a notable falling out with Coleen Nolan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an attempt to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," ending a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," in which it held a copyright interest, but the court refused to hear an appeal. Amy Wadge, who co-wrote "Thinking Out Loud" with Sheeran, expressed immense relief, stating that the trials had "haunted" her for 10 years, despite the song changing her life. The court agreed with earlier findings that the chord progression and harmonic rhythms in Gaye's song are too commonplace to be legally protected.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's handling of the Iran-Israel conflict is viewed by some analysts as a strategic move to leverage the United States in nuclear talks. According to Amit Segal of Israel’s Channel 12, Trump gave Prime Minister Netanyahu a green light to strike Iran after the expiration of a 60-day window for serious negotiations over Iran's nuclear weapons program. Trump has maintained a "masterful ambiguity" about his role, reminiscent of Sir John Lawrence's policy of "masterful inactivity." He is offering to mediate peace while warning enemies against harming Americans, and he is using the military and diplomatic tools to influence Iran's behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US immigration system is described as a system that dehumanizes people for profit, stemming from a history of racism and corporate greed. The author contends that the system, which didn't exist in its current form until the Immigration Act of 1924, was initially driven by xenophobia and eugenics. Multinational corporations later recognized that closed borders, combined with free trade agreements, could suppress wages and increase profits. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is cited as an example, where goods and capital moved freely while the movement of workers was restricted, creating an imbalance that benefited corporations at the expense of human rights.</p>

          <p>Travel experts offer advice on how to manage flight delays and cancellations, as air travel is getting notably worse, with an increase in canceled flights throughout 2024. They recommend multitasking by rebooking flights online while in line for customer service, calling customer service hotlines in other languages, and seeking assistance at airport lounges. Travelers should know their entitlements from the airline and check their travel insurance coverage, choose early-morning flights, and consider alternative transportation options if necessary. Booking direct with the airline is also advised to ensure better assistance in case of disruptions.</p>

          <p>Medicaid's popularity is increasing, with 83% of the public viewing it favorably, including a significant rise among Republican voters, even as Republicans aim to cut $800 billion in federal spending on Medicaid.

Medicaid provides health coverage to 71 million low-income and disabled people, and an additional 7 million low-income children are enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).

          <p>Timbaland's new AI-focused entertainment company, Stage Zero, has launched its first AI-generated "artist," TaTa, aiming to pioneer a new genre of music called A-pop. This move is part of a broader trend of integrating AI into music creation, using platforms like Suno to generate songs from text prompts. However, this integration has sparked controversy, with concerns about the erasure of artistic process and the devaluation of human expression. Critics argue that such AI tools prioritize efficiency over creativity, potentially disenfranchising artists and cheapening human expression, as seen in previous instances of AI-assisted scams and the creation of derivative content.</p>

The executive emphasized the importance of making decisions that align with the team's long-term goals and competitive dynamics, rather than short-term tournament considerations.

The private sector's "animal spirits" are making a return, with investment patterns suggesting a renewal led by capital expenditure, overseas expansion plans, research and development spending, and heightened fundraising activity. The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policy and regulatory frameworks, forceful macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations.

          <p>Investigators in India are studying the black boxes of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner after recovering them from the aircraft wreckage to ascertain the cause of last week’s plane crash that left at least 270 people dead. The black boxes will provide cockpit conversations and data related to the plane's engine and control settings to investigators. The London-bound Air India aircraft crashed on a medical college hostel soon after taking off from Ahmedabad, killing 241 people on board and 29 on the ground. Experts from India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau are probing the crash with assistance from the U.K., the U.S. and officials from Boeing.</p>

          <p>President Trump departed the G7 summit early, citing "much bigger" things than planning a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, after urging people to "immediately evacuate Tehran." G7 leaders affirmed support for Israel and condemned Iran for regional instability, reiterating that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. Trump's departure followed French President Macron's comments that Trump had offered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Israel's military claimed to have eliminated Ali Shadmani, identified as Iran's "war-time" chief of staff, signaling that the conflict was far from a resolution.</p>

The report said the ethnicity of people involved in grooming gangs had been "shied away from" by authorities with ethnicity data not recorded for two-thirds of perpetrators, meaning the data was not robust enough to support conclusions about offenders at a national level. The government accepted all Baroness Casey's recommendations, but the grooming gangs report itself made the point that many of the problems highlighted have been known about for years – yet there was a failure to act over decades.</p>
