          <p>Thirty-one workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a municipal wastewater tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in an 18-foot diameter tunnel, part of a long-term infrastructure project, when a section of it gave way. The trapped workers were able to climb over a large pile of loose soil to meet colleagues on the other side, who then shuttled them over five miles to the single access point. Over 100 first responders managed the complex operation, and all workers were evaluated by paramedics upon exiting with no visible injuries reported, bringing a fortunate conclusion to a highly dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed that detectives are examining historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former bishop and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. The report details how concerns about one of the figures were allegedly ignored by church officials for years before his promotion to bishop. Victims are now calling for an independent inquiry, citing a culture of concealment and failure to act on serious complaints. The Church in Wales has issued an apology for its past failings and promised a review of its culture and safeguarding procedures to address the crisis.</p>

          <h2>Former Conservative Party Chairman Sir Jake Berry Defects to Reform UK</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative cabinet minister and party chairman, has defected to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, marking a significant political development. This move follows other recent defections of former Tory MPs, signaling growing momentum for Reform. In his announcement, Berry issued a sharp critique of the last two decades of governance by both the Conservative and Labour parties. The defection is seen as a major blow to the Conservatives, while Labour is reportedly recalibrating its strategy to address the rising influence of Reform as a primary political opponent.</p>

          <p>Poland has reintroduced border controls at its crossings with Germany, a move that mirrors Germany's own recent measures and further strains the Schengen Agreement's principle of free movement. The Polish government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, stated the checks are a response to Germany's toughened migration policies, including the turning away of asylum seekers at its border. The decision has caused concern and disruption for residents and commuters in border cities like Frankfurt an der Oder and Slubice, who have long benefited from open borders. The situation is amplified by the presence of self-proclaimed citizen patrols monitoring the border.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will implement a 50% tariff on all copper imports, set to begin on August 1, following a national security assessment. The White House justified the move by highlighting copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other essential technologies. This policy, which follows similar tariff hikes on steel and aluminum, caused an immediate and significant jump in U.S. copper prices. The stated goal is to revitalize and expand the domestic copper industry, though experts caution that it will take years for U.S. production capacity to meet current demand.

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating that the country must be able to defend itself against intense Russian attacks. This decision reverses a recently confirmed pause on some weapons shipments, which the White House had attributed to a broader review of global military aid and stockpile levels. The president expressed frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin's attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilians. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending additional defensive arms at the president's direction to ensure Ukraine can defend itself while the U.S. works toward a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County medical examiner has ruled that the death of Lucrecia Macias Barajas, a 46-year-old U.S. Army veteran, was an accident caused by the combined effects of fentanyl and methamphetamine. Her body was discovered by her daughter in May inside a tent at a homeless encampment in the Westlake area. Another individual was also found deceased at the scene from the same cause. The case had drawn attention after video showed the victim's daughter pleading with police at the scene, though authorities stated they were investigating it as a suspected overdose rather than a homicide.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to raise costs for a wide range of consumer products and industries, according to economists. As copper is a vital component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles, the tariff could lead to broad price increases for consumers and businesses. The administration argues the tariff is necessary for national security and will incentivize domestic production. However, experts note that the U.S. is heavily reliant on copper imports and ramping up domestic mining and processing capacity would be a multi-year endeavor. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a new federal spending bill that tightens deadlines for subsidies, California lawmakers are considering rolling back some environmental regulations to accelerate clean energy projects. Influential State Senator Scott Wiener has suggested exempting such projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often criticized for slowing construction. Clean energy groups argue that without faster permitting, many projects risk losing crucial federal tax breaks, which the state cannot afford to replace. The debate pits the urgency of the green transition against the concerns of environmental groups wary of weakening long-standing protections.</p>

          <p>This opinion article, citing a report by UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese, argues that corporate entities are profiting from and contributing to an "economy of genocide" in the Palestinian territories. The author contends that many companies, including American defense contractors, have materially supported Israel's actions by providing weapons and technology used in the conflict. The piece asserts that this corporate complicity is part of a historical pattern where businesses have profited from major human rights crises. It calls for a cessation of business activities that support what the author and the cited report describe as an illegal occupation and apartheid system.</p>

The bishop stated that the "grave inconvenience" and fear caused by the potential for immigration enforcement action near churches impedes the spiritual well-being of the faithful. This extraordinary move comes as a federal immigration crackdown has created a climate of anxiety in Southern California, with some churches reporting attendance has dropped by as much as half.

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has only partially rebounded from the significant drop experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, the average lifespan was still nearly a year shorter than in 2019. While the virus was the primary driver of the decline, the lingering gap is now increasingly caused by drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease. The study also highlights persistent disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower recovery in life expectancy compared to white and Asian residents, pointing to ongoing structural health inequities.</p>
