          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz traveled to Turku, Finland, for a Nordic summit with prime ministers from Nordic countries to discuss mutual interests and concerns. Discussions likely included Russia's military build-up, especially given Finland's 1,340-kilometer border with Russia. Meanwhile, German Health Minister Nina Warken is advocating for stricter regulations on online medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Greens parliamentary leader Katharina DrÃ¶ge criticized Merz's government's plan to abolish the accelerated path to German citizenship, calling it "senseless."</p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, dominated by loyalists of NicolÃ¡s Maduro, declared a sweeping victory in regional and legislative elections, although the process lacked independent vote monitors. Critics have decried the election as a performance to legitimize Maduro's regime. The results, presented without evidence, stripped the opposition of key positions, including the governorship of Zulia. Despite sparsely populated polling places, the electoral council claimed a turnout exceeding 40 percent, though this was disputed. Opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado called for people to abstain, while others advocated for participation to rally support.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's education bureau is encouraging universities to attract "top talent" affected by the Trump administration's attempt to ban Harvard from enrolling international students. This initiative follows the temporary block on Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. The Hong Kong Science and Technology University has extended an open invitation to affected foreign students, offering streamlined admission and academic support. While Hong Kong boasts several top universities, national security and patriotic themes have been integrated into studies, reflecting China's tightening grip on the city.</p>
