        <p>President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum took effect, impacting global trade relationships and potentially slowing the U.S. economy.  The move, while supported by domestic metal producers, led to trade disputes with several countries, including Canada, and market fluctuations.  Trump's fluctuating approach to tariffs caused uncertainty and defensive reactions from U.S. allies.</p>

        <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manila on an ICC warrant for alleged crimes against humanity related to his anti-drug campaign.  The arrest, despite the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC's jurisdiction, highlights the court's efforts to hold leaders accountable for human rights abuses.  While celebrated by victims' families and some rights groups, the arrest also underscores the challenges faced by the ICC in securing cooperation from member states and the potential influence of domestic politics.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration reinstated military and intelligence aid to Ukraine after Kyiv agreed to a U.S.-proposed ceasefire.  The agreement, reached after talks in Saudi Arabia, aims to end the war and improve U.S.-Ukraine relations.  While the deal is seen as a positive step by some, the long-term success depends on Russia's acceptance, and recent continued fighting raises concerns about its implementation.</p>

        <p>The Trump administration plans to eliminate all EPA offices dedicated to environmental justice, ending decades of work to address pollution disproportionately affecting poor and minority communities.
