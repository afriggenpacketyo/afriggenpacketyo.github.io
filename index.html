          <p>Tesla's European car sales have decreased for the fifth consecutive month in May 2025, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). This decline is attributed to increased competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles and reputational damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk's controversial actions.  Tesla's market share dropped to 1.2%, compared to 1.8% in May 2024, and its stock price fell nearly 5% following the release of this data. The article suggests that even the revamped Model Y has not been able to fully reverse this trend.</p>
