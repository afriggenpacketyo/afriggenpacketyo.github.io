        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with record high rice prices in Japan, supermarket chains like Aeon, Ito-Yokado, and Seiyu are increasing sales of foreign-grown rice, particularly from California and Taiwan, to offer consumers more affordable options. Aeon will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestic rice, hoping to increase overall rice consumption by providing consumer choice. U.S. Ambassador to Japan George Glass hailed Aeon's decision as historic for American farmers. The average price of rice at Japanese supermarkets has surged due to a poor harvest in 2023, prompting the government to consider measures to stabilize prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes on June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying to stockpile before the ban takes effect, with some considering returning to smoking if they cannot access disposable vapes. Retailers are seeing sales surge as customers stock up, driven by concerns about the taste and convenience of rechargeable alternatives. Baroness Claire Fox, who quit smoking using disposable vapes, criticizes the ban as counterproductive, arguing that environmental concerns are prioritized over public health. The government aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, but retailers worry about the impact on their businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance after holding talks with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

A symbolic development was Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel. Despite Japan's push for complete tariff removal, compromises are being considered to secure an early deal.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available at 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. This initiative is in response to mounting criticism over rising rice prices, which have doubled in the past year due to a poor harvest and increased demand from tourism. The government is likely to commence procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. While the move is intended to lower prices, its overall impact remains uncertain given the limited amount of rice in reserve.</p>

          <p>Cuts to National Weather Service weather balloon sites by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are impacting the accuracy of weather forecasts, according to meteorologists. The reduction of balloon sites, including those in Michigan and Wisconsin, created gaps in data that could have helped during a recent ice storm and severe thunderstorms. Meteorologists emphasize that data from weather balloons is irreplaceable and cannot be duplicated by satellites or radar. Despite these concerns, NOAA defends its forecasting capabilities and strategic transformation efforts.</p>

          <p>Fears of a US-EU trade war have resurfaced after President Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on EU goods, claiming trade talks were "going nowhere." The European Commission and EU leaders have refused to back down, with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic emphasizing the need for mutual respect. While some officials suggest the tariffs are a negotiating tactic, others warn that the threats do not help trade talks.
