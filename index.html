          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS, Katherine Maher and Paula Kerger, discussed the Trump administration's executive order to cut federal funding to their organizations, stating they are exploring legal options to challenge the decision.

Kerger highlighted the broader implications for children's programming and research, noting that half the children in the country are not enrolled in formal pre-K, and depend on PBS programming. Maher defended NPR's editorial independence and commitment to serving the entire public, including conservative voices, and noted that they have been making requests of the Trump administration to have their officials on air.</p>

          <p>This article posits that President Trump's efforts to expand executive power are influenced by radical right-wing thinkers like Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss, who advocate for a strong, decisive executive unconstrained by traditional legal and bureaucratic norms. These thinkers prioritize decisive action and national interest over liberal values, potentially leading to an erosion of the separation of powers and the establishment of a near-permanent state of emergency. The author warns against the dangers of unchecked executive power and emphasizes the importance of upholding constitutional limits to prevent dictatorial rule.</p>
