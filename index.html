          <p>The U.S. military reports that its month-long air and naval campaign against the Houthi movement in Yemen has struck over 800 targets, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders. The U.S. Central Command states that these strikes aim to diminish the Houthi's ability to threaten shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. However, Houthi sources claim that recent U.S. attacks have resulted in civilian casualties, including women and children, raising concerns about the broader impact of the military operations on the already-fragile humanitarian situation in Yemen.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's trade policies have created uncertainty in global markets, leading to a weakening U.S. dollar and creating an opportunity for the Eurozone.

Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner responsible for the trade bloc’s economy, noted increased investor interest in euro-denominated assets.

A federal judge raised concerns about the lack of meaningful process in the case, but Homan insists the mother chose to take the child with her. He also addressed reports of other U.S. citizen children being deported, including a four-year-old with cancer, arguing that having a U.S. citizen child does not exempt individuals from immigration laws.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite challenges from the Trump administration's energy policies, the U.S. wind energy industry is finding new opportunities in 'repowering' aging wind farms. As many turbines reach the end of their lifecycle, operators are choosing to upgrade or replace them with newer, more efficient models. This repowering effort is providing a boost to companies like GE Vernova, Vestas, and Siemens Gamesa. Repowering offers economic benefits, such as increased electricity output and longer lifecycles, while also supporting advanced manufacturing jobs and local tax revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent concerns about a potential bust, the AI data center market is experiencing a 'pause' rather than a collapse, as major tech companies strategically reallocate investments. While some projects have been reconsidered, strong demand signals continue to reinforce near- and long-term growth. Companies like Amazon and Nvidia have reaffirmed the strength of the data center market, with significant players like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon planning substantial capital expenditures in AI infrastructure. This reshuffling of resources is driven by factors such as power scarcity and the need for low-latency, high-efficiency data centers.</p>
