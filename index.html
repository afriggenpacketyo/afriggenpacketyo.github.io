          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have commenced a new search for Madeleine McCann near Praia da Luz in Portugal, almost two decades after her disappearance in 2007. The search, focused on 21 plots of land between the Ocean Club resort and the former residence of prime suspect Christian Brückner, is expected to last until Friday. German investigators, who took the lead in 2020, suspect Brückner of murder but lack sufficient evidence to bring charges, though he repeatedly denies any involvement. The current search aims to re-examine areas where evidence or a body might have been hidden, with any findings to be handed over to German authorities.</p>

          <p>A recent shooting near a humanitarian aid distribution center in the southern Gaza Strip has reportedly resulted in at least 27 deaths and over 90 injuries, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) acknowledged the shooting, stating that their forces fired shots at suspects moving towards them near the aid site, after the suspects did not heed initial warnings. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which operates the aid site, stated that aid distribution was conducted safely at their site, but acknowledged the IDF is investigating injuries outside the designated safe corridor. This incident follows previous reports of violence surrounding aid distribution, prompting calls for an independent investigation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) forecasts a significant slowdown in U.S. economic growth, projecting a decrease to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026, down from 2.8% last year. The report attributes this slowdown primarily to the Trump administration's tariffs, which have increased the effective tariff rate to 15.4%, the highest since 1938. These tariffs, paid by U.S. importers, are expected to drive up consumer prices, leading to a spike in inflation, which is projected to reach 3.9% by the end of 2025. The OECD also notes that this uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence, holding back trade and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indigenous People of Biafra's (IPOB) sit-at-home protests in southeast Nigeria have significantly disrupted the region's economy and daily life. These protests, initially called to demand the release of IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu, have persisted due to fear of armed groups enforcing compliance. A recent report estimates economic losses of over $4.79 billion, with key sectors like transportation and trade heavily affected. Beyond the economic impact, the protests have also disrupted education and healthcare, fostering a climate of fear and ideological extremism among the youth.</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has collapsed after the party of Geert Wilders, a right-wing leader, withdrew from the governing coalition due to disagreements over immigration policies. Wilders demanded stricter asylum measures, including a freeze on applications and limits on family reunification, which the other coalition partners did not support. This move triggers snap elections, leaving the country in political uncertainty as the government could attempt to remain in power as a minority administration. The collapse reflects broader trends of rising right-wing parties across Europe amid concerns over immigration and economic anxiety.</p>

          <p>This article is an edited transcript of "The Ezra Klein Show," featuring Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, discussing the emergent Trump Doctrine. The conversation addresses how the U.S. is covering international conflicts, particularly in Israel, Gaza, and Ukraine, less frequently than in previous years due to the focus on domestic issues under Trump's administration. Ashford provides a realist perspective on Trump's "America First" foreign policy, analyzing its motivating impulses and evaluating its effectiveness. The discussion explores whether Trump's foreign policy is evolving and whether it has a real chance of succeeding.</p>

          <p>Luang Prabang, Laos, has experienced an economic boom driven by tourism, leading to a significant reduction in poverty, with officials reporting that 98.3% of the city's population is no longer considered poor. The city attracted over 2 million visitors last year, generating $560 million in revenue. However, Laos as a whole still struggles with poverty, high public debt, and reliance on agriculture, with concerns that some tourism models, such as "zero-dollar" tours, do not benefit the local population. Experts suggest that a combination of tourism, improved agriculture, and logistics could help Laos alleviate poverty nationwide.</p>

The OECD has downgraded its global growth forecast to 2.9%, citing a rise in trade barriers and widespread uncertainty due to Trump's unpredictable approach to implementing tariffs. The group also slashed the outlook for the U.S. economy this year from 2.2% to 1.6% and predicted growth would slow again in 2026.

          <p>Mount Etna, located in Sicily, Italy, is Europe's largest and most active volcano, with over 500,000 years of eruptive history.

While posing a threat to nearby populations due to debris and lava flows, Etna's volcanic soil is fertile, supporting agriculture and unique ecosystems.

          <p>Wildlife advocates are criticizing a proposal for a three-week bear hunt in Florida that could result in the killing of nearly 200 black bears. Opponents call it a trophy hunt based on bloodlust, not science, reintroducing outlawed practices like bear baiting and killing with bows and arrows. They argue the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) is using outdated data to justify the hunt and falsely insist the killings are necessary for conservation. Critics also point to the debacle of the 2015 hunt, where hunters massacred nearly 10% of the state’s bear population in two days.</p>

          <p>Male beauty standards are shifting, influenced by the manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces, focusing more on masculinity for its own sake rather than appealing to women. Trends like shaving off eyelashes and "mewing" to achieve a square jaw highlight this shift. This emphasis on hypermasculinity can lead to body dysmorphia among young men, mirroring issues women have long faced. Ironically, the pursuit of these standards can result in young men experiencing similar levels of body image issues as young women.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the significant impact of food production on the climate, emphasizing that it accounts for one-third of global emissions. Even if humanity transitions away from fossil fuels, the emissions targets set by the Paris Agreement cannot be met without addressing the food sector. The expansion of agriculture and pastureland leads to deforestation and the release of carbon dioxide, while increasing meat consumption exacerbates the problem. The author highlights the need for innovative solutions, such as reengineering plants, developing feed additives, and improving photosynthesis, to produce more food with less land.</p>

          <p>Millennials entering their 40s are experiencing midlife differently than previous generations, with economic instability and a focus on self-expression shaping their experiences. Unlike the traditional midlife crisis stereotypes, millennials are often seeking opportunities for personal growth and reevaluation rather than dramatic life changes. Factors such as the financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to a sense of uncertainty and a reevaluation of career and life goals. This generation is also more open to exploring new identities and embracing change.</p>
