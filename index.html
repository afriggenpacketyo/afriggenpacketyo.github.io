          <p>The contest to win tickets to a crypto dinner gala with Donald Trump concluded, with the top 220 holders of his meme coin winning invitations. The identities of the winners were not displayed, but some crypto experts have linked numerous wallets to possible foreign individuals and entities. The price of the Trump meme coin has fluctuated wildly, resulting in profits for some but losses for many more investors. The coin's website removed mention of a "Special VIP White House tour," and a disclaimer now says the tour is being arranged by a third party, with Trump appearing as a "guest."</p>

The judge clarified that the IRS can disclose information it obtains itself, but not information exclusively from the taxpayer, with the exception of the taxpayer's identity.

This reduction aims to alleviate some pressure on supply chains and Christmas product shortages, but prices are still expected to rise due to remaining tariffs and logistical costs.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-China tariff cuts, even if temporary, address concerns about Christmas product shortages. Retailers typically place orders months in advance, but the sudden doubling of tariffs in early April disrupted production. The 90-day window could resolve most of the product shortages for the U.S. Christmas season, though some impact on back-to-school sales is expected. Despite the tariff pause, existing tariffs remain in place, resulting in an average U.S. tariff rate on Chinese products of around 43.5%.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting the Supreme Court's permission to deport nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act. The administration argues that these migrants, allegedly members of Tren de Aragua, pose a danger in prolonged detention. The Solicitor General claims the migrants have received adequate notice and the opportunity to pursue habeas petitions. The administration also suggests the court clarify that the order only bars removal of the migrants under the AEA.</p>

This underground layer could hold a significant amount of water, matching what scientists believe is Mars' missing water.</p>
