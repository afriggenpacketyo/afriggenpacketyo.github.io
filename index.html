          <p>Diabetes prevalence in Turkey has soared, nearly doubling over the past two decades to affect over 16% of the adult population, the highest rate in Europe. Experts attribute this dramatic increase to national food policies, lifestyle changes, and high consumption of carbohydrates and starch-based sugars. Critics, including public health professionals, argue that the Turkish government's health ministry has failed to implement effective strategies for prevention, early diagnosis, and obesity reduction. The situation is compounded by issues of late diagnosis and inadequate post-diagnosis care, highlighting a significant public health crisis.</p>

He called for the lifting of remaining international sanctions to aid economic recovery and promised justice for victims of violence, though concerns about his consolidation of power remain.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has publicly stated his openness to another meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a positive personal bond from their previous summits. This development comes as North Korea continues to advance its weapons program and strengthen ties with Russia and China. However, significant obstacles remain, as Kim insists that North Korea's status as a nuclear power is non-negotiable, a position directly conflicting with Washington's long-standing goal of complete denuclearization. Analysts are skeptical about an imminent summit, noting the lack of substantive progress on key issues.</p>

          <p>Widespread protests in Nepal, largely driven by Gen Z's frustration over corruption and inequality, have resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli. The unrest, which turned violent and led to dozens of deaths, was initially sparked by a government shutdown of social media platforms. Now, with an interim government in place and elections scheduled for March 2026, the young activists are focused on creating a new political future, rejecting the old guard and discussing the formation of a new party. They aim to translate their movement's momentum into lasting democratic reform.</p>

          <p>The UK government has guaranteed a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the automaker manage the fallout from a major cyber-attack that has halted production for nearly a month. The shutdown has raised serious concerns about the stability of JLR's extensive supply chain, with some suppliers reportedly near collapse. A Member of Parliament and chair of the Commons Business and Trade Select Committee warned that this loan might not be the last intervention needed and called the attack a "wake-up call" for UK businesses to improve their cybersecurity defenses.</p>

The school board chair, a former aide to Michelle Obama, has urged "radical empathy" and stated that the board does not have all the facts about the case. This defense has drawn criticism from Iowa Republicans, who are launching an investigation into the district's hiring practices.

Business leaders and politicians express concern that this ad-hoc expansion of tariffs, designed to counter Chinese imports, is creating a turbulent trade relationship and harming various industries.

The new model has final assembly "pull" components from suppliers only when needed, which is expected to enable faster, cheaper, and more consistent mass production of space systems.

The lawsuit cited numerous false statements Giuliani made about the company's voting machines in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. The terms of the settlement are confidential. This marks another significant legal resolution for Dominion, which previously secured a $787.5 million settlement from Fox News and a $67 million settlement from Newsmax over the amplification of the same evidence-free conspiracy theories about the election.</p>

          <p>Michael Cohen, former lawyer for Donald Trump, stunned an MSNBC panel by asserting his belief that former FBI Director James Comey "committed a crime" and will likely be found guilty following his recent indictment. Cohen claimed his own investigation revealed Comey's negative involvement in the Russia probe. Drawing on his personal experience with what he called a "weaponized DOJ," Cohen argued that the government's access to extensive documents makes a conviction probable, a take that visibly surprised the show's co-hosts. He maintained this position even when questioned about his own guilty plea for campaign finance violations.</p>

          <p>World leaders at the U.N. General Assembly have expressed a wide range of opinions on U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration's policies.

Leaders from Bolivia and Colombia condemned what they described as hegemonic and aggressive U.S. policies. Others, including officials from Ukraine and Russia, noted a pragmatic or productive turn in relations, illustrating the deeply polarizing and consequential impact of Trump's presidency on the international stage.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the alarming rise of "nudify" apps and websites that use artificial intelligence to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfake images of people, often from their social media photos. The report focuses on a group of Minnesota women who discovered a male friend had used such a service to create sexualized images of them, causing significant emotional trauma. Because the content was not distributed, the women found they had no legal recourse, prompting them to advocate for state legislation to hold the tech platforms enabling this abuse accountable.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has pledged that construction on three new towns will commence before the next general election as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve proposed locations. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative at the party's annual conference, framing it as a core component of Labour's strategy to stimulate economic growth and address the nation's housing crisis, drawing inspiration from the post-war new town developments.</p>

          <p>A contentious battle is underway in Northern California over a new proposition to redraw the state's congressional maps, a move that could threaten the seat of seven-term Republican representative Doug LaMalfa. The proposal, a Democratic response to gerrymandering in Texas, aims to create five new Democratic-leaning seats in California and will be decided in a special election. Supporters believe it is a necessary step to counter the national Republican agenda, while opponents argue it is a partisan power grab that will dilute the representation of the state's rural, conservative areas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown as funding expires on Tuesday, with Democrats refusing to support any extension that does not reverse Republican-led cuts to healthcare programs. The key points of contention are funding for Medicaid and the extension of subsidies for Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans, which Democrats are leveraging as a condition for their votes. The White House has threatened mass layoffs of federal employees if a shutdown occurs, creating a high-stakes political standoff. Democrats believe the focus on healthcare gives them a strong position ahead of the midterm elections.</p>
