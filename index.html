          <p>Andrew and Tristan Tate, currently under investigation in Romania, will return to the UK to face 21 criminal charges, including sexual assault, actual bodily harm, and human trafficking, once the Romanian proceedings conclude. The charges, authorized by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in 2024, relate to alleged incidents between 2012 and 2015. The brothers, who deny all charges, claim there has been a "trial by media" and that UK prosecutors have not provided sufficient information about the allegations. The CPS maintains it is complying with disclosure obligations, but given the complexity of the Romanian proceedings, their return to the UK is unlikely to be soon. </p>

          <p>This article clarifies the nuances between credit card debt forgiveness and debt settlement, explaining that they are often used interchangeably by servicers. Credit card debt forgiveness typically occurs through a negotiated debt settlement, bankruptcy, or a debt management program, all requiring a debt settlement agreement. To qualify, borrowers generally need a minimum debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship. The article advises borrowers to research various debt relief companies to find the most suitable option for their circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized federal judges who blocked President Donald Trump's ability to impose global tariffs, a key component of his second-term agenda. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt labeled the court decisions as "judicial overreach" and urged the Supreme Court to intervene. The Court of International Trade had struck down Trump's global tariffs as "contrary to law," but a federal appeals court has temporarily delayed the ruling. Leavitt argued that the judges are undermining the credibility of the United States on the world stage and abusing their judicial power.</p>

A spokesperson for Demoulas called the board's claim "a farcical cover for a hostile takeover," highlighting the deep divisions within the family-controlled business.

          <p>Dell Technologies' shares rose in extended trading after the company raised its full-year earnings forecast and issued a stronger-than-expected forecast for the current quarter. The company attributed the strong guidance to $7 billion in artificial intelligence systems expected to ship during the quarter, which have higher margins than other Dell systems. Dell expects $2.25 in adjusted earnings per share for the current quarter, with revenue between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion.

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, arguing that the Constitution places limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The court argues that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) does not grant Trump unlimited tariff authority. The court's decision may not be final and can be appealed, but if higher courts agree, Trump may not be able to reimpose the sweeping tariffs. The ruling also states that tariffs imposed under IEEPA must address an unusual and extraordinary threat.</p>

The Federal Reserve meeting and potential rate cut could also impact gold prices due to the inverse relationship between gold prices and interest rates.
