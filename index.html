          <p>Professor Mohd Rizal Arshad, a prominent Malaysian deep-sea robotics scientist, has relocated to China to advance his work on underwater prototypes. He emphasized China's strong ecosystem for rapidly converting research into industrial applications, its direct engagement with businesses to solve real-world problems, and the convenient access to necessary components for building new devices. Rizal, who foresees oceans as vital future sources for drinking water, food, minerals, and energy, assumed the role of dean of robotics at Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University's Entrepreneur College. This transition underscores China's increasing leadership and investment in deep-sea science and marine robot technology.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Annunciation Church in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and 17 injured during a school Mass, is being investigated by the FBI as an act of domestic terrorism and an anti-Catholic hate crime. The attacker, identified as 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. Authorities are still probing the motive, noting Westman's legal name change in 2020 and calls from the mayor against anti-transgender hatred in the aftermath. The incident has profoundly shocked the community, drawing condolences from Pope Leo XIV and President Trump.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the Liberal Democrats, announced his decision to boycott the upcoming state banquet for Donald Trump's visit to the UK. Davey stated his refusal, despite it going against his instincts regarding an invitation from the King, is intended to pressure Trump to act on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and secure the release of hostages. He believes Trump possesses the influence over Israel, Qatar, and other Gulf states to de-escalate the conflict. This move has drawn criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel, who called it an act of disrespect to King Charles.</p>

          <p>Tesla experienced a substantial 40% year-on-year drop in European new car registrations in July, marking its seventh consecutive month of decline. In contrast, Chinese electric vehicle rival BYD saw its registrations surge by 225% during the same period, leading an aggressive push into the European market. Analysts attribute Tesla's struggles to intense competition, an aging vehicle lineup, and reputational damage from CEO Elon Musk's rhetoric. This trend highlights the increasing pressure on established automakers from rapidly expanding Chinese brands, which now command a record market share in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities endured a massive Russian missile and drone attack, resulting in at least 12 deaths, including two children, and 48 injuries. This marks the first major combined assault on the capital in weeks, occurring amidst struggling U.S.-led peace initiatives. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy condemned the strikes, stating Russia prefers conflict over negotiations and urging stronger international responses. The attack also damaged infrastructure and the EU mission building, while Ukrainian drones simultaneously targeted Russian oil refineries, escalating the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Rangers suffered a catastrophic 6-0 defeat to Club Brugge in the Champions League, leading to widespread criticism of manager Russell Martin. The loss, which exposed significant defensive vulnerabilities and a lack of progress under Martin's leadership, has intensified calls from the fanbase for his dismissal. Despite the overwhelming fan discontent, the club's new owners appear committed to patience, having supported their previous manager through a similarly rocky start at Leeds. Martin's strategic decisions and recent signings are under scrutiny as the team faces a crucial Old Firm game.</p>

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked widespread emotional reactions from fans, bringing attention to the concept of parasocial relationships. This phenomenon describes one-sided feelings of friendship or romance towards celebrities, fueled by extensive access to their private lives through social media and reality shows. Psychologists note that while these relationships can provide a sense of connection and community, particularly online, they cannot replace reciprocal real-life interactions. Experts caution that despite the illusion of intimacy, celebrities do not individually reciprocate fan affection, akin to "fast food" for emotional needs.</p>

          <p>Liz Hopkin, a teacher who was stabbed last year in a triple attack by a 13-year-old student at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, states she "could never" return to work. Hopkin recounted grabbing the assailant to protect a colleague, sustaining stabs to her leg, neck, and back. The girl, who cannot be named, was sentenced to 15 years for attempted murder. A multi-agency review highlighted the attacker's troubled childhood and mental health challenges, recommending better information sharing between agencies. Hopkin and politicians are urging the Welsh government for policy changes to prevent similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are experiencing a significant bull run, with some reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating another 20% gain. This optimism is fueled by a government pledge to stabilize the stock market amid a shaky economy, aiming to create a "wealth effect" to stimulate consumption. Software engineer Jacky Jia, for example, has focused his investments on high-beta stocks in new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors. This trend indicates a strong belief among individual investors in continued market growth, despite underlying economic challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, canceled his planned trip to the United States due to unresolved technical issues concerning a bilateral trade deal. The discussions were intended to address US tariff measures, particularly the lack of written confirmation to lower automobile tariffs to 15% from 25%. Japan is urging the US to amend its presidential order on reciprocal tariffs and issue a new one for auto parts. This comes after a July deal where Japan pledged a $550 billion investment package in exchange for reduced tariffs, with ongoing disagreements over the nature and returns of this investment.

Monarez's ouster and the resignation of several other senior CDC officials follow disagreements with the Trump administration over vaccine policy, budget cuts, and the "weaponization of public health." White House spokesman Kush Desai stated Monarez was terminated for refusing to resign, while her lawyers allege she was targeted for resisting "unscientific, reckless directives."</p>

          <p>The South Florida Water Management District is deploying 120 robot rabbits in the Everglades as a new strategy to combat invasive Burmese pythons. These robots, designed to mimic real marsh rabbits with heat, smell, and movement, aim to lure the voracious snakes out of hiding for removal. Pythons have severely impacted native wildlife, decimating small mammal populations by 95% in some areas. The solar-powered robots are monitored by cameras, signaling when a python is nearby for contractors to capture. This innovative approach seeks to improve detection rates of the well-camouflaged reptiles.</p>

He strategically diversified his pitch selection, utilizing his curveball and splitter more frequently, which manager Dave Roberts noted made him less predictable.

USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen expressed optimism for a swift agreement, acknowledging the series' importance to both programs and fans. Previously, USC was hesitant to commit long-term due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, with USC preferring an earlier season slot to balance its schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the traditional late-season matchup.</p>

The Iberian Peninsula alone saw 684,000 hectares scorched, a figure significantly higher than historical averages. Experts directly link the worsening fires to climate change, which creates hotter, drier conditions, and warn of future increases in frequency and severity. The fires have also released record levels of CO2, contributing to a climate feedback loop, while rural depopulation in affected areas exacerbates the problem by increasing flammable vegetation.</p>

The facility, part of the Trump administration's strategy to expand detention capacity, has faced allegations of inhumane conditions, including inadequate water and legal access, which officials deny.
