          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, is contributing $22 million towards the construction of the White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with Donald Trump following his ban from YouTube after the January 6th Capitol riot. This contribution represents almost 10% of the estimated $250 million construction costs. While Trump has promised that taxpayers will not foot the bill, questions remain about the full list of donors and the exact amounts they have pledged. The Treasury Department has restricted its staff from sharing photos of the East Wing demolition due to security concerns, and the White House has dismissed criticism as "manufactured outrage."</p>

          <h2>Most Americans Plan to Claim Social Security Benefits Early Despite Advice</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 13:15:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Schroders study reveals that 90% of working Americans plan to claim Social Security benefits before age 70, despite financial advice suggesting delaying to maximize monthly payments. Claiming early, as soon as age 62, reduces monthly payments by about 30%, while delaying until 70 increases payments by roughly 24%. Many Americans are aware of these trade-offs but need the income immediately upon retiring due to retirement savings shortfalls. Concerns about Social Security's future solvency also influence the decision to claim early, with some fearing the money may not be available later (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electricity prices are increasing dramatically, driven in part by the growing demand from AI data centers. Tech companies are shopping for power from multiple utilities, potentially leading to double counting of energy needs and infrastructure overbuilding. This speculation could result in regular customers bearing the financial burden of unused infrastructure. While electricity prices are expected to rise in the near term, consumers may save money on household energy over time by switching from fossil fuels to electricity, particularly with electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Storm Benjamin, named by Météo France, is expected to bring wet and windy weather to the United Kingdom. While the most severe impacts will be felt across France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, the UK could experience heavy rain leading to localized flooding and strong winds causing travel disruption. The Met Office has issued yellow severe weather warnings for both wind and rain. There is a small chance of gusts up to 75mph along the North Sea coast, which could topple trees, disrupt travel, and cause power cuts.</p>

          <p>A study by Ryan Goodman at New York University indicates that some courts are losing trust in the Trump Justice Department. The research tracks over 400 cases involving the administration and focuses on instances where courts have explicitly criticized the government's conduct. Findings include cases of non-compliance with court orders, false or misleading information provided by the government, and instances of arbitrary and capricious conduct. Goodman suggests this behavior is damaging the Justice Department's relationship with the courts and undermining the system of justice.</p>

          <p>Walmart is pausing the hiring of job candidates who need H-1B visas to work in the U.S. after President Trump announced higher fees for the visas. The Trump administration's decision aims to protect American workers' jobs and end abuse of the visa program. Walmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth-largest U.S. employer to issue the visas. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.</p>
