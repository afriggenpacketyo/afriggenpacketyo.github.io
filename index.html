          <p>Eli Lilly's stock fell after its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, showed modest results in a late-stage trial. The pill helped patients lose nearly 12% of their body weight, which was below some Wall Street expectations of around 15%. While some doctors praised the potential of a convenient oral alternative to injections for reaching more patients, others noted the discontinuation rates due to side effects like nausea and vomiting. Despite the market reaction, Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year, aiming for a launch in 2026.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has surpassed other candidates to become the leading contender for the next Fed chair on prediction markets like Kalshi. His odds surged following reports that advisors to President Trump are impressed with his policy approach, which favors adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts rather than only current data. Waller, who was nominated to the Fed by Trump in 2020, recently dissented from a decision to hold rates steady, arguing the central bank's approach was overly cautious. Other candidates like Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett have seen their odds decrease in response. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The political standoff over Texas's electoral map has intensified after Democratic lawmakers fled the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan. The situation escalated with a bomb threat at a hotel housing the Democrats and a request from Republican Senator John Cornyn for the FBI to assist in locating the absent legislators. President Trump also suggested federal involvement may be necessary. The Democrats' departure denies Republicans the necessary quorum to pass the new map, which would likely create several more GOP-leaning congressional districts.</p>

          <p>The Northern Superchargers secured a dominant 47-run victory over the Welsh Fire in The Hundred cricket competition at Headingley. After setting a target of 141-4, the Superchargers' bowlers dismantled the Fire's batting lineup, dismissing them for just 94 runs, their lowest total in the women's competition. Australian all-rounder Georgia Wareham was the standout performer, contributing with both bat and ball and playing a role in two run-outs. The significant margin of victory provides the Superchargers with a valuable net run-rate boost, placing them at the top of the league table.</p>

This move is seen as a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has been advocating for inclusion in these defined contribution plans, although it introduces new potential risks for retail investors. The policy change aims to broaden investment options for the trillions of dollars held in American retirement accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Teddy Bridgewater defended his actions while serving as a volunteer head coach for his high school alma mater, which led to a suspension. Bridgewater stated he was acting as a "protector" for the student-athletes, many of whom come from a tough neighborhood. He was suspended for providing financial benefits, including funding rides home and meals, which he said was to ensure the players' safety and well-being. Despite the controversy, Bridgewater expressed hope that his journey back to the NFL after a brief retirement serves as an inspiration to the young men he coached.</p>

          <p>Amid rising credit card debt, which has surpassed $1.21 trillion, many Americans are exploring debt forgiveness as a relief option. This strategy, also known as debt settlement, typically involves stopping payments to creditors and saving money to offer a lump-sum payment that is less than the total amount owed. While outcomes vary, consumers can potentially reduce their debt by 30% to 50% before fees, though this path can negatively impact credit scores and may result in tax liabilities on the forgiven amount. The article suggests this option is best for those facing significant financial hardship with no other viable path out of debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite Trump setting a deadline for a ceasefire in Ukraine, oil prices fell as traders seemingly bet the threat is a negotiating tactic that will not be fully implemented. Analysts suggest that the administration's history of not always backing up sanctions threats, coupled with the risk of causing a spike in global energy prices, makes a full-scale tariff unlikely. The administration's recent 25% tariff on India is seen as a much softer approach than originally threatened. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article in the Los Angeles Times argues that the Trump administration's attacks on independent government agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Congressional Budget Office are counterproductive. The author contends that while these agencies have flaws and deserve criticism for outdated methods, treating their findings as political disloyalty and firing their leadership erodes the credibility of essential economic data. This data is crucial for decision-making across the economy, from entrepreneurs to policymakers. The piece concludes that restoring confidence in these institutions through genuine reform, not political retaliation, is essential for achieving economic dynamism.</p>

          <h2>Essay Explores the Decline of Politeness and Its Negative Impact on Personal Happiness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 12:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the societal decline in politeness, accelerated by online interactions and AI, is harming individual well-being. The author posits that being impolite, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, can make people less happy, more depressed, and angrier. Citing research, the piece shows that courteous behavior is linked to higher happiness, and this effect holds true even when the courtesy is not reciprocated. The author suggests three personal rules: make courtesy a habit in all interactions, renounce sarcasm, and respond to rudeness with dignity, framing politeness as a countercultural act of personal freedom.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas announced that FBI Director Kash Patel has approved his request for the bureau to assist in locating the Texas House Democrats who fled the state. The Democrats left Texas to break quorum and block a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting plan. Cornyn thanked the FBI and President Trump for their swift action, calling the Democrats' move an "irresponsible" stunt. This development marks a significant escalation in the political standoff, introducing federal law enforcement into a state-level legislative dispute over electoral maps that could impact control of the U.S. House.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to use Fort Bliss, a U.S. Army post near El Paso, Texas, to detain up to 1,000 immigrants as part of its large-scale immigration enforcement operations. The facility, named Camp East Montana, is scheduled to open on August 17 with plans to potentially expand to a 5,000-bed capacity, which would make it the largest immigration detention center in the country. According to ICE, the "soft-sided" facility will house undocumented immigrants in removal proceedings and will also be used for deportation flights. The move has drawn criticism from some Democrats who argue that using military bases for detention could negatively impact military readiness.</p>

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has described the demographic trend as a "quiet emergency." In contrast, the number of foreign nationals living in Japan reached a record high of 3.67 million, highlighting their crucial role in addressing labor shortages in the world's second-oldest population.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable is pioneering consumer-grade headphones equipped with a brain-computer interface (BCI) that uses EEG sensors to monitor brainwaves. The technology can interpret electrical signals to measure a user's focus levels, prompting them to take breaks when attention wanes, and is now being developed to track broader brain health metrics. Unlike trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, this BCI measures brain activity at its source, potentially enabling early detection of issues like cognitive decline or depression. The company aims to license its technology for use in other devices like earbuds and helmets, making neurotechnology more accessible.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, the fifth cut since August of last year. The decision was narrowly passed by the Monetary Policy Committee, indicating that future cuts will be carefully considered amid concerns about rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. The rate cut will provide immediate relief for homeowners with tracker mortgages but will likely mean lower returns for savers. Bank Governor Andrew Bailey stated that while the path for rates is still "downwards," the economy's slow growth and a softening labor market create uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
