His comments come as U.S. President Trump prepares for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, where Trump suggested a deal could involve "some swapping of territories."

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 14:28:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bollywood's depiction of Kashmir has transformed significantly over the decades, shifting from a romantic paradise to a conflict-ridden battleground. Early films used the region as a scenic backdrop for love stories, largely ignoring its political complexities. However, the rise of militancy in the late 1980s led to narratives centered on conflict, often portraying Indian soldiers as heroes against Pakistan-backed insurgents. Recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," reflect a more nationalistic perspective aligned with government narratives, sparking debate over one-sided portrayals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers after its new president, Lee Jae Myung, halted anti-Pyongyang broadcasts to ease tensions. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which included blasting K-pop and critical messages, had recently intensified. While this development is a step towards reducing friction, tensions may rise again with upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon denies any conspiracy to ruin her predecessor, Alex Salmond, and accuses him of being willing to destroy their party, the SNP. Sturgeon recounts her shock at the sexual misconduct allegations against Salmond and her refusal to intervene in the investigation, which she says led to their political and personal break. She describes Salmond's claims of a conspiracy as a fabrication by a man unwilling to reflect on his own conduct. Sturgeon also reflects on the emotional toll of their estrangement.</p>

          <p>Authorities have lifted the final evacuation orders related to the Canyon fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, which has burned over 5,000 acres and is now 28% contained. The fire, which started Thursday, was fueled by a significant heat wave affecting Southern California, with inland areas experiencing triple-digit temperatures. While firefighting efforts are progressing, a Kern County Fire Department battalion chief was seriously injured in a vehicle rollover while working on the fire. The regional heat advisory is expected to remain in effect until Monday evening.</p>

          <p>Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine along the border with Cambodia, with one sustaining a severe leg injury. The incident occurred in Sisaket province just days after the two nations agreed to extend a ceasefire that ended their deadliest clashes in decades. Thailand accused Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention by laying new mines, a charge Cambodia denies, stating the mines are likely remnants from past conflicts. The explosion complicates efforts to peacefully resolve the long-running border dispute over ancient temples, which recently flared into a five-day armed conflict.</p>

          <p>A comparative taste test of 11 popular canned coconut milk brands has ranked Simply Asia's product as the worst option for consumers. The review, conducted by Chowhound, cited a poor texture reminiscent of curdled milk and a rancid taste. Unlike higher-ranked brands that were well-emulsified and creamy, Simply Asia's product was described as separated, oily, and containing overly solid chunks. The article advises shoppers to avoid this brand in favor of others, such as Target's Good & Gather, to ensure quality in their cooking and baking.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's decision to halt weapons exports to Israel for use in Gaza has created a significant political rift within his own conservative CDU/CSU alliance.

However, the decision has also received support from other conservatives and from the junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD). Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil stated that while Germany offers solidarity with Israel, wrongdoings must be called out.</p>

Using sophisticated mapping software, they drew lines that locked in GOP majorities in Congress and statehouses for a decade, even when Democrats won more votes.

          <p>Newly released documents reveal that radioactive water leaked from the Royal Navy's Coulport nuclear weapons depot into Loch Long in Scotland due to burst pipes. The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, show that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) cited "shortfalls in maintenance" for the incidents. One leak in 2019 resulted in the release of low levels of tritium. While the Ministry of Defence insists there were no unsafe releases, Sepa's assessments found the risk to be of "no regulatory concern."</p>

          <h2>Democrats Signal New Aggressive Strategy to Counter Republican Gerrymandering</h2>

          <p>In response to Republican-led efforts to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, a faction of the Democratic party is adopting a more aggressive, "fight fire with fire" strategy. Democratic governors in states like California, New York, and Illinois have declared their intent to pursue their own partisan gerrymanders to neutralize the GOP's advantage. This marks a significant shift from the party's previous high-road motto and support for independent commissions. Some prominent Democrats now argue that such tactics are a necessary response to an anti-democracy push from the GOP.</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers spent over $104 million to renovate the historic St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating for decades. The project preserved original architectural elements like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities. Of the 205 units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with market-rate rents ranging from $3,130 to $6,950 per month, blending historic preservation with new housing development.

          <p>Several German cities have offered to take in and provide medical care for seriously ill or traumatized children from Gaza, but the federal government is showing reluctance. The cities require federal support for entry and coordination, but the Interior and Foreign Ministries are citing security concerns and prioritizing aid on the ground. Conservative politicians have expressed fears that the initiative could trigger a new wave of immigration through family reunification. This hesitation contrasts with countries like Italy and Spain, which have already accepted injured children from the conflict zone.</p>

A former federal judge, he was widely credited with troubleshooting the agencies and rebuilding public trust through his fair, non-political leadership. He left a long legacy of public service.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has updated his guidance in a new book. He now suggests that a safe initial withdrawal rate could be closer to 4.7% for a 30-year retirement, thanks to more sophisticated portfolio diversification. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and don't spend enough, and his research aims to help them maximize their nest egg. He notes that inflation is the greatest enemy of retirees and that certain strategies can help increase withdrawal rates safely. (not investment advice)</p>
