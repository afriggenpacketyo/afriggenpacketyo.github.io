          <p>Cameron McGerr, 16, is passionately advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools, driven by the tragic loss of both his parents to heart conditions. He believes that having known life-saving skills at a younger age might have enabled him to intervene during their crises. Having successfully introduced the training at his own school in Inverclyde, Cameron's "Pulse of Life" campaign seeks to expand this vital education nationwide. Health groups and medical charities strongly support the initiative, highlighting that increased CPR confidence could significantly improve Scotland's current one-in-ten survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has offered to meet with Cameron, signaling growing governmental recognition of this crucial public health need.</p>

          <p>Tuesday's front pages are dominated by the Gaza ceasefire and the emotional release of hostages, with headlines proclaiming "Freed from hell" and "two years of torment over." The articles feature poignant images of reunited families, including Avinatan Or making a heart gesture and the Berman twins' "hug of love." President Trump's declaration of a "historic dawn" in the Middle East is widely reported, though some outlets, like the Financial Times, caution that lasting peace is not yet a certainty. Discussions also suggest Trump may now turn his attention to ending the Ukraine war, potentially eyeing a Nobel Peace Prize for his diplomatic efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European stock markets are projected to open lower on Tuesday, reversing earlier positive sentiment, primarily due to escalating trade dispute threats between the U.S. and China. President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, in response to China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, has heightened investor anxiety. China controls approximately 70% of the global supply of these critical high-tech minerals, vital for industries like semiconductors and defense. Investors are closely monitoring the IMF and World Bank annual meetings for the latest World Economic Outlook report, seeking clarity on global economic stability. Despite the tension, Trump later posted that trade relations "will all be fine," adding a layer of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Torrential rains have tragically caused widespread flooding across five Mexican states, with the death toll rising to 64 and 65 people still reported missing as search operations intensify. The disaster has severely damaged an estimated 100,000 homes, and in the oil-producing town of Poza Rica, cleanup efforts are significantly complicated by thick oil deposits carried by the floodwaters. President Claudia Sheinbaum assured the public of sufficient resources for the emergency response, acknowledging that establishing access to some 200 cut-off communities could still take days. The deadly downpours are attributed to the dissipation of two tropical systems, Hurricane Pricilla and Tropical Storm Raymond.</p>

          <p>China has imposed sanctions on five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, accusing them of cooperating with Washington's probe into the Chinese shipping industry. This move, which took immediate effect, prohibits Chinese organizations and individuals from conducting business with the sanctioned companies. It serves as direct retaliation for recent U.S. decisions to impose steep fees on Chinese ships and Beijing's expanded rare earths export controls. Following the announcement, Hanwha Ocean's shares in Seoul plunged over 8%, highlighting the immediate financial impact of these escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is urgently advocating for a targeted prostate cancer screening program, asserting it would be affordable, deliverable, and save countless lives. His comments come as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its previous decision against routine screening. The proposed program would focus on men aged 45-69 with a family history and Black men, a group facing double the risk, costing an estimated £25 million annually. While some medical experts express skepticism about overtreatment risks, Sunak highlights the increased reliability of testing with MRI scans, making the "moment now" for implementation. He emphasized the importance of early detection, having seen family and friends impacted by the disease.</p>

This robust performance, especially from qualified institutional buyers, underscores India's dynamic IPO market and LG Electronics India's strong position as a market leader in consumer electronics and home appliances.

          <p>Singapore's economy expanded faster than expected in the third quarter, with a 2.9% year-on-year GDP increase, surpassing economists' forecasts. However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026 as trade-related sectors normalize. Manufacturing, particularly biomedical and general manufacturing, was a drag on growth, while construction and financial services are expected to benefit from infrastructure spending and accommodative conditions. Despite recent declines in inflation, the MAS kept its policy settings unchanged, indicating a "comfortable hold" rather than a dovish pause, with the bar for further easing remaining high. Non-oil domestic exports saw an 11.3% decline in August, the sharpest drop since March 2024. (not investment advice)</p>
