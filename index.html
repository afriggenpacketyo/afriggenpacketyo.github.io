          <p>An immigrant father from Uganda shares his emotional experience watching his son begin kindergarten in a well-resourced American school. He contrasts his son's comfortable classroom with his own starkly different first day of school in a rural Ugandan church with a dirt floor. The author reflects on the sacrifices made and the generosity of others that led to this moment, viewing his son's opportunity as the fulfillment of a long-held dream. This personal milestone underscores his gratitude for being a present father, a role his own absent father could not fill.</p>

Despite an early morning start, which he admitted is not his preference, Alcaraz dominated the match with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 win. He briefly received medical attention for his knee in the second set but stated it was not a cause for concern and quickly recovered.

          <p>An emergency court hearing regarding President Trump's effort to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position has ended without an immediate decision. Cook's legal team is seeking a temporary restraining order, arguing the president's action is unlawful and exceeds his constitutional authority. The administration claims it has "cause" for her removal based on allegations of false statements on mortgage applications, which Cook's lawsuit does not address. The case raises significant questions about the independence of the U.S. central bank and could set a precedent for presidential power over its governors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts, seniors have several methods to borrow from their home equity without refinancing their existing low-rate mortgages. One key option available only to those 62 and older is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner without requiring monthly repayments. Other accessible methods include home equity loans, which offer fixed rates that are currently declining, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide flexible borrowing with variable rates. These alternatives allow homeowners to tap into record-high equity levels amid a challenging economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology fell sharply after the company's data center revenue for the second quarter missed analyst expectations. Additionally, Marvell issued a lackluster forecast for the current quarter, projecting revenue of $2.06 billion, which is below Wall Street's consensus of $2.11 billion. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the flat sequential guidance to the non-linear nature of its custom AI chip business, though he expects stronger growth in the fourth quarter.

          <p>The U.S. government has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was a response to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace negotiations. This move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for all UN-related diplomatic missions. The ban comes as several countries, including France, are advocating for the recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.</p>

          <p>President Trump has informed Congress of his intent to cut $4.9 billion in previously approved foreign aid funding for the State Department and USAID. The administration is utilizing a rare procedural move known as a "pocket rescission," which involves submitting the request so late in the fiscal year that the funds expire before Congress is required to vote. The action has drawn bipartisan criticism, with lawmakers like Republican Senator Susan Collins and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy arguing it illegally sidesteps Congress's constitutional power over government spending. This follows a separate, congressionally approved reduction in USAID's budget earlier in the year.</p>

Zelensky stated that any such deal could require Ukraine to cede territory, a condition he rejects, suggesting Russia should instead retreat from occupied areas.

The move is viewed by critics as a test case for using the military as a domestic police force and conditioning the public to authoritarianism.

          <p>Tesla is seeking to overturn or receive a new trial for a lawsuit verdict that found the company partially liable for a fatal 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. A jury had ordered Tesla to pay $242.5 million in damages for the collision, which killed 22-year-old Naibel Benavides and severely injured her boyfriend. In its appeal, Tesla argues that its Model S had no design defects and that the crash was caused entirely by driver recklessness, not the vehicle's technology. The plaintiffs' counsel maintains that the jury correctly found shared responsibility due to Tesla's misrepresentations of Autopilot's capabilities.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the US Open after a decisive 6-1, 6-2 loss to 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. Raducanu struggled against Rybakina's powerful serves and dominant groundstrokes, unable to gain momentum throughout the 62-minute match. The defeat highlights Raducanu's ongoing challenge against top-10 opponents and serves as a reality check despite her recent progress and return to form. Rybakina's aggressive play, marked by 23 winners, effectively neutralized Raducanu's game and secured her a spot in the fourth round for the first time at Flushing Meadows.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the initial stages of an expanded offensive into Gaza City, declaring it a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending humanitarian pauses. This escalation of the war against Hamas comes as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that the bodies of two hostages, including Ilan Weiss, had been recovered from the enclave. The planned offensive has drawn international condemnation and sparked protests within Israel from citizens and hostage families demanding a deal for the release of the remaining captives. The move further strains the limited critical infrastructure and health facilities remaining in the densely populated city.</p>

          <p>Share prices for major UK banks, including NatWest and Lloyds, declined following a proposal for a new windfall tax on the sector's profits. The Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank suggested the tax could raise up to £8 billion annually to offset taxpayer costs associated with the Bank of England's quantitative easing program. The IPPR argues that the program's design has resulted in a multi-billion-pound subsidy to commercial banks. Financial services body UK Finance opposes the idea, warning that an additional tax would harm Britain's international competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare a diplomatic victory, as key issues remain unresolved. Details concerning a $350 billion South Korean investment fund and the cost-sharing arrangement for U.S. troops stationed in the country still need to be negotiated.</p>

          <p>An editorial critiques the defense of the Federal Reserve's independence in response to President Trump's attempt to fire Governor Lisa Cook. While condemning Trump's actions as authoritarian, the piece argues that the Fed's independence is not synonymous with democracy and has historically favored business elites over labor and consumers. The article suggests that central bank independence blossomed in the neoliberal era to suit finance, not purely for technocratic efficiency. It calls for a reimagining of central banking to include greater democratic accountability, such as broader board representation and alignment with public priorities, rather than simply defending the current structure.</p>

          <p>This opinion column asserts that the United States is steadily moving towards authoritarianism under President Trump, a trend that is often downplayed or normalized. The author points to the deployment of armed National Guard troops in Washington D.C., the use of federal agencies to investigate political rivals like John Bolton, and attempts to control the Federal Reserve as clear evidence. The piece argues these actions are part of a systematic effort to amass power, neutralize opposition, and undermine democratic institutions like the separation of powers and fair elections.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many consumers are seeking debt relief. Qualifying for these programs depends on the specific option and an individual's financial situation. Traditional debt consolidation loans typically require a credit score above 650, while debt relief company programs may have more lenient requirements. For those facing severe hardship, debt forgiveness programs can negotiate to reduce the total amount owed, and debt management plans can lower interest rates. Other options include temporary forbearance from card issuers or, as a last resort, bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is the latest in the Trump administration's efforts to halt the growth of renewable energy. The largest affected project is the Humboldt Bay Offshore Wind marine terminal in California, which lost about $427 million in support. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy claimed the funds were for "wasteful" projects and would be redirected to other maritime industry upgrades, a decision that renewable energy executives warn will lead to higher power prices.</p>

          <p>For savers seeking stable returns, a certificate of deposit (CD) offers a predictable way to earn interest, with current rates providing significant gains. A $30,000 CD could earn between approximately $317 for a 3-month term and over $6,700 for a 5-year term, based on today's average rates. Opening a CD now allows savers to lock in these high rates before the Federal Reserve implements expected rate cuts. However, this option requires giving up liquidity, as funds cannot be withdrawn before the term ends without incurring a penalty, making it crucial to weigh against more flexible options like high-yield savings accounts.
