She is the fifth person to be convicted in connection with the plot, which includes her son, who is already serving a life sentence.

          <p>The U.S. supply chain is bracing for new economic pressures as the government imposes significant tariffs on Chinese-made freight vessels and port machinery. The U.S. Trade Representative announced additional fees, including tariffs up to 150% on essential equipment like cranes, which could raise the total rate to 270%. Industry groups have warned that these measures will increase costs for importers, hinder supply chain expansion, and ultimately affect U.S. consumers. These actions are part of a broader trade dispute, with China recently announcing its own retaliatory measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the unique evolution of cumbia music in Ecuador, which began in the 1960s by blending traditional Andean rhythms with Colombian influences. Musician Polibio Mayorga is credited with pioneering this hybrid genre, creating a new cultural identity for migrants moving to urban centers. The sound was later popularized nationwide by artists like Medardo Luzuriaga and his orchestra, whose music remains a core part of the country's collective memory. The piece also examines modern forms like tecnocumbia and the experiences of performers in all-female groups.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the two-year war in Gaza suggests that Israel's military strategy, while achieving its immediate goals, could establish a bleak new standard for counterinsurgency warfare. The approach, characterized by overwhelming force and causing immense civilian casualties, disregarded traditional doctrines that prioritize winning over local populations. Despite international condemnation, the war concluded with a U.S.-brokered peace deal favorable to Israel's terms, including the release of all living hostages. This outcome may lead other nations to conclude that such brutal tactics are effective, potentially eroding international norms around the laws of war.</p>

Inside the apartment, detectives found stolen jewelry, cash, and equipment used to produce "pink cocaine," connecting the suspects to at least five burglaries in the region.

Trump's aggressive diplomacy succeeded in forcing a resolution that Netanyahu likely would have avoided to prolong his hold on power and delay facing corruption charges. The agreement, which implicitly moves toward a two-state solution, has left Netanyahu diplomatically isolated and criticized at home. The outcome underscores a shift where U.S. regional strategy has taken precedence over the Israeli leader's political agenda.</p>

          <p>England defender Millie Bright has announced her retirement from international football, ending a nine-year career that saw her become one of the country's most influential players. Bright was a cornerstone of the Lionesses' defense during their historic Euro 2022 victory and captained the team to the 2023 World Cup final. With 88 caps, she was known for her leadership both on and off the pitch, serving as a mentor to younger players. Her retirement marks a changing of the guard for the national team as a new generation of defenders emerges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump made a significant geographical error while speaking to journalists, claiming that one could walk from Iran to Qatar "in one second." In reality, the two nations are separated by the Persian Gulf and do not share a land border. The comment was made as Trump praised Qatar's role in mediating the recent Gaza peace deal. Critics on social media quickly pointed out the gaffe, sharing maps to highlight the inaccuracy and adding it to a list of previous geographical mistakes made by the president.</p>

          <p>Over 150 unvaccinated students in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, have been quarantined for 21 days after a potential exposure to measles. The state is currently experiencing a surge in cases, reflecting a nationwide trend that has seen U.S. measles infections reach a 33-year high. Health officials have confirmed active community transmission in the state and are urging the public to ensure they are vaccinated. The MMR vaccine is highly effective at preventing the disease, which can lead to serious complications, and most recent cases have occurred in unvaccinated individuals.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast interview, former President Barack Obama criticized companies, universities, and law firms that have altered their policies or settled with the Trump administration. He argued that these institutions should have stood by their convictions, such as diversity initiatives, rather than yielding to political pressure. Obama suggested that organizations have the capacity and resources, like university endowments, to "ride this out" and resist being bullied into compromising their core values. He emphasized that integrity can be uncomfortable but is essential when confronting certain political pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning the sale of new Glock handguns in California due to a design feature that allows them to be easily converted into fully automatic weapons. The legislation targets the pistol's susceptibility to modification with a small, illegal device known as a "Glock Switch." While the law does not prohibit the possession or resale of used Glocks, it aims to pressure the manufacturer to redesign the firearm to prevent such conversions. The bill was supported by gun control advocates but opposed by Republicans who argue it unfairly restricts access to a popular handgun.</p>

          <h2>Experts Highlight Ambiguities and Challenges in Trump's Gaza Peace Plan</h2>

          <p>While the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is a significant first step, experts point out that the 20-point peace plan is deliberately vague, leaving many critical questions unanswered. Key unresolved issues include the specifics of a full Israeli military withdrawal, the composition and mandate of a proposed "international stabilization force," and the long-term future of Hamas. The plan calls for the complete demilitarization of Gaza but lacks clear benchmarks or a timeline, creating potential loopholes. Analysts suggest that sustained U.S. pressure will be crucial to navigate these ambiguities and prevent the fragile agreement from collapsing.</p>
