          <p>Japan is showcasing its Mogami-class multi-mission frigate, the Yahagi, in Darwin, Australia, to vie for a contract to build Australia's new-generation fleet. MSDF officials are emphasizing the frigate's stealth features and smaller crew size compared to German vessels. The Australian government is considering the Mogami-class frigate and Germany's MEKO A200 frigate to replace its Anzac-class frigates, with a decision expected by the end of the year. The Australian government is planning a major naval expansion amid growing concerns about China's military presence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 5% increase on Friday, recovering from a significant drop caused by escalating tensions between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts attributed the initial market downturn to a Politico report suggesting Trump intended to contact Musk to resolve their conflict. However, a White House official refuted these claims, stating Trump had no interest in speaking with Musk. The disagreement stemmed from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill following the end of Musk's tenure as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

The central bank reduced rates by 100 basis points, from 21% held since last October. Seasonally-adjusted inflation in April was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank stated that while domestic demand growth still exceeds the capacity to expand the supply of goods and services, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path, and monetary policy will remain tight to achieve a 4% inflation target.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's travel ban, targeting several countries, appears illogical at first glance but reveals a pattern when considering the history of American imperialism. The targeted nations are primarily in the global south, with predominantly Black, brown, or Muslim populations, and many have high poverty rates or have experienced social upheaval due to war. The article argues that the poverty and insecurity in these nations are largely a result of historical and ongoing US military and economic intervention. The travel ban is described as a cruel escalation of policies that profit off vulnerable populations while denying them access to safety built at their expense.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules requiring UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its takeover of Credit Suisse in 2023. The measures aim to ensure UBS fully capitalizes its foreign units and reduces share buybacks. The Swiss National Bank supports these measures, stating they will significantly strengthen UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of a government bailout in a crisis.

This move could open one of the US’s most pristine wilderness areas to water pollution risks. The bill includes provisions that rescind the Biden administration’s 20-year mining prohibition in the Superior national forest and grants Twin Metals 20-year mining leases. Conservationists argue the bill may violate Senate rules and that the proposed mine poses a threat to water quality.</p>

From the rebellious teens of the 1950s to the stressed-out overachievers of the 21st century, teen films have long served as a mirror to society's fears and fascinations. The author discusses the changing landscape of teen culture, noting that teenagers are increasingly creating their own content and communities online. The focus has shifted from adults being afraid *of* teens to adults being afraid *for* teens, and newly distressed about their own role in the troubles facing them.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a strategic railway project linking the Kashmir Valley to the Indian mainland for the first time. The 272-kilometer line is part of Modi’s broader push for infrastructure development in the region, aimed at enhancing Kashmir’s connectivity with the rest of India.
