          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. His extensive career in public service spanned from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, serving under Presidents Carter, Reagan, and George H.W. Bush. Before his agency leadership, Webster was a federal judge and a U.S. Navy lieutenant in two wars. He was widely praised for his integrity and dedication to public service throughout his distinguished career.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reformed its civil service summer internship program, now restricting applications to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds to improve representation. The move has divided prospective applicants, with some students from working-class families praising the increased opportunity and feeling they will now be taken seriously. However, others who no longer qualify, such as those whose parents are nurses or teachers, feel unfairly excluded and deflated by the new criteria. The change aims to make government more reflective of society.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have achieved a significant breakthrough by creating high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare structure first discovered in a meteorite. This variant, known as lonsdaleite, was synthesized in a lab, producing crystals up to 100 micrometers in size. Published in the journal Nature, the research provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence, a goal that has eluded international research teams for years. The discovery confirms that these unique diamonds can be formed from graphite under intense pressure.</p>

          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) showed no year-on-year change in July, while producer prices continued to decline, signaling persistent weak demand in the nation's economy amid trade uncertainties. The flat CPI reading was slightly better than market forecasts, which had predicted a minor decline. Despite a monthly rise attributed to policies aimed at boosting domestic demand, the overall data points to ongoing economic challenges. Food prices fell by 1.6%, while service prices saw a modest increase. (not investment advice)</p>

At 11:02 a.m., a moment of silence was observed to commemorate the exact time the "Fat Man" bomb was dropped in 1945. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reiterated the country's commitment to being a non-nuclear state, though Japan still relies on the U.S. nuclear deterrent and has not signed the UN prohibition treaty. Representatives from 94 countries, including Russia and Israel, attended the event.</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County police officer was killed following a shooting incident near the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta. The officer, identified as David Rose, was responding to reports of an active shooter and was fatally wounded. The suspect was later found deceased from what may have been a self-inflicted gunshot wound, after firing multiple rounds at the CDC building. No civilians were injured, but the event prompted a lockdown and shelter-in-place order, causing significant distress in the community.</p>

During the filming of a documentary, a genetic test revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. The 41-year-old star said the discovery prompted a deeper self-reflection on his purpose and what he contributes to the world, rather than just what he accumulates.

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on both small "pick-me-ups" and larger, memorable experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," sees consumers cutting back on daily essentials while splurging on items from makeup to concert tickets. Analysts note this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the unattainability of traditional milestones like homeownership for younger generations. This shift indicates that celebrating smaller "inch-stones" has become a way to find joy amid ongoing financial pressures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to BTIG's chief market technician, the stock market has shown a technical signal suggesting a pullback from recent all-time highs is imminent. The strategist predicts the S&P 500 could experience a 5% sell-off, potentially falling to the 6,100 level, which previously acted as a resistance point. Several factors are cited as warning signs, including weakness in consumer-focused stocks, a potential lag in the semiconductor sector, and the risk of widening credit spreads. The analysis notes a lack of new buying enthusiasm for mega-cap tech stocks after strong earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have suffered a major blow with offensive tackle Rashawn Slater sustaining a ruptured patellar tendon, an injury that will end his 2025 season. Coach Jim Harbaugh described the loss of the cornerstone lineman as a "gut punch," creating a somber mood around the team. Slater's absence forces a significant reshuffling of the offensive line, with Joe Alt moving to left tackle and Trey Pipkins III likely stepping into the right tackle role. The team is now exploring the free-agent market to add depth to its depleted offensive line.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Azerbaijan and Armenia have signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, aimed at ending decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Donald Trump, the deal was described as a "significant milestone" that will see the two nations stop all fighting "forever" and reopen key transport and diplomatic relations. As part of the agreement, the U.S. will help build a major transit corridor connecting Azerbaijan with its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has seen an "uptick" in complaints regarding models in high street fashion ads who appear "unhealthily thin." Retailers like Zara, Next, and M&S have recently had advertisements banned over this issue, sparking debate about a potential return of the "heroin chic" aesthetic of the 1990s. While brands claim the models are healthy, the ASA ruled that posing, lighting, and styling made them appear unhealthily thin, which could present an irresponsible and aspirational body image. This trend is raising concerns among activists and industry experts.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on August 15 to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump suggested a deal is close and would involve the "swapping of territories," a condition Ukraine has repeatedly rejected. The Kremlin confirmed the summit, calling it "logical." The announcement follows reports that Putin would agree to a ceasefire if Kyiv withdraws its forces from the Donbass region, effectively ceding occupied territories to Russia. The proposed meeting marks a significant diplomatic development in the ongoing war.</p>

Vance is currently on a holiday visit to the UK, staying with Lammy at his country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences of difficult childhoods, their Christian faith, and their education at elite U.S. universities. This personal relationship is seen as potentially valuable for UK-US relations, particularly given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the Trump administration.</p>
