          <p>Scientists have sonified data from the European Space Agency's Swarm mission, representing the Laschamps geomagnetic reversal 41,000 years ago through natural sounds. This event caused a significant weakening of the magnetic field, increasing cosmic ray exposure and potentially impacting climate and megafauna extinction. The resulting soundscape provides a unique auditory experience of this geological event.  The research helps scientists better understand and predict future magnetic field fluctuations.</p>
