          <h2>India and Pakistan Accuse Each Other of Ceasefire Violations After U.S.-Brokered Truce</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, India and Pakistan have accused each other of violating the agreement with explosions reported in Indian-administered Kashmir. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated that Pakistan violated the truce, while Pakistan denies these claims. The ceasefire came after a significant escalation involving drone and missile strikes. While President Trump announced the initial agreement, the extent of U.S. involvement remains unclear, as both nations had been engaged in military operations after a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir last month, for which India blamed Pakistan.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's tax agenda moves forward, key issues and potential roadblocks are emerging, particularly within the House Ways and Means Committee. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the package without Democratic support through reconciliation, but the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for a fiscally responsible package could complicate the process. Negotiations are ongoing, with debates focusing on specific provisions and their impact on millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee will debate and advance this legislation on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing criticism for potentially being "Too Late" in adjusting interest rates, as President Trump pressures for cuts despite economic uncertainties. Economists suggest Powell's cautious approach, given conflicting signals from tariffs and economic data, puts him in a no-win situation. The Fed's reluctance to act preemptively, especially with volatile policies like Trump's tariffs, risks being behind the curve, particularly if the labor market is used as the primary guide. Powell's confidence in a solid economy clashes with surveys showing heightened worries in manufacturing and service sectors.</p>

          <p>The new German government, a coalition of the CDU/CSU and SPD, faces significant challenges, including a slumping economy and a growing far-right opposition. The coalition aims to strengthen the economy, limit illegal migration, and restore order. However, disagreements persist, particularly regarding social policy cuts. The government plans to increase border controls and refusals to address concerns about immigration, while also investing in modernization projects. In foreign policy, Germany seeks to redefine its role in Europe amid shifts in U.S. policy and threats from Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to add at least 20,000 officers to enforce his deportation policies. The administration is also pursuing multiple pathways to encourage undocumented immigrants to self-deport, including offering bonuses and paid travel. Other deportation methods have faced legal challenges, with federal courts blocking Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act. The self-deportation initiative, dubbed "Project Homecoming," includes potential penalties for those who remain in the U.S.</p>

While the United States focused on the moon, the Soviet Union aimed to explore Venus, launching numerous missions to the planet.
