          <p>Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who designed America's first hydrogen bomb at the young age of 23, passed away at 97. Despite his crucial role in developing the weapon, Garwin remained relatively unknown to the public for decades, with Edward Teller initially receiving most of the credit. He later advised numerous presidents on defense policies and contributed significantly to advancements in computing, communications, and medicine at IBM. Garwin also advocated for nuclear arms control and opposed the Star Wars missile defense system, emphasizing the importance of a strategic balance of power to deter nuclear attacks.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address overcrowding in prisons across England and Wales, the government will implement limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their licenses. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled to prison will be released after a fixed 28-day period, freeing up approximately 1,400 prison spaces. This measure aims to provide ministers with time to overhaul the system, which is described as being "on the brink of collapse," while new prisons are being constructed. The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years who are recalled for breaching their license terms, but not to those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>Shares of the stock trading app eToro experienced a significant surge in their Nasdaq debut, climbing 40% after raising nearly $310 million in its initial public offering. The company, based in Israel, sold almost six million shares at $52 each, exceeding the anticipated range of $46 to $50, resulting in a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. This IPO is being closely watched as a potential indicator of renewed interest in IPOs following a prolonged slowdown. EToro, which had previously shelved plans to go public through a SPAC merger in 2022, has seen substantial growth in its cryptocurrency business, with revenue from crypto assets more than tripling in 2024.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Donald Trump's tax bill, incorporating trillions of dollars in tax breaks. The House Ways and Means Committee approved the legislation after overnight debates, with a 26-19 party-line vote. However, disagreements persist over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which remains unresolved. While the bill proposes raising the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, some lawmakers advocate for a higher limit. The full House vote is anticipated as early as next week, but significant modifications are expected in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Recent cases in Kenya involving the smuggling of ants have brought attention to the increasing issue of biopiracy and illegal wildlife trade. Four individuals were found guilty of attempting to smuggle ants, including valuable giant African harvester ants, which are prized for their unique behaviors and colony-building abilities. The Kenya Wildlife Service emphasized that such smuggling infringes on the Nagoya Protocol and poses risks to ecosystems, as the introduction of non-native species can have detrimental consequences. The illegal trade in wild animals also raises concerns about zoonotic diseases, with the transport of animals in unhygienic conditions increasing the risk of infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants and some temporary foreign residents, reigniting a long-standing legal debate. The challenge is based on the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction. Trump has argued that the amendment was intended to address slavery, not tourism or immigration. Legal scholars and courts have largely upheld birthright citizenship, citing the 1898 case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, but the Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on bail. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri's detention was based on his First Amendment speech in support of Palestine and association with his wife and father-in-law. Suri, a visiting scholar with lawful status, could be released once ICE receives the written order. The judge concluded that Suri is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, allowing him to participate in his removal proceedings while out on bail.</p>

While some critics have voiced concerns about Qatar's role in the Gaza conflict and its relationship with Hamas, others have defended its efforts to mediate and facilitate hostage releases.

          <p>Milwaukee Judge Hannah Dugan has been indicted on federal charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings after she allegedly helped an undocumented immigrant avoid federal agents. The indictment follows her arrest in April, which has drawn condemnation from Democratic leaders and lawyers, while the Trump administration defends the prosecution as upholding the rule of law. The case involves Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national, who was in court for battery charges when ICE agents were waiting to arrest him. Judge Dugan is accused of directing him out of a side door to avoid the agents, leading to her suspension from her position as a circuit judge.</p>

          <p>Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old woman who has lived in the U.S. since she was 4, is facing deportation to Mexico despite the dismissal of traffic charges that led to her arrest by ICE. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. without authorization in 2010, does not qualify for DACA. Despite the dismissal of the charges, ICE maintains that she and her father, who was also detained, are in the country illegally and must face the consequences. The case has sparked unease in her community, even among conservatives, with many feeling that she is not a criminal and is being unfairly targeted.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing fluctuations in U.S. tariff policies, consumers are seeking strategies to mitigate the impact on their household budgets. With recent agreements between the U.S. and China reducing tariffs, shopping expert Trae Bodge advises consumers to look for sales, check the origin of products, and purchase domestic goods. Electronics and toys are expected to be the most affected by tariffs, so shoppers should consider whether these items are worth purchasing. Bodge recommends that consumers consider purchasing items they were already planning to buy, such as dishwashers or cars, sooner rather than later, but advises against panic shopping.</p>

          <p>A report by the RAND Corporation has found that prescription drug prices in the U.S. are almost three times higher on average than in 33 other high-income countries. This is attributed to the U.S.' complex reimbursement system and lack of national pricing control, where prices are set by pharmaceutical companies and negotiated by private insurers. While the branded market for U.S. pharmaceuticals is expensive, the U.S. system is efficient at lowering costs for unbranded generic drugs, which account for 90% of prescription volumes.

          <p>Margaret Fiander, a former FedEx employee, is suing the company, alleging she was fired for attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and that her termination was due to racial discrimination. Fiander, who is white, claims that Latino employees received preferential treatment while she was treated less favorably. She alleges that her supervisor failed to accommodate her disability and discriminated against her because of her race. FedEx denies the allegations and asserts its commitment to a workplace free from discrimination.</p>
