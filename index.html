The decision followed a call between President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, aimed at providing time to negotiate a new trade deal. The current tariffs include a 25% duty on cars and fentanyl-related items, and a 50% tariff on metals, which Mexico will continue to pay during this period. The administration stated that Mexico also agreed to terminate non-tariff trade barriers, though specifics were not provided. (not investment advice)</p>

McIntire, who has completed 10 marathons, later finished the ride virtually. She emphasized the importance of aligning her athletic pursuits with a higher purpose and highlighted that her donation saved a person's life with minimal personal cost.</p>

In exchange, the Guardians will receive pitching prospect Khal Stephen.

The move aims to strengthen the Blue Jays' pitching rotation as they lead the AL East, while the Guardians, who are struggling in their division, continue to reshape their roster.</p>

On Wednesday alone, 898 people were brought ashore in the UK, contributing to the rising total. In response, the UK government is increasing intelligence sharing with France to dismantle smuggling networks, and a new pilot scheme will see some migrants returned to France. Campaigners continue to advocate for more safe and legal routes to deter the dangerous crossings.</p>

          <p>Shares of the gaming platform Roblox jumped 16% after the company reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations. The company announced net bookings of $1.44 billion, a 51% year-over-year increase, and a 41% rise in daily active users to 111.8 million. Despite a net loss of $279.38 million, the strong user growth and engagement metrics prompted Roblox to raise its booking guidance for the third quarter. The positive performance reflects strategic investments in its platform and the recent rollout of new age-verification tools to enhance user safety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Druze community in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, who have long maintained a strong Syrian identity, are facing a crisis of loyalty due to recent sectarian violence in southern Syria. Clashes between Sunni Bedouin tribes, Syrian government forces, and Druze factions in the Sweida region have killed over 1,000 people. This has led to disillusionment with Syria's interim government, which some Golan Druze accuse of fueling sectarianism. During the fighting, some Druze from the Golan crossed into Syria to aid relatives, while others welcomed Israeli airstrikes intended to protect their community, further complicating regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>A remarkable new study suggests that the ancestor of the modern potato arose from an improbable hybridization event between an ancient tomato and a different flowering plant from the Etuberosum group. This chance union, occurring 8 to 9 million years ago, created a new species with a novel ability: forming tubers. Neither parent plant could form tubers, but the hybrid combined the right genetic material to do so, allowing it to thrive in new, harsher environments and diversify into over 100 species. The discovery challenges the traditional view of hybridization as an evolutionary dead end, showcasing it as a powerful creative force.</p>

          <p>CVS Health's shares rose over 6% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst estimates and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. The strong performance was attributed to improvements in its retail pharmacy business and its Aetna insurance unit, which has been working to recover from rising medical costs. CEO David Joyner highlighted the success of investments in pharmacy labor, technology, and a new drug pricing model. This positive result marks the third full quarter under Joyner, who took over amid efforts to boost profitability and the company's stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. The administration is appealing a lower court ruling that found the president lacked the authority to implement the duties. Challengers, including 12 states and several small businesses, argue that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs and that the president's actions violate constitutional principles by usurping Congress's power. The administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national emergencies like trade deficits and fentanyl trafficking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>High Noon is recalling some of its 12-pack vodka seltzers due to a packaging error that resulted in alcoholic seltzer being placed in cans mislabeled as Celsius energy drinks. The mix-up occurred at a third-party packaging supplier shared by the two distinct brands. The recall affects variety packs shipped to six states, and consumers are warned of the risk of unintentional alcohol ingestion. The FDA and Celsius have urged customers to check lot codes and lid colors on certain products. No illnesses have been reported, and the companies have launched a joint investigation into the supply-chain failure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Energy has reported the discovery of a radioactive wasp nest at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, a facility formerly used for producing nuclear weapon components. The nest was found near tanks that store liquid nuclear waste and showed radiation levels more than 10 times the allowable federal limit. Officials stated the contamination was from "legacy" sources in the environment and not a new leak, and that the nest was safely removed and disposed of as radiological waste.

These counterfeit products can be ineffective or contain harmful ingredients.
