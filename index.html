          <h2>Republicans More Likely to Use ACA Marketplace Coverage, Despite Party Efforts to Cut Funding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 09:38:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent KFF poll reveals that nearly half of adults enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health plans identify as Republicans, with a majority identifying as "MAGA" Republicans. This finding is particularly relevant as Republicans on Capitol Hill consider legislation that would cut billions in ACA funding, potentially impacting their own constituents. The self-employed, who tend to lean Republican, often rely on ACA exchanges for coverage, and many red-leaning states have not expanded Medicaid, making ACA tax credits more crucial for residents. If tax credits are not extended, approximately 15 million people could lose their health insurance, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

          <p>The UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, is addressing critical issues impacting the world's oceans, including climate change, plastic pollution, and overfishing. Rising ocean temperatures are causing coral bleaching and reducing oxygen levels, endangering marine life, with projections indicating widespread reef death if temperatures rise significantly. Overfishing exacerbates the problem, disrupting marine ecosystems and threatening food security for over a billion people who rely on fish as a primary protein source. Plastic waste, with millions of tons entering the oceans annually, poses a significant threat to marine life, while changes in ocean currents due to rising temperatures could drastically alter weather patterns and agricultural yields.

          <p>President Trump promoted the new Trump Savings Account program, included in the GOP megabill, during a White House roundtable with lawmakers and CEOs. The program aims to provide a strong start for American children at no cost to taxpayers by depositing $1,000 into a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund for each newborn. Additional contributions up to $5,000 annually would be permitted, allowing the funds to be used for college or a down payment on a home upon adulthood. House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the policy as a transformative measure to help American families and set up the next generation for success.

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, which alleged civil extortion and defamation. The lawsuit stemmed from Lively's accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation against Baldoni during the production of "It Ends With Us," accusations Baldoni denies. A separate defamation lawsuit filed by Baldoni against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed.

          <p>Israeli authorities deported climate activist Greta Thunberg after intercepting a Gaza-bound aid ship she was aboard, along with eleven others, according to Israel's Foreign Ministry. The ship, part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, aimed to deliver aid and protest Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. The Israeli navy seized the vessel without incident approximately 125 miles off the coast of Gaza, prompting condemnation from the coalition and rights groups, who claim it violates international law.

          <p>As retirees face rising costs and fixed incomes, they are increasingly considering home equity products like HELOCs and reverse mortgages. A HELOC functions as a revolving line of credit, suitable for temporary cash needs and one-time expenses, requiring repayment within a set period. In contrast, a reverse mortgage is a longer-term solution where repayment isn't required until the borrower dies or sells the home, making it suitable for covering monthly expenses. Choosing between the two depends on individual financial circumstances, the purpose of the funds, and the ability to repay.

The judge criticized the Trump administration's handling of OPM records, noting the failure to acknowledge mistakes and follow cybersecurity procedures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to save money and earn returns that outpace inflation. Today's leading CD accounts provide higher returns and the ability to lock in rates for the term of the CD, with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. Strategies for obtaining good CD rates include exploring online banks, which often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and considering short-term CDs, which currently have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, buying CDs with staggered maturity dates, can help take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

Paramount and Skydance are awaiting regulatory approval for their merger amidst a lawsuit filed by President Trump against CBS over a "60 Minutes" interview.

The U.S. Fourteenth Amendment, while intended to extend citizenship to formerly enslaved people, faces challenges in its interpretation regarding undocumented migrants, potentially leading to statelessness.
