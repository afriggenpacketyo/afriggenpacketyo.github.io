          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has requested a federal judge to block President Trump's deployment of National Guard members and Marines to Los Angeles, citing that it threatens democracy. Newsom argues that Trump's actions are unwarranted and stoking more fear and civil unrest in LA, with the state Attorney General arguing the deployment poses imminent harm to state sovereignty. Trump defended his decision, stating that Los Angeles would be burning if the federal government didn't intervene. Newsom's lawsuit claims Trump broke the law by federalizing the California National Guard without the governor's consent. </p>

          <p>A school shooting in Graz, Austria, has resulted in eleven fatalities, making it the deadliest gun attack in the country's recent history. The 21-year-old gunman, a former student, committed suicide in a school bathroom after the attack, and twelve others were injured. Authorities are investigating the gunman's motive, and they confirmed that he legally owned the two guns used in the attack. Austria has declared three days of mourning, and the school will remain closed until further notice.</p>

          <p>Ballymena, County Antrim, experienced a second night of serious disorder with petrol bombs, masonry, and fireworks thrown at police, leading to baton rounds and water cannon deployment. The violence followed an earlier peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault in the town. One assembly member reported a family with three young children had to barricade themselves in their attic during the attacks. A 29-year-old man has been charged with riotous behavior, disorderly behavior, attempted criminal damage, and resisting police, while the police described the actions as "racist thuggery."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major international study of nearly 300,000 children reveals a two-way link between screen time and emotional well-being, where more screen time is associated with aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. The study, analyzing 117 long-term studies, found that children already struggling with social or emotional challenges tended to spend more time on screens. Time spent on gaming consoles was particularly linked to a greater chance of developing issues, while moderate screen time, especially for educational purposes, poses a lower risk. The study recommends ensuring that screen time doesn't interfere with sleep and physical activity.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that embracing wild lawns, as part of movements like "Let It Bloom June," may offer unexpected health benefits. Physically demanding lawn work can lead to muscle strains, back pain, and joint injuries, while chemical pesticides and herbicides pose risks when airborne. Mental health professionals also agree that natural environments promote mindfulness and well-being. Letting nature reclaim the yard could mean fewer chemicals and health hazards, and gardening promotes mindfulness and can lower cortisol levels.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to direct military forces in Los Angeles to arrest civilians, a request exceeding Trump's authorization for the National Guard. Noem's letter sought authority for DoD forces to detain or arrest lawbreakers under Title 18, which typically prohibits defense personnel from direct law enforcement activities. While defense personnel can detain individuals temporarily to protect federal property, the Posse Comitatus Act generally prohibits the U.S. military from enforcing domestic laws. Hegseth did not act on Noem's request, and the Marines sent to LA lack arrest authority, focusing instead on protecting federal property and personnel.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals a surprising increase in the belief of “love at first sight,” with 60 percent of single American adults endorsing the concept, a nearly 30 percent increase from 2014. Researchers attribute this rise to the prevalence of swipe-based dating apps, which encourage quick judgments about potential partners. While some psychologists acknowledge the possibility of instant connections, they caution that passionate love differs from compassionate love and that initial feelings do not guarantee lasting relationships. Despite the potential for unrealistic expectations, the survey indicates that singles haven't given up on romantic idealism.</p>
