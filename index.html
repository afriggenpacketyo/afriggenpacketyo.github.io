          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant operational disruption due to a technology issue, leading to a nationwide ground stop for its mainline flights. The halt impacted major hubs including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, causing hundreds of delays and leaving passengers stranded on tarmacs and at gates. After several hours, the airline resolved the underlying problem and lifted the ground stop, though it cautioned that residual delays would continue as it worked to restore normal operations.</p>

The project aimed to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally restore land that protects communities from hurricanes. However, it faced strong opposition from local oystermen and community members in Plaquemines Parish, who feared it would destroy their fishing industry and way of life, leading to its termination by the governor.</p>

          <p>The UK's Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner, has formally requested that China explain why parts of its plans for a new mega-embassy in London are redacted. The request gives Beijing a two-week deadline and comes amid growing concerns about potential espionage and security risks due to the proposed site's proximity to the city's financial district. The government has taken over the final planning decision from the local council, with a ruling expected by early September.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study from the World Weather Attribution group has found that climate change likely made Pakistan's recent monsoon rains 10-15% heavier, exacerbating the deadly floods. The report links a warmer atmosphere, which holds more moisture, to the increased intensity of the rainfall that has led to at least 300 deaths. The research underscores the nation's extreme vulnerability to climate change, compounded by rapid urbanization in flood-prone areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that inner London boroughs are poised to be the biggest losers in a government plan to overhaul council funding. Some boroughs, such as Camden and Westminster, could see their funding levels fall by as much as 12% after accounting for inflation. The proposed changes aim to redistribute approximately £2.1 billion in annual funding toward areas with higher service demands and lower property tax bases, benefiting many urban areas outside the capital.</p>

This trend is driven by universities seeking the financial stability offered by domestic undergraduates amid uncertainty over international student numbers. As a result, fewer places are expected to be available through the "clearing" system for students who did not initially receive offers.</p>

          <p>New archaeological findings suggest that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence points to a precarious settlement, described as a "favela among the ruins," that existed until the 5th century. This theory, now clearer through new excavations, indicates that people inhabited the upper floors of ash-filled homes and salvaged valuables, challenging the long-held view that the city was completely abandoned after the disaster.</p>
