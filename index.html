            <p>CBS has been granted a temporary reprieve in its legal dispute with Sony Pictures Television, allowing the network to continue distributing the popular game shows 'Wheel of Fortune' and 'Jeopardy'. Three California appellate judges have paused a lower court's ruling that would have stripped CBS of its distribution duties. Sony terminated its deal with CBS in August, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and budget cuts. CBS maintains that Sony's claims are based on dissatisfaction with a decades-old agreement, as CBS has distributed the shows since acquiring King World Productions in 1999.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration plans to overhaul the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to facilitate construction and development in areas inhabited by endangered species, according to a White House official. The administration is considering repealing the definition of 'harm,' which would remove habitat protections for endangered species. Critics argue that the ESA is overly burdensome, while environmentalists warn that weakening the law would harm wildlife and their habitats. The ESA has been credited with saving 99% of listed species since its enactment in 1973.</p>
