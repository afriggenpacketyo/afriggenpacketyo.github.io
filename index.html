          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry resort in Scotland to discuss a major trade agreement. Trump expressed a 50-50 chance of securing a deal, which he described as the largest ever for either side, though he noted he was "not in a good mood." The meeting occurred after Trump played a round of golf and also included a brief, unanswered query about the humanitarian situation in Gaza. The discussions are taking place amid a significant security presence and some local protests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz in a deal valued at £65.5 million, including add-ons. The 28-year-old was left out of Liverpool's recent pre-season match due to the transfer speculation and has been permitted to travel for a medical examination. Diaz, who joined Liverpool in 2022, scored 41 goals in 148 appearances for the club. The move comes as Liverpool has already signed two new forwards this summer and is reportedly interested in another.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland voiced strong opposition to U.S. funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed organization delivering aid in Gaza. He described the GHF as a "death trap" and argued that American taxpayer money should not support it, citing the deaths of civilians seeking food. Van Hollen also disputed claims that UN-delivered aid was systematically diverted to Hamas, calling it a pretext to use food as a weapon of war. He expressed concern over the influence of far-right ministers in the Israeli government on Prime Minister Netanyahu's decisions.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna are jointly advocating for the full release of Justice Department files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Their efforts include seeking financial records from Epstein's estate, beyond just personal documents like a disputed birthday message from Donald Trump. The representatives are attempting to use a discharge petition to force a House vote on the matter, bypassing Speaker Mike Johnson, who adjourned the House for recess early. Massie and Khanna argue their legislation is about transparency and justice for victims, with protections to redact their names.</p>

The movie's performance, coupled with positive critical reviews, suggests that the studio's renewed focus on quality over quantity is resonating with audiences. The success follows a trend of high-performing comic book films this month, challenging the narrative of widespread 'superhero fatigue' among moviegoers.</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" by CBS has intensified debate over the viability of the traditional late-night television format. While some view it as a one-off financial decision by parent company Paramount, others see it as a sign of a broader decline due to rising production costs and shrinking linear TV ad revenue. The industry is now watching Disney's upcoming decision on "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026. Despite its high ratings, Colbert's show faced financial losses, reflecting a challenging landscape where live sports increasingly dominate advertising budgets.</p>

          <p>According to BBC's international editor Jeremy Bowen, Israel's recent announcement of a "tactical pause" in military activity and aid airdrops is likely a gesture to appease international allies horrified by the starvation in Gaza. While Israel maintains it is not responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe, its closest allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, have issued stark statements blaming Israel for the crisis. The analysis suggests these new measures are insufficient to solve the problem and may be a tacit admission that more action is needed, particularly as the UN and other agencies refuse to cooperate with the controversial Israeli-backed GHF aid system.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has warned that the stock market is "pricing in perfection" and is overly complacent about the approaching August 1 U.S.-EU trade deadline. She believes a combination of tariff uncertainty, potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy, and technically overbought conditions could lead to a valuation correction in the near term. Despite being a long-term bull, she advises caution and suggests that pullbacks could present buying opportunities, particularly in underloved international stocks. She stresses the importance of appropriate asset allocation to navigate the potential volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from enforcing new funding restrictions on organizations that serve vulnerable communities. The restrictions required grant recipients to align with the administration's views on gender identity and diversity. The lawsuit was filed by a nationwide coalition of groups, including six from Rhode Island, who argue the conditions force them to choose between their mission and their funding. The ruling is a critical temporary victory for providers serving domestic abuse survivors, LGBTQI+ youth, and unhoused individuals.</p>

          <p>A protest by approximately 300 demonstrators on the Greek island of Syros successfully prevented an Israeli cruise ship from docking, igniting a heated debate within Greece. The protestors, carrying Palestinian flags, aimed to show that greeting Israeli tourists was unacceptable while Palestinians in Gaza face a humanitarian crisis. The incident has highlighted a split in Greek public opinion, with some condemning the protest as racist and others supporting it as a legitimate political statement. The debate touches on issues of antisemitism, free speech, and Greece's long-standing but complex alliance with Israel.</p>

Doctors reported that the venom's effects were mild, causing the boy to lose consciousness but not proving fatal, and he is now in stable condition. The incident is particularly remarkable given that India has one of the world's highest rates of fatal snakebites.</p>

          <p>An investigation by CBS News and The Marshall Project reveals that routine drug tests on pregnant patients in U.S. hospitals are leading to devastating consequences due to a high rate of false positives. Common substances like poppy seeds can trigger a positive result for opiates, automatically prompting child welfare investigations in many states. These probes can lead to families being separated and new mothers being robbed of their initial bonding experiences, even after confirmatory tests prove their innocence. Medical groups recommend verbal screenings over these unreliable tests, which are often used without fully informed consent.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has started a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three areas of Gaza to allow aid agencies to address the severe hunger crisis. This move comes amid intense international pressure and warnings of famine, with images of emaciated children drawing global condemnation. While the UN's food agency welcomed the step, it emphasized that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach everyone in need. The Hamas-run Health Ministry reported more deaths from malnutrition and called the pause meaningless without a massive influx of medical and food supplies.</p>

While the free initial deposit is attractive, financial analysis suggests other strategies may be more beneficial for long-term savings. Options like 529 education savings plans and custodial Roth IRAs offer significant tax-free growth for education or retirement. Additionally, purchasing a whole life insurance policy for a child can lock in low premiums and build cash value over time. (not investment advice)</p>
