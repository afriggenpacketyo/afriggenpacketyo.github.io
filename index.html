          <p>Chinese device assembler and Apple supplier Luxshare experienced a stock increase of approximately 10% following reports that it secured a deal with OpenAI to manufacture a consumer AI device. The company is allegedly developing a prototype utilizing ChatGPT's large language models, with a potential product launch aimed for late 2026 or early 2027. This move signals OpenAI's significant push into dedicated hardware, potentially creating new competition for established tech giants. The partnership also brings a key player from Apple's own supply chain into OpenAI's ecosystem, highlighting a strategic expansion into physical products. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report led by the Stockholm Environment Institute reveals a significant gap between climate pledges and actual fossil fuel production plans. Major polluting nations, including the U.S. and China, are projected to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than what is consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This discrepancy has widened since 2023, largely driven by China's slower-than-expected reduction in coal production. The findings underscore the stark reality that despite international commitments, the global transition away from fossil fuels is not on track to meet critical climate targets.</p>

These minerals, such as lithium and cobalt, are essential for green technologies and modern electronics. A recent study from the China Geological Survey details the advanced capabilities of this technology, which can identify resources buried several kilometers underground. This technological superiority in geological exploration positions China to dominate the supply chains for materials crucial to the future of energy and technology, leaving international competitors behind.</p>

Despite early frustrations, including a sideline exchange between Travis Kelce and Coach Andy Reid, the team found its rhythm in the second half. The Chiefs' defense successfully contained Giants' quarterback Russell Wilson, holding him to 160 passing yards and securing the much-needed victory, moving their season record to 1-2.</p>

          <p>Gabrielle has strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. With maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, the storm's center is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, though no watches or warnings are currently in effect for the island. The National Hurricane Center has warned that swells generated by Gabrielle are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into early next week. The storm's formation comes after the historical peak of the hurricane season, which has been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

The plans set quantitative goals and strategic priorities for various sectors, dictating the direction of industrial and social policy.

          <p>A solitary male bottlenose dolphin, nicknamed 'Reggie', has prompted warnings from officials in Dorset, England, due to increasingly close and boisterous interactions with swimmers. While some encounters appeared playful, others involved the dolphin pushing people underwater, raising safety concerns for both humans and the animal. Experts clarify that this behavior is not malicious but a dangerous change resulting from habituation to human contact. The UK's Marine Management Organization is urging the public to avoid approaching or swimming with the dolphin, as such interactions can lead to aggression and diminish the animal's natural wariness, posing risks of injury.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China has kept its key benchmark lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, and the five-year rate, which influences mortgages, stays at 3.5%. The decision to hold rates steady was widely expected by economists, as authorities appear to be avoiding major stimulus measures despite recent data indicating a deepening economic slowdown. Key indicators like retail sales and industrial output have weakened, and the nation's real estate slump continues to worsen. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that from targeting law firms and universities to boasting about silencing media personalities, the administration has shown a clear disdain for free expression. The piece references several landmark Supreme Court cases that establish free speech as a bedrock principle of American democracy, even for offensive or disagreeable ideas.

This development, combined with imagery of the drone's profile on the emblem of a new Type 076 amphibious ship, suggests the GJ-11 could become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone.

          <p>A fire in a Long Beach apartment unit resulted in the deaths of 32 cats and one dog. The blaze broke out Sunday morning and was quickly extinguished by the Long Beach Fire Department, but the animals succumbed to the fire. The resident of the apartment was not home at the time and informed authorities that the animals were not hers but were being housed for future adoption. The fire was contained to a single unit, which sustained significant damage, but no other residents of the three-story building were affected. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Speaking at a public memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump diverged from his prepared remarks to state that he disagrees with Kirk's sentiment of loving one's opponents. Trump told the large crowd, "I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them, I’m sorry." This comment came after he had just quoted Kirk's desire to know and love those who disagreed with him. The speech mixed eulogy with campaign-style rhetoric, creating an awkward tone at the somber event and highlighting a stark contrast with the message of forgiveness delivered earlier by Kirk's widow, Erika.</p>

The leaders of the three nations stated the decision is part of an international effort to build momentum for a two-state solution and revive hopes for peace. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that this recognition is not a reward for Hamas but rather a step toward a future where the terrorist organization has no role. The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that no Palestinian state would be established.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychology expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model key behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, this approach emphasizes creating an environment of emotional safety. Other crucial behaviors include teaching conflict resolution, validating feelings, and listening more than lecturing, which together build a foundation for emotionally intelligent and socially adept adults.</p>

McFadden emphasized the need to address the rising cost of benefits and provide better support to help people on sickness benefits return to work. He described the current system as creating an "unhealthy" binary divide between those deemed fit for work and those not, and announced that specially trained work coaches will now offer voluntary support to benefit recipients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from MIT and Tufts University is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild mice. The project, centered on Nantucket island where Lyme disease is prevalent, aims to make the white-footed mouse—the primary carrier of the Lyme bacteria—immune to the illness. By introducing a gene for a Lyme-preventing antibody into the mice, they can create a heritable immunity that is passed down through generations. This would break the cycle of infection where ticks become carriers after biting infected mice, offering a potential long-term solution without harming the local ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their final regular-season home game 3-1 to the San Francisco Giants, following a late-inning bullpen collapse. Despite a stellar performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan, who threw seven innings of one-hit ball, the bullpen gave up three runs in the eighth inning. The loss was played before a large crowd that pushed the team's season attendance over 4 million for the first time. With a magic number of three to clinch the division title, the team is expected to secure a playoff spot and return to Dodger Stadium for the postseason next week.</p>
