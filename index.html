President Trump echoed similar sentiments, saying that if California officials stand in the way of law and order, they will face charges.

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval from Americans, with strong support from Republicans. The approval is largely dependent on the perception that the program targets dangerous criminals, with support dropping significantly if it is believed to target others. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than they expected during the 2024 campaign, and most in this group disapprove of the program. The poll also reveals concerns about the economic impact of the program, with more Americans believing it will weaken rather than strengthen the economy. </p>

          <p>Residents of Riverton, Wyoming, are building a new community hospital after feeling that their existing hospital, acquired by a private equity firm, had deteriorated in quality and services. The town secured a $37 million loan from the USDA to fund the project, offering services that had been cut by the private equity-owned hospital. This effort challenges the conventional wisdom that private equity is the only option for struggling rural hospitals, highlighting the importance of local control and investment in community health. The community's efforts show how a small town can take healthcare into its own hands. </p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are using familiar tropes to justify cuts to safety net programs in order to pay for Trump's tax bill, claiming these programs are rife with waste and that recipients are not working hard enough. However, research shows that a majority of those receiving aid who can work are already employed, with others being ill, disabled, or caring for family members. The article argues that policies should be based on the complex reality of poverty, not on false stereotypes, and that investments in childcare and other support services are crucial for helping families achieve economic independence.

She expressed solidarity with other Republicans who have raised concerns about the administration's immigration policies. Garcia's comments highlight divisions within the Republican party regarding immigration enforcement. </p>
