          <p>After a seemingly routine foot surgery, Amber Meade experienced debilitating, persistent pain that upended her life. It took nearly a year for doctors to diagnose her with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable disorder characterized by extreme pain signals. Through a combination of specialized physical therapy, relaxation exercises, and ketamine infusions, Meade has been able to regain some functionality and improve her quality of life. While she still faces daily challenges, she is now able to participate more in family activities and is grateful for the progress she has made.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway announced a 4% year-over-year decrease in its second-quarter operating earnings, falling to $11.16 billion, partly due to a downturn in its insurance underwriting business. The conglomerate, led by Warren Buffett, issued a significant warning about the potential negative impacts of U.S. tariffs on its diverse portfolio of businesses. The company's cash reserves saw a slight reduction to $344.1 billion, and it refrained from any stock buybacks in the first half of the year. This report comes as Buffett prepares to step down as CEO at the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially restricted President Trump's proclamation aimed at closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the administration cannot use the order to bypass laws protecting migrants from being deported to places where they face persecution or torture. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the asylum system itself, it affirmed that migrants must still be allowed to apply for other mandatory humanitarian protections. This decision limits the executive branch's power to unilaterally suspend these specific legal obligations for those already on U.S. soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel has largely maintained restrictions on federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, upholding a lower court's finding that the operations appeared to unconstitutionally target people based on race or language. The ruling requires federal agents to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and prohibits them from basing arrests solely on factors like ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or location. The decision stems from a lawsuit over widespread raids in June that caused significant fear in the region's Latino community. Pro-immigrant advocates praised the ruling as a protection against indiscriminate and fear-inducing enforcement tactics.</p>

While some aides provided limited information or could not recall key details, others invoked their Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. The investigation continues to seek testimony from more former officials as it explores the extent of the alleged cover-up concerning the former president's health and cognitive state.</p>

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town revitalized by an influx of immigrants over the past two decades, is now gripped by fear due to a harsh immigration crackdown. The local Butler County jail, run by an outspoken anti-immigration sheriff, primarily houses individuals on immigration-related charges, generating significant revenue for the county. This policy has instilled deep anxiety within the town's vibrant Hispanic community and other immigrant groups, who have been instrumental in reviving the local economy and culture. The situation highlights a national divide, pitting the economic and cultural benefits of immigration against populist anti-immigrant policies and their human consequences.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with the deputy attorney general, Ghislaine Maxwell is simultaneously exploring several legal strategies to secure her release from a 20-year prison sentence for child sex trafficking. Her legal team is petitioning the Supreme Court, pursuing a congressional subpoena with a request for immunity, and signaling openness to clemency from the Trump administration. This multi-pronged approach comes amid swirling controversy and political maneuvering related to Jeffrey Epstein and his connections to powerful figures. Legal experts view this as a comprehensive, albeit long-shot, effort to leverage the current political climate and any information she possesses to overturn her conviction.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should persistently connect President Trump to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal to expose him as a protector of elites, a narrative that could resonate with voters. The author suggests that the response to the scandal, including the administration's actions regarding Ghislaine Maxwell and the Epstein files, reinforces a perception that there are two systems of justice. By repeatedly highlighting Trump's friendship with Epstein, Democrats can frame it as a clear example of elite favoritism. This strategy aims to link the abstract scandal to everyday concerns about inequality and a system that benefits the powerful at the expense of ordinary Americans.</p>

Because the new organ is made from the patient's tissue, there is no risk of rejection, and patients do not require immunosuppressant drugs.

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that he ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia in response to social media posts by Dmitry Medvedev, Moscow's official reaction has been notably silent. Russian news outlets and military commentators have largely dismissed the move as a "temper tantrum" or "meaningless blather," suggesting it is not being treated as a serious escalation. The Kremlin, foreign ministry, and defense ministry have not issued official statements or announced any reciprocal military movements. This quiet response indicates that Moscow may not perceive the deployment as a genuine threat, but rather as part of Trump's unpredictable political style.</p>

          <p>In an interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor argues that humanity is facing an existential crisis due to climate change and technological disruption, rooted in a flawed, anthropocentric worldview. He traces this problem to the modern philosophical idea of human consciousness as separate from and superior to nature, which has justified exploitation of the planet. Taylor proposes a new understanding of the self as an interconnected node in a vast relational network, where everything is co-dependent. He contends that surviving our current crises requires moving beyond a mindset of mastery and control and embracing this profound interrelationality with the world.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the May 7 air battle between Pakistan and India reveals that an Indian intelligence failure regarding the range of a Chinese-made missile was a key factor in the downing of an Indian Rafale fighter. Pakistani J-10C jets, equipped with PL-15 missiles, were able to strike the Rafale from a distance greater than Indian forces had anticipated. This element of surprise, combined with Pakistan's more efficient use of a networked "kill chain" linking air and ground sensors, gave them a tactical advantage. The incident has raised questions about Western military hardware's effectiveness against modern Chinese technology and boosted China's arms export prospects.</p>

This trend reflects broadening discomfort within the American Jewish community over the civilian toll of the war.

The tariffs add to existing pressures, with some businesses already experiencing a slowdown they attribute to economic uncertainty and community fears over immigration enforcement. This policy is creating considerable stress for small, family-run businesses that are central to the local Indian American community. (not investment advice)</p>

Far from being easier, the months of isolation, daily testing, and emotional strain of the COVID-19 crisis made the victory uniquely challenging.

This marks the first time a former Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial.

          <p>During President Trump's second term, a distinct pattern has emerged in which world leaders increasingly use praise and flattery as a key diplomatic strategy. Leaders from the U.K., Israel, and the European Commission have offered effusive compliments and symbolic honors, a notable shift from the more skeptical approach of his first term. Analysts suggest that foreign leaders have learned that appealing to Trump's desire to be seen as a uniquely successful deal-maker is the most effective way to engage with him and achieve their policy goals. This personalized approach recognizes that he is the ultimate decider, making direct, flattering engagement essential.</p>

It ultimately makes the case for graciously accepting praise, benefiting both the receiver and the giver in the social interaction.</p>
