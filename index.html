          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% increase that surpassed market estimates. This significant growth is primarily attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients such as Nvidia and Apple. Buoyed by the ongoing AI boom, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure. The company's performance highlights the critical role of high-end semiconductors in the rapidly expanding AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer goods corporation Nestle has announced a significant restructuring plan that includes cutting 16,000 jobs over the next two years, a move that caused its shares to rise by nearly 8%. The decision is part of an accelerated cost-savings program under new CEO Philipp Navratil, aimed at improving operational efficiency and turning around the company's performance. Despite challenges in its Greater China business, the company reported better-than-expected organic growth in the third quarter. The job reductions are a key part of the new leadership's strategy to regain investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him that India would soon wind down its oil purchases from Russia. However, India's Foreign Ministry did not confirm this assertion, issuing a statement that emphasized its priority to safeguard consumer interests and ensure stable energy supplies through diverse sourcing. Since 2022, India has significantly increased its intake of discounted Russian crude oil, a practice that has drawn criticism from its Western partners. New Delhi's response suggests it will continue to base its energy policy on national interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Rifle Association, along with other gun rights organizations, has filed a lawsuit against the state of California over a new law banning the sale of Glock-style handguns that can be easily converted into fully automatic weapons. The lawsuit argues that the ban on these commonly used firearms is a violation of the Second Amendment and contradicts previous Supreme Court rulings. The challenged law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is scheduled to take effect in July 2026 and aims to address the rising use of illegally modified automatic weapons. This legal challenge continues the ongoing national debate over gun control measures.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened with mixed results on Thursday, continuing a week of volatile trading as investors weigh various global economic factors. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index hovered near the flatline, while major indices in the U.K., Germany, and France experienced slight declines at the opening bell. This choppy performance reflects ongoing market uncertainty, influenced by factors such as strong U.S. bank earnings, persistent trade tensions with China, and domestic political developments in France. Investors are closely watching for upcoming corporate earnings reports and key economic data for further direction. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by a slight 0.1% in August, according to the Office for National Statistics, narrowly avoiding contraction after a revised 0.1% decline in July. The modest growth was primarily driven by a 0.7% increase in the manufacturing sector, while the crucial services sector showed no growth. This data indicates a continued sluggish economic outlook as the government prepares for its upcoming Budget. Economists suggest that the weak performance will likely persist due to pressures on households and businesses, adding to the challenges facing the chancellor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is reportedly escalating its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, with a new focus on the country's gas production and pipeline networks as winter approaches. While previous campaigns targeted the electricity grid, recent strikes have damaged a significant portion of Ukraine's gas facilities, particularly in the Kharkiv and Poltava regions. This shift in strategy aims to disrupt the heating season and create a severe energy crisis for Ukrainian civilians. In response, Ukraine is working to repair the damage and may need to increase gas imports to meet winter demand, posing a significant financial and logistical challenge.</p>

Published in the journal Nature, the research indicates that rising extreme temperatures linked to climate change are causing more tree deaths than new growth. As a result, the carbon released from decaying dead trees now outweighs the carbon absorbed by living ones. This trend, observed over the past 25 years, has significant implications for global climate models, which may be overestimating the capacity of forests to offset fossil fuel emissions.</p>

This has ignited a political firestorm, with the opposition accusing the current government of a cover-up to protect relations with Beijing, while the government insists the decision was solely the CPS's and based on the previous administration's stance.</p>
