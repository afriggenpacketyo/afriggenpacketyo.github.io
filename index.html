        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new spending bill signed by President Trump does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits, contrary to some claims. Instead, the legislation introduces a temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors over 65 within certain income limits, which applies to all income, not just Social Security. Policy experts note that this change primarily benefits higher-income seniors and does not affect low-income recipients who already pay no federal income tax. Critics also warn this could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As President Trump indicates a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas could be imminent, Israeli military operations in Gaza have intensified, resulting in at least 138 Palestinian deaths. Hamas has provided a "positive" response to the proposal but is seeking guarantees for a permanent end to the war and a partial Israeli withdrawal. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with deadly chaos reported at aid distribution sites. A meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled for Monday to discuss the potential agreement.</p>

          <p>Allied Materials, a Kansas City-based flag manufacturer, is preparing for a surge in demand as the United States approaches its 250th anniversary in 2026. The company produces about 1,000 American flags per day, with all components sourced domestically, supplying federal agencies, the military, and the public. For the employees, many of whom have personal connections to the military, producing a perfect flag is a matter of honor, particularly for those used in veterans' funerals. The company is proud of its American-made status, which has insulated it from global supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued another temporary halt to the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, just one day after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their removal. The case involves a complex legal battle, as the men are being sent to a war-torn country where almost none of them have ties. The judge determined that new claims from the immigrants' lawyers warranted a hearing and transferred the case to another judge in Boston who had previously stopped the deportations. The men, all convicted of serious crimes, remain in Djibouti pending further legal action.</p>

          <p>Turkey's LGBTQ+ community is facing a systematic crackdown, with activists and journalists describing an atmosphere of intimidation and erasure. The government has banned Pride events, and police have arrested dozens of participants, while President Erdogan has labeled the community a threat to the family. Rights groups report a surge in hostile rhetoric from politicians and the blocking of LGBTQ+ news sites by court order. Despite the repression, the community continues to advocate for its existence and rights under the slogan "Insisting on life."</p>

          <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has publicly denied allegations of torture made by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported from the U.S. who was held in the country's notorious CECOT supermax prison.

Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos, claiming Abrego Garcia looked well and was not mistreated.

The growth is driven by new brands like BYD and Omoda, alongside established Chinese-owned brands such as MG. This surge comes as other Western countries, including the U.S. and EU member states, have imposed steep tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, a measure the UK has not yet adopted. The trend highlights the growing competitiveness of Chinese automakers in the global market, particularly in the electric vehicle sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The prospect of a new political party to the left of Labour is gaining traction after MP Zarah Sultana announced she was leaving Labour to help launch one with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn welcomed her decision, he indicated that discussions are still ongoing and the party's foundations are not yet set. Polls suggest such a party could capture up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters. The move reflects a significant split on the British left following Keir Starmer's leadership of the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the UK after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary block.

The group's co-founder condemned the decision as an "authoritarian abuse" of power and stated they would pursue an urgent appeal.
