          <p>The UK Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced plans to tackle the extensive backlog in driving tests, aiming to clear it by next summer. The government intends to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests per month to address the issue, which currently sees learner drivers waiting over five months for a practical test. Alexander acknowledged that current wait times are unacceptable and announced measures including increased training capacity for examiners and reintroducing overtime pay. The government also plans to crack down on test booking bots that exploit learners, with the goal of reducing average waiting times to seven weeks by summer 2026.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former paddleboard firm owner, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding tour in Wales. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead such a tour in hazardous conditions. The court heard that the river was in flood conditions with a strong current, and the group encountered a dangerous weir. The judge criticized Lloyd's abysmal approach to health and safety and her disregard for the high risk of death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a pause in discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant wrongfully deported, one day after a judge ordered the government to fully answer questions about the deportation. Judge Paula Xinis had previously criticized Justice Department attorneys for their inaction and ordered government officials to testify under oath. The Trump administration argues that providing detailed information on the legal basis for Abrego Garcia's confinement would be an invasion of diplomatic discussions. Abrego Garcia's attorneys accuse the administration of providing non-responsive interrogatory responses.</p>

          <p>The pro-natalism movement, gaining influence in the Trump administration, seeks to increase birth rates in America through various proposals, including fertility awareness classes and “baby bonuses.” Critics argue that the movement's true agenda is to enforce regressive social roles, push women out of the public sphere, and narrow their prospects beyond motherhood. These proposals conspicuously lack measures to address the needs of current mothers, such as paid family leave and affordable childcare. The movement's focus is on encouraging primarily white births and enforcing hierarchical social roles.</p>
