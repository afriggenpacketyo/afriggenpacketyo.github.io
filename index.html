        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, heightening concerns about an impending slowdown. Production output saw a decline, while services and construction showed slight increases. Economists anticipate a slowdown in the latter half of 2025, prompting Finance Minister Reeves to address economic revival as a top priority ahead of the Autumn Budget. The Bank of England is also weighing fiscal uncertainties against persistent inflation, with expectations of holding rates steady in the near term. (not investment advice) The flat economic performance in July may not be enough to alleviate the Bank of England's inflation concerns, thus policy decisions remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained in a US immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia have returned to their home country. The return follows concerns raised by the South Korean president and Hyundai's CEO about the raid's impact on investment and factory operations. The departure was delayed due to a request from the White House, reportedly to assess the workers' willingness to remain in the US, with South Korea negotiating visa options for its workers in the US. The incident has sparked protests and concerns about future investments in the US, potentially delaying the factory's opening.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures reveal that the UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June. While monthly figures can be volatile, the economy grew by 0.2% over the three months leading up to July compared to the previous three months. The government faces increasing pressure to stimulate economic growth ahead of the Budget on November 26. The service sector performed well, but this was offset by weakness in the manufacturing sector, leading to speculation about potential tax increases.</p>

          <p>European stocks are poised to open higher following data indicating that the UK economy's growth stalled in July. Futures tied to the Stoxx 50, FTSE 100, DAX, and CAC 40 indexes all show gains, while the UK's flat economic growth adds to the Bank of England's considerations for its upcoming monetary policy update. The European Central Bank recently left its key interest rate unchanged.

          <p>The House of Lords is set to debate a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, with peers expressing concerns about the legislation. Opponents cite "massive problems" with the bill, while supporters urge respect for the Commons' decision to back it. A committee has warned about the limited scrutiny given to the bill, and an amendment has been tabled calling for further evidence before debate. The bill proposes allowing terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, subject to approval by multiple medical professionals.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the challenges faced by the United States in implementing industrial policy due to its post-industrial nature. It criticizes the raid on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Georgia, highlighting the contradiction between anti-immigrant policies and the need for skilled workers. The author argues that efforts to reshore American manufacturing and isolate China are futile. The current crackdown on undocumented migrants and illegal workers, skilled and unskilled, appeals to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base and is believed to be good for votes.</p>

The bill permits taller buildings near transit corridors, affecting single-family neighborhoods within a half-mile radius. Supporters argue it is necessary to address the state's affordability crisis, while critics claim it strips local authorities of control.
