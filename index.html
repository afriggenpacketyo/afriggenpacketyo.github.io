        <h2>Schumer's Vote to Avoid Government Shutdown</h2>

        <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he will vote to keep the government open, likely preventing a shutdown.  This decision contrasts with House Democrats' near-unanimous opposition to the GOP funding bill.  Schumer argued that a shutdown would be worse than passing the flawed bill, citing the potential for increased power for President Trump and Elon Musk.  House Democrats remain strongly opposed to the bill and favor a short-term spending extension to allow further negotiations.</p>
