          <p>Following the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on the city's light rail, the House Judiciary Committee will conduct a field hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina. The hearing aims to scrutinize what critics call "soft-on-crime" policies and is part of a series of visits by the Republican-led committee to Democrat-run cities to highlight crime rates and prosecutorial issues. The event will feature testimony from victims and examine policies like cashless bail, continuing the committee's focus on criminal justice reform debates across the nation. The discussion is framed around the tragic death and the suspect's extensive criminal history.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Determines Renewable Energy Sources are the Most Cost-Effective</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 13:11:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, which shows renewables are more affordable to generate per megawatt-hour compared to fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While the upfront capital investment for renewables is high, their operational costs are significantly lower. Experts caution that a diverse energy portfolio is necessary to ensure a consistent power supply, as the intermittent nature of wind and solar requires reliable backup sources.

          <p>In an interview with CBS Mornings, Grammy-winning artist Cardi B addressed her reputation for being outspoken and dramatic, which inspired the title of her upcoming album, "Am I the Drama?" She explained to Gayle King that she does not enjoy conflict but believes her large personality and candid nature make her an easy target for controversy. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, acknowledged that this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic." She stated that some of the drama in her life is a significant source of stress for her.</p>

The agreement, which is expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, will also see Oracle continue its role as the platform's cloud and data security partner. This development comes after years of uncertainty and a congressional mandate for ByteDance to divest its U.S. assets due to national security concerns. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the deal, noting that commercial terms had been in place for months but were delayed by geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that Democrats must challenge the Trump administration on the upcoming government funding bill, despite the risks in a politically charged climate following Charlie Kirk's assassination. In an interview, he argued that forcing a government shutdown over restoring Medicare funding and Obamacare subsidies would place the blame on Republicans for attempting one-party rule. Van Hollen expressed alarm at President Trump's rhetoric blaming the left for political violence, viewing it as a threat to civil liberties. He emphasized that Democrats need to more forcefully oppose what he calls the president's lawlessness and present a clearer vision for the country.</p>

          <h2>The Reverse Mortgage 6-Month Repayment Rule Explained for Homeowners and Heirs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 12:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key feature of reverse mortgages is the "6-month rule," which dictates the timeline for repayment after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Once this qualifying event occurs, the lender issues a "Due and Payable" letter, giving heirs six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to settle the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While up to two three-month extensions can be requested from HUD, this guideline highlights the importance of proactive estate planning for borrowers who wish for their families to retain the home.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey reveals that a vast majority of economists, fund managers, and strategists believe President Trump's actions are aimed at limiting or eliminating the Federal Reserve's independence. According to 82% of respondents, this pressure campaign is likely to result in negative economic outcomes, including higher inflation, weaker growth, and increased unemployment. While respondents overwhelmingly expect the Fed to cut interest rates this week, they are divided on whether it is the correct course of action. The survey also highlighted that tariffs and administration policy uncertainty remain the top threats to the ongoing economic expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to receive a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom, complete with royal pageantry at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III. However, the visit's timing is considered awkward for both leaders, as it follows British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's firing of his U.S. ambassador over new revelations about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. This has resurfaced questions about Trump's own past association with the disgraced financier. The trip also occurs as the U.S. grapples with the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination and the U.K. faces its own growing political divisions, potentially making diplomatic discussions challenging.</p>

Mangione still faces nine other state charges, including second-degree murder and multiple weapons offenses, in addition to separate federal charges.

Bessent revealed that while commercial terms had been settled for months, China had put the deal on hold following a U.S. tariff announcement. The president's willingness to prioritize national security over the app's continued operation ultimately broke the stalemate. This development could mark a turning point in U.S.-China relations, with the two nations moving closer to finalizing the agreement for the social media platform's U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has commenced a long-anticipated major ground offensive in Gaza City, which it describes as the last significant stronghold for Hamas. The operation began with intense overnight airstrikes, forcing thousands of Palestinian civilians to flee south along a single designated coastal road. The assault has drawn sharp criticism from the international community, including the UK and the UN, with a UN commission report accusing Israel of committing genocide. Israeli officials maintain the operation is necessary to dismantle Hamas's infrastructure and secure the release of hostages, urging civilians to evacuate the combat zones.</p>

          <p>In an emotional address at the reopening of a historic synagogue in Munich, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke about the resurgence of Jewish life in Germany while acknowledging the persistent and rising threat of antisemitism. He expressed personal shame that Jewish institutions still require police protection, highlighting a "new wave of antisemitism" on social media and in public spaces. The speech, one of two he is giving on the topic this week, comes as the Central Council of Jews in Germany marks its 75th anniversary amid growing concerns for the community's safety, particularly since the October 7th Hamas attack.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 89, Robert Redford is remembered not just for his iconic good looks but for a subtle, process-oriented acting style that grounded his performances in realism. In landmark films like "All the President's Men," he embodied a diligent professionalism that made his character's loss of faith in institutions feel authentic. Despite his fame, his craft was often understated, making him a perfect counterpart to more expressive co-stars like Barbra Streisand and Paul Newman. His career, from New Hollywood star to the founder of Sundance, reflects a deep commitment to the art of filmmaking, both on and off the screen.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House, alleging a coordinated effort to damage his reputation before the 2024 election. The suit claims that a series of articles and a book published by the defendants contained false and libelous information. Trump's lawyers argue that the newspaper has become a "mouthpiece of the Democrat Party" engaged in "industrial-scale defamation." A spokesperson for The New York Times dismissed the lawsuit as baseless and an attempt to stifle independent reporting, stating the organization will not be deterred by intimidation tactics.</p>

          <p>As of September 16, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,683.46 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. The value of gold is influenced by a range of factors, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation, against which it is often seen as a hedge. Additionally, geopolitical uncertainty, central bank policies, and currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, play significant roles in its price fluctuations. Investors often turn to gold as a safe-haven asset during times of market instability, which can drive its value higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates recently falling to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering refinancing. Experts advise evaluating several factors, including one's current interest rate; homeowners with rates above 7% are encouraged to start exploring options now. Another key consideration is immediate financial need, as refinancing can lower monthly payments or allow for cash-out options to consolidate higher-interest debt. While some analysts predict rates could fall further by year-end, there is an opportunity cost to waiting, as homeowners continue to pay higher interest in the interim. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An F-22 Raptor has successfully executed the longest-known air-to-air missile shot using an AIM-120 AMRAAM, according to manufacturer Raytheon. The test, conducted in late 2024 near Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrated the extended flight capabilities of the missile's F3R variant, which is designed to enhance performance and lethality for fifth-generation aircraft. This milestone highlights the U.S. military's ongoing focus on developing extended-range capabilities to counter advancements made by adversaries like China and Russia. While the exact range is classified, it underscores efforts to keep the AMRAAM relevant as its successor, the AIM-260, approaches service.</p>

Critics fear the move, reportedly driven by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

This could lead to reduced insurance coverage and access, particularly for federal programs like Vaccines for Children.

          <p>A 71-year-old man has been arrested for obstruction of justice after allegedly falsely confessing to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Authorities state that George Zinn began shouting "I shot him" immediately after the shooting, an act police believe was intended to help the actual shooter escape. Zinn later admitted to investigators that he was not the killer and wanted to become a "martyr" for Kirk's cause. The real suspect, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, was arrested following a two-day manhunt. Zinn also faces charges related to child abuse material allegedly found on his phone.</p>
