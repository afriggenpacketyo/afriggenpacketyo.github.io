        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned the Trump administration's reported plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling it a potential "invasion." Pritzker stated that his administration has not been contacted about these plans, which he believes are being developed in secret. He argues that such a deployment is not about fighting crime but serves other political aims of President Trump, possibly related to influencing future elections. The governor vowed to use legal channels to stop the deployment, asserting that federal troops have no place in law enforcement on American city streets without a true emergency.</p>

          <p>Musician John Fogerty, at 80 years old, has released a new album featuring re-recordings of his iconic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs, a project undertaken after he regained the rights to his music catalog. For decades, Fogerty had lost control over his own compositions following the band's breakup, a painful experience that led him to stop performing his classic hits for a period. Encouraged by his wife, Julie, he embarked on the new album, "Legacy," which features his sons Shane and Tyler in his band. Fogerty reflects on the emotional journey of revisiting the songs and the pride he feels in finally owning his musical legacy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates designed to operate jointly in northern Europe. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the UK's defense industry over its competitors.</p>

          <p>A humanitarian aid flotilla, named the Global Sumud Flotilla, has departed from Barcelona with the goal of breaking the Israeli blockade and delivering essential supplies to the Gaza Strip. The convoy includes prominent figures such as actress Susan Sarandon and climate activist Greta Thunberg, alongside politicians and journalists from 44 countries. Organizers state that the mission aims to bring food, water, and medicine to the region, where food experts have warned of famine conditions. Thunberg emphasized that the story is about the deliberate deprivation of basic survival means for people in Palestine as the flotilla navigates the Mediterranean.</p>

          <p>During a college football game between the New Mexico Lobos and the Michigan Wolverines, a notable moment occurred when a New Mexico lineman chose to de-escalate a potential conflict. After a play in the third quarter, some pushing and shoving began, and Michigan linebacker Ernest Hausmann appeared to confront Lobos guard Richard Pearce. Rather than engaging further, Pearce was seen on replay running away from the developing scuffle as officials intervened to separate the players.

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the former chief of immunizations at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has voiced significant concern about the future of public health under the leadership of HHS Secretary Robert F.

He told ABC News that he believes the agency is moving in an ideological direction aimed at undoing vaccination progress.

          <p>In a humorous commentary piece, comedian Jim Gaffigan reflects on the perils of being an overly ambitious but unskilled home gardener, particularly concerning his cucumber plants. He describes his annual cycle of May optimism, where he plans to "do it right this year," followed by the August realization that his efforts have produced an unmanageable surplus of cucumbers. Gaffigan jokes about his use of "succession planting," which, instead of providing a steady supply, has resulted in a deluge of produce. The commentary details his family's attempts to consume the bounty before he ultimately resorts to begging others to take his cucumbers.</p>

The activists link a significant percentage of these wildfires to the livestock industry and demand more urgent government action on the climate emergency.

Badenoch argued it is "absurd" to leave resources untapped while neighboring countries do not. The move has been criticized by the Labour government and environmental groups as reckless and a form of "environmental vandalism" that would accelerate the climate crisis without lowering energy bills.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in the latest drawing. This makes the current prize the fifth-largest in the game's history, attracting widespread participation despite the astronomical odds of winning, which stand at 1 in 292.2 million. The last time the jackpot was won was on May 31, allowing the prize to accumulate over several months. A potential winner could choose to receive the full amount in payments spread over 30 years or opt for an immediate lump sum of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. The next drawing is scheduled for Monday night.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the world is entering a new, multipolar arms race that is elevating the threat of ballistic missiles to unprecedented levels. The author contends that advancements in missile technology have created new battle spaces and that, similar to the Cold War, adversaries can now hold entire populations hostage under the threat of nuclear annihilation. The piece reflects on the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, suggesting that while the nature of war has changed, the logic remains the same. It concludes with a warning that these developments do not bode well for global strategic stability and that the risk of conflict is significant.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's attempts to exert control over the Federal Reserve, including his effort to remove Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-standing political independence. Experts argue that if successful, these moves could undermine the American financial system by eroding the Fed's credibility and allowing monetary policy to be dictated by political motives rather than economic stability. While Trump's goal is to lower interest rates to boost the economy and manage federal debt, critics warn that politicizing the Fed could lead to hyperinflation and instability, similar to what has been seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

          <p>A decade after volunteering to accept more migrants than required during the 2015 crisis, the small German town of Altena provides a nuanced look at the long-term impacts of such policies. Initially seen as a way to reverse population decline and revitalize the local economy, the effort yielded mixed results. While many newcomers integrated and found work with the help of community volunteers, others struggled with cultural barriers or moved to larger cities for better opportunities. The town now faces rising welfare costs and growing support for the anti-immigration AfD party, illustrating that migration was not a simple panacea for its deep-seated economic and demographic challenges.</p>

          <p>The recent release of transcripts from an interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell has drawn criticism for the questions that were left unasked by the deputy US attorney. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that associates of Jeffrey Epstein were serving in Donald Trump's cabinet, but she was not pressed to provide names. Similarly, when she gave an ambiguous answer about contact with the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, the interviewer moved on without follow-up. Critics and victims' advocates argue that this approach, along with the failure to interview dozens of survivors, suggests the disclosure was more for show than a genuine pursuit of truth.</p>

          <p>A critical analysis piece argues that many of Donald Trump's decisions are rooted in a profound and dangerous ignorance, rather than a coherent ideology. The article cites several examples from his presidency, including his scientifically impossible claim that opening taps in the Sierra Nevada foothills could solve Los Angeles' wildfire problem and his belief that water flows from Canada to California. The author posits that Trump's reliance on his "gut instinct" and information from uninformed acquaintances, combined with a refusal to accept expert advice, leads to erratic and potentially harmful policies.

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is highlighting the little-known story of how surfing was first introduced to the U.S. mainland in 1885. The sport was brought to the shores of Santa Cruz by three teenage Hawaiian princes—David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui—who were attending a nearby military school. Using boards fashioned from local redwood to replicate the ones they used at home, the princes demonstrated what was then called "surfboard swimming" to amazed locals. Their display of the traditional royal sport of Hawaii planted the seed for a culture that would eventually sweep across the nation.</p>

While the U.S. has long been Taiwan's primary arms supplier, co-production on the island would mark a significant strategic shift.

Rhode Island's surcharge, nicknamed the "Taylor Swift Tax" after the pop star's Watch Hill property, imposes extra fees on non-primary residences valued over $1 million. Proponents see it as a way to address budget shortfalls and housing inequality, but real estate brokers and some locals argue it unfairly penalizes seasonal residents who support local economies without heavily using municipal services.

Officials stated that while the containers are used for mere seconds, they can persist in the environment for centuries. Although made of recyclable plastic, their small size makes them difficult for recycling machinery to process effectively.

They warn that his proposed changes could dismantle the system that shields vaccine manufacturers from extensive litigation, potentially causing them to exit the market and leading to vaccine shortages. The VICP was created in the 1980s to ensure a stable vaccine supply by providing a no-fault compensation route for the rare instances of vaccine injury. Critics argue that eliminating this liability shield, as Kennedy has advocated, would not make vaccines safer but would instead make them less accessible for everyone.</p>
