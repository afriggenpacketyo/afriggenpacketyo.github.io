            <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed as investors analyzed Japan's inflation data, which showed a 3.6% year-on-year increase in March, slightly below February's 3.7% but still above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.03%, while South Korea's Kospi added 0.53%, and China's CSI traded flat. Shipping stocks in South Korea and Japan experienced gains following the U.S. imposing fees on ships built in China. Australia, Hong Kong, and Singapore's markets remained closed for the holidays.

            <p>A coroner's report has deemed the current eyesight regulations for motorists in the UK as unsafe, following inquests into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision. The report highlights that the UK relies on self-reporting of visual conditions, unlike most European countries, and issues licenses without mandatory visual checks for extended periods. The coroner urges the Transport Secretary to take action to prevent future deaths, emphasizing that the current system is ineffective and unfit. Families of the victims express their grief and call for stricter enforcement of visual standards for drivers.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the recent earthquake in Myanmar could disrupt the production of rare earth minerals supplied to China. The earthquake may have damaged mining equipment, compromised mine safety, and obstructed transportation routes in Myanmar, which is a major source of rare earth elements for China. This disruption could further exacerbate price volatility and force China to diversify its sources for these critical minerals. Rare earths are essential for manufacturing smartphones, advanced weaponry, and other high-tech products.</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like "The Terminator," has modified his views on artificial intelligence, suggesting that Hollywood should embrace AI to cut costs in visual effects (VFX) workflows. Cameron, who joined the board of Stability AI, believes AI can double the speed of VFX completion, allowing artists to focus on more creative tasks. He downplays concerns about AI replacing creatives, emphasizing its potential to streamline tedious tasks like rotoscoping and motion capture. While acknowledging the need for legal management of AI, Cameron encourages focusing on output and monetization rather than restricting input.</p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García in El Salvador, a man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. This meeting occurred after the senator was initially denied access to the prison where Ábrego García is being held. The White House has criticized Van Hollen's actions, while El Salvador's president mocked the meeting. Ábrego García's attorneys are working to secure his return to the U.S., arguing he was wrongly deported.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has blocked the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive Social Security records, citing privacy concerns. The judge stated that granting DOGE unlimited access to personal information would betray the government's commitment to citizens' privacy. The order prevents DOGE from accessing personally identifiable information and installing software on SSA computer systems. This decision comes after concerns were raised about DOGE's mission to identify fraud within the Social Security Administration.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has implemented port fees on Chinese ships to bolster the US shipbuilding industry and challenge China's dominance. Fees will be based on cargo weight, container count, or vehicle number, increasing over three years. Exemptions apply to empty vessels and ships moving goods between US ports. These measures aim to address trade imbalances and promote domestic manufacturing. However, global trade disruptions and price increases for US consumers are potential consequences.</p>
