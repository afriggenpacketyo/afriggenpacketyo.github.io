          <p>HSBC is set to expand its investment banking operations to capitalize on the increasing demand for initial public offerings (IPOs) from companies in Asia and the Middle East, aligning with the bank's restructuring efforts to prioritize high-return markets like Hong Kong and India while exiting less profitable regions such as Europe and the US. Hong Kong currently leads the world in IPOs, followed by India's bourses ranking fourth and fifth, prompting HSBC to redirect growth towards Asia and intra-Asia opportunities. David Liao, HSBC’s co-CEO for Asia and the Middle East, emphasized Hong Kong's significance as a listing market and hub for international investors, driving the bank's decision to enhance its capacity to serve a growing wealth management clientele. This expansion signifies HSBC's strategic pivot to leverage the burgeoning IPO market in Asia and the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, seeking relief from their combat-related trauma, using psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT in traditional ceremonies. The retreat aimed to help veterans revisit traumatic moments and process emotions in ways that traditional therapies have not been able to achieve. While the Veterans Administration is beginning to fund clinical trials using psychedelics, many veterans are turning to retreats in countries where the drugs are legal. A year later, eight of the nine veterans reported improved symptoms and described the experience as "life-changing," highlighting the potential of psychedelics in treating PTSD.</p>

          <p>Former agents from Israel's Mossad detailed a daring operation in which they built and sold explosive pagers to Hezbollah terrorists, a plot that had dramatic repercussions, including aiding in the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and weakening Iran. The operation involved creating shell companies to supply Hezbollah with booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies, which were later activated to cause mayhem and disrupt the terrorist organization's operations. The agents emphasized that the goal was not only to kill terrorists but also to create a lasting impact by wounding them and instilling fear, demonstrating Israel's superiority in the Middle East. This elaborate deception highlights the complex and often morally ambiguous nature of counterintelligence operations.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria have significantly weakened Iran's power and influence, as detailed in a CBS News report, after Mossad detonated explosive pagers and walkie-talkies among Hezbollah militants, leading to numerous casualties and the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah. The Israeli-Hezbollah ceasefire, brokered by the United States and France, requires the Lebanese government to regain control of southern Lebanon, where Hezbollah has maintained a military presence. Experts suggest that Hezbollah's proxy war strategy, used by Iran for its own national security, is failing, and the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has further isolated the group. The destruction of Hezbollah has had a profound rippling effect, severely weakening Iran by leaving its proxy empire in ruins.</p>

Companies like Ocean Winds are compensated when the system cannot accommodate the electricity generated by their wind farms, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity, highlighting the challenges of integrating renewable energy sources into an outdated grid. The current system is costing the country hundreds of millions annually, potentially reaching billions by 2030, leading the government to consider radical solutions such as regional electricity markets. This proposed shift aims to make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills, but it has sparked intense debate and uncertainty within the energy industry.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has responded to the deployment of federalized National Guard troops in her city, ordered by President Trump without the agreement of California's governor. The deployment, citing a rarely used law, involves two thousand National Guard troops sent to Los Angeles for sixty days. It marks the first time in 60 years a president has used federal power to deploy national guard troops without the state's governor's consent. NPR's Scott Detrow spoke with Mayor Bass to gauge the reaction within Los Angeles to this federal intervention.</p>

The controversy arose after Biles responded to Gaines' criticism of a transgender pitcher competing in a softball championship, with Biles suggesting the creation of a transgender category in all sports.

          <p>Federal officials have vowed to continue immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, prompting concerns and questions about how to handle interactions with federal agents, as ICE agents made arrests in the garment district and other locations. The Trump administration's "border czar," Tom Homan, stated that law enforcement will continue "every day in L.A.," regardless of local sentiment, emphasizing the administration's commitment to its deportation crackdown. Experts advise individuals to remain silent, request a warrant, and avoid resisting agents, while employers are urged to create a response plan and ensure employees know their rights.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the mid-1970s, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's imposition of the Emergency, India entered a period where civil liberties were suspended and much of the political opposition was jailed, and her government quietly began reimagining the country as a centralised state governed by command and control, historian Srinath Raghavan reveals in his new book. Inspired in part by Charles de Gaulle's France, the push for a stronger presidency in India reflected a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy - even if it never fully materialised. Nehru imagined a single, seven-year presidential term, proportional representation in Parliament and state legislatures, a judiciary with curtailed powers and a press reined in by strict libel laws. Despite serious flirtation, India never made the leap to a presidential system.</p>
