        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell sharply following the European Commission's announcement of plans to increase steel tariffs and reduce import quotas. The proposed measures, which would double tariffs to 50% on excess imports and cut quotas by 47%, are intended to protect the EU's domestic steel industry. However, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association has warned that the move threatens the auto sector with higher costs and could have an inflationary impact on market prices. BMW's stock was particularly affected, also citing slow growth in China and existing U.S. tariffs in a separate profit warning.</p>

          <p>An NPR journalist shares a personal reflection from their time aboard a Doctors Without Borders migrant rescue ship in the Mediterranean Sea. The article describes the exhausting and often traumatic work of the crew, who in one ten-day period saved 258 lives. Amidst the difficult reality of rescuing migrants who paid smugglers for the perilous journey to Europe, a moment of shared joy occurred when a pod of dolphins swam alongside the vessel. This brief encounter provided a powerful reminder of beauty and life persisting even in the face of human cruelty and hardship.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that demand for AI computing has risen significantly, particularly over the last six months, as AI models advance from simple queries to complex reasoning. Speaking on CNBC, Huang noted that the company's most advanced GPU, Blackwell, is experiencing very high demand, signaling the start of a "new industrial revolution." He also addressed the immense power requirements for the industry's growth, suggesting that data centers will need to generate their own power, potentially using natural gas or nuclear energy, to meet demand without straining public grids.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is scheduled for his first court appearance in Alexandria, Virginia, following an indictment for making a false statement and obstruction. The charges stem from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he has publicly denied. The case has generated controversy, particularly after President Trump publicly called for action against Comey and appointed a former aide to oversee the U.S. Attorney's office handling the prosecution. Two out-of-state prosecutors have been assigned to the case, suggesting internal challenges within the Virginia office.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 09:37:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has warned that the risk of a "sharp market correction" has grown, highlighting stretched valuations in the equity market, especially for tech firms focused on artificial intelligence. The central bank noted that the market concentration in top tech companies is at a 50-year high, making markets vulnerable if optimism around AI's future earnings diminishes. This warning aligns with concerns from other financial institutions about a potential AI bubble, although some strategists believe the high valuations are supported by strong fundamentals.

It lists national average yields for various terms but highlights that top rates, especially from online banks, are significantly higher. For instance, some 6-month CDs offer APYs over 4.40%, while national averages are much lower. The article advises consumers to look at online banks and consider short-term CDs, which currently offer higher rates due to an inverted yield curve, to secure the best returns.

These altered patterns could be misinterpreted by doctors as signs of disease if they are unaware of the patient's medication history. The study's authors urge imaging professionals to carefully document patient medications to avoid misdiagnoses, unnecessary tests, and potential delays in proper treatment.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's failure to pass a funding deal, a government shutdown is forcing active-duty U.S. military members to continue their service without receiving timely paychecks. While a 2019 law ensures all government employees eventually receive back pay, military pay is not guaranteed unless separate legislation is passed, which has not yet happened. In response, financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are offering 0% APR loans to affected service members.

While lawmakers' pay is secure, their staffers are treated like other federal employees and will not be paid until a funding agreement is reached, though most are expected to continue working.

The review covers shutdowns under various presidents, from Ronald Reagan, who oversaw eight, to the 34-day shutdown under Donald Trump in 2018, which caused an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses. These events, often driven by intense partisan disputes over issues like spending cuts, healthcare, and immigration, highlight a recurring pattern of political brinkmanship in Washington.</p>

          <p>Flight delays have been reported at several U.S. airports, including in Denver and Newark, due to shortages of air traffic controllers, a problem exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown. Although controllers are deemed essential workers, they are required to work without pay, leading to a slight increase in sick calls. The FAA has responded to low staffing levels by reducing the number of takeoffs and landings to maintain safety, which in turn causes delays.

          <p>The UK government is reportedly preparing to increase the amount the NHS pays for medicines by as much as 25% in an effort to resolve a standoff with pharmaceutical companies and the Trump administration. The proposal includes raising the cost-effectiveness threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to approve new drugs. This move follows pressure from the U.S. and recent decisions by major drugmakers like MSD and AstraZeneca to cancel or pause significant investments in the UK. However, the plan faces resistance from the Treasury and No 10 over how to fund the increased costs.</p>

          <p>The players' unions for the WNBA and the NWSL, the two most prominent women's professional sports leagues in the U.S., have developed a strong collaborative relationship to advocate for their members. This solidarity was recently highlighted when NWSL players wore shirts supporting the WNBPA's campaign for a new collective bargaining agreement. The unions, both relatively young compared to their male counterparts, work together on issues like fair pay, player safety, and protections for mothers. They also coordinate on broader political advocacy, such as opposing federal immigration raids and addressing potential threats to Title IX in proposed legislation for college athletes.</p>

Traditionally, these lands were not inherited by women, but a new generation is working to restore them using sustainable, traditional methods in an area dominated by men. Their efforts focus on preserving a unique agricultural system threatened by urban sprawl, pollution, and mass tourism. By reviving practices like using canal mud for fertilizer, they are also helping to protect the habitat of the endangered axolotl and maintain the ecological stability of the region.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged period of high prices, U.S. cocoa futures have fallen to their lowest point in nearly two years, dropping below $6,100 a ton. The sharp decline has led investment banks like Citi and Societe Generale to warn that the commodity has become "extremely oversold," with money managers taking historically weak speculative positions. This situation makes the market vulnerable to "short covering," where a rush to buy back assets could cause prices to rebound quickly. Analysts note that the sell-off was driven by new crop sales after governments in Ivory Coast and Ghana raised farmgate prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after the October 7th attack, American public support for Israel has fallen to historic lows, while sympathy for the Palestinian cause has increased, according to multiple recent polls. A Pew Research survey found that 59% of Americans now hold a negative view of Israel, fueled by the ongoing war in Gaza which has killed over 67,000 Palestinians. This shift is particularly pronounced among Democrats and younger voters, creating a new political dynamic that is impacting election campaigns and challenging the influence of traditionally powerful pro-Israel lobby groups like AIPAC. This change in public sentiment is seen by analysts as a fundamental and potentially permanent shift in U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>This opinion article analyzes a 20-point plan for post-war Gaza drafted by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Donald Trump, characterizing it as a "hallucinatory" and imperialistic vision. The plan proposes turning the territory into a colonial-style protectorate and special economic zone, overseen by an international board chaired by Trump and including Blair. The author argues the plan ignores the political realities on the ground and reflects Blair's long-held belief in market-led solutions, which failed during his time as Middle East envoy. The article suggests the proposal reduces politics to a business deal, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest involving Blair's think tank and its financial backers.</p>

          <p>The recent collapse of the French government underscores a deep-seated political crisis in the country, centered on a conflict between its prized social model and the pressures of global economic competition. Unpopular budget proposals, including a suggestion to remove two public holidays to boost productivity, have fueled widespread discontent amid a deepening debt crisis. The standoff reflects a broader European debate over whether nations can maintain a strong work-life balance and social protections while competing with economic powerhouses like the U.S. and China.

This move is seen as a significant strategic pivot by New Delhi, allowing it to increase engagement with Kabul's de facto rulers without granting official recognition. The visit comes as the Taliban's relationship with its traditional backer, Pakistan, has soured, creating an opportunity for India to regain strategic influence in the region. Discussions are expected to cover counterterrorism, trade, and humanitarian aid, as the Taliban seeks to expand its diplomatic footprint beyond Pakistan and China.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Make Me Commissioner," a new book by veteran sportswriter Jane Leavy that examines the state of modern baseball and proposes ideas for its improvement. Leavy argues that the sport, a "nineteenth-century construct," is struggling to maintain its relevance and has become overloaded with data and analytics at the expense of its "human element." The book is presented as a "barnstorming tour" of baseball, featuring conversations with players, managers, and innovators about how to make the game more accessible and engaging for new generations. While the reviewer notes recent rule changes have already improved the pace of play, Leavy's book is celebrated as a compelling love letter to the game's traditions.</p>

The company aims to remove the barrier of a separate trip to a pharmacy, which often results in prescriptions going unfilled.

In contrast, jobs requiring physical labor or significant human interaction, such as nursing or construction, are more insulated from the current capabilities of AI. Experts note the debate continues whether AI will primarily automate jobs, making workers obsolete, or augment them, increasing productivity, with most industries currently adopting a hybrid approach.

          <p>The UK Conservative Party is facing a significant demographic challenge, as its voter base continues to skew older while it struggles to gain support from young people. Polling data discussed at the party conference indicates that the average age of a Conservative voter is now in their late 60s, a trend described as unsustainable. Party members and MPs are debating strategies to reverse this, from increasing their presence on social media platforms like TikTok to implementing youth-focused policies like tax rebates and abolishing stamp duty to help with home ownership. The core challenge is convincing a generation for whom the current economy is not working that the party has relevant solutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute shows that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has increasingly issued warnings instead of meaningful enforcement actions, like fines, against businesses that violate the Animal Welfare Act. The report highlights cases of severe neglect at dog breeding facilities and primate research labs where violators received only a warning. This trend of weak enforcement has been exacerbated by a recent Supreme Court decision that has had a chilling effect on agencies imposing civil penalties. Critics argue that without stronger fines, many businesses view the penalties as a mere cost of doing business rather than a deterrent.</p>

          <p>As overall mortgage demand continues to weaken, borrowers still in the market are increasingly opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to find savings. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the share of ARM applications rose to 9.5% last week, as their interest rates are averaging nearly a full percentage point below 30-year fixed-rate loans. While total application volume fell, the move toward ARMs indicates that homebuyers are contending with high prices and interest rates by accepting more risk. These loans typically offer a lower initial rate for a fixed period before adjusting based on market conditions, which can lead to higher payments later. (not investment advice)</p>
