          <p>The Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran, an economist and adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors. The confirmation, which passed with a narrow 48-47 vote, places a Trump appointee on the board just before a critical meeting to decide on interest rates. Miran will serve a short term until January and has taken an unpaid leave of absence from his White House role, a move that has drawn criticism from Democrats who question his ability to maintain the Fed's independence. Miran has stated his intention to preserve the central bank's autonomy and would resign from his White House position if confirmed for a longer term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are pursuing a new trial based on recently surfaced evidence. This evidence includes a letter from Erik detailing abuse prior to the killings and an affidavit from a former boy band member, Roy Rossello, who alleges he was also sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez. Their lawyers argue these findings support the brothers' long-standing claim that they acted in self-defense after years of severe abuse, which should have resulted in a manslaughter conviction rather than murder. Despite a recent resentencing to 50 years to life and a subsequent denial of parole, their legal team hopes this new information will lead a judge to vacate their original convictions.</p>

          <p>Utah prosecutors have charged 22-year-old Tyler Robinson with aggravated murder for the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, announcing their intent to seek the death penalty. Robinson was also charged with multiple other counts, including obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Authorities state that Robinson's family identified him from surveillance images, and his mother noted his recent shift toward left-leaning political views. Evidence cited includes text messages where Robinson allegedly wrote a note stating, "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and I'm going to take it," indicating a potential political motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Eritrean man has successfully obtained a temporary injunction from the UK High Court, preventing his removal to France under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme. His lawyers argued that the decision was rushed and that he needed more time to present evidence that he may be a victim of modern slavery. Although the Home Office contested the claim, it acknowledged his right to make further representations, which would be difficult from France. The judge ruled there was a serious issue to be tried regarding the trafficking claim, setting a precedent that could affect other migrants scheduled for removal under the new agreement.</p>

          <p>An early morning fire at the Rosslyn Lofts, a high-rise apartment building in downtown Los Angeles, has resulted in the death of one resident. The blaze broke out around 2 a.m. on the seventh floor, prompting a response from over 100 firefighters who faced challenges accessing the fire without elevators. After extinguishing the flames, firefighters discovered the deceased individual inside one of the units, with no other injuries reported.

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced intense questioning from the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the investigation into Charlie Kirk's assassination and the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Patel defended his transparency during the Kirk investigation, which led to the suspect's arrest in under 36 hours, and confirmed the FBI is investigating individuals in a Discord chat linked to the suspect. Regarding the Epstein case, Patel blamed former U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta for a limited initial investigation and testified that Epstein was not an FBI informant. The hearing was marked by tense exchanges, particularly with Democratic senators who criticized Patel's leadership and public communications.</p>

          <p>While mortgage purchase rates have recently fallen, refinancing rates remain elevated, making it costly for many homeowners to access their home's equity through a traditional cash-out refinance. This article outlines two alternative methods for borrowing against home equity without altering an existing low-interest mortgage. Homeowners can consider a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which offers a variable rate and flexible borrowing, or a home equity loan, which provides a lump sum at a fixed rate. Both options allow homeowners to leverage their equity while waiting for a more favorable refinancing climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's credible threat to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that while the commercial terms of a deal had been settled for months, China paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements in April. The President's willingness to prioritize national security over the app's continued operation reportedly "turned the tide," leading to the current agreement. The White House has once again extended the divestiture deadline for ByteDance to December 16, providing time for the deal to be finalized between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

In response, stores like Walmart are actively courting these wealthier customers by remodeling stores for a better shopping experience and expanding their selection to include premium brands.

          <p>After more than a decade of steady increases, the national average FICO credit score in the U.S. has dropped for the second year in a row, now standing at 715. This decline is driven by mounting consumer debt, with delinquency rates for credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans reaching levels not seen since the 2009 financial crisis. High interest rates and inflation have pushed many Americans, particularly those in Generation Z, into financial distress, leading to missed payments and maxed-out credit lines. Experts suggest that while official economic data shows expansion, the rising debt and falling credit scores indicate many households are experiencing a personal recession.

          <h2>Journalist's Firing After Charlie Kirk's Death Highlights Rise of Workplace Censorship</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 14:27:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent firing of Washington Post columnist Karen Attiah and other employees at various companies for their comments following Charlie Kirk's death is highlighted as evidence of growing censorship within the private sector. Attiah claims she was unfairly terminated for posts that condemned violence and hatred, arguing her employer overreacted without evidence. The article contrasts the corporate response to Kirk's death with the lack of similar consequences for those who made insensitive comments after the assassination of a Minnesota state representative three months prior. This discrepancy suggests a politicized environment where free speech is increasingly policed by employers rather than the state.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has pushed back against criticism from pundits regarding the club's £450 million expenditure on eight new players this summer. Slot emphasized that the spending was largely offset by recouping over £250 million from player sales, arguing it was necessary to strengthen the squad. He defended the club's strategy of signing promising players aged 25 or under, including the British record £125 million signing of striker Alexander Isak. Slot asserted that Liverpool "did great business" and should be praised for its self-sustaining financial model, which he believes positions the team for long-term success.</p>

          <p>Legendary actor, director, and founder of the Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redford, has passed away at the age of 89 at his home in Utah. Redford, an Oscar-winning director for "Ordinary People," was celebrated for iconic roles in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "The Sting." His death prompted an outpouring of tributes from colleagues like Meryl Streep and Jane Fonda, who remembered him as a cultural giant and a beautiful person. Redford's most enduring legacy may be the Sundance Film Festival, which he established to champion independent filmmakers and which has since become a vital launchpad for new artistic voices in cinema.</p>

          <p>Many individuals may be exacerbating their debt problems through common but counterproductive financial habits. This article identifies three key behaviors: consistently making only the minimum payment on credit cards, which primarily covers interest; overusing "buy now, pay later" services for small purchases, which can lead to a significant accumulation of hidden debt; and relying on balance transfers as a temporary fix without addressing underlying spending issues. These practices can create a false sense of progress while trapping consumers in a long-term cycle of debt, especially in a high-interest-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, the former chief financial officer of Elon Musk's rival AI company, xAI, to serve as its business finance officer. Liberatore, who was at xAI for only three months, will be responsible for managing OpenAI's significant infrastructure spending, including its major compute contracts. This move marks the latest development in the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but have since had a public falling out.

She acknowledged that this reputation has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic."

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle company, Waymo, has received a permit to begin testing its robotaxi service at San Francisco International Airport (SFO). The rollout will occur in phases, starting with employee testing with human safety drivers on board before transitioning to a fully driverless commercial service for the public. This expansion marks a significant step for Waymo, which already operates in surrounding areas but did not previously have permission to service the airport. The move follows similar permits granted to Waymo at airports in Phoenix and San Jose, further advancing the integration of autonomous ride-hailing into major transportation hubs.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a preliminary investigation into the 2021 Tesla Model Y following multiple reports of inoperable electronic door handles. The probe covers over 174,000 vehicles and was prompted by nine owner complaints, several of which described being locked out of the car after placing a child inside, in some cases forcing them to break a window to gain entry. The issue appears to be linked to insufficient voltage reaching the electronic door locks, occurring without any prior warning to the driver. While the vehicles have internal manual releases, they are often inaccessible or inoperable for small children.</p>

Speaker Mike Johnson is targeting a vote by Friday, but the bill faces an uncertain path as Democrats are demanding an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies.

          <p>This editorial argues that President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine has been characterized by empty threats and a failure to take meaningful action against Russia. Despite initial promises of "bone-crushing" sanctions, the administration has repeatedly failed to follow through, emboldening Vladimir Putin to continue his aggression, as seen with the recent drone incursion into Poland. The article contends that Trump's latest demands—tying tougher Russia sanctions to unrealistic EU trade concessions regarding China and LNG imports—are diversionary tactics. This strategy of bullying allies while avoiding direct pressure on Moscow is steadily undermining Ukrainian and broader European security interests.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates, savers are encouraged to consider long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in current high yields. A 2-year CD offers a balance of a guaranteed return over an extended period while providing flexibility for future financial strategy. With top rates currently around 4.06%, a $10,000 deposit could earn approximately $828 in interest over the 24-month term. This article explains that while variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings offer more liquidity, their rates will likely fall with Fed cuts, making fixed-rate CDs an attractive option for protecting returns.
