          <p>The UK and Irish governments have unveiled a new framework to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles, replacing the controversial Legacy Act. The deal aims to provide reconciliation and justice for victims by establishing a reformed Legacy Commission with independent oversight and cross-border cooperation, including a new legacy unit within the Irish police. While acknowledging that trust is shattered, officials hope the "honest attempt" will win the confidence of victims over time and represent a final opportunity to heal deep wounds from the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, criticizing the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" for its excessive length and florid detail. The judge, Steven Merryday, cited violations of federal rules requiring concise allegations, pointing to superfluous references to "The Apprentice" and the "Russia Collusion Hoax." Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended complaint, limited to 40 pages, allowing the case to potentially proceed in a more focused form.</p>

          <p>NATO forces intercepted three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets that violated the airspace of member state Estonia over the Gulf of Finland. The incursion, which lasted for 12 minutes, was condemned by Estonia as "unprecedentedly brazen," leading it to summon Russia's chargé d'affaires and request Article 4 consultations with NATO allies. This incident follows recent Russian drone breaches in Poland and Romania, escalating tensions and prompting the alliance to bolster its eastern flank with additional troops and air defense missions.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary effect on the U.S. economy, placing him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee. Miran, who was the lone dissenter in the recent vote to cut interest rates, argued that there is no evidence of macroeconomically significant inflation from tariffs, citing a lack of differential inflation in import-intensive goods. He anticipates stronger economic growth in the second half of the year and suggests that changes in immigration policy could have a disinflationary effect. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has failed to advance two separate short-term government funding bills, bringing Congress no closer to a solution as the October 1 deadline approaches. Both a House-passed Republican bill and a Democratic counter-proposal were blocked in procedural votes, with neither garnering enough support to move forward. The legislative stalemate heightens the risk of a government shutdown, as lawmakers remain deadlocked on a path to keep federal agencies funded and operational before time runs out.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that NBA star Kevin Durant has successfully recovered access to his Bitcoin holdings on the platform after being locked out for years. Durant, an early investor in Coinbase, purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was significantly lower than its current trading price of around $116,000. The situation has highlighted broader customer service issues at the cryptocurrency exchange, prompting Armstrong to state that the company is putting a "big focus on getting better" at user support.</p>

          <p>Britain's state visit for U.S. President Donald Trump, marked by royal pageantry and flattering words from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, yielded mixed results according to political analysts.

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency order to enforce its policy requiring passports to reflect the holder's "biological sex at birth," effectively ending the use of the "X" gender marker. The policy, a reversal of the Biden administration's approach, has been blocked by a lower court injunction that found it was likely motivated by animus toward transgender people and violated their equal protection rights. The administration argues the injunction forces it to act in contravention of the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a "courageous American patriot," a move that created a difficult vote for Democrats. While House leadership supported the resolution, which condemns political violence, many progressive members voted no or present, citing Kirk's history of controversial and divisive rhetoric. Opponents like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez argued that honoring Kirk ignored his past statements, while supporters of the measure felt it was important to unequivocally condemn his murder.</p>

          <p>A potential deal to resolve TikTok's U.S. ownership may involve a licensing agreement for its highly coveted algorithm, a major point of contention in negotiations. China had previously vowed to block the sale of the technology, which is crucial to the app's success, but may be shifting its stance to allow parent company ByteDance to retain some control and revenue. However, national security experts warn that a licensing deal, where ByteDance could still access metrics or influence content, might not fully resolve U.S. concerns about data privacy.</p>

          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) more affordable for homeowners looking to tap into their equity. A $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term now costs approximately $608 per month, down from over $640 last year, reflecting the drop in the average interest rate to around 8.05%. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they can adjust downward with Fed cuts, making them cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans, although borrowers must also account for potential volatility.

This downward trend is energizing the housing market, but the extent of the drop depends heavily on future inflation data, with sticky inflation posing a risk that could keep rates closer to 6%.
