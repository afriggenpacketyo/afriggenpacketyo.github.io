          <p>Restoration Hardware's CEO, Gary Friedman, witnessed his company's stock plummet during an earnings call, reacting with an expletive.  The drop was attributed to the release of a poor earnings report and President Trump's newly imposed tariffs on foreign goods.  Friedman highlighted the challenging housing market as a contributing factor, while acknowledging the company's performance despite adverse conditions.  He warned analysts to expect a higher-risk business environment.</p>

          <p>Major automakers showed surprising resilience in the stock market following the implementation of President Trump's 25% tariff on imported vehicles.

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended President Trump's new tariffs, predicting they will force other countries to re-evaluate their trade policies and offer greater access to American goods.  He anticipates a "reordering" of fair trade, addressing non-tariff barriers.  Despite immediate market reactions showing significant stock declines, Lutnick expressed confidence in the long-term benefits for U.S. products.  His statements contrast with economists' concerns about potential global trade wars and inflation.</p>
