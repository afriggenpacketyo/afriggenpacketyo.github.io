          <p>House Republicans are proceeding with a vote this week on a tax bill containing President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, but internal GOP divisions persist. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledges more work is needed, with disagreements remaining on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Conservative holdouts want deeper cuts to clean energy subsidies and Medicaid, while moderates resist Medicaid slashes and demand SALT relief. President Trump is expected to pressure Republicans to pass the bill, which also faces Senate resistance. The inclusion of a debt limit increase adds urgency, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of potential inability to pay bills by August if Congress does not act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that markets and central banks are underestimating the risks posed by record U.S. deficits, tariffs, and international tensions. Dimon believes the risks of higher inflation and stagflation are not adequately reflected in stock market values. He anticipates Wall Street earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies will decline, potentially leading to a fall in stock prices. Dimon's comments follow Moody's credit rating downgrade of the U.S., citing concerns about growing debt. A top deputy noted that corporate clients are in a "wait-and-see" mode regarding acquisitions, with investment banking revenue expected to decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has allowed five UN lorries carrying humanitarian aid into Gaza after an 11-week blockade, but the UN calls it a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the urgent needs of 2.1 million Palestinians. Prime Minister Netanyahu cited pressure from US senators as the reason for temporarily allowing minimal food supplies, emphasizing the need to avoid famine for both practical and diplomatic reasons. Netanyahu stated that food deliveries would continue until Israeli military and private companies establish aid distribution hubs under a US-backed plan. Meanwhile, Israeli air strikes continue, and the military has ordered evacuations in Khan Younis, signaling an impending 'unprecedented attack.' International leaders have criticized Israel's actions, with some threatening further concrete actions if the offensive continues and aid restrictions persist.</p>

          <p>NFL owners are set to discuss a potential ban on the 'tush push' play, with Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu calling it a 'cheapo play' akin to a rugby scrum. Luvu suggests the play gives an unfair advantage and disrupts defensive cadences. He was penalized three times for jumping over the line of scrimmage during January's NFC Championship game against the Eagles, who heavily rely on the play. The NFL's vote on the ban was previously tabled due to an even split among owners, requiring 24 votes to pass. The Eagles' success with the 'tush push' has made it a point of contention within the league.</p>

          <p>Newark Airport experienced a brief radio system outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control center, marking the fourth such incident since April 28. The FAA is investigating the two-second outage, stating that all aircraft remained safely separated. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said upgrades to the nation's air traffic control system are underway, costing tens of billions of dollars, but the existing system relies on decades-old technology. The Philadelphia air traffic control facility handling Newark flights is also experiencing a staffing shortage, adding to the challenges. More than 90% of the nation's airport towers are inadequately staffed, falling short of standards set by a working group.</p>

Beijing has demanded the Trump administration 'correct its mistakes,' calling the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance 'discriminatory' and 'market distorting.' The U.S. Commerce Department issued an alert warning of the risks of using PRC advanced-computing ICs, including specific Huawei Ascend chips, stating they were likely developed or produced in violation of U.S. export controls. These events occurred shortly after Washington and Beijing agreed to a 90-day pause on most tariffs, suggesting the U.S. stance on Chinese chips could impede further trade progress.</p>

          <p>After days of intense hostilities, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire, with President Trump claiming credit for the agreement to halt military action along The Line of Control in Kashmir. The conflict's dynamics were shaped by both militaries' use of missiles, drones, and related technologies, marking the first conflict to showcase Chinese, American, Russian, and French weapons systems. The use of these technologically advanced weapons incentivized limited action, giving rise to tit-for-tat action and a protracted crisis, while simultaneously creating an environment where both sides alluded to being constrained in their military responses. This highlights a restraint-escalation paradox in modern warfare.</p>

The judge stated that the administration's actions to dismantle USIP, including terminating its board members, staff, and dispersing its assets, were unlawful. The ruling emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The judge noted that Trump used force and 'threats of criminal process' to take over the USIP headquarters.</p>

          <p>The Senate is expected to hold a key procedural vote on a crypto regulation bill after Democratic opposition stalled an initial attempt due to concerns about ties between the digital asset industry and the Trump family. The GENIUS Act aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is advocating for the measure, calling it a 'meaningful step forward,' but voiced concerns about the Trump family's use of crypto technologies. Senator Elizabeth Warren is urging colleagues to vote against the updated version, stating that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given suggests that midfielder Jack Grealish may need to leave the club this summer due to a lack of playing time. Grealish, a record signing for City, has struggled to secure regular starts and was an unused substitute in the recent FA Cup final. Given believes Grealish is not being treated fairly and should seek a fresh start at a club where he can play regularly. He also questioned why Pep Guardiola even brought him to London. The situation raises questions about Grealish's future heading into a World Cup year, after he missed out on England selection for Euro 2024.</p>

Flores sustained severe burns during a mandated firearm skills test in October 2023 and was hospitalized for six months until his death.

          <p>Experts are warning that the Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit, prompting concerns from Wall Street. The proposed tax breaks are projected to outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to higher debt levels. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The bill faces opposition from the House Freedom Caucus, who say it fails to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government. The Trump administration disagrees, claiming the bill has $1.6 trillion worth of savings. (not investment advice)</p>

The sculpture, by Croatian artist Mladen Mikulin, was found during a search tied to a fraud case led by the Paris public prosecutor's office. Morrison's grave is the world's most-visited resting place of a musician. The Doors, founded in Los Angeles, were among the most influential rock groups of the late 1960s and early 70s. In February, Paris named a bridge after the iconic singer.</p>

Investor concerns mounted after Moody's slashed the U.S.' credit rating on Friday, bringing it down one notch from Aaa to Aa1. The agency attributed the downgrade to the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit, as well as the high cost of rolling over existing debt amid high interest rates.
