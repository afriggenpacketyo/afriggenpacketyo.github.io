          <p>Bain Capital, the controlling shareholder of luxury parka maker Canada Goose, is considering selling its stake as the company faces take-private bids valuing it at approximately $1.35 billion. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, while other potential buyers include Bosideng International and a FountainVest Capital-Anta Sports consortium. Industry observers suggest that going private could offer greater autonomy for a turnaround, as Canada Goose has struggled with growth, declining revenues in key markets like China, and questions about its brand positioning amid cautious consumer spending. This potential exit comes after Bain's 12-year control, exceeding typical private equity investment cycles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, citing "gross negligence" and "potentially criminal" actions related to mortgage documents. Cook and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, assert the move lacks legal basis, as Fed board members serve 14-year terms and can only be removed "for cause," and plan to file a lawsuit. The central bank has deferred decisions on Cook's status pending a court ruling, emphasizing the importance of long tenures for monetary policy independence. This action marks an early test of Trump's authority over the Fed, following months of his criticism regarding interest rates and Fed Chair Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Civil rights advocates, including the NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, have filed a lawsuit against Texas, seeking to overturn new redistricting maps. They allege the maps, designed to favor Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections, illegally dilute the electoral influence of Black voters and are racially motivated. The NAACP highlights a history of discrimination in Texas redistricting and argues the state's intent is unconstitutional. Texas Republicans, who approved the maps along party lines, maintain they followed the law and based the changes on political performance, with Governor Greg Abbott predicting the maps will withstand court challenges.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading as investors evaluated China's industrial profits and impending U.S. tariffs on India. China's industrial profits saw a recovery in July, declining by a slower 1.5% year-on-year, attributed to Beijing's efforts against price wars. Meanwhile, additional U.S. tariffs of 25% on India's exports, pushing total duties to 50% over its Russian oil purchases, are set to take effect. Japan's Nikkei 225 was marginally up, boosted by Nikon, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 showed slight movements. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 also saw modest gains, with some analysts noting "irrational exuberance" in the latter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. has launched a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to counter negative perceptions, while approximately 110 National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen picking up trash. Although 800 Guard members were ordered into the city, only a fraction patrol with police, with others handling logistics and community projects like litter removal. The city's tourism leaders aim to build on a record 27.2 million visitors in 2024, despite a projected drop in international visitation for 2025. This backdrop highlights a political battle over the capital's image, with major renovations and museum openings planned for America's 250th anniversary in 2026.</p>

          <p>India's merchandise exports to the U.S., its largest export partner, are under severe threat as new U.S. tariffs, totaling 50% due to additional levies over Russian oil purchases, take effect.

Major export sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, are particularly vulnerable. While some electronic and pharmaceutical goods currently have exemptions, there are threats of future tariffs, raising concerns about India's overall export competitiveness against regional rivals.

          <p>China's industrial profits declined by 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policy campaign against price wars, which has helped enhance companies' profit margins. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell 1.7%. State-backed firms saw a larger drop of 7.5%, while businesses with foreign investments experienced a 1.8% increase.

          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, identified as Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. He received a suspended 18-month sentence for preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act abroad. Prosecutors stated he supported the Islamic State group's ideology and communicated with an Austrian acquaintance who planned to use knives or explosives outside the stadium. The defendant made a "comprehensive confession," acknowledging sending bomb-building instructions and organizing contact with an IS member. Austrian authorities arrested two suspects in August 2024, preventing a potential attack on up to 95,000 fans.</p>

          <p>Dezi Freeman, 56, is the "sovereign citizen" at the center of a major manhunt in Victoria, Australia, accused of fatally shooting two police officers and injuring a third. Freeman, a conspiracy theorist who rejects government authority, has a documented history of animosity towards law enforcement, including calling police "terrorist thugs" and attempting to arrest a magistrate. Locals noted his behavior became erratic and his views extreme during the Covid pandemic. An experienced bushman, Freeman is believed to be heavily armed, posing a significant challenge to the search party. This article highlights the growing concern over the "sovereign citizen" movement's capacity to inspire violence.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have finalized their initial 53-man roster for the upcoming season, with Trey Lance winning the backup quarterback position behind Justin Herbert. This move signifies confidence in Lance's talent, which once made him a top-three draft pick.

The team's offensive line remains a question mark due to injuries, but the running back group sees new additions with Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris expected to carry a heavy workload.

          <p>Microsoft requested police intervention to remove protesters who improperly entered a building at its Redmond headquarters, including President Brad Smith's office. The group, "No Azure for Apartheid," protested Microsoft's alleged use of its software by the Israeli military in Gaza, delivering a court summons. Smith condemned the actions, noting that while employee views are respected, trespassing and planting listening devices are unacceptable. Two of the seven individuals removed were employees, and disciplinary action is being considered. This incident follows similar protests at other tech giants and highlights growing controversy over megacap tech companies' increasing work with defense agencies, particularly amid the escalating conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he already has a replacement in mind for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, even as she prepares to sue his administration over her removal. Speaking during a cabinet meeting, Trump mentioned consulting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick for the position, and is reportedly considering nominating economic adviser Stephen Miran. Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, has called Trump's attempt to fire her "illegal," asserting she will challenge the move to retain her position. This development underscores the ongoing tension between the Trump administration and the independent central bank, particularly concerning appointments and monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents related to the bureau's "Crossfire Hurricane" probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. The investigation reportedly stems from the discovery of thousands of Russia-related documents in "burn bags" at FBI headquarters by Director Kash Patel. This probe aligns with Trump's long-standing claims of a "hoax" and "witch hunt" regarding the Russia allegations. While no criminal charges have been filed, top administration officials have accused Obama-era intelligence leaders of "treasonous conspiracy." The FBI's 2017 report and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings both concluded Russian interference aimed to benefit Trump's campaign.</p>

          <p>The small town of Mason, Tennessee, is deeply divided over the decision to reopen a shuttered private prison as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. Supporters, including Mayor Eddie Noeman, believe the CoreCivic-owned facility will bring over 200 jobs and much-needed revenue to the financially struggling town. However, opponents like Alderwoman Virginia Rivers argue against for-profit prisons and potential mistreatment of detainees, stating "all money is not good money." President Trump's reversal of a Biden-era policy against private prison contracts enabled the reopening. CoreCivic has a history of staffing deficiencies and higher inmate mortality rates compared to government-run prisons in Tennessee.</p>

California has sued to challenge these funding cuts, calling the decision illegal and "petty, political retribution" by President Trump against Governor Gavin Newsom.

          <p>Grocery giant Kroger is laying off nearly 1,000 corporate employees as part of a business restructuring aimed at trimming costs and simplifying its model. This move follows the failed merger with Albertsons last year, which was blocked by a federal judge over competition concerns. The affected associates do not work in stores, manufacturing, or distribution centers. Interim CEO Ron Sargent stated these "difficult choices" are necessary for continued success. Kroger, which operates over 2,700 stores nationwide, has also faced other challenges, including closing 60 locations and a former CEO's resignation. Despite these setbacks, the company's shares have risen, indicating investor confidence in its management. (not investment advice)</p>

The resort owner and homeowners have sued Maui Land & Pineapple, alleging failure to maintain a century-old water delivery system, a claim the latter attributes to record low stream levels, not inefficiency. This dispute highlights broader water management issues on Maui, with the resort aiming to use limited water for fertilizer and grass removal to save the courses.</p>
