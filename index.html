          <p>A group of Democratic senators is questioning Google about its settlement talks with former President Donald Trump's lawyers regarding a censorship lawsuit. The senators expressed concern over a potential "quid-pro-quo" arrangement, where Google might settle the suit to gain favorable treatment from the administration on other legal matters. The inquiry comes as Google faces significant federal antitrust and labor lawsuits, and highlights the complex intersection of corporate legal battles and political influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel's CEO, describing him as "highly conflicted" in a social media post. This demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton, which raised concerns about the CEO's alleged investments and business ties to Chinese companies, including some with links to the Chinese military. The president's statement prompted an immediate negative reaction in the market, with Intel's stock falling over 4% in premarket trading.</p>

The "one in, one out" deal involves the UK returning one migrant to France for each approved asylum seeker it accepts from there. The initial detentions occurred in Dover, with the government stating those held will be in removal centers until they are sent back, a process that could begin within weeks despite the potential for legal challenges.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a savings vehicle that can offer returns surpassing the inflation rate. This article outlines the current national average CD yields and contrasts them with the significantly higher rates offered by top institutions, which are often online banks.

It acknowledges that while rates are higher than in previous years, securing a good rate is still possible, particularly for applicants with strong credit profiles.

          <p>A massive wildfire in the Aude region of southern France, described as the largest in the country in 75 years, continues to burn out of control. The blaze has devastated an area larger than the city of Paris, causing at least one death, injuring 13 people, and destroying dozens of homes. Despite the deployment of over 2,000 firefighters and water-bombing aircraft, officials state that while the fire's intensity has decreased, it is not yet contained.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose a 100% tariff on imported semiconductors has placed immense pressure on Taiwan's world-leading chip industry. The policy effectively forces Taiwanese companies into a costly choice: pay the massive tariff or undertake enormous investments to build new manufacturing facilities in the United States. While the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, may be exempt due to its existing U.S. investments, the threat creates significant uncertainty for the rest of Taiwan's vital tech sector.

          <p>This personal essay delves into the profound and often socially unrecognized grief of losing a sibling, particularly during one's formative years. The author describes this experience as a form of "disenfranchised grief," which can lead to a feeling of lost identity, as one is no longer a sibling but not truly an only child. The piece reflects on the complex emotions and the lifelong process of reconciling a life shaped as much by a sibling's absence as by their presence.</p>
