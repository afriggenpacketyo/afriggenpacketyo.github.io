        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ACLU of Idaho has filed a federal lawsuit challenging a new state law set to restrict public benefits for undocumented immigrants, including access to life-saving HIV medication. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a doctor and four immigrant patients with HIV, argues the law is unconstitutionally vague and contradicts federal statutes. It creates a public health risk by potentially causing patients to lose their undetectable viral status, which prevents transmission of the virus. The law, effective July 1, requires verification of legal residency for services like disease testing, vaccinations, and food assistance, representing a significant tightening of state-level immigration policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has confirmed significant changes to its welfare reform bill after facing a potential defeat from over 100 rebel Labour MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that current claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will not be affected by the planned cuts, which will now only apply to future claimants. This move is seen as a major climbdown for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's administration, which had initially sought to save £5 billion annually through these reforms. The concessions have largely placated the rebels, making the bill's passage through Parliament likely, though it raises new questions about funding the government's economic plans.</p>

          <p>During the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, economists argued that for China to achieve long-term prosperity, it must shift from a production-focused to a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu noted that China's reliance on subsidizing production creates trade imbalances and global friction, suggesting that increasing internal consumption is crucial for harmonious international relations. The panel recommended that China's government incentivize consumption as a measure of success for local officials. This structural reform is presented as essential for sustainable growth, beyond just achieving technological supremacy with advancements like new AI models. (not investment advice)</p>

The initial lockdown, which began on June 12, suspended visits and phone calls and confined high-security inmates to their cells. Officials stated the measure was necessary after 13 inmates were killed by other prisoners this year. Recent searches have uncovered 169 weapons and 310 cellphones, and investigations are ongoing at the facilities that remain restricted, including Pelican Bay and High Desert state prisons.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid delivered its most cohesive performance under new manager Xabi Alonso, defeating Red Bull Salzburg 3-0 to win Group H of the Club World Cup. The victory was powered by standout performances from Vinícius Júnior and Jude Bellingham, who combined for the opening goal. Vinícius also provided a brilliant backheel assist for Fede Valverde's goal, with Gonzalo García adding a third. The win ensures Madrid avoids a last-16 clash with Manchester City and will instead face Juventus, showcasing an effective blend of tactical structure and individual brilliance from its star players.</p>

The National Weather Service received over 140 reports from Georgia, South Carolina, and neighboring states around 12:30 p.m. In Henry County, Georgia, a resident reported a rock crashed through their roof, leaving a small hole in the ceiling, around the same time a sonic boom was heard. While space debris entering Earth's atmosphere is common, it is rare for an object to be bright enough to be clearly visible in broad daylight.</p>

          <p>An Egyptian man has pleaded guilty to harming a law enforcement animal after he kicked a U.S. Customs and Border Protection beagle at Washington Dulles International Airport. The 70-year-old man, Hamed Aly Marie, kicked the dog, Freddie, so hard that it became airborne after the beagle alerted officers to over 100 pounds of prohibited food in his luggage. Freddie was treated for contusions, and Marie was sentenced to time served, ordered to pay the veterinarian bills, and deported back to Egypt. The prohibited agricultural products were seized to prevent the potential introduction of foreign diseases.</p>

          <h2>China Warns Philippines Against Hosting US Missiles, Calling it 'Self-Inflicted Destruction'</h2>

          <p>China's Defence Ministry has issued a stern warning to the Philippines, stating that hosting U.S. missile systems would be an act of "self-inflicted destruction" that binds Manila to the "US war machine." The warning comes after the Philippines confirmed that U.S. anti-ship missile systems used in recent joint military exercises would remain in the country as a deterrent. Chinese ministry spokesman Zhang Xiaogang argued that this move undermines regional stability and is akin to "inviting wolves into the house." The escalating rhetoric highlights the growing geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea between Beijing, Manila, and Washington.</p>

          <p>During a segment on "The Five," Fox News host Jessica Tarlov openly expressed disbelief at Senator Tom Cotton's explanation regarding the recent U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites. Tarlov rolled her eyes while quoting Cotton's statement that destroying uranium was not part of the mission, questioning why it wouldn't be a primary goal if the U.S. believed it was present. Her reaction highlighted a rare moment of on-air dissent regarding the administration's narrative, contrasting with President Trump's claims that Iran's nuclear capabilities were "obliterated." The exchange underscored the ongoing debate and uncertainty surrounding the actual success and strategic goals of the military action.</p>

          <h2>Trump Makes Final Pitch for Tax and Spending Bill Without Mentioning July 4 Deadline</h2>

          <p>In a final appeal for his major tax-and-spending bill, President Donald Trump did not mention the July 4 deadline he had previously set for its passage. Speaking at the White House, Trump promoted the bill's benefits, including tax cut extensions and increased funding for immigration enforcement, to an audience of supporters. The legislation faces significant opposition from Democrats, who have criticized its deep cuts to programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The omission of the deadline suggests an acknowledgment of the challenges the bill faces in securing passage through a divided Senate.</p>

          <h2>Senators Remain Divided on Iran Strikes After Contentious Intelligence Briefing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 20:48:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A closed-door intelligence briefing on the U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites has left senators sharply divided along partisan lines, failing to resolve conflicting reports about the mission's effectiveness. Republicans like Lindsey Graham echoed President Trump's claim that Iran's capabilities were "obliterated," while Democrats like Chuck Schumer argued the administration has no coherent long-term strategy. The briefing proceeded without the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, fueling accusations that the White House is stonewalling Congress. The deep divisions reflect the ongoing political and intelligence community disputes over the true impact of the strikes and the legality of the unilateral military action.</p>
