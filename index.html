            <p>Netflix reported a significant earnings beat for the first quarter of 2025, with revenue growing by 13% due to higher subscription and advertising revenue. The company increased its pricing across all plans in late January and is focusing on revenue and financial metrics rather than subscriber data. Netflix continues to forecast full-year revenue between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting the entertainment industry's resilience during tougher economic times. The company is also enhancing its in-house ad tech platform, planning to expand it into more markets. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Brazil recorded a trade deficit with China for the first two months of 2025, marking the first time in nearly a decade, driven by a surge in Chinese imports, including solar panels and petroleum drilling platforms. The deficit reached $3.2 billion in February, deviating from Brazil's typical trade surplus with China. However, by the end of the first quarter, Brazil regained a $700 million trade surplus with China. The initial import surge was attributed to concerns among Brazilian business executives about the escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington.</p>

            <p>The FDA is suspending a quality-control program for its food-testing laboratories due to staff cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). This program, part of the Food Emergency Response Network, ensures consistency and accuracy across 170 labs testing food for pathogens and contaminants. The suspension, lasting until at least September 30, will halt planned quality-control work on lab testing for cyclospora in spinach and glyphosate in barley. These cuts are part of a larger effort by Donald Trump to reduce HHS funding by as much as $40 billion.</p>

The initiative aims to provide theoretical support for borderland governance and counter Western perspectives on China's borderlands.

            <p>President Trump announced that the United States and Ukraine will sign a critical minerals deal next week. This announcement follows a tense meeting with Ukraine's leader. Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, stated that the two countries had virtually signed a memorandum as a first step towards the agreement. The deal grants American companies access to Ukraine's vast mineral reserves and allows them to participate in rebuilding the country's infrastructure. This partnership aims to strengthen economic ties between the two nations.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration, through the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and Amtrak, is taking control of the reconstruction of Penn Station in New York from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). The DOT claims this move will save taxpayers approximately $120 million and will utilize a public-private partnership model. This decision follows criticism of Amtrak and remarks from Elon Musk about the state of U.S. passenger rail. Penn Station, the busiest transit hub in the Western Hemisphere, has faced years of controversy regarding its renovation plans.</p>

            <p>A series of Israeli strikes in Gaza resulted in the deaths of at least 37 people, mostly in areas where displaced civilians had set up tents. Witnesses reported that tents were engulfed in flames following a powerful explosion in al-Mawasi, an area where Israel had previously directed Palestinians to evacuate. The Israeli military stated they are investigating the reports. Hamas formally rejected Israel's latest ceasefire proposal, stating they are ready to negotiate a deal involving the release of all remaining hostages in exchange for an end to the war.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology. The US Department of Justice, along with 17 US states, sued Google, arguing the tech giant was illegally dominating the technology which determines which adverts should be placed online and where. This is the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, after it was ruled the company also had a monopoly on online search. Google said it would appeal against the decision.</p>

            <p>Netflix reported strong first-quarter earnings despite rising economic uncertainty, with revenue growing 13% to $10.5 billion, fueled by membership growth and higher prices. Net income jumped 24% to $2.89 billion, exceeding analysts' forecasts. Executives expressed confidence in weathering tariff-fueled economic concerns, citing the low-cost ad plan and strong engagement. Analysts believe Netflix's market position provides a cushion. Programs like "Adolescence" and "Back in Action" have contributed to the streaming service's success. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Several Republican-led states, including Arkansas, Idaho, and Indiana, are moving to ban the purchase of soda and candy with SNAP benefits. The rationale behind these restrictions is to improve the health of low-income Americans. However, anti-hunger advocates argue that such measures stigmatize recipients and are unlikely to improve eating habits. They suggest focusing on the high cost of groceries, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. The Trump administration is signaling its support for granting waivers to states seeking to implement these restrictions.</p>
