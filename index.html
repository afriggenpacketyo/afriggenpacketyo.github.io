          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are fighting a Department of Justice effort to unseal grand jury testimony related to her and Jeffrey Epstein's cases. They argue that releasing the information, which consists of testimony from two law enforcement officers, would violate grand jury secrecy and prejudice Maxwell's ongoing legal challenges, as she is still pursuing an appeal to the Supreme Court. The filing emphasizes that Maxwell is alive and her due process rights are at stake, unlike Epstein, and that she has not been allowed to review the materials herself. Some of Epstein's victims have expressed support for unsealing the files, provided their identities are protected.</p>

          <p>Restaurant conglomerate Yum Brands, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, has become an unofficial training ground for the industry's future chief executives. The company's focus on leadership development, a legacy from its time as part of PepsiCo, has produced a notable roster of alumni who now lead rival chains like Starbucks, Brinker International, and Cracker Barrel. Experts attribute this trend to a "people first" culture and the ample opportunities for executives to gain experience across its massive global operations. The internal competition for top roles often encourages talented leaders to seek CEO positions elsewhere, spreading Yum's influence across the sector.</p>

          <p>A significant political battle is unfolding in Texas over a Republican-led effort to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade, a move that could secure them three to five additional House seats. This effort has national implications, given the GOP's narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. In protest, Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny a voting quorum, prompting the governor to order their arrest. The move has drawn criticism and promises of retaliatory gerrymandering from Democratic governors in states like New York and California, escalating the partisan conflict over electoral boundaries.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, and several former attorneys general and FBI directors as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bipartisan effort seeks depositions and documents to scrutinize the federal government's handling of the sex trafficking investigations involving Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. This move follows the Justice Department's conclusion that no "client list" existed, which angered some lawmakers and the public. The committee aims to use its findings to inform potential legislative reforms regarding sex-crime investigations and non-prosecution agreements.</p>

          <p>Shares of cryptocurrency platform Coinbase experienced a significant drop after the company revealed plans for a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. The stock's decline marks a more than 30% fall from its record high in July, which was driven by legislative momentum for the crypto industry. Despite a strong year-to-date performance and optimism about its long-term prospects tied to AI and the broader crypto market, investors reacted with a risk-off stance. The company had recently reported disappointing second-quarter revenue, contributing to the waning momentum after a period of rapid growth earlier in the year.</p>

The attack is believed to be a domestic violence incident, where the suspect allegedly forced his way into an apartment and shot the two women in a bathroom where they were hiding with five children. The chief also highlighted challenges for local law enforcement due to restrictions on cooperating with federal immigration agencies, sparking a debate on crime and immigration policy.</p>

          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals how much a $500 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account could earn, highlighting the potential for modest but guaranteed returns in the current economic climate. With top rates for a one-year CD around 4.40%, the account would yield approximately $22, while a five-year term at 4.15% could generate over $112. These fixed rates offer predictability, a significant advantage as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts loom, which would likely lower returns on other savings vehicles. The article suggests that while the earnings are not substantial, CDs provide a secure way to grow savings compared to traditional accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tax package enacted under President Donald Trump is scheduled to introduce significant changes to the charitable deduction for high-income earners starting in 2026. The new rules will establish a floor, allowing deductions only on donations exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and will also cap the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners advise proactive strategies for 2025, such as "bunching" several years of donations into one to maximize the more generous current deduction. The legislation also creates a new, smaller deduction for non-itemizers, capped at $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers. (not investment advice)</p>

While cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish contributed to the damage, scientists warn the reef is approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Open Network reveals that a cancer diagnosis significantly increases monthly out-of-pocket expenses for privately insured patients under 65. Researchers found that costs jumped by an average of nearly $600 per month in the six months following a diagnosis. The financial burden escalates with the severity of the disease, with stage 4 cancer patients facing an increase of over $700 per month in costs. The findings highlight the substantial financial toxicity of cancer, even for those with insurance, and underscore the need for policy solutions like paid sick leave to support patients during treatment.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at a warehouse party in downtown Los Angeles resulted in the deaths of two people and left six others wounded. The incident occurred early Monday morning after police had earlier responded to shut down a large party in the area and arrested one person. When officers returned following reports of gunfire, they discovered one man dead at the scene; a woman later died at the hospital. The motive for the shooting is unknown, and no suspect information has been released. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass condemned the "senseless violence" and stated that gang interventionists were providing support to the community.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, total U.S. credit card debt rose to $1.21 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, matching the all-time high set a year prior. The data also revealed that delinquency rates remain elevated, with 6.93% of balances transitioning into delinquency over the past year. Researchers noted that this trend may be due to consumers overextending themselves amid inflation and the end of pandemic-era leniency from lenders. Other data shows particular strain among subprime borrowers, indicating a growing split in the financial health of American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analytical article questions why the extremist group Proud Boys has been less visibly active since Donald Trump's second term began, despite his pardoning of members convicted for the January 6th insurrection. The piece suggests that internal fractures, including disavowals of former leader Enrique Tarrio, have weakened the group. More significantly, it argues that the Trump administration's aggressive actions, particularly on mass deportations, have co-opted the group's core agenda, leaving them with less to protest. With federal agencies like ICE enacting policies aligned with their interests, some far-right groups are reportedly "keeping it low-key" as the government itself pursues their goals.</p>

The practice was initiated in February by Elon Musk during his time at the Department of Government Efficiency as part of an effort to reduce the federal workforce. The directive, which threatened that non-compliance would be treated as a resignation, was met with resistance, with many agencies instructing staff to ignore it from the start.

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs economist, the effects of generative AI on the labor market are already becoming visible, particularly in the technology sector. While widespread adoption is still nascent, there has been a noticeable pullback in tech hiring over the last three years, deviating from a two-decade growth trend. The impact is most pronounced among younger workers, with unemployment for tech employees aged 20-30 rising by three percentage points this year. The analysis suggests companies are delaying hiring for junior roles that are more easily automated, offering an early glimpse into the potential for AI-related job displacement.

Witnesses reported that Black expressed being in significant pain shortly after the lethal injection began, raising questions about whether the device activated and caused unnecessary suffering. His attorneys had fought to have the device deactivated, arguing it could prolong the execution, but were overruled by the state's Supreme Court. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters.

Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, which included a sharp 18.6% drop in motor vehicle thefts.

The author points to instances where critics of Israel, including Senator Bernie Sanders, were accused of "blood libel," a term for a medieval anti-Semitic canard. This rhetorical strategy, the article contends, is used to shut down debate and bears a resemblance to illiberal tactics from the left.
