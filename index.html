          <p>Svetlana Dali was found guilty by a Brooklyn federal jury for stowing away on a Delta flight from JFK to Paris in November 2024. Dali passed through security using a crewmember lane and blended with boarding passengers to bypass gate agents. Dali admitted to not having a boarding pass and staying in the bathroom for most of the flight. After being sent back to the U.S., Dali allegedly cut off her ankle monitor and attempted to cross into Canada, leading to further charges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department, ordering officials to reinstate thousands of fired employees. The ruling, a preliminary injunction, is a setback for the president's plans to reorganize the agency. The judge agreed with plaintiffs that the actions equated to an illegal shutdown of the agency, which only Congress can abolish. The administration plans to challenge the decision.</p>
