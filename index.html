        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and sustained interest from institutional investors. According to CoinShares, broader macro concerns, such as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, further fueled Bitcoin's rally as investors sought alternative stores of value. This price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, indicating a potential divergence from its typical correlation with equity markets. Investors may be viewing Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability, contributing to its continued appeal and value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government's borrowing in April was higher than anticipated, reaching Â£20.2 billion, which is Â£1 billion more than the borrowing figure from April of the previous year. According to the Office for National Statistics, this borrowing figure represents the difference between government spending and tax income. Analysts had predicted a borrowing figure of Â£17.9 billion, making the actual amount higher than expected. This April's borrowing marks the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993, signaling potential challenges in the UK's fiscal management.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues during ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement implies that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is not a significant concern in trade talks, differing from President Trump's previous stance on Japan's trade deficit. Meanwhile, Japan has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy to reduce prices by 10 yen per liter, aiming to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The BOJ also indicated it would take a cautious approach on raising short-term interest rates.</p>

The study, published in Nature Communications Earth & Environment, highlights that the annual number of deaths ranged from 130 to 5,100, with states like Oregon and California experiencing the highest tolls. Researchers emphasized the growing frequency of wildfire smoke events and their significant impact on mortality and economic stability.</p>

The agreement also includes provisions to prevent future abuse and provide services to survivors, including a survivors' bill of rights.

The Russian economy is slowing, with high inflation and production costs, and sanctions are impacting revenue-generating exports like oil.

          <p>Martin Kettle argues that the UK is increasingly divided, with economic divisions so deep that the state struggles to manage them. Public confidence in the government is low, and the recent local elections signal further potential fragmentation. Keir Starmer's Council of the Nations and Regions is a test of whether British governance can address these issues through collaboration between the UK government, devolved governments, and mayors. The success of Starmer's agenda depends on cooperation with devolved bodies, but tensions and differing powers among attendees pose challenges to effective action.</p>

Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, emphasized the need for reforms to prevent emergency releases and address dangerous conditions in overcrowded prisons.

Despite claims of civil rights violations and disproportionate violence, there is no evidence to support these assertions, and white South Africans still hold a significant portion of the country's wealth. Trump's administration has offered refugee status to Afrikaners and has raised concerns about their treatment with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

          <p>The Senate is poised to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a controversial move challenged by Democrats as a "nuclear option." These waivers allow California to set stricter emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue the Congressional Review Act permits overturning agency rules, but Democrats contend the waivers aren't rules and the vote sets a dangerous precedent. California officials vow to sue if the waivers are revoked, potentially impacting 16 other states adopting California's standards.</p>
