          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm supplying major UK supermarkets like Tesco and Sainsbury's, has been targeted in a ransomware attack, disrupting order processing and potentially leading to food waste. The company confirmed the attack, stating that transport activities remained unaffected, but clients are experiencing issues with deliveries. Black Farmer founder Wilfred Emmanuel-Jones estimates thousands of his meat products are at risk of being discarded if the situation is not resolved quickly. This incident highlights the vulnerability of smaller logistics firms to cyber threats, following recent attacks on larger retailers like Marks & Spencer and Co-op.</p>

          <p>A new report by the Bonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC) argues that Germany's refugee policies are inadequate for addressing current global displacement issues. The report criticizes Chancellor Friedrich Merz's plans to tighten border controls and turn back migrants, asserting that such measures are ineffective and push migrants towards more dangerous routes facilitated by human traffickers. Researchers emphasize the need for multilateral refugee and migrant policies, urging Germany to take a leadership role in Europe and globally, rather than pursuing fragmented national responses. The report suggests improving living conditions and legal security in migrants' home countries as a more viable solution to reduce irregular migration.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is set to report its quarterly earnings, facing challenges such as high interest rates, a sluggish housing market, and potential cost pressures from increased tariffs. Despite spring being its peak sales season, fewer consumers are undertaking home purchases or major renovations due to higher borrowing costs. The company has been focusing on attracting more business from home professionals, acquiring SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion. Home Depot projects modest sales growth for fiscal 2025 but also anticipates a slight decline in adjusted earnings per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers are warning of increased solar activity, including solar flares and storms, as an active region of the Sun rotates into view. A recent X2.7 flare, the most powerful of 2025, caused radio blackouts in parts of the Middle East. NASA cautions that ongoing solar eruptions could impact radio communications, power grids, navigation signals, and spacecraft. The Met Office forecasts potential auroras, including Northern Lights over the UK and Ireland. The sunspot AR4087 is particularly active and could lead to supercharged auroras as it aligns with Earth.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, significant sea-level rise remains a threat due to the continued melting of ice sheets. Research indicates that past periods with similar warming levels resulted in sea levels several meters higher than present. Current observations show an increasing rate of melting in Greenland and West Antarctica, while computer models predict sea-level rise will not slow or stop even if warming stabilizes. The researchers emphasize that every fraction of a degree of warming avoided can greatly limit the risks to coastal populations, with an estimated 230 million people living within one meter of current high tide lines.</p>

          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, drawing parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis suggests that Biden's diagnosis presents an opportunity for him to demonstrate leadership on a human level, by openly sharing his experiences and emotions related to his illness. She argues that such candor could help restore trust with voters who may feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term. Davis emphasizes that personal revelations can transcend partisan politics and ideological debates, offering a chance for connection and understanding.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. This ruling lifts a hold placed by a California judge, enabling the administration to end protections and work permits for these migrants. Venezuelans were initially granted TPS in 2021 due to the humanitarian crisis in their home country. Lawyers representing TPS holders express shock at the Court's decision, highlighting the significant humanitarian and economic impact it will have.

          <p>Carlos Lozada reviews new books examining the Democratic Party's knowledge of Joe Biden's declining physical and mental state leading up to the 2024 election. Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's "Original Sin" portrays a party aware of Biden's weaknesses but choosing to accommodate and rationalize them, driven by a belief in the Biden mythology and fear of another Trump term. The book highlights instances of Biden's decline, including memory lapses and confusion, and criticizes top aides for downplaying concerns. The review also touches on Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes' "Fight," which suggests Biden's motives for staying in the race were self-serving, and examines the party's decision to coalesce around Kamala Harris as his replacement.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share more similarities than differences, particularly in their anti-establishment stances and conservative/populist ideologies. The article asserts that both men acted on their conservative ideas and were cherished by Republicans for it. It highlights Reagan's opposition to the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate the Departments of Education and Energy, drawing parallels to Trump's policies. The author contends that the Republican Party has embraced issues such as tax cuts, federalism, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance due to the influence of Reagan and Trump.</p>

          <p>China has reduced a key mortgage reference rate in an attempt to stabilize its struggling property market, which has been a significant drag on the economy. The five-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered by 10 basis points to 3.5 percent, following an earlier cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate. This move is part of Beijing's broader efforts to stimulate domestic demand and ensure economic stability, particularly amid heightened external risks. Analysts, however, believe that the moderate rate cut may not be sufficient to fully revive the property sector.</p>

The results showed that of the 25,000 website visitors, 600 ordered the imported showerhead, while none chose the 'Made in USA' option.

          <p>Despite President Trump's imposition of tariffs aimed at boosting U.S. manufacturing and raising revenue, collecting these tariffs has proven difficult due to smuggling and lack of resources. Higher tariffs have incentivized companies to evade the law through practices like transshipping, routing products through third countries to avoid duties. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) faces understaffing and is overwhelmed by the volume of imports, including low-value packages from Chinese e-commerce platforms.

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a primary roll thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been dormant for two decades, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft. The decision to reactivate the thruster was made due to concerns about the backup thrusters, which had been in use since 2004 and were showing signs of potential failure. The successful test of the primary thruster occurred just before a critical ground-based radio antenna, essential for communicating with Voyager 1, was taken offline for upgrades. This fix ensures that Voyager 1 can continue its decades-long journey and potentially celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza report living in constant fear and scarcity as Israel continues its offensive, with families facing constant bombardment and struggling to find food. Alaa Moein, a resident of Gaza City, described living in hell, fearing for his life and his children's safety, and struggling to find food. Farmer Naim Shafi'i and his family have been repeatedly displaced, now living in a tent after fleeing their home in northern Gaza. Despite Israel's announcement of allowing limited aid into Gaza, the amount is considered insufficient, and the situation remains dire for the 2.1 million people living in the territory.</p>

          <p>Helen Flinders, an art teacher, has been banned from teaching after engaging in a five-month sexual relationship with a student. The Teacher Regulation Agency (TRA) found that Flinders had seriously breached the teacher-pupil boundary and abused her position of trust. Flinders admitted to kissing the student after sports day and engaging in sexual activity at his parents' home. The relationship ended in December 2000, and Flinders later resigned from her position.
