          <p>Former Russian transport minister Roman Starovoyt was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound just hours after being dismissed by President Vladimir Putin. The Investigative Committee is treating the death as a suicide, which occurred in a Moscow suburb. The dismissal came amid chaos at Russian airports due to Ukrainian drone attacks and a separate fraud investigation into his successor as governor of the Kursk region. Starovoyt's abrupt sacking and subsequent death highlight the intense pressure and turmoil within Russia's political elite.</p>

The transition, which has been planned for years, follows a health incident Jakes experienced in 2024. He will continue his work as chairman of the T.D.

          <p>The UK government is proposing a new law to extend parental bereavement leave to include miscarriages that occur before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. The new measure would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, recognizing the emotional toll of early pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward in workplace rights and acknowledging parental grief.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates later this year, financial experts are advising savers on whether to lock in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate now. The consensus is that it can be a smart move to secure currently high rates, especially for those with specific savings goals and adequate liquid emergency funds. Experts note that shorter-term CDs are offering better yields than long-term ones and suggest strategies like CD laddering to balance returns and flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite largely forgoing traditional wide theatrical releases, Netflix consistently attracts Hollywood's most celebrated directors, including Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Rian Johnson. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering an irresistible combination of lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to an audience of over 300 million subscribers. This model has made Netflix a haven for ambitious or financially risky projects that traditional studios might be hesitant to fund, securing a steady stream of prestige content.</p>

The report suggests the U.S. has less than 20 years to change course before even aggressive measures may be insufficient to prevent default. (not investment advice)</p>
