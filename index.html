          <h2>Study Suggests Switching to Slower-Growing Chicken Breeds Could Prevent Suffering for Pennies</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper in the journal Nature Food argues that the extreme suffering of factory-farmed chickens can be significantly reduced at a minimal cost. Researchers found that modern chickens, bred for rapid growth, endure hundreds of hours of disabling or hurtful pain in their short lives. By switching to slower-growing breeds, a key tenet of the Better Chicken Commitment, producers could prevent an hour of intense pain for as little as half a cent. While this change may slightly increase production costs and environmental footprint, advocates argue the immense animal welfare benefits are substantial.</p>

          <p>In Long Beach, Minnesota, a town with a population of just over 300, a unique community space combines a tiny chapel and a vibrant public garden. The Morning Glory Gardens were established in the 1960s to beautify a swampy area by Lake Minnewaska and are now maintained by over 30 volunteers. A small, 16-seat chapel was later moved to the site, where it now hosts several weddings each year. The intertwined attractions serve as a peaceful retreat for residents and visitors, providing a place for reflection and community pride in the small town.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, which has lowered conventional mortgage rates, retirees considering reverse mortgages should understand key differences. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond Fed policy, including lender margins and investor appetite, making it crucial to shop around. The choice between a fixed or adjustable-rate product also impacts how borrowers are affected by rate changes. A significant benefit of lower rates is that they can increase the total amount of home equity a retiree is able to borrow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling carrier Spirit Airlines plans to slash its flight capacity by 25% starting in November to reduce costs and optimize its network around its strongest markets. In a memo to employees, CEO Dave Davis stated that the company is re-evaluating its fleet size and negotiating with vendors, warning that these changes will inevitably impact the size of its teams. The airline, which recently emerged from its second bankruptcy in a year, is also seeking $100 million in annual cost savings from its pilot union. This move follows the announcement that Spirit would halt service to 11 destinations.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, former President Donald Trump stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin has "really let me down" regarding efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Speaking at a joint press conference, Trump expressed that he had expected negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to be a straightforward process due to his relationship with Putin. He lamented the high number of casualties in the conflict, emphasizing his sense of obligation to see it settled. The comments came as the U.S. approved new weapons packages for Ukraine funded by NATO allies.</p>

          <p>At a news conference concluding his second state visit to the UK, former U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer could deploy the military to stop illegal migration across the English Channel. Trump stated he told the prime minister he would "stop it" regardless of the means used, arguing that such migration "destroys countries from within." The two leaders also announced a new technology partnership focused on artificial intelligence and discussed topics including the war in Ukraine and Palestinian statehood, on which they expressed disagreement.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified a body found in a severely decomposed state inside an abandoned Tesla as 15-year-old Celeste Rivas, who was reported missing over a year ago. The vehicle is registered to charting artist D4vd, who police say is cooperating with the homicide investigation. The cause of death has not yet been released, and it remains unclear how Rivas came to be in the car or what connection, if any, she had with the singer. Investigators are currently examining Rivas's movements and relationships in the time leading up to her death.</p>

          <h2>Discovery of Prehistoric Insects in South American Amber Offers New Insights</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:12:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in South America, scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and wasps, preserved in 112-million-year-old amber. Found in a sandstone quarry in Ecuador, the specimens date back to a time when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. This finding is significant because nearly all other amber deposits from this era have been found in the Northern Hemisphere. Researchers believe these "little windows into the past" will help them better understand the ancient ecosystems of the supercontinent Gondwana and the evolving relationship between plants and insects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis examining fighter pay in boxing and MMA reveals significant structural differences, challenging claims of parity from UFC CEO Dana White. While top-tier boxers earn purses that far exceed those of the highest-paid UFC stars, the UFC distributes its compensation more evenly, resulting in higher pay for its undercard and journeyman fighters. Data from athletic commissions and lawsuits shows that major boxing promoters allocate a much higher percentage of event revenue to fighters (around 60-70%) compared to the UFC's share (around 16-20%). This results in a system where boxing's biggest names earn vastly more, while the UFC provides a more stable, albeit lower-ceiling, career path.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has conducted further long-range drone attacks on two major Russian oil facilities, escalating its campaign against Russia's critical energy sector. One strike hit the Gazprom Naftohim Salavat facility, one of Russia's largest refineries, located approximately 800 miles from the front lines. Another attack targeted a refinery in the Volgograd region. These strikes are part of a broader strategy to disrupt Russia's economy and undermine its ability to fund its war efforts, reportedly causing fuel shortages and price increases within Russia.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging they use "illegal" tactics that harm consumers and artists. The suit claims the companies collude with ticket scalpers by allowing them to unlawfully purchase large quantities of tickets, which drives up prices on the secondary market. The FTC alleges Ticketmaster effectively "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers on both primary and secondary sales. The agency argues these practices have cost fans millions and frustrated artists' attempts to keep ticket prices affordable.</p>

          <p>A public dispute has broken out between the founders of a new UK left-wing party, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, over control and transparency. Sultana accused Corbyn's allies of creating a "sexist boys' club" and sidelining her from key decisions, including the launch of a membership portal. The conflict became public after Corbyn's team sent an email dismissing the membership drive as "unauthorised," while Sultana insisted it was legitimate. The infighting threatens to derail the new political project before it has officially been named, causing frustration among its potential supporters.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump celebrated ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show from the air, calling it "great news for America." The show's removal followed remarks by Kimmel arguing that the political right was exploiting the recent killing of activist Charlie Kirk. Trump, a frequent target of Kimmel's criticism, declared the host has "ZERO talent" and has previously expressed a desire to see his show canceled. The conflict highlights a long-standing animosity between the two public figures, with Kimmel often using his platform to critique the former president.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the wisdom of 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who faced intense public condemnation, or "cancellation," for his ideas yet maintained his equanimity. Spinoza argued against being a "prey to his emotions," proposing that rational understanding and consciousness provide power over feelings of fear and anger. His approach, now known as metacognition, involves observing one's emotions from a distance to regulate them. By pausing before reacting and understanding the source of emotional turmoil, individuals can avoid being controlled by primitive fears and respond to criticism with dignity and reason.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia has announced a landmark $5 billion investment in its competitor, Intel, signaling a major strategic partnership between the two tech giants. The collaboration will focus on co-developing chips for personal computers and the powerful data centers that form the backbone of artificial intelligence infrastructure. This move provides a significant lifeline to the struggling Intel, which has fallen behind in the AI boom, and follows a recent 10% stake taken by the U.S. government to bolster domestic manufacturing. The deal is seen as a pivotal moment for U.S. high-tech manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>
