          <p>A large rally in Tel Aviv saw Israelis express gratitude towards Donald Trump for his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release agreement, as the Monday deadline for Hamas to free 20 remaining living hostages approaches. Concurrently, Palestinian officials noted the return of approximately 500,000 displaced individuals to northern Gaza, despite widespread destruction. Egypt is set to host a crucial summit, with over 20 global leaders, including Trump, attending to finalize the broader peace deal, which also entails scaled-up humanitarian aid for the famine-stricken region. Hamas is also reportedly mobilizing forces to regain control in areas vacated by Israeli troops, highlighting ongoing complexities.</p>

          <p>Former NBA star Paul Pierce faced arrest on suspicion of misdemeanor driving under the influence after California Highway Patrol officers discovered him asleep behind the wheel of his Range Rover on the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles. The incident transpired after traffic lanes reopened following an earlier multi-car accident, with officers observing signs of impairment during their investigation. Pierce later clarified the situation on social media, explaining he had been stuck in prolonged standstill traffic for 45 minutes and simply fell asleep due to age and fatigue. The case will be presented to the LA County District Attorney's Office for review, marking a notable event for the Hall of Famer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented significant layoffs, affecting over 100 employees at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Agency (SAMHSA) and various departments within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as a government shutdown continues. SAMHSA, which manages the 988 suicide prevention hotline and distributes billions in mental health and addiction grants, reportedly lost around 125 staff members, leading to widespread concern among current and former employees. Critics argue these reductions, which also impacted CDC's disease surveillance and outbreak forecasting teams, could severely weaken the nation's public health infrastructure and capacity.</p>

          <h2>Steven Gerrard Declines Opportunity to Return as Rangers Manager</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steven Gerrard has reportedly declined the opportunity to return as manager of Rangers for a second term, with the timing of the move cited as the primary reason for his decision. Despite holding promising discussions with the Scottish Premiership club, the former Liverpool and England captain, who previously guided Rangers to a Scottish title in the 2020-21 season, ultimately withdrew from the selection process. This leaves the Rangers' new US-based ownership consortium still seeking a successor to Russell Martin, who was dismissed after only 17 matches, highlighting a period of significant managerial instability for the club.</p>

          <p>An unseasonably deep low-pressure system is expected to deliver widespread and beneficial rainfall to Southern California early next week, with the heaviest precipitation anticipated on Tuesday. The National Weather Service forecasts 0.5 to 1.5 inches of rain for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, potentially reaching up to 3 inches in mountainous and hilly regions. While this storm is significant for the time of year, meteorologists emphasize it will not be enough to conclude the wildfire season. Residents are advised to monitor forecasts for minor road flooding and a remote risk of flash floods or debris flows in burn scar areas.</p>

          <p>Israel's Rabin Medical Center is diligently preparing to receive the 20 expected living Israeli hostages from Gaza, pioneering a new field they call "captivity medicine." Head of nursing Dr. Michal Steinman explained that lessons from previous releases emphasize becoming "medical detectives" to understand the complex, delayed physical and psychological effects of prolonged captivity. The specialized sixth-floor unit offers private rooms designed with comfort in mind, including space for family members, and a "do not disturb" policy, prioritizing the hostages' need for space, time, and quiet over immediate medical task completion.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been granted a well-deserved retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire, following injuries sustained during a chaotic incident last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses that broke free and galloped through the streets of London after being spooked by construction noise, resulting in collisions with vehicles and injuries to several people and soldiers. While the event caused significant disruption and concern, Quaker's retirement ensures his long-term welfare after it was determined he could not return to active duties.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has announced the closure of all 21 of its museums, research centers, and the National Zoo, effective Sunday, as the ongoing government shutdown exhausts its reserve funds. Although animal care at the National Zoo will be maintained, public-facing services such as the beloved animal cams are deemed nonessential and will be suspended. This significant closure underscores the wide-ranging impact of the federal funding impasse on vital cultural institutions and public services, which largely depend on government funding to operate and provide free access.</p>
