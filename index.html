          <p>President Donald Trump announced the termination of all trade negotiations with Canada, citing a Canadian television ad that he claims fraudulently used Ronald Reagan's image to criticize U.S. tariffs. Trump asserted the ad was a deliberate attempt to interfere with U.S. court decisions regarding tariffs, calling it "egregious behavior." The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute also stated that the Ontario government's ad misrepresented and edited Reagan's 1987 remarks without permission. This abrupt decision further escalates trade tensions, impacting the significant daily cross-border trade and Canada's export strategy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is grappling with significant challenges in finding a suitable chair for the inquiry into child sexual abuse, as prominent candidates with extensive experience are declining the role. The inquiry faces a "mess" due to deep-seated distrust among victims, who have been repeatedly failed by state agencies over decades. Internal government discussions reveal a reluctant acceptance that a universally accepted candidate is likely impossible to find. The article also highlights a controversy surrounding Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips, with some victims calling for her replacement while others insist on her retention, underscoring the complex and sensitive nature of establishing trust and making progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, reportedly informed the Department of Justice that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff on mortgage fraud charges, according to MSNBC. This development comes after President Trump publicly called for Schiff's criminal prosecution. While a senior DOJ official is allegedly pushing to continue the investigation, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has denied MSNBC's report of a meeting with Hayes. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, asserted that career prosecutors found the politically-motivated allegations baseless, emphasizing the vindictive nature of the effort to silence the president's critic.</p>

          <p>Ireland is holding an election to choose its next president, a largely ceremonial role, with left-wing independent Catherine Connolly widely favored over Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. Connolly, known for her strong stance against Israel, leads in polls after a third candidate withdrew due to a financial scandal. Humphreys emphasizes a centrist, pro-business approach. The president appoints the prime minister and signs bills into law, and past incumbents have used the platform to express views on important issues. The outcome, expected by Saturday evening, will see the winner serve a seven-year term.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines grounded all flights nationwide due to an IT outage that significantly disrupted operations. The airline initially issued a temporary ground stop, later confirming the outage was ongoing and led to cancellations into the following day. While systems showed signs of coming back online, the exact number of impacted flights remained unclear. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the ground stop, which also affected Horizon Air, a subsidiary of Alaska Airlines. This incident highlights the critical reliance of modern air travel on robust technology infrastructure and the cascading effects of system failures on passenger travel plans.</p>
