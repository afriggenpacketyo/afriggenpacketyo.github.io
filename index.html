            <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States, China has appointed Li Chenggang as its new international trade representative, replacing Wang Shouwen, who was involved in the 2020 trade deal negotiations. This move comes as the trade war between the two largest economies intensifies, with both countries imposing significant tariffs on each other's goods. The appointment signals China's strategic adjustments in response to the evolving global economic landscape and its commitment to navigating the complexities of international trade relations. The implications of this change in leadership remain to be seen as both countries continue to engage in trade negotiations.</p>

            <p>Campaigners report that England's water pollution incidents have reached a ten-year high, with data showing a significant increase in serious spills by water companies. Surfers Against Sewage revealed that pollution incidents are almost double the Environment Agency's target, potentially harming wildlife and public health. Water UK claims companies plan to invest Â£12 billion to reduce spills by 2030, largely funded by increased water bills. The government has established an independent review to explore alternative regulatory approaches for the water industry due to growing public dissatisfaction.</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled that Ryan Routh, accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump, can hire an expert to examine the rifle recovered from the scene, but only to determine its operability. Routh's attorneys sought broader testing, but the judge limited the examination, setting a May 15 deadline. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, faces charges of attempted assassination and firearm offenses, with his trial scheduled for September. Prosecutors allege Routh plotted to kill Trump for weeks and even attempted to purchase an anti-aircraft weapon online.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. The JFTC found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. Google allegedly required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome as conditions for advertising revenue sharing. This action aligns with similar regulatory crackdowns on Google in the UK and the US, reflecting a global trend of increased scrutiny of tech giants' business practices.</p>

            <p>European companies are expressing concern that China's 'Made in China 2025' initiative, aimed at bolstering technological independence, could marginalize foreign firms. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China suggests that foreign companies may be excluded once Chinese companies achieve comparable technology. The chamber recommends China focus on opening up and attracting foreign investment with clear metrics and accountability practices. The initiative's progress could lead to a less globalized world, isolating China and potentially triggering external actions.</p>

            <p>Brown pelicans in Southern California are suffering from a toxic algae bloom, leading to a dual crisis of sick and starving birds. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin from the bloom, is poisoning adult pelicans, while baby pelicans are struggling due to the loss or disorientation of their parents. Wildlife rehabilitation centers are overwhelmed with both poisoned adults and malnourished chicks. Runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm may have contributed to the algae bloom's severity, while climate change may also be a factor.</p>
