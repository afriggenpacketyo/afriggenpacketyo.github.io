        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UEFA has delayed its ruling on whether Crystal Palace can compete in the Europa League, pending the outcome of a financial appeal by French club Lyon. Both clubs share a co-owner, John Textor, which violates UEFA's multi-club ownership rules for its competitions. Textor has agreed to sell his stake in Palace to resolve the issue. However, the decision is now tied to Lyon's appeal against a demotion to Ligue 2 for financial reasons, as their potential relegation would automatically resolve the conflict by removing them from the competition.</p>

          <p>A 32-year-old woman in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, has pleaded guilty to culpable and reckless conduct after permitting a girl under the age of 10 to drive a car. The incident, which occurred in the village of Crimond in poor weather, was filmed and later appeared on social media. The video showed the barefoot child operating the vehicle's controls, including wipers and indicators, while peering over the steering wheel. The woman could be heard cheering in the background, and the court has deferred her sentencing pending social work reports.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combination vaccine but plans to resubmit it with this new efficacy data. Moderna anticipates potential approvals for both products next year, positioning itself as a frontrunner in the market.</p>

          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that understanding a dog's experience of the world begins with its nose. In an interview, she details how smell is a dog's primary sense, shaping their perception of space and even time. Horowitz describes her own experiments, such as sniffing objects at a dog's height, to better grasp this olfactory reality. She suggests that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are rich sources of information, allowing them to perceive the lingering presence of people and events long after they are gone.</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another person was injured in what authorities are calling a deliberate ambush in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The incident occurred when firefighters responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain were met with gunfire. Following an extensive manhunt involving around 300 officers, the suspected gunman was found deceased on the mountain with a firearm nearby. Authorities are investigating whether the fire was intentionally set to lure first responders to the scene, a tactic that Sheriff Robert Norris described as a "total ambush."</p>

          <p>Amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, American security agencies have issued warnings about potential retaliatory attacks from Tehran-backed "sleeper cells" within the United States. This article examines the credibility of this threat, distinguishing between political rhetoric and expert analysis. While experts confirm that Iran and its proxies likely maintain small clandestine cells for intelligence and targeted operations, they suggest an attack on U.S. soil is a contingency for moments of existential desperation. Iran's recent actions suggest a desire to de-escalate, making a domestic attack unlikely despite the real, albeit often overstated, threat.</p>

          <p>Recent data suggests the global decline in birth rates is happening much faster than official United Nations projections, potentially bringing forward the start of global population decline by decades. Macroeconomist JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde highlights that the UN's models have consistently been too optimistic, pointing to plummeting fertility rates in Latin American and other middle-income countries. The UN model often assumes fertility rates will stabilize or rebound, but real-world data from countries like Colombia and Thailand show a continued, sharp decline. This accelerated trend could mean the world's population will begin to shrink as early as 2055.</p>

The defeat highlighted the team's ongoing struggles since Parker's departure after the 2020 season, a period during which the franchise has failed to make the playoffs. This article frames the loss as another instance of the "Candace Curse," contrasting the team's current 12-17 record with the success it enjoyed with Parker.

However, the court ruled that the issue was a matter of national security, as the components are part of a vital international defense collaboration.

          <p>China's top audit authority has reported that tens of billions of yuan from the country's 2024 stimulus package were misused or fraudulently claimed by local authorities. The National Audit Office found that nearly 20 billion yuan intended for equipment renewals and consumer goods trade-ins were misappropriated. Examples of misuse include a university obtaining funds for gym equipment under the guise of advanced technology and several provinces diverting over 15 billion yuan to cover basic public spending like civil-service wages instead of designated projects.</p>

The arrested woman, Pierina Uribarri, is reportedly the partner of the alleged gunman and faces charges of intentional homicide, criminal association, and terrorism. Arrest warrants have been issued for three other suspects in the case, which has drawn attention to the dangers faced by social media figures.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has called for reforms to the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA), warning that its structure can cause savers to lose money. The Treasury Committee report highlighted that early withdrawal penalties result in a 6.25% loss of the individual's own savings, not just the government bonus. The committee also described the product as complex, potentially unsuitable for retirement savings, and noted that its rules can nonsensically penalize claimants of certain benefits. A surge in unauthorized withdrawals suggests the product may not be functioning as intended for many users.</p>

          <p>Trade talks between the United States and Canada are set to resume after the Canadian government rescinded its planned Digital Services Tax, which was set to impact major U.S. technology firms. President Trump had suspended negotiations over the tax, calling it a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump, Canada announced it would drop the tax in anticipation of a new trade deal. The move is seen by some analysts as a victory for the White House and a sign of Canada's vulnerability to U.S. pressure.</p>

          <p>While Russia's recent promises of investment in Cuba have largely failed to materialize, China has quietly increased its role, becoming a critical partner for the crisis-stricken island nation. A Reuters review indicates that China is moving forward with key infrastructure projects, notably financing dozens of solar parks to help stabilize Cuba's collapsed electrical grid. In contrast, many announced Russian projects, such as revitalizing a major steel mill, have stalled. This shift highlights China's growing influence through its Belt and Road Initiative as Cuba's economy continues to struggle with severe shortages and U.S. sanctions.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Robert Reich argues that Palantir Technologies, a data-analytics firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, poses a significant threat to American democracy. The piece highlights Palantir's contract to create a super-database for the Trump administration, combining personal data from numerous federal agencies. Reich expresses concern that this tool could be used to surveil and punish critics, likening the company to the deceptive seeing stones from "The Lord of the Rings."

          <p>The popular wellness trend of aiming for high daily step counts, often exceeding 10,000 or 20,000 steps, is being criticized for turning a simple activity into a source of anxiety and compulsion. While walking is a beneficial, low-impact exercise, the cultural fixation on quantifying every step can lead to obsessive behavior and diminish the enjoyment of the activity. Experts note that the health benefits of walking often plateau around 7,000 to 8,000 steps. The pressure to constantly track and meet high targets, fueled by social media and wearable technology, can transform a healthy habit into an unhealthy obsession with productivity and perfectionism.</p>

          <h2>France Implements Outdoor Smoking Ban in Public Areas Frequented by Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 05:46:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law banning smoking in many public outdoor spaces, including parks, beaches, and near schools, as part of an effort to create a "tobacco-free generation." The ban, which took effect Sunday, is aimed at protecting children from exposure to smoke and the influence of smokers. Violators of the new restrictions can face fines starting at around $150. While the move is supported by a majority of the French public, some smokers feel the law is excessive for outdoor spaces, though it does not currently apply to e-cigarettes or outdoor cafÃ© seating.</p>

          <p>A recent wave of intense Israeli air raids has targeted several densely populated neighborhoods in Gaza City, forcing hundreds of Palestinian families to flee their homes. The bombardment, which followed one of the largest evacuation orders since March, reportedly struck areas including a school sheltering displaced people. Local reports indicate at least five people were killed in the strikes. The attacks come amid growing international and domestic pressure on Israel's prime minister to prioritize a ceasefire agreement, as the humanitarian crisis in the region deepens.</p>
