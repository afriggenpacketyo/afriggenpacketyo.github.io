          <p>A significant Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of at least 21 people, including four children, and left dozens more wounded. The bombardment destroyed a five-story residential building and caused damage to the nearby European Union delegation office, sparking outrage from EU leaders. This assault, the deadliest on the Ukrainian capital since July, occurred amid renewed diplomatic peace efforts, drawing strong condemnation from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the strikes as Moscow's response to calls for diplomacy and reiterated the need for stronger sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>A new Texas state law, set to take effect on September 1st, restricts individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from purchasing or renting property. While state officials, including Governor Greg Abbott, defend the bill as a crucial measure for national security, opponents argue it is discriminatory and anti-immigrant. The law has sparked legal challenges and concern within the Chinese-American community, with some drawing parallels to historical exclusion acts. Business leaders and real estate agents also worry about the potential negative economic impact on foreign investment and local businesses in Texas.</p>

The company announced earnings per share of 20 cents against an estimated 11 cents, with revenue reaching $876 million, exceeding the projected $837 million. This performance marks a significant milestone as Affirm achieved operating income profitability, a goal it had committed to a year prior. Despite facing increased competition, particularly from Klarna's recent partnership with Walmart, the company provided a positive outlook for the upcoming quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has fired two employees who were involved in a protest that included breaking into the office of company President Brad Smith. The demonstration was organized by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid,' which opposes the Israeli military's alleged use of Microsoft's cloud services in its Gaza operations. The protesters demanded that Microsoft cease all support for Israel, and Smith later claimed they planted listening devices and blocked access to the office before being removed by police. The company stated the terminations were due to serious breaches of policy and unlawful actions, and noted it is cooperating with law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has proposed a new model for compensating college football players, suggesting they be paid directly for participating in the College Football Playoff. Sanders argues that instead of conferences receiving millions for their teams' appearances, the money should go to the athletes, with additional payments for advancing in the tournament. This idea was discussed in an interview alongside former coach Nick Saban, who also expressed concerns about the current state of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. Sanders believes his proposal would create more equality, mirroring the NFL's system of playoff bonuses for players.</p>

          <p>A woman arrested for spitting on a police officer at the National Zoo was mistakenly detained in a D.C. jail for a week due to a series of errors by federal and local authorities. Despite the Justice Department not seeking pretrial detention, Kristal Rios Esquivel remained incarcerated because of an incorrect 'hit' in the warrant system that was not cleared after her court appearance. A federal judge described the incident as "false imprisonment" and criticized the systemic failures that led to her prolonged and unlawful detention. The case has drawn scrutiny amid the ongoing federal takeover of the District of Columbia's justice system.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, the relationship between China and Japan remains a complex paradox of deep-seated historical resentment and strong contemporary ties. This dynamic is highlighted by the recent box office success in China of a film depicting Japanese wartime atrocities, which has reignited painful memories. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan is surging, making China the top source of inbound visitors. This love-hate relationship is shaped by a mixture of historical trauma from the Sino-Japanese war, ongoing geopolitical tensions, economic interdependence, and a surprising degree of shared cultural affinity between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to launch large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially starting as early as September 5th. According to sources within the Department of Homeland Security, the raids are expected to employ tactics similar to those used in Los Angeles, which involved armored vehicles and tactical gear. This planned action is separate from President Trump's recent push to deploy the National Guard to combat city crime, an idea that has been forcefully rejected by both Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

The piece highlights Trump's statement, "I have the right to do anything I want to do," and compares it to the fictional villain's own sense of omnipotence and narcissistic rage. The author argues that both figures are surrounded by sycophants and seem to believe they are unrestrainable. However, the article concludes that unlike the super-powered Homelander, Trump is a mortal politician who can be constrained by the Constitution, the courts, and ultimately, the voters.</p>

          <p>The recent leadership upheaval at the CDC, including the firing of its director and the resignation of four top officials, is rooted in a deep-seated conflict over vaccine policy and the role of science in public health. The turmoil is largely driven by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, who has overhauled key advisory panels and pushed for changes to immunization schedules. Departing officials have voiced concerns that the agency's scientific integrity is being undermined by political agendas, potentially eroding public trust and weakening the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks.</p>

The advice includes tackling demanding tasks during 'high energy' morning hours and saving rote activities for later in the day. Building 'micro routines,' such as doodling or listening to music, can also provide moments of relief without leaving one's desk. A key recommendation is the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say 'no' when necessary, emphasizing that self-care is crucial for being effective and helpful to others in the long run.</p>
