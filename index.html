        <h2>Unexpected UK Economic Contraction in January</h2>
        <div class="timestamp">2025-03-14 06:26:35 EDT</div>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>The UK economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in January, driven by a decline in manufacturing.  This weaker-than-forecast result impacts the government's growth priorities and upcoming Spring Statement.  Economists had predicted 0.1% growth, contrasting with December's 0.4% increase. While three-month growth shows a 0.2% increase, concerns remain about sluggish growth due to tax rises and business challenges.</p>

        <p>Senate Democrats are likely to avoid a government shutdown by voting for a six-month spending bill, despite opposition from some within the party.  President Trump will visit the Department of Justice to outline his vision for the department, a move that breaks with historical precedent of presidential distance from the DOJ.  Federal judges have ordered the reinstatement of thousands of recently fired federal workers.</p>

      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>Vladimir Putin stated Russia's readiness for a ceasefire, but his conditions—including halting Western arms supplies to Ukraine and the demilitarization of Ukraine—are seen as unacceptable to Ukraine and its allies.  Putin's stance is interpreted as negotiating from a position of strength, given recent Russian advances in some areas of the conflict.</p>
