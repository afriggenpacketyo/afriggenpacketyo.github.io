          <p>President Donald Trump deflected questions regarding his past association with Jeffrey Epstein, urging the focus to shift to others like Bill Clinton. When asked about a potential pardon for convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump said he had not thought about it, though he acknowledged he has the authority to do so. His comments come as Maxwell is engaged in multi-day meetings with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and pressure mounts on the administration to release investigative files related to Epstein.</p>

          <p>The United States and Israel have pulled their negotiating teams from Gaza ceasefire talks in Qatar, with President Donald Trump stating that Hamas "didn't really want to make a deal." A US envoy cited Hamas's response to the latest proposal as showing a "lack of desire," while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that the group is the primary obstacle. Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsens, with the UN warning of mass starvation and the local health ministry reporting more deaths from malnutrition.</p>

          <p>A lawyer for Ghislaine Maxwell described her first day of meetings with U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche as "very productive," stating she answered every question posed to her. The interview, taking place in Tallahassee where Maxwell is imprisoned, is part of a renewed focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case amid public pressure for the release of related files. The meeting has drawn criticism, with some Democrats citing a conflict of interest as Blanche is a former personal lawyer for President Trump.</p>

          <p>Major Premier League clubs are dominating summer transfer spending, with Liverpool leading the way at £269 million and Chelsea following with over £212 million. This spending spree, which also includes significant outlays by Arsenal, Manchester United, and Tottenham, contrasts with the previous season and is fueled by increased revenues from TV deals, prize money, and ticket sales. Despite the massive figures, financial experts note that when adjusted for football inflation, the spending is not unprecedented and remains within profit and sustainability rules.

          <p>As Ghislaine Maxwell continues her meetings with the Deputy Attorney General, a legal expert suggests three potential outcomes could be in play for the convicted sex trafficker. Professor Jonathan Turley noted that Maxwell could be seeking a sentence reduction from the DOJ for cooperation, or she could be hoping for a presidential commutation from Donald Trump. The third possibility relates to her ongoing Supreme Court appeal, which argues her conviction was invalid due to a prior non-prosecution agreement Epstein secured with federal prosecutors.</p>

          <p>The fine art market is showing signs of a potential structural shift as auction sales at major houses like Sotheby's and Christie's fell by 6% in the first half of the year. This decline marks the third consecutive year of falling sales, a trend that diverges from the booming stock market and record-high wealth among the affluent. Experts suggest this could be a temporary dip or a more fundamental change, possibly driven by a generational wealth transfer where younger, digital-native collectors have different tastes than the baby boomers who previously dominated the market.

One method is to invest in an annuity, which can provide a guaranteed income stream for a set period before you start collecting Social Security. Another option for homeowners is a reverse mortgage, which allows borrowing against home equity, while a third strategy involves maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs.

          <p>A provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student loan forgiveness federally tax-free is set to expire at the end of 2025, and it was not extended in a recent bill. Without new legislation, borrowers who have their debts canceled under income-driven repayment plans could face significant tax bills, as forgiven debt is typically treated as taxable income. For an average borrower with a $57,000 balance, this could result in a federal tax liability of over $12,000, a situation consumer advocates call cruel. (not investment advice)</p>

The ongoing revelations have intensified anger over the administration's failure to release the full Epstein investigative files, and Trump has responded by suing The Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the matter.</p>
