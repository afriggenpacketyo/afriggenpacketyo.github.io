          <h2>Bank of Japan to Slow Bond Purchase Cuts Amid Growth Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 00:43:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it would reduce the pace of government bond purchase cuts starting in April of next year, while maintaining the benchmark interest rate at 0.5%. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, as the central bank aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets to support stability. The BOJ will decrease its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by approximately 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, followed by a slower reduction of 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027. Japan's economy faces growth uncertainty, with inflation running above the BOJ's target for about three years, prompting the bank to monitor underlying inflation closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel launched an attack on Iranian state television and warned residents in central Tehran to evacuate, following a missile strike by Iran that resulted in civilian casualties. The warning affected approximately 330,000 people, including areas around state TV, police headquarters, and hospitals. An explosion disrupted a live broadcast on the Islamic Republic of Iran News Network, with reports of casualties among reporters, and Israel's defense minister claimed responsibility for the attack on the television studio.

          <p>Gold has emerged as the premier safe haven asset, with spot prices increasing by 30% in 2025, outperforming traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions have fueled demand for gold, while confidence in U.S. assets has been compromised by volatile policymaking. Gold's value is unaffected by high debt-to-GDP ratios impacting other currencies, making it a large, liquid, and apolitical market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tuesday's newspaper headlines are dominated by a report on grooming gangs, with many papers highlighting failures by authorities to protect victims and a "conspiracy of silence over race." The report reveals that authorities shied away from addressing the ethnicity of perpetrators for fear of raising tensions, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has apologized to victims. Several newspapers also lead with the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, focusing on Israeli strikes and evacuation orders in Tehran. Additionally, some papers feature stories on a potential hosepipe ban in Yorkshire due to drought conditions.</p>

This deal is expected to prevent significant job losses in the UK, particularly in the West Midlands, where Jaguar Land Rover's plant is located. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminium, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities in proving the steel's origin. The deal also includes reciprocal access for 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, ensuring no changes to the UK's food safety standards.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer is set to announce new sanctions against Russia at the G7 summit, aimed at increasing economic pressure on the Kremlin. The sanctions are designed to restrict Russia's war machine and squeeze its energy revenues, reducing funds available for its illegal war in Ukraine. While other Ukraine allies are expected to join the move, the US may not participate due to President Trump's opposition to further measures. The new sanctions package will aim to keep up pressure on the Russian military industrial complex.</p>

          <h2>Homelessness Among Older Americans on the Rise, Raising Health Concerns</h2>

          <p>The number of Americans aged 55 and older experiencing homelessness is growing, with projections estimating a near tripling by 2030. More than 140,000 older Americans are homeless on any given day, often due to factors such as the death of a spouse, job loss, or mounting medical issues. This trend is causing concern among health workers, as older homeless individuals often have complex chronic conditions and lack access to necessary care. The rise in homelessness among older adults is also impacting healthcare systems, with increased hospitalizations and challenges in providing adequate support.</p>

          <h2>Survey Indicates Growing Awareness of Nicotine Pouches Among Children</h2>

          <p>New data suggests that awareness of nicotine pouches among young people under the age of 18 is increasing. A survey commissioned by Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) found that 43% of 11-17 year olds knew of the pouches in 2025, up from 38% in 2024, with nearly 4% having tried them. Ash is urging the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which will ban the marketing and sale of nicotine pouches to under 18s. The survey also indicates an increase in pouch usage among adults aged 18-34, with men under 40 being more likely to use them than women of the same age.</p>
