The El Dorado County Sheriff's Office released the names and ages of the victims, who hailed from various locations in California and New York. Coop Cooper, a marina manager with Coast Guard experience, emphasized the importance of preparedness when boating, including having a radio, wearing life vests, and taking a boating course to anticipate weather changes, noting the sudden shift in conditions on the lake.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index reveals that national home prices rose by only 2.7% in April compared to the previous year, marking the smallest gain in nearly two years. This deceleration is attributed to rising housing supply and slowing demand, with some previously hot markets like Tampa and Dallas experiencing price declines. Higher mortgage rates are pricing out potential buyers, particularly first-timers, contributing to the weakening market. While prices are weakening, they are not at risk of major declines due to constrained housing supply, as existing homeowners are reluctant to surrender their sub-4% pandemic-era rates, and new construction is failing to meet demand.

          <p>Chris Schwegmann, at the law firm Lynn Pinker Hurst & Schwegmann, is using AI creatively by asking it to adopt the personas of figures like Chief Justice John Roberts or Sherlock Holmes to analyze legal briefs.

Despite the relatively low adoption rate, 98% of those using AI report that it has not impacted their firms' employment numbers.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear targets were within his constitutional powers and questioned the validity of the War Powers Act. Johnson stated that many constitutional scholars believe the Nixon-era law, which limits the president's power to unilaterally wage war, violates Article II of the Constitution. He vowed that a pending resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran under that law would not pass the House. Johnson also mentioned that Rep. Massie's resolution might be a "moot point" given the announced ceasefire, potentially averting a vote on the matter.

          <p>A new national poll indicates that more Americans oppose than support the U.S. military strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, but there is a significant partisan divide. The Reuters/Ipsos survey reveals that most Republicans support President Trump's decision, while the majority of Democrats oppose it. The poll also suggests that a majority believe the airstrikes will not make America safer, and a large percentage worry that Iran may target U.S. civilians in response. These results reflect the deep political divisions surrounding U.S. foreign policy. The score reflects the uncertainty and potential risks associated with the military action.</p>

He said policymakers are "well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance." These cautious tones could further antagonize President Trump, who has ramped up his criticism of Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
