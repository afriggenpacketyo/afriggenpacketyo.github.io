            <p>The Liberty Crest Apartments, formerly the Lorton Reformatory, a prison from 1910 to 2001, has been renovated into 165 apartments. The prison, known for housing suffragists, was purchased by Fairfax County and transformed into a mixed-use property featuring a park, golf course, schools, and an arts center. The Alexander Company converted the prison into apartments, preserving historical elements like signs and the original grandstand built by prisoners. Rent ranges from $1,372 to $2,700 per month, and the complex includes amenities like a yoga studio, gym, and community pool.</p>

            <p>Following Pope Francis's death, the Cardinal Camerlengo formally pronounced him dead, initiating the traditional Novemdiales, a nine-day mourning period. During this time, cardinals will gather in Rome for General Congregations to discuss the future direction of the Church. A papal funeral will take place within four to six days of the death, after which the Cardinal Electors will convene in a conclave, isolating themselves in the Sistine Chapel to elect the next pope. The process involves repeated balloting until a candidate secures a two-thirds-plus-one majority, signaled by white smoke.</p>

            <p>According to one Fox News opinion piece, Democrats are attempting to find new figures to rally support against President Trump's agenda. The author identifies Luigi Mangione, Karmelo Anthony, and Kilmar Abrego Garcia as potential figures being promoted by the left. The piece draws parallels to the case of George Floyd, suggesting Democrats are seeking to mobilize protests and create division for political gain. The author argues that these individuals are not suitable as martyr figures and that the public may not respond in the same way as in 2020.</p>

            <p>New research has revealed alarming levels of toxic chemicals in children’s mattresses, including phthalates, flame retardants, and UV filters. These chemicals, which can off-gas into the air and be inhaled or absorbed, are linked to serious health issues. Researchers found concerning levels in 16 common mattress brands, with one mattress containing 3% flame retardant by weight. Experts recommend seeking mattresses without flame retardants or made of natural materials, and manufacturers are urged to eliminate toxic chemicals.</p>

By substituting domestic technology for foreign parts, China hopes to catch up with Elon Musk’s Starlink. The trade restrictions could affect up to 30 percent of the US-sourced specialized satellite components. The senior executive from a leading Chinese commercial satellite company said these parts can all be manufactured domestically, but the main challenge is that domestic production comes at a higher cost.</p>
