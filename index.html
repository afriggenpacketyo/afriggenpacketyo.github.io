          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock surged after the company announced better-than-expected second-quarter financial results. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 million and a significantly narrowed net loss of $4.7 million, compared to $32.8 million in the previous year. CEO Adam Aron credited the performance to a recovering box office, increased attendance, and successful debt restructuring. The company also saw record-high revenue per patron, driven by growth in premium offerings, indicating a positive trajectory for the theater industry post-pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares for enterprise AI firm C3 AI dropped 30% after it released preliminary first-quarter financial results and announced a restructuring of its sales organization. The company projected revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million, a significant decrease from the previous year's $87.2 million. CEO Thomas Siebel called the sales performance "completely unacceptable," attributing it to the reorganization's disruptive effects and his own health issues, which have prompted a search for his successor. The company also anticipates a much wider operating loss compared to the same period last year.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high rates and low inventory, current mortgage rates remain elevated, though well-qualified buyers can still secure favorable terms. As of early August, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.75%, with 15-year loans near 5.99%, while refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers. To secure the best rates, financial advisors recommend strengthening credit profiles, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders to minimize long-term costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Money psychology expert Morgan Housel argues that many investors, particularly those with high intelligence, mistakenly complicate their strategies, which often leads to poorer results. Instead, he advocates for a simple and consistent approach, such as periodically investing in low-cost index funds that track market averages like the S&P 500. This view is supported by historical data and echoed by Warren Buffett, who has long recommended passive investing for the average person. The core principle is that achieving average returns over a long period is more effective and less risky than attempting to outperform the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a ceremony to unveil his statue at Gillette Stadium, former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady took a playful jab at New York Jets fans. Brady, who won six Super Bowls with the Patriots, remarked that the statue would give Jets fans "something to throw their beers at" as they leave the stadium early in games. The comment references his dominant career record against the Jets, whom he defeated 30 times while throwing 60 touchdown passes. The ceremony celebrated his legacy with the team before his eventual induction into the Hall of Fame.</p>

          <p>Dame Stephanie 'Steve' Shirley, a visionary technology entrepreneur and philanthropist, has passed away at the age of 91. Arriving in Britain as a child refugee before World War Two, she went on to break barriers for women in the tech industry. In 1962, she founded a software company that almost exclusively employed women with children, offering them flexible, remote work. After building a fortune, she became a dedicated philanthropist, donating nearly £70 million to causes related to autism and IT projects, leaving an inspirational legacy of innovation and social change.</p>

The administration has already deployed around 450 federal officers to the city, with Trump vowing to make the capital safer and remove homeless encampments. This move comes despite D.C. police data showing a 26% decrease in violent crime this year. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has pushed back against the president's characterization of the city as dangerous, stating that crime is declining and that she works cooperatively with federal law enforcement.</p>

Key factors influencing its price include supply and demand, global economic health, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability.

For those with a defined savings timeline, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer fixed rates, with some reaching 4.5%.

          <p>Bournemouth's Ukrainian defender, Illia Zabarnyi, is set for a £57.1 million transfer to European champions Paris St-Germain, pending a medical. The 22-year-old has reportedly agreed to a five-year contract with the French club. This move marks the third major defensive sale for Bournemouth this transfer window, following the departures of Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez, generating significant profit for the Premier League club. To fill the gap, Bournemouth has already agreed to a deal to sign Bafode Diakite from Lille for an initial fee of £30 million.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration deprioritizing investigations into right-wing extremism, some far-right groups are reportedly expressing anger towards the president. Issues such as his strong support for Israel and a potential war with Iran have stirred rage among neo-Nazi and white supremacist factions online. Experts note the irony, as these groups have benefited from policy changes that have reduced FBI scrutiny, allowing them to organize more freely. While some extremists view Trump as an enemy, others have celebrated his hardline immigration policies and pardons for January 6 participants, highlighting a complex relationship.</p>

          <p>An Ohio law requiring public school districts to provide transportation for private and charter school students is forcing some public high schoolers to find their own way to school. In Dayton, about 2,000 public school students will not have bus service due to a shortage of drivers and buses, as the district must prioritize non-public students to avoid millions in fines. This situation, a result of a broader conservative push for private school vouchers, has left many low-income families scrambling for solutions. A recent law also banned the district from providing public transit passes, a previous workaround.</p>

In its recent filing, Claire's cited the shift away from brick-and-mortar retail and macroeconomic challenges like higher interest rates and labor costs as insurmountable obstacles.

          <p>In a review of Osita Nwanevu's book "The Right of the People," the author argues that simply calling for more democracy is insufficient to address America's political ills. While agreeing with many of Nwanevu's progressive proposals—like ending the filibuster and taxing wealth—the article criticizes the book for not adequately addressing the rise of right-wing populism or the reasons working-class voters are drawn to it. The piece contends that a true democratic renewal requires more than a policy wish list; it demands understanding and engaging with the political culture and mindset of all citizens, not just assuming they align with a progressive worldview.</p>

          <p>Air India has announced it will suspend its direct flight service between New Delhi and Washington, D.C., starting September 1. The airline attributed the decision to an aircraft shortage caused by a planned $400 million upgrade program for its aging fleet. Additionally, the continued closure of Pakistani airspace has complicated long-haul routes, increasing operational complexity and costs. This suspension is another setback for the carrier, which is already under heightened regulatory scrutiny. Passengers will be offered alternative routes with layovers through Air India's interline partners.</p>

The decision comes as hospital records indicate nearly 2,000 dog bites occur daily in the capital, where rabies remains a significant public health threat.

The policy allows the government to deport foreign nationals who have committed crimes in the UK before their appeals are heard, with offenders participating in hearings via video link from their home countries. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the expansion aims to prevent criminals from exploiting the immigration system and to fast-track their removal, which ministers also argue will help ease prison overcrowding.</p>
