        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article reports that a new analysis reveals red meat studies with industry funding are significantly more likely to report favorable cardiovascular results compared to independently funded studies, which consistently show worsened or neutral outcomes. This discrepancy stems from industry-funded studies often comparing red meat to less healthy options rather than a broader range of diets. Experts worry that such biased research, exacerbated by potential cuts to federal funding for nutrition research, could mislead consumers and undermine public health. The article highlights the importance of independent research to ensure unbiased nutritional guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite exceeding earnings and revenue forecasts for its fiscal third quarter, Palo Alto Networks' stock experienced a decline in after-hours trading.

CEO Nikesh Arora emphasized the company's platformization strategy, aiming to consolidate customer spending on Palo Alto's suite of products.

          <p>The UK has intensified its response to Israel's military actions in Gaza, citing a growing humanitarian crisis and a lack of progress toward a ceasefire. Measures include suspending trade deal talks, summoning the Israeli ambassador, and imposing sanctions on West Bank settlers accused of human rights abuses. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the Israeli government's actions as "morally unjustifiable" and accused them of isolating Israel from its allies. The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza and mounting pressure from MPs and international bodies. The UK government expressed its unwavering support for Israel's right to self-defense, but has taken issue with the egregious and disproportionate actions taken by the Netanyahu government.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has stated he will leave his position as manager of Manchester City if the club continues to maintain a large squad. Guardiola expressed frustration with leaving several senior players out of matchday squads, emphasizing his desire to work with a smaller, more manageable team. He believes that a large squad is unsustainable and detrimental to team cohesion. This comes amid speculation of player exits in the summer transfer window, with Guardiola's contract running until 2027.</p>
