          <p>BBC reporter Nada Tawfik recounts her experience interviewing Prince Harry in California, noting the unusual setting and the Duke's down-to-earth demeanor. Despite the recent unfavorable court judgment regarding his security, Prince Harry was eager to share his feelings and address criticisms. Tawfik found him to be softly spoken and willing to engage with difficult questions about taxpayer-funded security and his family's safety in the UK, all while remaining aware of the intense scrutiny he faces. The article emphasizes the importance of providing Prince Harry space to express his perspective, regardless of public opinion. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the initial impact of Donald Trump's economic policies, noting a chaotic start marked by a contraction in GDP during the first quarter. The piece highlights Trump's attempts to deflect blame onto his predecessor while taking credit for positive job reports. It points out that Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty surrounding them have negatively affected consumer spending and business investment. The article suggests that the 'strategic uncertainty' employed by Trump in trade negotiations creates instability for businesses and consumers, potentially leading to a 'Trumpcession'.

          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using antibodies from a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from various deadly snakes. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. The research team identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins, creating a cocktail that protected mice from 13 of 19 deadly elapid snake species. Optimism score: 80</p>

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods from China is expected to significantly impact online retailers like Temu and Shein, which relied heavily on digital advertising. These companies have already begun to reduce their advertising spending on platforms like Meta and Google. The change is projected to decrease revenue for these tech giants, as Chinese advertisers, previously one of their fastest-growing segments, cut back on spending in anticipation of the tariffs. This shift may lead to a decline in app downloads and overall online advertising revenue. Optimism score: 50</p>
