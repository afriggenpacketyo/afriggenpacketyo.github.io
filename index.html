        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France, the United Kingdom, and Canada have issued strong condemnations of Israel's military actions in Gaza, demanding an end to the offensive due to the intolerable level of human suffering. The leaders from these countries are calling for a ceasefire and the release of hostages, emphasizing that Israel's response has been disproportionate. Prime Minister Netanyahu has dismissed these arguments, stating that the war will only end when Hamas returns hostages, disarms, and its leaders go into exile. The international pressure comes amid warnings of imminent famine in Gaza, with the EU also criticizing the systematic violation of international law in the region.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to revoke temporary protected status for nearly 350,000 Venezuelans, reversing a lower court's block. This move permits the deportation of Venezuelans who had been shielded due to unsafe conditions in their home country. While the court did not provide a rationale, activists and attorneys for the migrants expressed shock, calling it the largest single action stripping immigration status in modern US history. Homeland Security hailed the decision as a win for American safety, while critics decried it as a xenophobic attack against a community fleeing a criminal dictatorship.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is underway in New Orleans after ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Parish jail, prompting increased scrutiny of the long-troubled facility. The escapees, facing charges including murder and armed robbery, left behind a taunting message. The jail has been under a federal consent decree since 2013 due to issues such as overcrowding and understaffing. Louisiana's Governor Jeff Landry has demanded answers, citing broader failings in the criminal justice system and criticizing the mismanagement of cases. The escape has also drawn attention to the lengthy periods some inmates spend in jail awaiting trial or sentencing.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Japan, has been arrested for allegedly driving against traffic on the Shin-Meishin Expressway, causing collisions with multiple vehicles.

The man reportedly drove in the wrong direction for approximately 10 kilometers before reaching a roadside parking area, and police suspect he may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway.</p>

          <p>The People’s Bank of China has reduced its benchmark lending rates to historic lows in an effort to cushion the economy from the impact of US tariffs.

This surge reflects investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the expanding electric vehicle market.

The company is expanding into Europe to meet the growing demand from automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen.

          <p>The Trump administration is growing frustrated with the lack of progress in peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, threatening to disengage from the conflict. However, the article argues that the war in Ukraine is not just a European issue but directly impacts American interests. Putin's ambitions extend beyond Ukraine, aiming to reshape the European order and diminish American influence. Abandoning Ukraine would embolden Russia, destabilize Europe, and create new challenges for the United States, making it more costly to resist Russian aggression in the long run.</p>

          <p>The United States has initiated a voluntary deportation program, sending 68 migrants from Honduras and Colombia back to their home countries. The program offers returning migrants financial assistance and the possibility of applying for legal entry into the U.S. in the future. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that those who do not participate in the voluntary program will face fines, arrest, and deportation. The Honduran government is also providing support to returning migrants. Some migrants reported that they had been thinking about returning to their home countries already, and the process was easy.</p>
