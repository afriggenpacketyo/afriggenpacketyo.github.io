McConnell, who is not seeking an eighth term, has occasionally challenged Trump since stepping down as party leader.

During a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Trump stated his confidence in reaching fair deals, emphasizing that there was no immediate rush. However, a senior administration official noted the significant trade deficit between the U.S. and EU members, including Italy, highlighting Trump's desire to level the playing field.

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Google has an illegal monopoly in online advertising technology, marking the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year. The US Department of Justice, along with 17 US states, sued Google, arguing the tech giant was illegally dominating the technology which determines which adverts should be placed online and where. Google said it would appeal the decision. Judge Leonie Brinkema stated that Google had "wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts" which enabled it to "acquire and maintain monopoly power" in the market. Optimism Score: 60</p>

            <p>President Trump's policies have become a central issue in Canada's prime minister election debate between Prime Minister Mark Carney and conservative challenger Pierre Poilievre. Carney argued that Trump poses the greatest challenge to Canada, while Poilievre faces criticism for a message seen as too similar to Trump's 'America First' agenda. Concerns over a potential trade war with the U.S. and Trump's threats to annex Canada have bolstered support for the Liberal Party under Carney. Voters concerned with the economy and relations with the U.S. tend to favor Carney, while those focused on cost-of-living concerns back Poilievre. Optimism Score: 55</p>

            <p>President Trump has sharply criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, urging the central bank to lower interest rates and stating that Powell's 'termination cannot come soon enough.' These remarks followed Powell's concerns about Trump's tariff policy potentially hiking inflation and slowing economic growth. Trump's criticism echoes previous instances where he challenged the Fed's political independence, despite the central bank's established autonomy.

            <p>Claire Baglin’s debut novel, On the Clock, translated into English by Jordan Stump, gives a new level of detail to the realities of blue-collar labor. The story follows a nameless university student from a working-class background as she spends her summer break working at a fast-food restaurant. The narrator’s critique focuses on how the restaurant pits her colleagues against one another. By imparting specificity, and therefore dignity, onto working-class concerns, Baglin makes them impossible to ignore. Optimism Score: 65</p>

            <p>Elon Musk’s SpaceX, partnering with Palantir and Anduril, is a leading contender to build key components of Donald Trump’s 'Golden Dome' missile defense shield. The plan involves launching hundreds of satellites for missile detection and tracking, with a separate fleet for interception. SpaceX has proposed a subscription-based model for the government's access to the technology. The Pentagon is considering whether SpaceX should own and operate its part of the system. This project could be a major win for Silicon Valley in the defense contracting industry. Optimism Score: 60</p>

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting with President Trump at the White House in what her aides call a 'commercial peace mission.' European leaders hope Meloni can act as a bridge between the Trump administration and the EU, which Trump has criticized. The hope is that Meloni can persuade Trump not to impose steep tariff hikes that could devastate European economies. The two leaders are expected to discuss trade, defense, shipping, ending the war in Ukraine, energy, artificial intelligence and more. Optimism Score: 60</p>

The decision could reshape the online advertising business that website publishers rely on to fund content creation. The U.S. Justice Department and several states sued Google, alleging the company engaged in illegal behavior to squash competition in advertising technology. Google says it does have rivals and will appeal the other half of the case. Optimism Score: 60</p>

            <p>Astronomers have detected promising 'hints' of potential life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located 124 light years away, using the James Webb Space Telescope. They detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be 'biosignatures' indicating extraterrestrial life. On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton. The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm these findings, and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery. Optimism Score: 80</p>
