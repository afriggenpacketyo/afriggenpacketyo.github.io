          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated he is currently inclined toward only one interest rate cut this year, balancing concerns about potential inflation increases with recession risks. Bostic noted that tariffs have been larger than anticipated, which could complicate the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. He expressed particular concern about rising inflation expectations, which could make the Fed's job more difficult. Bostic is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators are providing an update on the Mexican navy ship that crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge over the weekend, an incident which suspended commercial water traffic in the area. The ship, CuauhtÃ©moc, lost power before colliding with the bridge, causing its masts to snap and resulting in two fatalities and multiple injuries among the 277 people on board. One victim has been identified as 20-year-old cadet AmÃ©rica Yamilet SÃ¡nchez, and the second as Adal Jair Maldonado Marcos.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that preventing famine in Gaza is essential for diplomatic reasons, announcing that his government would allow limited food aid into the territory. This decision comes after more than two months of an aid blockade intended to pressure Hamas, a move that has faced international criticism and warnings from UN agencies about severe shortages in Gaza. The UN- and NGO-supported Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reports that 22% of Gaza's population is at critical risk of famine.

Moodyâ€™s cited the tax cut legislation and broader concerns about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs in downgrading the U.S. credit rating. This downgrade means that all three major rating agencies no longer consider the United States qualified for their top credit ratings.

          <p>Stock futures declined following Moody's Ratings' downgrade of the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1. Moody's cited widening federal deficits driven by higher interest payments on debt, growing entitlement spending, and low revenue generation from taxes. The downgrade reflects concerns about U.S. debt and the potential impact of the reconciliation bill in Congress. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index showed consumer confidence dipped in May due to trade war concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trumpâ€™s tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, the heart of Canadaâ€™s auto-parts industry. The tariffs are threatening smaller parts makers, many of which are family-owned businesses, and estimates suggest that thousands of parts workers have been laid off. While automakers are unlikely to move assembly plants, there is growing concern that tariffs will devastate parts makers. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and the complexity of trade rules are making it difficult for parts makers to plan and compete.</p>

The S&P 500 was indicated lower following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. The trust is taking advantage of this weakness to add to its position in the energy equipment manufacturer. The company is expected to benefit from increased investment in power and grid infrastructure and has a substantial backlog of orders, with much of 2026 and 2027 already sold out. The company was also one of the big winners from President Donald Trump's Middle East trip. (not investment advice)</p>

On Monday, the Foreign Office responded by summoning Tehran's ambassador to the UK following the charges. The alleged spying took place from August 2024 to February 2025, and the men are accused of carrying out surveillance with a view to locating journalists associated with Iran International.</p>

          <p>A theoretical proposal published in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics is challenging our current understanding of gravity. The theory aims to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, which are mathematically incompatible. The proposal suggests a new concept called unified gravity, where gravity is managed by four connected components that interact with one another. This model offers a testable approach to understanding quantum gravity effects, although it could take decades to achieve experimental breakthroughs.</p>
