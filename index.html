          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, citing increased sales to home professionals that offset decreased demand from do-it-yourself customers. CEO Marvin Ellison credits investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating near-term uncertainty and housing market challenges. While first-quarter sales slightly missed expectations, earnings surpassed estimates, and the company anticipates comparable sales to be flat to up 1% for the year. Lowe's is diversifying its imports to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs, with only about 20% of its purchase volume currently originating from China.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a National Parking Platform (NPP) to simplify paying for parking across different car parks. Currently in the trial phase and set to be handed over to an industry body for expansion, the NPP allows drivers to use any major parking app at participating locations, eliminating the need to download multiple apps. The RAC welcomes this initiative, emphasizing the importance of broad adoption by car park operators. The trial phase involved 10 local authorities and facilitated over half a million transactions, aiming to create a more flexible and hassle-free parking experience for motorists.</p>

          <p>Canada Goose's shares experienced a significant surge after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings beat analyst expectations, although it withdrew its fiscal year 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited unpredictable global trade and consumer spending patterns as reasons for not providing a financial outlook. The company said that the vast majority of its products are not impacted by tariffs, and it remains confident in its brand strength and ability to adapt to changing conditions. Canada Goose is also expanding into non-winter categories, such as rain jackets and warm-weather clothing, to strengthen the brand's year-round relevance.</p>

          <p>Tax cuts championed by President Trump are intensifying worries about debt and deficits among influential market participants, impacting interest rates. Investors are increasingly concerned that the proposed tax cuts, without corresponding spending reductions, will enlarge the federal deficit, leading to higher borrowing costs. This unease is reflected in rising Treasury yields, with the 10-year yield climbing above 4.5 percent and the 30-year yield exceeding 5 percent. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that Treasury market volatility could further destabilize the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>This article addresses concerns and questions surrounding President Biden's recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer. Despite having access to top medical care, the cancer went undetected, leading to questions about screening protocols for men over 70. Guidelines suggest that routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests may not be beneficial for older men due to slow-growing cancers and potential side effects from treatment. While Biden's prognosis is relatively good with modern treatments, the diagnosis highlights the ongoing debate about the necessity and frequency of prostate cancer screenings.</p>

Japan's approach to LNG investment has turned it into a main driver of LNG development in the Asia Pacific.

          <h2>Pakistan's Cybercrime Law Faces Scrutiny for Silencing Dissent</h2>

          <p>Pakistan's strengthened cybercrime laws are facing criticism from human rights groups for allegedly silencing critical voices, particularly journalists. The Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) criminalizes the dissemination of false information online that could incite fear, panic, or unrest. Journalists are concerned about the law's broad reach, allowing authorities to imprison social media users for up to three years for spreading disinformation. The Pakistani government defends the law as necessary to limit the spread of disinformation, while press freedom groups express concern over a lack of consultation before enacting such strict laws.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel's announcement of easing its blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza, desperately needed food, fuel, and medicine have yet to reach Palestinians. Dozens of trucks with supplies have crossed into Gaza at the Kerem Shalom crossing, but the United Nations has been unable to move any trucks from Kerem Shalom to warehouses inside Gaza. This delay has left Palestinians reeling from Israelâ€™s two-month ban on food, fuel, and other supplies waiting, with aid organizations suspending their operations and the price of food skyrocketing.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry has criticized President Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense shield program, arguing that it risks the weaponization of space and undermines global strategic stability. The proposed shield, estimated to cost around $175 billion, is designed to intercept missiles even if they are launched from space. China claims the project has a strong offensive nature, violating the principle of peaceful use in the Outer Space Treaty. The ministry urged the U.S. to abandon the project and enhance strategic trust between major countries.</p>

States are implementing various policies, including banning phones during instructional time or throughout the entire school day. While exceptions are often made for medical needs and special education plans, there is growing support for restricting phone access to promote social interaction and reduce distractions.</p>
