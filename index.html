Companies like Trina Solar are localizing production abroad, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion.

This therapy, known as belantamab mafodotin, has been shown to halt the cancer for nearly three times longer than current treatments, reducing side effects. The drug works by binding a chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets plasma cells, releasing its toxic payload inside the cancerous cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness, and around 1,500 patients a year could benefit from this treatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the restoration of Confederate names to military bases, but the Pentagon's official announcement stated the bases would be renamed after other veterans with the same surnames. This discrepancy reveals the administration's wink-and-a-nod approach, as the original names were replaced after a careful process. The move is seen as an attempt to capitalize on cultural divides and public dissatisfaction with DEI initiatives. The renaming is criticized as an insult to those whose names were added and then removed, and the actions highlight the administration's willingness to embrace Confederate ideas.</p>

Critics argue this decision reverses precedent and leaves homeowners to bear the cost of testing or risk returning to contaminated properties.</p>
