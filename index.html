          <p>This article shares the audio diary of Hanya Aljamal, a 28-year-old teacher living in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, documenting her life since the war began. Displaced multiple times and now living with her family, she describes the psychological toll of constant explosions, the struggle to find purpose, and the loss of her former identity. She recounts the deaths of students, a colleague, and a cousin, reflecting on the inability to grieve properly in a war zone. The diary captures small moments of hope, like a neighbor's garden, amidst widespread destruction and malnourishment.</p>

          <p>A UK mother, identified as Emma, has resorted to illegally purchasing vapes for her teenage children to control their nicotine addiction. She aims to provide them with lower-nicotine products from reputable suppliers, believing it's a safer alternative to them sourcing high-strength, illicit vapes themselves. This personal story highlights the broader issue of rising youth vaping, the ineffectiveness of the recent disposable vape ban, and the challenges parents and health services face in combating teenage nicotine dependency. Health experts express concern over vaping as a gateway to addiction for non-smokers.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes across Gaza have resulted in at least 72 Palestinian deaths, including civilians and children in displaced persons' shelters. The attacks occurred in Gaza City and near Khan Younis, adding to a death toll that has surpassed 56,000 in the 21-month conflict. Simultaneously, President Trump has indicated that a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be reached within the next week, although no official comments have been made by the involved parties.

          <p>Astronomers have discovered faint, ancient radio signals originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049, which took 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been detected so deep in space before. This finding suggests that the processes creating these energetic particles, such as supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, have been shaping galaxy clusters for nearly the entire history of the universe. The discovery opens a new window into understanding how the early universe grew and evolved.</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued an infant who had been left alone for several days in an apartment after the child's mother had died. Officers responded to a welfare check called in by a neighbor and, upon entering the apartment, found the deceased woman and the visibly emaciated baby on a bed. Bodycam footage shows an officer carefully rescuing the child, who was then transported to a hospital for lifesaving medical care. The baby is now expected to make a full recovery, while the cause of the mother's death is under investigation.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran for the state funeral of top Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists killed during a recent 12-day war with Israel. The conflict, which Israel stated was aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear program, resulted in the deaths of over 30 Iranian commanders and 11 scientists. Iran responded by firing over 550 ballistic missiles at Israel before a ceasefire was declared. The funeral procession marked the first public mourning for the high-ranking officials, with crowds chanting anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans, reflecting a defiant national mood.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani showcased his best pitching performance of the season, throwing two sharp innings for the Los Angeles Dodgers in their 9-5 loss to the Kansas City Royals. The two-way star reached a career-high velocity of 101.7 mph and effectively mixed his pitches, allowing only one hit and one walk over 27 pitches. Despite Ohtani's impressive outing, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled, with bulk reliever Ben Casparius giving up six runs. The loss snapped the Dodgers' five-game winning streak, but Ohtani's continued progress on the mound remains a significant positive development as he returns from Tommy John surgery.</p>

Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that while the US maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that could take years to close, China is making significant strides in algorithm engineering. He highlighted Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top US competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power, as a prime example of this progress.</p>

While the woman did not see what bit her, experts who analyzed photos of the wounds concluded they were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark.

          <p>Dave Parker, the formidable outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates known as "The Cobra," has passed away at the age of 74. Parker was a dominant force in his era, winning two batting titles, the 1978 National League MVP award, and helping lead the Pirates to a World Series championship in 1979. Over his 19-year career, he was a seven-time All-Star and will be posthumously enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame next month. The Pirates and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred paid tribute to Parker as a gifted, intimidating player and a legendary figure in the sport.</p>

The 940-page package extends many 2017 tax cuts and adds new temporary breaks for tip income and overtime pay, largely favoring upper-income families. A controversial "revenge tax" targeting foreign countries was scrapped, while the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions was raised to $40,000. The bill also includes deep cuts to Medicaid and targeted provisions, such as an increased deduction for whale-hunting expenses, reflecting last-minute negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A severe mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a major traffic shutdown on the West Virginia Turnpike, leaving thousands of motorists stranded for over eight hours. The slide blocked a storm drain, flooding the northbound lanes and creating a 12-mile backup in a mountainous area with no easy detours. The West Virginia Parkways Authority took full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, calling the situation unacceptable and promising to revise its closure policies. No injuries were reported, but stranded drivers expressed frustration over the lack of information and resources during the overnight ordeal.</p>

The plaintiffs sued Trump for statements he made suggesting they were guilty of the crime for which they were wrongfully convicted.

Experts warn that the increased use of plainclothes and masked agents by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under the Trump administration makes it easier for imposters to deceive the public. Several cases have been reported nationwide where individuals impersonating ICE agents have attempted to enter homes, detain people, and even commit sexual assault.

Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings, which also show preferential treatment for females in grave goods, challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Organizers estimated a record turnout despite a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, which carries potential fines and prison sentences. The event proceeded as a powerful symbol of civil society's resilience against the government's anti-LGBTQ policies. Attendees, including EU officials and MEPs, marched to show solidarity and advocate for diversity and equal rights in a country with an increasingly restrictive political climate.</p>

          <p>Concerns over press freedom in Kenya are escalating following a harsh crackdown on anti-government protests that left 19 dead and hundreds injured. During the demonstrations, the government attempted to ban live media coverage, an order that was quickly overturned by judges but seen as a damaging attack on free expression. Journalists report being targeted by police with live ammunition, and activists have been arrested for online dissent. The events highlight a growing rift between President William Ruto's government and the nation's youth, who are protesting economic hardship and a lack of opportunities.</p>
