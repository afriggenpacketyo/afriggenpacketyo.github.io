          <p>After operating for over six decades, the pharmacy chain Rite Aid has announced the closure of all its locations. This decision follows two bankruptcy filings in less than two years, the most recent being in May after a previous filing in October 2023. The company has been grappling with declining sales and significant litigation related to opioid prescriptions. Since its 2023 bankruptcy, Rite Aid had already closed over 520 stores, and its website now directs former customers to services for transferring pharmacy records. The closure marks the end for the company founded in 1962.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon has issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the president's justification for the deployment was "untethered to the facts," noting that recent protests in the city were not significantly violent or disruptive. The ruling addresses constitutional principles regarding the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement and the balance of power between federal and state governments. The White House has indicated it will likely appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza in the near future, following Hamas's agreement to key parts of a U.S.-brokered peace plan. The proposal includes the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a phased Israeli military withdrawal from parts of Gaza. While Hamas has accepted some terms, negotiations are ongoing in Egypt to finalize technical details, such as the decommissioning of weapons. The plan, outlined by President Trump, aims for a sustainable peace, though Netanyahu has signaled that a full Israeli withdrawal is not guaranteed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has authorized the deployment of 300 National Guard troops to Chicago, citing a need to address crime and protect federal property. The decision follows recent clashes between immigration authorities and protesters, including an incident where an armed woman was shot. This move has been criticized by state and local leaders, including Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who called it an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." The deployment in Chicago is part of a broader administration strategy of sending federal forces to cities led by Democrats, a tactic that faces legal challenges.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, global equity markets are showing a surprising resilience, with major indexes reaching record highs. Data indicates a significant flow of capital into global equities, particularly the technology sector, despite concerns about the shutdown's economic impact and low consumer sentiment. However, analysts are raising red flags about potential bubbles, especially in credit markets where investor overconfidence is high. This article notes a significant disconnect between political instability and market optimism, while also touching on cultural economic trends like "Swiftonomics." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A social media account associated with China's People's Liberation Army has condemned the production and sale of building block toys that depict Japan's notorious Unit 731. The military account, Junzhengping, accused the merchants of promoting a distorted view of history by turning the unit's horrific wartime atrocities into a commercial product. Unit 731 was responsible for brutal human experimentation and biological warfare during World War II, and its history remains a deeply sensitive topic in China. The toys have since been removed from Chinese e-commerce websites following the criticism.</p>

          <p>The nation of Fiji is experiencing one of the world's fastest-growing HIV epidemics, with health officials declaring a national crisis. The number of people living with HIV has surged from under 500 in 2014 to nearly 5,900 in 2024, with a significant increase among young people. The rise is linked to intravenous drug use, particularly methamphetamine, and dangerous practices like needle sharing and "bluetoothing," where blood is shared between users. A lack of needle-syringe programs, insufficient healthcare resources, and challenges in data collection are exacerbating the situation, with experts fearing the true scale of the crisis is still unknown.</p>

          <p>A series of before-and-after photographs starkly illustrates the rapid retreat of glaciers around the world, a direct consequence of global warming. Scientists report that glaciers outside of Greenland and Antarctica lost 450 billion tonnes of ice in 2024 alone, with Swiss glaciers losing a quarter of their volume in the last decade. This rapid melting is not a natural cycle but is definitively linked to human-caused CO2 emissions. The loss of these frozen reservoirs threatens global sea levels and jeopardizes fresh water supplies for hundreds of millions of people, particularly in mountain communities in Asia.</p>

Psychologists note that the anticipation of a reward releases dopamine, making the wait feel exciting, especially for exclusive or limited items. Brands are capitalizing on this by using "experiential marketing," offering freebies, entertainment, and social media-worthy moments to turn long lines into a key part of their promotional strategy.</p>

          <p>Syria is holding its first parliamentary elections since the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, though the process is facing criticism and is not taking place nationwide. The vote is indirect, with "electoral colleges" selecting two-thirds of the assembly members, while the interim president appoints the rest. Elections have been postponed in three provinces due to security issues and political standoffs with Kurdish-led forces. Civil society groups have raised concerns that the system allows the executive branch to dominate parliament, rendering the elections more symbolic than democratic and failing to represent the will of all Syrians.</p>

Immunologists explain that bringing together thousands of students from diverse locations creates a "mixing pot" of viruses to which many have no prior immunity. This is compounded by lifestyle changes common during the first few weeks of university, such as stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all of which weaken the immune system.

          <p>An FBI agent has reportedly been suspended for insubordination after refusing to take part in a planned "perp walk" for former FBI Director James Comey. According to reports, FBI leadership had discussed using agents in tactical gear to publicly escort Comey to his court arraignment on charges of lying to Congress. The suspended agent allegedly found this plan inappropriate for a non-violent case. The indictment of Comey followed calls from Donald Trump to investigate his political adversaries, raising questions about the motivations behind the high-profile prosecutorial actions.</p>

          <p>The populist ANO party, led by billionaire former prime minister Andrej Babis, has won the parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic with just under 35% of the vote. While ANO secured the most seats, it fell short of an overall majority and will need to form a coalition to govern. Babis is expected to begin talks with two smaller right-wing eurosceptic parties to build a majority alliance. His campaign leaned into anti-Ukrainian rhetoric and opposition to EU climate policies, signaling a potential shift in the country's domestic and foreign policy direction.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown is significantly impacting operations at National Park Service sites across the country. Many parks have been forced to close or operate with minimal staff, leading to the suspension of visitor services, maintenance, and regular updates. While some states are using their own funds or donations to keep parks open, others, like White Sands National Park in New Mexico, are completely closed. The situation has raised concerns about public safety and the potential for vandalism and environmental damage, similar to what occurred during previous shutdowns.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly attack outside a synagogue, Greater Manchester Police have deployed hundreds of additional officers to the city's streets. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes stated that officers are working extended shifts to provide a visible presence and reassure the Jewish population and other communities. The increased security measures also account for the Conservative Party Conference scheduled to begin in the city. Police have made several arrests on terrorism charges in connection with the attack, which killed two men and was carried out by an attacker who was shot dead by police.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack on Yom Kippur at a Manchester synagogue resulted in the deaths of two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, and left three others seriously injured. The attacker, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, used a car to ram people before attempting to enter the synagogue with a knife; he was shot and killed by police. One of the deceased victims, Mr. Daulby, was tragically killed by a police bullet as officers engaged the attacker. The suspect, a British citizen of Syrian descent, was not on a counter-terrorism watchlist but had a recent criminal history.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested nearly 500 people during a demonstration in Trafalgar Square in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The vast majority of arrests were for supporting a proscribed organization. The protest went ahead despite calls from police and politicians to postpone it in light of the recent deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers from the group Defend Our Juries, including a Jewish member, argued that canceling the vigil would be "letting terror win" and that it is possible to grieve for multiple tragedies simultaneously.</p>

The club's strong performance follows a significant £10m investment from Tony Bloom. Pundits note that while maintaining this form is challenging, the early-season success gives the fanbase legitimate cause for optimism in a league typically dominated by Rangers and Celtic.</p>

          <p>Attendees at the annual Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach, California, experienced a notably different event this year due to the U.S. federal government shutdown. The U.S. military, typically a main attraction with its advanced fighter jets and demonstration teams, was unable to participate, leaving a significant void in the program. While international military teams from Britain and Canada, along with civilian and vintage aircraft, filled the schedule, many spectators expressed disappointment at the absence of American military might. The situation highlighted another tangible consequence of the political deadlock in Washington for a major public event.</p>

          <p>After starting the season by snatching victories with dramatic late goals, Liverpool FC has now suffered two consecutive Premier League defeats due to last-minute strikes from their opponents. A 95th-minute goal from Chelsea followed a 97th-minute winner for Crystal Palace the previous week, marking three successive losses for manager Arne Slot for the first time in his career. The article suggests that the team's early-season success masked underlying performance issues and a lack of balance following nearly £450m in new signings. Key players like Mohamed Salah appear to be struggling for form as the champions have fallen from the top of the table.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has unveiled a stringent immigration plan, pledging to remove 750,000 migrants within five years if they win the next election. The proposal includes banning anyone who enters the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and replacing court appeals with an internal Home Office process. The plan would also double the funding for a rebranded "Removals Force" and is paired with a commitment to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to prevent legal challenges. This policy creates a clear dividing line with the opposition Labour party ahead of the election.</p>
