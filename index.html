        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced further delays to the HS2 high-speed rail project, pushing the opening date beyond 2033. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander cited a "litany of failure," including scope changes, ineffective contracts, and mismanagement, which have caused costs to balloon by Â£37 billion since the project's approval in 2012. An interim report by HS2's chief executive revealed shocking mismanagement under previous governments, while another report examined governance and accountability issues within HS2 Ltd. The government plans to provide an update on costs and deadlines later in the year, marking a reset in how major infrastructure projects are delivered. Optimism for the project's future is low given the current state of affairs.</p>

          <p>An Iranian official has warned that any U.S. intervention in the ongoing conflict with Israel risks escalating the situation into an "all-out war." The conflict, now in its sixth day, involves exchanges of missile fire, with Israel targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran retaliating with missiles aimed at Israeli cities. The U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that two centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit during the strikes. While Israel has inflicted significant damage, it has also suffered casualties from Iranian missiles, prompting mass evacuations from Tehran and heightened security measures in Israel.</p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum's biography, "Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television," explores the Cuban-born entertainer's impact on American culture and television. Arnaz, known as Ricky Ricardo, played a crucial role in transforming television production methods and business models. He assembled a team of Hollywood technicians to film "I Love Lucy" in front of a live audience with three cameras, a groundbreaking method at the time. His ability to preserve episodes on film led to the invention of reruns and syndication, shifting network television production from New York to Los Angeles.</p>

The heat is attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot air from Western Europe.

          <p>Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, envisions transforming the fintech platform into a comprehensive "super app" leveraging artificial intelligence. Klarna is launching mobile phone plans in the U.S. through a partnership with Gigs, aiming to offer personalized financial services beyond its "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) model. Siemiatkowski emphasizes AI's role in tailoring services to individual users and addressing issues with Klarna's previous super app attempts. The goal is to create a "digital financial assistant" for everyday banking needs, though Klarna faces perception challenges in the U.S. where it's primarily known for BNPL.</p>

          <p>Marty from Spokane, Washington, was surprised with a $140,000 tax bill after withdrawing $400,000 from his 401(k) to buy a house. He mistakenly believed he had paid all the necessary fees and taxes at the time of withdrawal. The Ramsey Show co-hosts advised him to use his savings and take out a personal loan to pay off the IRS as quickly as possible, emphasizing that it is better to owe a bank than the IRS. The story serves as a reminder to avoid dipping into retirement accounts without fully understanding the tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>
