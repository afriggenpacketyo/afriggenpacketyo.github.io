          <p>Authorities have apprehended a suspect in connection with the theft of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's purse, which occurred at a Washington D.C. restaurant. The Secret Service stated that the suspect, described as a serial offender, did not appear to target Noem specifically due to her position. The individual allegedly attempted to use Noem's credit card and access her electronic devices after stealing the purse, which contained personal identification, medication, department credentials, and a significant amount of cash. The incident raised concerns about security protocols, as agents were not in close proximity to the Secretary at the time of the theft.</p>

          <p>Senator Jeanne Shaheen has publicly criticized Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, stating that he has "created chaos" at the Pentagon. Shaheen cited staffing shakeups and concerns over Hegseth's handling of classified information, particularly his use of the encrypted messaging app Signal, as reasons for her criticism. She argued that Hegseth's actions demonstrate a lack of qualification for the role and a failure to take responsibility. In response, a Pentagon spokesman defended Hegseth's performance and pointed to issues during the previous administration.</p>

          <p>Survivors and families gathered at Bergen-Belsen to commemorate the 80th anniversary of its liberation, reflecting on the horrors witnessed at the Nazi concentration camp. The camp, liberated by British and Canadian troops in April 1945, was found with thousands of unburied corpses and tens of thousands of emaciated survivors. The testimonies of soldiers, journalists, and survivors painted a chilling picture of the camp's conditions, where overcrowding, disease, and starvation led to countless deaths. The commemoration served as a reminder of the atrocities committed and the importance of remembering the victims.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple who are legally in the U.S., criticizing the government's attempt to deport them based on alleged gang affiliation. Judge David Briones accused the government of lacking meaningful evidence to support the claim that the couple were members of a gang. The couple, who fled Venezuela in 2022 and were granted Temporary Protected Status, were arrested and detained due to their alleged association with a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The judge's ruling highlighted concerns over due process and the government's handling of immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks discovered off the coast of Costa Rica have been confirmed as Danish slave ships, the Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus. Marine archaeologists identified the vessels through investigations of ship timbers, cargo bricks, and clay pipes found during underwater excavations. The ships were wrecked in 1710, with one set on fire and the other wrecked in the surf. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and provides valuable historical insights.</p>

While visual separation is usually executed without incident, it can pose a deadly risk when mishandled, as aviation experts have cautioned for years.</p>
