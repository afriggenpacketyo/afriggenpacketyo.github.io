Despite its high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 273, its annual revenue remains significantly smaller than other companies of a similar market cap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell has been sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and for a murder conspiracy against her niece's ex-husband.

The judge highlighted her profound manipulation and the unparalleled calculation behind her crimes, which prosecutors argued were motivated by money and her religious beliefs.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated that a new trade agreement with Canada may not be reached, suggesting that imposing tariffs might be the alternative to a negotiated deal. This statement comes as an August 1st deadline for an agreement approaches, with Canada's prime minister stating the country will not accept a "bad deal." The potential for a 35% tax on certain Canadian goods looms, adding to existing tariffs and creating further uncertainty for the deeply integrated economies. (not investment advice)</p>

Army Secretary Dan Driscoll criticized the original decision as an injection of "far-left politics" and emphasized the symbol's importance to the academy's motto of "Duty, Honor, Country."</p>

          <h2>Coroner Finds Failings in Care of Former England Cricketer Graham Thorpe Before His Suicide</h2>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that former England cricketer Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide in August 2024, experienced failings in his mental healthcare in the months prior to his death. The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive him to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported he was asking for help to end his life. While the coroner noted shortcomings in his care, such as a lack of in-person assessment, it was determined they did not constitute gross misconduct.</p>

          <p>A total of 220 Members of Parliament from nine different political parties have signed a letter calling on UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter, backed by over half of Labour's MPs, argues that recognition is a vital step toward a two-state solution and would send a powerful message of support for Palestinian rights. This puts additional pressure on the Prime Minister, especially after France announced its commitment to recognize Palestinian statehood within months.</p>
