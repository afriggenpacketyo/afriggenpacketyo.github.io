          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement to develop a supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, aiming to reduce dependence on China. The deal involves a project pipeline valued at up to $8.5 billion, with both nations committing to substantial initial investments in joint mining and processing ventures. This strategic partnership is a direct response to China's dominance and recent export controls over these materials, which are vital for defense, technology, and electric vehicles. The collaboration seeks to bolster economic and national security for both allies.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, the pediatrician who helped expose the Flint water crisis, has launched an innovative program called "Rx Kids" to combat child poverty. The initiative provides direct, no-strings-attached cash payments to every expectant mother in Flint, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the baby's first year. Funded primarily by private donations, the program is designed to alleviate financial stress so families can afford essentials like rent, diapers, and food. It represents a novel public health approach to addressing the detrimental effects of poverty on children.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has lifted a temporary restraining order, granting the Trump administration the authority to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon. The administration claims the deployment is necessary to protect a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility that has been a site of protests. However, state and local officials have strongly disputed this characterization, describing the protests as small and largely peaceful. The 9th Circuit's ruling overturns a lower court's decision that found no legitimate basis for the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates show signs of cooling, prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing are cautioned against making several common mistakes. The article advises against trying to time the market by assuming rates will only continue to drop, as they can be volatile. It also encourages exploring alternatives to traditional 30-year fixed loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points to secure a lower rate. Homeowners are also reminded that even a small rate reduction, not just the traditional 1%, can make refinancing worthwhile. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that university tuition fees in England will be permitted to rise annually in line with inflation, beginning in the 2026 academic year. This policy change aims to provide financial stability to universities after a decade-long fee freeze. However, the ability for institutions to charge the maximum fee will be conditional on meeting quality thresholds for teaching and student outcomes, as determined by the Office for Students. The move is intended to address the erosion of university funding but will increase the cost burden for future students.</p>
