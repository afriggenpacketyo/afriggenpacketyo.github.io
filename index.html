          <p>The Maine Coast Fisherman’s Association has voiced their support for Jordon Hudson after her advocacy for Maine fishermen during the Miss Maine USA pageant. Hudson, whose family's fishing business went bankrupt due to state regulations, highlighted the struggles of fishermen in rural Maine and advocated for government support to prevent further economic hardship for these communities. The association praised Hudson for bringing attention to the challenges faced by Maine's fishing communities in a unique way, emphasizing that advocacy takes many forms and her voice matters. Hudson's parents owned a fishing business, Frenchman’s Bay Fisheries, in Maine, but after the area they used to fish was closed off to fishing by the state in 2000, their business eventually went bankrupt years later.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with outfielder Juan Soto regarding his effort level when running to first base after Soto failed to run hard on multiple plays. Soto's lack of hustle was apparent in a game against the Red Sox, where he watched a hit bounce off the Green Monster, resulting in only a single, and in a previous game against the Yankees. While Soto denies any lack of effort, Mendoza emphasizes the importance of running hard in all situations, particularly in Fenway Park due to the dimensions of the field. Soto recently signed a 15-year, $765 million contract with the Mets.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by Allianz Trade reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S., despite a temporary tariff reduction following a deal between Beijing and Washington. The survey indicates that the trade war has left lasting scars on Chinese exporters, leading them to diversify away from the U.S. market. Even with the temporary tariff reduction, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains significantly higher than before the second Trump administration. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is emerging as a preferred destination for Chinese firms seeking to move production overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., to address strained relations between the two countries. The visit aims to reset the strategic relationship, which has deteriorated due to ideological differences, geopolitical alliances, and domestic policy conflicts. Ramaphosa will attempt to refute Trump's claims of a "genocide" against white South Africans and present a new trade framework to govern trade between the two countries post-AGOA. Tensions have risen due to Trump's trade policies, cuts in U.S. aid, and South Africa's case against Israel in the International Court of Justice.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump are engaged in a public feud after Springsteen criticized Trump's administration as "corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous" during a concert in England. Trump responded by calling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggesting that Springsteen and Beyoncé should be investigated for illegal campaign donations to Kamala Harris. Springsteen has been a long-time political opponent of Trump, and has spoken out against Republican presidents in the past. The article highlights the political risk of Trump attacking musical figures like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift due to their younger, more female audiences.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, stated that the company does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. He noted that over half of the company's sales come from the U.S., and they have diversified their import sources, reducing reliance on China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which indicated it would need to raise prices due to tariffs. Home Depot's full-year sales forecast remains unchanged, with expectations of 2.8% total sales growth and 1% comparable sales growth, based on the continuation of temporary tariff agreements.</p>

The Trump administration's trade policies, including high tariffs on Chinese goods, are disrupting trade flows between the world’s two largest economies.

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, lifting a lower court's order that had barred the termination. The decision potentially leaves hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants vulnerable to deportation and uncertain about their legal status and employment authorization. Lawyers representing the TPS holders criticized the Supreme Court's decision as "callous" due to the lack of clarity regarding the timing and implementation of the rollback.

He is accused of conspiring with Roman Lavrynovych, who has already been charged with arson. The fires targeted Starmer's family home, a car he previously sold, and a house where he lived in the 1990s. Authorities have arrested three people in total, and the investigation is being handled by Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command.</p>

          <p>A Mexican naval ship, the Cuauhtémoc, accelerated suddenly in the wrong direction before colliding with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members. The ship was moving at six knots when it struck the bridge, less than five minutes after leaving a Lower Manhattan pier. Federal transportation officials have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the sudden acceleration. The ship, which had 277 people on board, was on a good-will tour with planned stops in multiple countries.</p>

          <p>A Chinese scientific study has traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event. The research suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. These findings support the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes, challenging earlier findings about the lineage of this common ancestor. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could uncover insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working to protect jaguars by changing perceptions of them from cattle-killing villains to valuable parts of the ecosystem. The project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect the animals and their prey. This approach has expanded the protected area for jaguars and fostered a shift in attitudes among ranchers, who are learning to coexist with the predators. The initiative has led to a stable population of jaguars in the reserve and surrounding ranching region.</p>
