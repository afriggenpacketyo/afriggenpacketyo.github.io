The 25-year-old, a mainstay for Crystal Palace since 2021, recently led his team to their first major trophy and a Community Shield victory, attracting interest from top clubs like Liverpool. Guehi credits his family's sacrifices and a formative loan spell at Swansea for shaping his character, and candidly discusses his passion for music, reading, and even a surprising aspiration to become a WWE wrestler, offering a comprehensive view of the person behind the player.</p>

          <p>San Bernardino County deputies have announced the tragic belief that missing 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro is dead, leading to the arrest of his parents, Jake and Rebecca Haro, on murder charges. The investigation, which began as a reported kidnapping, shifted after authorities found inconsistencies in Rebecca Haro's account and were unable to locate the infant. Law enforcement had previously removed a 2-year-old child from the couple's home, and Jake Haro has a prior conviction for willful child cruelty. This heartbreaking development has prompted a continued search for Emmanuel, with Sheriff Shannon Dicus asserting that the justice system will hold the parents accountable for their alleged actions.</p>

          <p>North Korea has strongly accused South Korea of a "serious provocation" after South Korean troops fired warning shots at its soldiers near the inter-Korean border earlier this week. Seoul's military confirmed the incident, stating that North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the military demarcation line while engaged in barrier construction. Following the warning shots, the North Korean troops immediately returned to their territory without further conflict or reported casualties. Pyongyang's Vice Chief of the People's Army General Staff linked the incident to ongoing US-South Korean military drills, emphasizing the heightened and volatile nature of the relationship between the two nations.</p>

Additionally, the release of Lucy Connolly, imprisoned for inciting racial hatred online, sparks debate as she claims to be a "political prisoner."

          <p>Lyle Menendez has been denied parole by the California board, just one day after his brother Erik's similar bid for freedom was rejected. Both brothers were convicted in 1995 for the 1989 murders of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, maintaining they acted in self-defense due to alleged abuse. Despite Lyle being described as a "model inmate" and showing remorse, the parole board cited concerns about his actions during and after the murders, including deception and lack of self-control, concluding he still poses a public risk. The brothers must wait three years for their next hearing, though Lyle might be considered sooner.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from denying federal funding to over 30 cities and counties, including major hubs like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. These jurisdictions maintain "sanctuary" policies that limit their cooperation with federal immigration efforts, a stance the Trump administration has aggressively challenged. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders, which threatened to withhold billions in federal money, an unconstitutional "coercive threat." This ruling marks a significant legal victory for these localities, reinforcing their ability to set their own immigration cooperation policies against federal pressure.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have lost their recent momentum, dropping into a first-place tie with the San Diego Padres after a narrow 2-1 defeat at Petco Park.

Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the team's disappointment, stressing the immediate need to secure a win in the upcoming game. This result follows a week of squandered opportunities, including a split series against the last-place Colorado Rockies, indicating a persistent offensive struggle that the team must address to regain their division lead.</p>

The party proposes detaining individuals on disused RAF bases and deporting them to their home countries if agreements can be reached.

This shift is driven by Hong Kong's more active capital market and the average 19.4% jump in new shares on their trading debuts, compared to 3.6% in the US. Growing US-China rivalry and lingering delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the US also contribute to this preference, making Hong Kong a more attractive and stable listing option.

          <p>The Texas legislature is poised to give final approval to a redrawn congressional map, preliminarily passed in an 18-11 party-line vote, which is expected to significantly boost Republican representation by up to five seats. This move fulfills a direct request from Donald Trump to strengthen the GOP ahead of next year's midterm elections. A Houston Democratic state senator, Carol Alvarado, has threatened a filibuster to delay the map's passage, arguing against its partisan nature. Critics allege the new districts diminish minority voter influence, with swift lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act anticipated once Governor Greg Abbott signs the bill into law.</p>

          <p>India's Election Commission (ECI), a historically trusted institution, is confronting a severe credibility test following a barrage of allegations from the opposition regarding voter fraud and inconsistencies in electoral rolls. Opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, accuse the ECI of colluding with the ruling BJP to rig the 2024 general elections, citing issues like fake and duplicate voters. A recent intensive revision of Bihar's electoral rolls, which removed 6.5 million names, has intensified criticism over procedural failures and potential disenfranchisement. The ECI denies wrongdoing, but a Supreme Court intervention ordering transparency highlights the significant challenges to its impartiality.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking, a controversial car park operator, has been ordered to pay £10,240 to a charity after losing its second court appeal against Hannah Robinson. The firm had relentlessly pursued Robinson for thousands in charges due to its "five-minute payment rule," which was widely criticized and later banned. A district judge initially dismissed Excel's claim, deeming its conduct "unreasonable," and ordered the payment to the Access to Justice Foundation because Robinson had free legal representation. Despite this defeat, Excel maintains its terms were lawful and continues to pursue other drivers for similar pre-ban infringements, highlighting ongoing consumer rights battles.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted court-authorized searches of former National Security Adviser John Bolton's home in Bethesda, Maryland, and his political action committee office in Washington, D.C. Sources indicate the searches are related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump, who claimed to learn about the raid from TV, called Bolton a "lowlife" and "unpatriotic." This development follows a criminal inquiry during the first Trump administration and a lawsuit over Bolton's memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," which allegedly contained classified information. The Biden administration had previously closed the investigation, adding a layer of political intrigue to the current events.</p>

          <p>A notable political divide is emerging between young men and women in Britain, with polling suggesting young women are increasingly left-wing while young men lean more towards the right. A 2025 survey found 20% of young women identified as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with women showing stronger support for Labour and the Green Party, and men for Reform UK. Researchers attribute this gap to factors like higher education rates among women, fostering socially liberal views, and the influence of social media. Experts suggest young men may be drawn to parties supporting traditional masculinity, while women seek progressive futures.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington D.C. to be armed, escalating the Trump administration's ongoing crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses an earlier stance by the Pentagon and comes as President Trump claims the mission has brought "total safety" to the city, which he previously characterized as a "hellhole." Washington D.C.'s Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser has voiced "grave concerns" about the federal intervention, citing existing crime reductions and warning that the "unlawful deployment" could inflame tensions. Trump is considering declaring a national emergency to extend the 2,000-troop deployment beyond its initial 30-day period, underscoring the contentious nature of this federal action.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration highlights over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as a success for its crime crackdown, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers are not necessarily reliable indicators of public safety. While the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department reported a 25% increase in arrests compared to last year, the White House and MPD have not provided full details on who was arrested or why. Experts like Jenn Rolnick Borchetta of the ACLU question the validity of some arrests, while others note that "flooding the zone" with officers can simply lead to more arrests, not necessarily a reduction in serious crime, and risks increased police-public interactions and potential uses of force.</p>
