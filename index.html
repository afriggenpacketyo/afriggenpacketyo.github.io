          <p>President Trump voiced his displeasure with Vladimir Putin's recent escalation of attacks in Ukraine, stating he was "not happy" with the situation. Speaking to reporters, Trump mentioned his surprise at the intensified attacks, especially given ongoing peace talks, and indicated he might consider imposing further sanctions on Russia. Trump highlighted his long-standing relationship with Putin, expressing bewilderment at the recent change in Putin's actions, emphasizing the loss of life due to the attacks on Ukrainian cities, as he said that Putin is ‚Äúkilling a lot of people and I don‚Äôt like it at all.‚Äù The article conveys the shift in Trump's tone towards Putin, who he has largely sided with in the war, and his renewed commitment to holding Russia accountable for its aggression. Optimism here is somewhat mitigated due to the ongoing conflict and loss of life.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine completed a significant prisoner exchange, releasing over 300 soldiers each, reflecting a rare instance of cooperation amidst the continuing conflict. This exchange, agreed upon during talks in Turkey, involved the swap of 1,000 prisoners of war and civilian detainees from each side. However, despite the prisoner exchange, Russia continued its offensive, launching extensive drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, resulting in casualties and infrastructure damage. President Trump expressed consideration of additional sanctions against Russia following these attacks, while Ukrainian President Zelenskyy urged Western partners to intensify sanctions to deter further aggression.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, a notable increase from 2022. This rise is attributed to both increased submissions and Tripadvisor's more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews, where businesses offer rewards for positive feedback. The company employs a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to combat fake reviews. Tripadvisor identifies four categories of fake submissions: boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews, with most paid reviews originating from Asia. The company acknowledges the ongoing challenge of detecting fake reviews but emphasizes its commitment to improving its systems and penalizing violators.</p>

Trump initially threatened to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods starting June 1, citing frustration with the pace of negotiations. Von der Leyen stated that the EU is ready to move "swiftly" to agree a trade deal with the U.S. but needs until July 9 to reach a "good deal."

          <p>President Trump clarified that his tariff policy aims to bolster domestic manufacturing of military equipment and technology, rather than consumer goods like sneakers and T-shirts. He supported Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks suggesting the U.S. does not necessarily need a "booming textile industry." Trump emphasized the importance of producing "big things" such as tanks, ships, chips, and computers domestically, indicating a strategic focus on high-value and defense-related manufacturing sectors. This statement aligns with Trump's broader trade rhetoric, which includes imposing tariffs on imported goods to incentivize domestic production.</p>

Senator Ron Johnson expressed concerns that the bill increases the deficit and urged deeper spending cuts to pre-pandemic levels. The bill, which extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases military and border security spending, faces criticism for raising the debt ceiling and potentially harming lower-income Americans. Speaker Johnson defended the bill as an investment that will stimulate the economy, while Senator Rand Paul opposes the debt ceiling increase included in the legislation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to decide on the cases of two former City traders jailed for manipulating interest rates, raising concerns about potential miscarriages of justice. Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo were among 37 traders prosecuted for "rigging" Libor and Euribor, with allegations that they sought to influence rates for their banks' benefit. Evidence later emerged suggesting that central bankers and government officials had pressured banks to engage in similar conduct on a larger scale. The Supreme Court will determine if judges were wrong to instruct juries that the traders' actions were unlawful, which could lead to the overturning of all remaining convictions.

          <p>This article reports on veterans' invisible wounds, the previously unknown brain injuries suffered by those who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. New research suggests the troops were wounded by repeated, low-level, blast pressure from their own weapons. Ryan Larkin, an elite Navy SEAL who joined right out of high school and served in four combat deployments before severe depression led him to take his own life, was one of those injured fighters. An autopsy revealed microscopic scarring in his brain, and doctors pinpointed his injuries to the weapons systems he routinely used during training exercises.</p>

          <p>Cleanup crews in California are addressing the aftermath of recent wildfires, focusing on removing hazardous waste and mitigating the risk of exploding batteries from electric vehicles. The EPA is working to remove hazardous waste, including electric vehicles and power walls, which can pose significant risks due to damaged lithium-ion batteries. The batteries are treated as potentially unstable and are carefully extracted, submerged in saltwater, and eventually disposed of in landfills. Residents in affected areas express concerns about the safety of their air, soil, and homes, highlighting the challenges of cleaning up toxic ash and debris.</p>

          <p>Frank Larkin's son, Ryan, a decorated Navy SEAL, took his own life, and Larkin suspected his son's military service resulted in an invisible brain injury. Larkin donated his son's brain to Dr. Daniel Perl at the Uniformed Services University, the military medical school. Dr. Perl found scarring in Ryan Larkin's brain, but there was one big difference: Larkin had not been hit by a roadside bomb. Most of what he endured was low-level, repeated, shocks from his own weapons. As a result, Special Operations is testing a door breaching charge with half the blast pressure and training rooms are now designed to absorb shockwaves.</p>

          <p>Indian Relay, a sport with roots dating back centuries, involves riders racing bareback on thoroughbred horses, leaping from one horse to another after each lap. The sport is exciting and dangerous, and injuries to both horses and humans are common. Ken Real Bird says the roots of modern Indian Relay are in the horse-stealing raids that tribes once staged against White settlers and each other. Mason Red Wing feels a close connection to his horses, and he said that when he was younger, he didn't want to be Native American, but the horse helped him reconnect with his culture and be proud of who he is and proud of where he's from.</p>

          <p>Workers broke ground on an underground parking lot in Rome 18 years ago, and they unearthed what Italian archeologists believe was once "the pleasure gardens" of the Roman emperor Caligula. Scholars have been re-examining Caligula's story to see if history has it right. It took archeologists nine years to carefully recover more than a million pieces of the past, while an underground parking garage and modern building was built around them. One of the most remarkable things about Caligula is that he lived to become emperor at all, and he was just 24 years old and in charge of an empire.</p>
