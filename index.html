          <h2>Experts Analyze Kris Jenner's Apparent Cosmetic Transformation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 05:00:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kris Jenner's recent youthful appearance has sparked speculation about a possible deep plane facelift, which her representative confirmed was performed by Dr. Steven Levine. Experts suggest that Jenner's natural-looking rejuvenation is indicative of a well-executed procedure that reset her facial tissues. A deep plane facelift involves a wider dissection under the structural elements of the face, allowing for a more natural and durable result. While any surgery carries risks such as infection and nerve damage, a deep plane facelift's main risk is potential facial paralysis, and the recovery time is approximately six months for full results.</p>

          <p>People's Liberation Army (PLA) maneuvers around Taiwan have increased in tempo and intensity, evolving from occasional sorties into a coordinated campaign for combat training and strategic signaling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises, each varying in scale and purpose. Near-daily patrols have sharply increased since 2024, after Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te assumed office. Fewer than 20 PLA aircraft entered Taiwanâ€™s air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in 2019, highlighting the escalation in recent years.</p>

          <p>Reporters at Voice of America and other U.S.-funded networks are concerned about their future following mass layoffs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the imprisonment of a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty correspondent in Azerbaijan. The Trump administration's cuts eliminate a significant portion of Voice of America, raising doubts about the government's commitment to non-American journalists working for these networks who often risk their lives to cover sensitive issues in their home countries. Journalists fear being prevented from working, imprisoned, or facing worse consequences if they return home when their visas expire. Ivana Konstantinovic, a former news anchor for Voice of America's Serbian-language service, highlighted the vulnerability of independent journalists in Serbia, where attacks against the media are increasing.</p>

          <p>China's real estate sector is facing a prolonged downturn exacerbated by a shrinking population. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain suppressed, at only a quarter of the 2017 peak. China's population has been declining for the past three years, with birth rates dropping despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing. This demographic shift is expected to further cripple home demand, as pronatalist policies have had limited effect due to deep-rooted economic and social issues.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, after experiencing a targeted export ban from China in 2010. Since then, Japan has invested in stockpiling, recycling, and non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths from over 90% to below 60%. Despite these efforts, Japan still has a long way to go in cutting its dependency on China in key areas, especially for heavy rare earth elements. Western auto industry groups have been particularly hard hit by China's export curbs, raising concerns about production outages.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the current trend of online feminist commentary, arguing that it often devolves into puritanical tellings-off rather than meaningful analysis. It references recent criticisms of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae, contrasting them with past feminist debates and the complexities of female desire and power. The author suggests that these online spaces, which could be forums for serious discussion, are instead dictated by sexist algorithms that reward extreme views. The piece advocates for a more nuanced understanding of the intersection of capitalism, kink, and female sexuality, urging against paternalistic judgments and a return to the rich arguments of the past.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is appealing to the House of Lords to support the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would give terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This appeal comes after the bill was backed by MPs in the House of Commons. Critics of the bill, including some in the Lords, express concerns that it could lead to disabled and vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, insists the bill has rigorous safeguards in place and is only for those with six months to live who choose to ask for help.</p>

          <p>Towns and cities in eastern German states are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme provides people with the chance to stay for up to four weeks free of charge. The initiative aims to encourage long-term settlement and address the demographic challenges faced by these regions, including declining birth rates and emigration. Similar projects have been launched in nearby towns, with efforts to create attractive locations and welcoming cultures to incentivize businesses and residents.</p>

The Lions compounded too many errors and weren't able to put the pace on the game that they wanted because of that.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University graduate student, has been released after 104 days in immigration detention in the U.S. A judge ruled that Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, should be released, but the Trump administration is appealing the decision and seeking to deport him over his role in pro-Palestinian protests. The government alleges that Khalil lied on his green card application, which he disputes. Civil rights groups argue that the administration is conflating anti-Semitism with criticism of Israel to silence dissent.</p>

It details Netanyahu's decades-long rhetoric about the Iranian threat and how the recent attacks have been seen as a vindication by his supporters. The piece examines the political motivations behind the conflict, noting that it has temporarily diverted attention from Netanyahu's domestic troubles and increased his popularity among Israelis. However, it also cautions against complacency and the potential for devastating consequences from a "war of cities."</p>
