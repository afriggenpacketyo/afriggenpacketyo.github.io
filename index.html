          <p>The European Union's executive arm has proposed a €2 trillion budget for the next seven years, starting in 2028, marking the largest budget in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP. This plan significantly boosts defense and space investment to €131 billion, a fivefold increase, reflecting Europe's "era of rearmament" amid geopolitical concerns. The budget also allocates 35% to climate and biodiversity projects, streamlines funding access, and seeks new revenue streams, though it still requires unanimous approval from member states and the European Parliament.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold another 225,000 shares, totaling approximately $37 million, as part of a prearranged plan to sell up to 6 million shares. Since beginning sales this year, Huang has offloaded 1.2 million shares worth about $190 million, following over $700 million in sales last year. This comes as Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion due to surging AI demand, propelling Huang's net worth past Warren Buffett. The company also plans to resume H20 chip sales to China after U.S. government approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump reportedly asked House Republicans about firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with many voicing approval, and Trump indicating he might proceed. This move is legally untested, as a Fed chair can only be fired "for cause," and could severely impact financial markets. Trump cited Powell's alleged mismanagement of Fed headquarters renovations and slow interest rate cuts as reasons for his dissatisfaction, despite having appointed Powell initially. The president has publicly criticized Powell, calling him "Mr. Too Late" and a "total stiff."</p>

          <p>NWA 16788, the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, was sold for nearly $5.3 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City. Discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023, the 54-pound meteorite is one of only 400 Martian meteorites identified on Earth, representing about 6.5% of all known Martian material. Sotheby's noted the astronomical unlikelihood of its journey and its significance as a "massive dataset" for unlocking secrets of the red planet.</p>

While investors had largely expected a reduction from the current 4.25%, the inflation rise has introduced caution, with some economists deeming a cut "irresponsible." The Bank will need to justify any rate reduction by looking beyond the current spike to next year's projected drop to the 2% target, amid ongoing questions about the UK's inflation susceptibility and a weakening jobs market.</p>

          <p>An experimental weekly injection, HRS9531, developed by China's Hengrui Pharma and Kailera Therapeutics, demonstrated positive late-stage trial results in China, positioning it as a potential competitor to Eli Lilly's Zepbound. Patients on HRS9531 lost nearly 18% of their body weight on average over 48 weeks, with most adverse events being mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues. While an approval application will be filed in China, global studies are planned, suggesting it will be several years before it reaches markets like the U.S. The article also mentions Anne Wojcicki regaining control of 23andMe after a bankruptcy auction.</p>

          <p>A major review led by Lord David Anderson KC concluded that the UK's Prevent counter-terrorism scheme missed opportunities to intervene in the life of Axel Rudakubana, the Southport killer. Despite teachers referring Rudakubana three times due to his obsession with violence, his case was closed each time because he lacked an identifiable ideological motive. The review recommends Prevent focus more on individuals obsessed with extreme violence, even without clear ideological ties, and enhance online monitoring to identify potential attackers. Rudakubana is serving a life sentence for murdering three girls and injuring others in a knife attack.</p>
