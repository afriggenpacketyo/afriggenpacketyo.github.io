Despite facing increased competition and Walmart's recent shift to a rival service, Affirm's positive results and strong first-quarter guidance have bolstered investor confidence in its market position.

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, the city of Biloxi, Mississippi, is still in a protracted dispute with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) over rebuilding funds. Mayor Andrew Gilich states that FEMA owes the city $34 million for critical sewage and stormwater system upgrades, but the agency has denied requests for increased funding to cover rising costs. This situation highlights a broader issue, with hundreds of other Katrina relief projects across the region remaining incomplete, fueling criticism of FEMA's bureaucratic delays and inefficiency.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether the prestigious Hundred Acre winery in Napa Valley may have played a role in starting the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire. The investigation is reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the blaze, which originated on the winery's property. While the cause is still under official investigation, the fire has threatened hundreds of buildings and wineries in the region, though no structures have been reported destroyed thus far.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its long-standing policy that guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by plus-size travelers, a move that has been called "heartbreaking" by advocates. Under the new rules effective in January, a refund will only be issued if the flight has at least one open seat upon departure, creating financial uncertainty for those who need the accommodation. Critics argue this change, coupled with the airline's shift to assigned seating, reverses years of progress in accessibility and will create new barriers and anxieties for the plus-size community.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis by BBC Verify of new video footage has concluded that Israel struck the Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday. The investigation identified two previously unreported simultaneous blasts in addition to the widely covered "double-tap" strike that hit first responders and journalists. This new evidence contradicts initial reports of two strikes and adds complexity to the incident, which has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about potential violations of international law regarding the protection of medical facilities.</p>

          <p>A group of 40 Rohingya refugees has alleged that Indian authorities deported them to Myanmar by flying them to an island, putting them on a naval vessel, and then forcing them into the Andaman Sea with life jackets. The refugees, who had fled persecution in Myanmar years ago, are now in a war-torn region of the country with an uncertain future. Testimonies gathered by the BBC describe being bound and blindfolded before being "thrown in the sea," an accusation the UN's special rapporteur says is supported by "significant evidence."</p>

          <p>During the deadly mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis, heroic middle school students are being credited with saving lives by shielding younger children from gunfire. According to emergency officials and the school principal, older students instinctively pushed their younger "buddies"—part of a school mentorship program—under the pews and covered them with their own bodies. These acts of bravery meant that many of the older children sustained injuries themselves, including one who took a shotgun blast to the back while protecting another child.</p>

          <p>An angler's discovery of an enormous, 26-kilogram grass carp in Lake Huron has prompted a warning from Canadian officials about the highly invasive species. Although the captured fish was sterile and unable to reproduce, the presence of even a single grass carp is a serious threat to the local ecosystem. These fish can consume up to 40% of their body weight in aquatic vegetation daily, destroying habitats for native species and degrading water quality. Officials are increasing surveillance and urging the public to report any sightings immediately.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 8,000 Americans suggests that Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology may be a net negative for the brand's appeal, with 35% of respondents saying it would make them less likely to buy a Tesla, compared to only 14% who said it would make them more likely. The findings come as Tesla faces a sales slump and reputational challenges, with nearly half of those surveyed believing FSD technology should be illegal.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot legally fire the director of Voice of America (VOA), Michael Abramowitz, without the explicit backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel. The judge stated that Lake's attempt to remove the director was a clear violation of the law designed to insulate the international broadcaster from political pressure. This ruling represents a significant check on the administration's efforts to dismantle VOA and exert greater control over the federally funded news agency, which has already seen its operations drastically reduced.</p>

Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan has surged, with nearly a million visitors in July alone, making China the top source of tourists for Japan. This dynamic underscores the deeply intertwined nature of the two nations, shaped by historical wounds, economic codependence, and cultural affinity.</p>

The article highlights Trump's claim that "I have the right to do anything I want to do," comparing it to the villain's unrestrained ego and the sycophantic behavior of those around him. While acknowledging Trump is not a literal superhero, the commentary argues that his authoritarian posturing should be met with public pushback, legal challenges, and laughter to counter his bullying tactics.</p>
