          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, to demonstrate their commitment to the country amidst its ongoing war with Russia. They pledged to intensify pressure on Russia to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire, and discussed ways to strengthen the Ukrainian military to ensure a lasting peace. The visit came after Russia's celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and amid concerns about the weakening of the trans-Atlantic bond. Ukraine has agreed to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire proposed by the United States, but Russia remains opposed to any ceasefire unless Western nations stop providing military aid to Ukraine.</p>

The rivalry between the two countries stems from a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, with both nations claiming the territory as their own.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is navigating a complex economic landscape with volatile policies and threats to the Fed's goals of full employment and low inflation. President Donald Trump has criticized Powell for not cutting rates, but some economists believe that doing nothing is the right approach given the current uncertainty. Powell has dismissed the idea of a pre-emptive rate cut, citing a 'solid' economy and a labor market 'consistent with maximum employment.' History suggests that Powell may struggle to avoid the 'Too Late' label, as central bank leaders have often been slow to act in the face of economic challenges.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to pass crypto legislation are being threatened by concerns that his personal cryptocurrency ventures have created significant conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to Trump's involvement with meme coins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA. These ventures have added billions to his wealth and raised concerns about pay-for-play schemes. Some investors believe the president's pursuit of personal profits is hindering progress on long-awaited advancements in the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>An order that confined around 160,000 people in Spain's northeastern Catalonia region was lifted after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine.

Fire services monitored the blaze for toxic levels, and reported no casualties. The warehouse owner suggested a lithium battery may have caused the fire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how large corporations are increasingly hiring part-time workers and using just-in-time scheduling to avoid paying benefits and minimize labor costs. This practice results in underwork, where employees are not guaranteed a set number of hours and face inconsistent schedules, making it difficult to earn a decent living. The author suggests that Congress should address this issue by requiring large employers to set schedules in advance and removing incentives for employing people part-time.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) has filed a lawsuit against the German domestic intelligence agency, which labeled the party as "confirmed right-wing extremist."

The AfD claims this as a success, stating that the BfV has effectively "withdrawn" the party's classification. However, the classification "confirmed right-wing extremist" was not withdrawn, and the BfV considers its classification to be correct, only suspending the designation to allow the court time for review.</p>

          <p>For years, Xi Jinping has planned to make the world dependent on China's exports and know-how, directing the state-controlled banking system to lend an extra $2 trillion to industrial borrowers. China has also introduced export controls, antimonopoly laws, and blacklists as weapons of economic warfare. The trade war has validated Xi's warnings about Western hostility and has prompted China to flex its muscles, but the focus on critical technologies and economic self-reliance has worsened frictions with trading partners. This strategy challenges the supremacy of the United States and makes the world choose sides.</p>

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is using a new approach to evaluate rookie talent, focusing on individual drills rather than 11-on-11 periods during minicamp. The goal is to provide a fair way for rookies to compete and showcase their pure talent. Harbaugh is "mining for gold" by teaching two drills that directly apply to the Chargers' scheme and three drills by position. The rookies who pass the minicamp will join veterans during organized team activities, where the Chargers are experimenting with offensive line configurations.</p>

          <p>Since President Trump took office vowing to pull back U.S. support for Ukraine, European leaders have worried that they would be unable to supply Ukraine with the weapons it needs. As the U.S. does less to secure Europe, allies scrambling to arm themselves have less to give to Ukraine. Ukraine’s Parliament approved a deal to give the United States a share of future revenue over natural resources, hoping to keep open the possibility of continued shipments of American arms. Allies fear that Mr. Trump will pull Russian deterrents, like U.S. troops and the American nuclear umbrella, out of Europe.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances. The bill aims to allow research to catch up with the US’s increasing cannabis consumption, enabling policymakers to craft effective legislation. Unlike rescheduling, the EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of schedule I substances. Experts believe the bill has the potential to attract bipartisan support and advance medical research on cannabis and other schedule I substances.</p>
