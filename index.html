          <h2>Israeli Military Escalates Gaza Operations, Calls Up Reservists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 13:32:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Israeli army has initiated a call-up of tens of thousands of reservists to intensify and expand its operations in Gaza, aiming to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and defeat militants. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) plans to operate in new areas and destroy infrastructure both above and below ground, leading to concerns about the safety of hostages and the potential for a war crime. International negotiations have failed to secure a new ceasefire and hostage release deal, and aid agencies report acute shortages of food, water, and medicines due to the ongoing blockade. The expanded offensive raises questions about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's true intentions and the long-term plan for Gaza, as he faces accusations of prolonging the war for political purposes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 13:28:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's moves to enlarge executive power are being justified by his administration through a tradition of right-wing thought that favors monarchical and dictatorial rule. This tradition, influenced by legal theorist Carl Schmitt and philosopher Leo Strauss, critiques liberalism and emphasizes decisive executive action, drawing parallels to historical figures like Adolf Hitler. The Claremont Institute and legal scholar Adrian Vermeule also contribute to this view, advocating for consolidating executive power and reviving medieval political theology. Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, is identified as a key figure connecting Trump to these intellectual precursors, leading to concerns about the potential transformation of the American presidency into a dictatorial office that disregards the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>F1 star Oscar Piastri has dismissed the possibility of a future in IndyCar, stating that his focus remains on Formula One and competing for the world drivers' championship. Piastri cited the high speeds and close proximity of walls in IndyCar as reasons for his lack of interest, emphasizing that F1 has always been his dream. He acknowledged the skill and bravery of IndyCar drivers but expressed a preference for the challenges and environment of F1 racing. Piastri currently leads his McLaren teammate Lando Norris by nine points, with Max Verstappen trailing in third as he aims to continue his success in the F1 circuit.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich has secured its 33rd Bundesliga title, marking a return to dominance after Bayer Leverkusen's historic unbeaten season. Despite initial doubts about Vincent Kompany's appointment as coach, Bayern's strong start and key signings like Harry Kane and Michael Olise proved pivotal. Leverkusen's inability to maintain their previous season's form and Bayern's strength in depth, even amidst injuries, contributed to their success. Kompany's management of player issues and media relations also played a crucial role, setting the stage for continued success and the potential addition of Florian Wirtz to further strengthen the squad.</p>

          <p>The CEOs of NPR and PBS are exploring options to challenge the Trump administration's executive order to cut off public funding, potentially through legal action. NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger emphasize the devastating impact such cuts would have on local stations and their audiences, particularly in rural communities where access to news is already limited. Maher highlights that 20% of Americans lack access to another local source of news, making federal funding essential for journalists covering their local communities. Kerger notes that PBS has faced similar challenges in the past but has never encountered such a comprehensive attack on its funding and operations.</p>

Trump also said he could ask El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, but that the decision ultimately rests with President Nayib Bukele.

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investment icon, is planning to step down as chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era for the $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Buffett's success lies in value investing, focusing on wonderful businesses at fair prices, and turning a failing textile manufacturer into a diverse economic powerhouse. His approach includes acquiring insurers like National Indemnity and Geico, using their float to invest in a vast array of successful businesses and stocks like American Express, Coca-Cola, and Apple. Buffett's influence extends beyond finance, advising corporate executives and government officials, and his departure raises questions about Berkshire's future without its chief architect.</p>

          <p>A missile fired by the Houthi group in Yemen struck near Israel's main airport, Ben Gurion, causing injuries and prompting a temporary suspension of flights. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a response against the Houthis, stating that Israel would retaliate at a time and place of their choosing, also implicating Iran as the source of the attacks. Several major airlines, including Lufthansa and Air France, cancelled flights to and from the airport, and the Israeli Air Force is investigating the failure to intercept the missile. The Houthis have regularly launched missile attacks at Israel in solidarity with Hamas, but successful strikes are rare due to Israel's air defenses.</p>

          <p>A psychologist studying couples has identified the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as a major relationship killer. This phrase, often used during arguments, conveys a message of inadequacy and can lead to irreparable insecurity issues. The underlying problem is often a fear of openly communicating needs, leading to suppressed frustrations that eventually erupt in comparisons. The psychologist recommends direct communication and creating a safe environment for partners to express their needs without shame or comparison, ultimately strengthening the relationship.</p>

          <p>Refitting underused single-family homes into multifamily units, such as ‚Äúroommate houses‚Äù or backyard cottages, presents a potential solution to America‚Äôs affordable housing crisis. With a shortage of millions of homes and increasing construction costs, developers and policymakers are exploring ways to repurpose existing housing stock. States like California have seen success with accessory dwelling units (ADUs), offering homeowners the opportunity to add rental units to their properties. This approach allows for increased housing density in existing neighborhoods without significant disruption, catering to changing household compositions and addressing the growing need for affordable housing options.</p>

The United States must approve the transfer, given the sensitive nature of the equipment, and the decision follows a recent meeting between Presidents Trump and Zelenskyy, signaling a potential shift in U.S. policy towards Ukraine.</p>

The incident marks a major security breach and raises questions about the effectiveness of Israel's missile defense system, while Lufthansa and other airlines suspended flights to Tel Aviv.
