          <p>Following the announcement of new tariffs by the Trump administration, a price tracker highlights the rising costs of goods for American consumers, particularly groceries and vehicles. A significant portion of commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from countries facing these new duties, and experts predict the costs will be passed on to shoppers. The article also notes that the expense of owning a vehicle has already risen sharply due to supply-chain issues and inflation. These new tariffs on imported vehicles and parts are expected to further increase prices for purchasing, repairing, and insuring cars and trucks. (not investment advice)</p>

The companies aim to deploy thousands of driverless vehicles across the continent in the subsequent years, pending regulatory approval. This move follows Lyft's recent acquisition of the European ride-hailing service FreeNow, providing a platform for the new venture. For Baidu, this marks a significant international expansion, while for Lyft, it offers a competitive edge against rivals like Uber in the European market.</p>

          <p>A heated confrontation erupted between American sprinters Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek following the 200-meter final at the U.S. track championships.

Bednarek later criticized Lyles for what he described as unsportsmanlike conduct, vowing to win their next matchup at the upcoming world championships. The incident adds a dramatic new chapter to their rivalry, which has been building over several high-stakes competitions, and brings a surge of energy to the sport.</p>

          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), a UK trade body, has labeled the financial regulator's proposed compensation scheme for mis-sold car finance as "completely impractical." The primary concern is the plan's retroactive scope, which could cover loans dating back to 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may lack adequate records. While a Supreme Court ruling limited the scope of payouts, millions of drivers might still be eligible for compensation over hidden commissions. The industry warns that the significant costs of the redress scheme, estimated to be between £9 billion and £18 billion, could ultimately lead to more expensive borrowing for consumers.

          <p>A tense standoff occurred between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese coastguard vessels near the disputed Dongsha Island. Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration reported that it detected a mainland ship heading toward the island, which is administered by Taiwan but claimed by Beijing. After the Chinese vessel ignored repeated radio warnings and entered Taiwanese waters, Taiwan dispatched a patrol ship to shadow it. At one point, the two ships were separated by only one nautical mile before the mainland vessel eventually changed course and withdrew, ending the close-quarters encounter after several hours.</p>

          <p>A national survey of American children aged 8 to 12 reveals that despite spending significant time online, their preferred way to socialize is through unstructured, in-person play. The research suggests that the rise of the "phone-based childhood" is not just due to addictive technology, but also a lack of real-world freedom. Many children reported not being allowed to play unsupervised, even in their own yards, pushing them toward digital spaces as their only escape from adult supervision. The article argues that to get kids off their phones, parents and communities must restore opportunities for independence and free play.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense, under Secretary Pete Hegseth, has implemented a new policy requiring the vetting of all event attendance by defense officials, leading to a more isolationist stance. The move was highlighted when top military officers were abruptly barred from the Aspen Security Forum, an event the Pentagon's spokesperson criticized for promoting "globalism." This policy shift, along with the elimination of the strategic Office of Net Assessment, is seen by critics as an attempt to shield the military from outside ideas and viewpoints with which the administration disagrees. This could risk fostering groupthink and undermining the strategic thinking that such engagements have historically provided.</p>

          <p>The global fur industry has seen a staggering decline, with the number of animals farmed for fur plummeting from over 140 million in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This transformation reflects a major shift in public perception, turning fur from a luxury status symbol into an ethical misstep. The article attributes this success to sustained animal welfare campaigns that pressured major fashion brands to go fur-free and persuaded numerous countries to ban fur production. The trend was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the risks of mink farming, as well as changing economic and political conditions in key markets like China and Russia.</p>

          <p>A UK Home Office minister has confirmed that migrants arriving on small boats will be allowed to keep their mobile phones. This clarification comes as new legislation, the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, is being debated. The bill aims to grant authorities new powers to seize devices from those suspected of being people smugglers, but the minister, Dame Angela Eagle, stated the government does not intend to apply a blanket policy to every arrival. This approach follows a High Court ruling that found the previous blanket seizure of phones from all small boat arrivals was unlawful.</p>
