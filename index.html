          <p>Pakistan reported that India launched missiles at three of its air bases, prompting retaliatory strikes on Indian air bases and a missile storage facility. The Pakistani military stated they used medium-range Fateh missiles to target Indian assets, while India claimed to have destroyed multiple Pakistani drones. This exchange marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the two nuclear-armed rivals, triggered by a recent attack in India-controlled Kashmir. The Group of Seven nations have urged restraint from both sides, warning of a serious threat to regional stability.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for critical trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war. The meetings, the first since increased tariffs were imposed by both countries, sought to address the economic impact of the levies, which have disrupted global supply chains and increased consumer costs. While expectations for a major breakthrough were low, the fact that discussions were taking place raised hopes for a potential reduction in tariffs and a more stable economic relationship. Trump suggested lowering tariffs to 80 percent, but the Chinese government insists it will not make trade concessions in response to tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is facing scrutiny over proposed job cuts as part of the Trump administration's DOGE initiative, with concerns raised about the potential impact on veteran healthcare. While VA Secretary Doug Collins insists that frontline healthcare will not be affected, data indicates that a significant number of nurses and medical support staff have applied for deferred resignation. Critics argue that reducing the VA workforce will exacerbate existing shortages of medical providers and compromise the quality of care for veterans.

The judge also blocked further orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff, remaining in effect for at least 14 days while the case is considered.</p>

          <h2>House Republicans Propose Tax Cuts Primarily Benefiting the Wealthy</h2>

          <p>House Republicans unveiled the first components of a $4 trillion tax cut package, which would make key provisions of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing additional temporary tax breaks. The legislation aims to lock in the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates established in 2017. Democrats have criticized the plan, arguing that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy while cutting spending on programs for the poor. The bill faces a challenging path to passage, given Democratic opposition and divisions within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>President Trump terminated Carla Hayden, the Librarian of Congress, a move criticized by Democratic leaders as an attempt to undermine American history. Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was notified via email. Democratic leaders condemned the decision, calling for the position to be appointed by a congressional commission rather than the president. The sudden firing has sparked concerns about the future of the Library of Congress and its role in preserving American culture.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to pay Hawaii $700 million to settle a lawsuit concerning the efficacy and safety of the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement follows a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi subsidiaries to pay $916 million, though neither company admitted wrongdoing. The state argued that the companies failed to update labels despite knowing that a significant portion of patients might have a diminished response to the drug. Hawaii's Governor hailed the settlement as a major victory for the state.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ordered her release on bail. The judge cited "very substantial" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when her student visa was revoked. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her visa in March, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas. The case has raised concerns about the targeting of international students for their political views.</p>

The White House has since clarified that "no final decision" has been made and that they're "exploring all options" for revitalising the US film industry.

          <p>The Trump administration is "actively looking at" suspending habeas corpus, the right of a person to challenge their detention in court, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller justified the potential suspension of habeas corpus by arguing the United States is currently facing a national security threat by undocumented migrants "invading" the United States. Legal experts say the issue is not as cut and dried as Miller suggests, and that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress.</p>

The series also highlights that lobbying by UK and US-based family groups resulted in "key reforms, from strengthening travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening, to people-centred responses to major disasters".</p>

Mutual trust between the two sides has significantly declined. Once trust is lost, financial relations are particularly vulnerable, as finance relies heavily on commitments across time. Without trust, there can be no sustainable finance. The threat of delisting from US exchanges looms large on nearly 300 Chinese firms.</p>

A high school student from this spring, the youngster has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata from judges and coaches inside Japan. Nishino landed a quad toe loop for the first time in a competition, albeit slightly under-rotating. He has grown nearly 10 centimeters over the past year to stand just over 160 cm, according to coach Misao Sato, and the rapid growth forced him to quickly progress to bigger boots and blades.</p>
