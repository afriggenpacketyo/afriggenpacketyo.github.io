          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $9 billion spending reduction package targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting funds. The vote occurred after a significant delay caused by a contentious partisan debate over Democratic demands for the release of Justice Department files related to financier Jeffrey Epstein. Republicans ultimately advanced the bill, which was a key request from the Trump administration, by combining it with a procedural vote to expedite its passage before a critical deadline.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as a form of "unacceptable blackmail." The proposed tariffs are linked to U.S. pressure for Brazil to drop legal charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial over an alleged coup attempt. Lula asserted that any attempt to interfere in Brazil's judicial system constitutes a grave attack on its national sovereignty and characterized Brazilian politicians supporting Trump's stance as traitors.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local and national attention by successfully building and operating a homemade 7-meter submarine. Inspired by a television program and a lifelong fascination with invention, he secretly constructed the vessel using just 5,000 yuan (US$700) for materials like steel plates, a battery, and an engine. His creation, which he now pilots on a local river, represents a personal dream fulfilled against the odds of his rural life.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that it will conclude its top-rated late-night program, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," in May of next year when the host's contract expires. The network stated the cancellation is a financial decision, unrelated to the show's content or other matters at its parent company, Paramount. However, the announcement has sparked widespread speculation and criticism, as it closely follows a controversial $16 million settlement paid by Paramount to Donald Trump, a frequent target of Colbert's comedy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna clarified that while his department does not honor civil immigration detainers, it has "no choice" but to comply with federal judicial warrants seeking the transfer of inmates to ICE. Speaking amid heightened community fears over immigration raids, Luna stressed that these warrants are for individuals with probable cause for significant crimes and are distinct from street-level enforcement operations, in which his department does not participate. The clarification aims to navigate the complex intersection of federal law and local sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>This analysis piece posits that President Trump's announcement about Coca-Cola switching to cane sugar is a calculated political maneuver designed to score an easy victory with his base. The article argues that the change is more symbolic than substantive, as health experts note there is little to no metabolic difference between high-fructose corn syrup and cane sugar. The move is framed as part of a pattern of headline-grabbing actions that align with the "Make America healthy again" movement but have minimal real-world health impact.</p>

The crackdown has forced many undocumented residents into hiding, causing them to miss work and school, while businesses have shuttered and community events have been canceled. The aggressive enforcement has created a landscape of fear and triggered a fierce backlash from activists and local leaders, who accuse the Trump administration of terrorizing communities and weaponizing federal agencies against Californians.</p>

          <p>A precious ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey, where scientists will melt it to study Earth's ancient climate. By analyzing materials like dust, ash, and algae trapped within the planet's oldest ice, researchers hope to unlock vital information about a previously unknown period of climate history. This ambitious project could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current warming.</p>
