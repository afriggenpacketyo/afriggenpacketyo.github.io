          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring the iconic "blue screen of death" (BSOD), a fixture of the Windows operating system since the 1990s. The error screen, which appears during unexpected system crashes, will be replaced by a black version in the upcoming Windows 11 24H2 update. This change is part of a broader effort to streamline the restart experience, reduce downtime, and align the user interface with the modern Windows 11 design. The company aims to make recovering from system failures a faster and less disruptive process for users.</p>

          <p>Apple has revised its App Store policies in Europe, introducing a complex new system of fees in an effort to comply with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and avoid a potential 500 million euro fine. The changes include a new "core technology commission" and other fees, which some developers argue violate the spirit of the regulation by making alternative payment systems commercially unviable. While Apple stated it was forced to make the changes and believes its new plan is compliant, the European Commission is still assessing the new terms and has not confirmed that the fine will be avoided. Critics like Spotify and Epic Games have accused Apple of malicious compliance.</p>

          <p>During a contentious Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Senator Jeff Merkley accused Trump administration OMB Director Russell Vought of responsibility for the deaths of children due to foreign aid budget cuts. Merkley cited a study claiming the cuts led to a quarter-million child deaths, a charge Vought rejected, stating administrations have the right to review and change spending priorities. The hearing was marked by frustration from both Democratic and some Republican senators, including Mitch McConnell and Lisa Murkowski, who argued the cuts undermine U.S. interests and create vacuums for adversaries like China to fill.</p>

          <p>The victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary has intensified the debate within the Democratic Party over its future direction. Mamdani, a 33-year-old assembly member, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo with a progressive platform focused on affordability, including free child care and rent freezes. His win highlights a generational and ideological rift in the party, pitting a younger, more progressive wing against established moderates. While celebrated by some, his victory has drawn criticism from moderate Democrats and conservatives, who label his agenda as extreme and unachievable.</p>

          <p>Signs installed in U.S. national parks, prompted by a Trump executive order to remove content that "inappropriately disparages Americans," have elicited critical and unsupportive feedback from visitors. The signs ask the public to report any "negative" information about past or living Americans. However, a review of submitted comments shows visitors largely rejecting the premise, with many arguing for the importance of telling the complete, and sometimes difficult, history of the nation to avoid repeating past mistakes. The Department of the Interior stated the effort is to ensure an accurate portrayal of American history, but critics worry about the potential for biased or inaccurate feedback.</p>

          <p>A black bear with a history of breaking into homes was euthanized by California wildlife officials after it attacked a camper near Lake Tahoe's Emerald Bay. The woman was injured when the bear forced its way into her trailer; it was later reported harassing other campers. Officials deemed the bear a public safety risk after multiple failed attempts to haze it away from populated areas, including an incident where it broke into a car with a child inside. The bear's two cubs were captured and sent to a rehabilitation facility with the hope of eventually returning them to the wild.</p>

          <p>Representative Kat Cammack of Florida announced that her district offices were evacuated following "imminent death threats" against her and her family.

Cammack has blamed "pro-abortion activists" for the threats, which are now under investigation by law enforcement.

This structural change aligns the U.S. publication with other international Vogue editions and allows Wintour to focus more on her global and corporate responsibilities while still overseeing the brand.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive taxation and spending package central to Donald Trump's agenda, dubbed the "one big beautiful bill act," is now under consideration in the U.S. Senate after passing the House. The legislation faces a challenging path, as Republicans hold only a narrow majority in the Senate and will likely seek to make significant changes to the more than 1,000-page bill. While President Trump has expressed a desire to sign the legislation by July 4th, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans can reconcile their differences and meet that ambitious deadline. The bill encapsulates Trump's key fiscal priorities.</p>

          <p>An in-depth article from The Atlantic examines the precarious position of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard within the Trump administration, particularly concerning Iran policy. Initially an advocate for non-intervention, Gabbard has reportedly shifted her public statements on Iran's nuclear capabilities to align with President Trump's more hawkish stance, undermining her credibility with career intelligence officers. Despite her efforts to conform, her influence appears to have waned, with insiders describing her as a "nonplayer" in key foreign policy decisions. The piece suggests she is struggling to reconcile her anti-war principles with the political realities of serving a president she often disagrees with.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers considering where to deposit a significant sum like $10,000, weighing the benefits of short-term CDs against high-yield savings accounts. With current interest rates, 3-month and 6-month CDs offer slightly higher returns than a high-yield savings account, while a 9-month CD earns slightly less. Because the earnings are so similar, the decision depends on an individual's outlook on future interest rate movements and their need for liquidity. Locking in a CD rate can be advantageous if rates are expected to fall, whereas a savings account offers flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

The court upheld a lower court's decision holding artistic producer Luis de Llano civilly liable for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol when she was 14 and he was 39. Crucially, the ruling determined that statutes of limitations do not apply in such cases, opening a path for other victims to seek justice regardless of how much time has passed.

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study concludes that Donald Trump would still have won the 2024 presidential election, and by a wider margin, even if every eligible American had voted. The survey found that non-voters in 2024 preferred Trump over Kamala Harris, a significant shift from 2020 and 2016 when non-voters favored the Democratic candidate. This finding challenges the long-held political assumption that higher turnout universally benefits Democrats. The study also highlights a demographic shift, with Trump's 2024 coalition becoming younger and more ethnically diverse compared to his 2016 base.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat events become more common, transportation infrastructure faces significant challenges. According to Mikhail Chester, an engineering professor at Arizona State University, high temperatures can cause materials like asphalt and steel to expand and degrade, leading to buckling roads, warped railway tracks, and stressed bridges. This creates safety risks and necessitates costly repairs and operational adjustments, such as slowing down trains to prevent derailments. The interview highlights the urgent need for infrastructure to be redesigned and retrofitted with more resilient materials and strategies to withstand the increasing stress from climate change.</p>

          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers have been dismissed for gross misconduct over the "humiliating" strip-search of a 15-year-old Black schoolgirl, known as Child Q, in 2020. A disciplinary panel found the officers' actions were unjustified and disproportionate after they searched the girl at her school on suspicion of cannabis possession while she was on her period and without an appropriate adult present. While the panel noted that Black children are often treated as less vulnerable, it did not find race to be a direct factor in this case. The incident sparked widespread protests and has been described by the police as a "catalyst for change" in their procedures.</p>

          <p>Top officials in the Trump administration are engaged in a full-court press to defend the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, countering a preliminary intelligence assessment that suggested limited success. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held a defiant press conference, calling the operation an "historically successful attack" and dismissing the leaked report as politically motivated. Both the CIA Director and the Director of National Intelligence issued statements supporting President Trump's claims of severe damage to Iran's program. However, questions remain about how far the strikes set back Iran's capabilities and whether nuclear material was moved beforehand.</p>

          <p>A newly appointed U.S. vaccine advisory committee, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted to recommend that flu vaccines for all age groups should not contain the preservative thimerosal. This decision was made despite a lack of scientific evidence linking thimerosal to harm and its near-total removal from childhood vaccines years ago as a precaution. The move has been criticized by prominent medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, who argue it is an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in immunizations and could effectively ban the preservative, which is still used in some multi-dose vials globally.</p>

A paper from Apple researchers, titled "The Illusion of Thinking," found that these models fail on problems beyond a certain complexity and may not be developing generalizable problem-solving skills, instead just memorizing patterns. This concept of "jagged intelligence" has also been noted by researchers at Salesforce and Anthropic, indicating a significant gap between current AI capabilities and real-world demands.

          <p>Kenyan running great Faith Kipyegon narrowly missed her goal of becoming the first woman to run a mile in under four minutes. At a special event in Paris, the three-time Olympic champion clocked a time of 4:06.42, which is faster than her own official world record but will not be recognized due to assistance from pacemakers and advanced technology. Despite falling short of the historic barrier, Kipyegon ran the fastest mile ever by a woman and expressed that she has proven the feat is possible. She remains hopeful that she or another athlete will achieve the sub-four-minute milestone in the future.</p>

          <p>A high school in Maine is implementing an innovative approach to discipline by giving students who receive detention the option to go on a hike instead. The program aims to provide a more constructive and positive alternative to sitting in a classroom for punishment. By offering a choice to engage in physical activity in nature, the school hopes to foster better student well-being and reflection. This unique initiative represents a shift from traditional punitive measures towards more restorative and engaging methods of student discipline, focusing on connection and outdoor experience rather than isolation.</p>
