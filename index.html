          <p>Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Chicago Bulls and White Sox, will be deposed in a lawsuit related to a shooting at a White Sox game in August 2023. A 42-year-old woman was shot in the leg during the game, leading to the lawsuit accusing the team of negligence. The shooting's circumstances remain mysterious, as weapons are prohibited in the stadium, and fans undergo metal detector checks. The game continued despite the incident, and the White Sox lost to the Athletics. The author's tone is neutral, reflecting the details of the legal proceedings and the event itself.</p>

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed without prejudice in the case of his wife, Suzanne Morphew's disappearance, just before his trial was set to begin. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to finding Suzanne's body as reasons for the dismissal. The defense argued that the case should be dismissed with prejudice, preventing future charges, emphasizing the lack of physical evidence linking Barry to the alleged crime. The case has been marked by bizarre twists, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and mystery DNA, with Suzanne's body still missing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, while President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" with the school. The judge's injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the federal database for student visa applications. This ruling follows earlier actions by the administration, including attempts to revoke Harvard's student visa certification and bar most international students from entering the U.S., citing concerns about campus antisemitism. The legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where international students comprise a substantial portion of the student body.</p>

          <p>Rhode Island's state House passed a bill to ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, often referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to the governor, who supports such bans, and if signed, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. The bill applies only to sales and manufacturing, not possession, and aims to prevent residents from purchasing assault weapons in other states. Critics argue the ban won't curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after being detained for over three months, with a judge ruling he isn't a flight risk or threat. The Trump administration labeled Khalil a national security threat due to his pro-Palestinian activism and sought his deportation. Khalil criticized the administration for targeting him and expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son, born during his detention. The White House maintains Khalil engaged in "fraud and misrepresentation" and plans to appeal his release.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted that he might consider firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. Trump has been a vocal critic of Powell, whom he appointed, for the Fed's interest rate policies. The legality of firing Powell before his term ends in 2026 is unclear, with legal precedents suggesting he can only be fired "for cause." Trump's criticism stems from the Fed's decision to keep interest rates steady, balancing the need to control inflation with the desire to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A retired University of Alberta professor, Jutta Hinrichs, was killed in a rockfall in Banff National Park, while three others were injured. The incident occurred on the Bow Glacier Falls hiking trail, and rescue efforts have been called off after accounting for everyone in the area. The University of Alberta described Hinrichs as a "dedicated leader and educator." Officials said the rockfall was an "extremely rare event" that was "neither predictable nor preventable."</p>
