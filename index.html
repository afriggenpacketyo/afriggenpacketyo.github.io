          <p>Amazon is developing a new generative AI initiative, codenamed "Starfish," to create comprehensive and accurate product information for its online marketplace. The system is designed to crawl and scrape data from across the web to automatically generate detailed listings, including titles, descriptions, and images. This project aims to improve the shopping experience, save time for sellers, and is projected to boost Amazon's sales significantly. The initiative represents a major step in automating e-commerce and positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tragic incident on the Deschutes River in Oregon has resulted in one person's death and two others missing after being swept over Dillon Falls. The group of six people went over the 15-foot waterfall, which is known for its churning rapids. The Deschutes County Sheriff's Office reported that three other individuals from the group were rescued and taken to the hospital. Search efforts for the two missing people were paused overnight and are set to resume, as emergency responders continue to investigate the accident.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project that his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was held amid public frustration over rising prices and the looming threat of U.S. tariffs. A loss of the majority would weaken the coalition's legislative power and could destabilize the government during a critical period of trade negotiations. The result reflects voter dissatisfaction with Ishiba's leadership as Japan faces significant economic challenges.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebellion have signed a peace declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and direct negotiations. The agreement, mediated by Qatar, calls for the restoration of state authority in rebel-held areas and sets a timeline for a comprehensive peace deal by early August. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the challenges of implementation and immediate disagreements over rebel withdrawal. Past peace agreements in the region have often failed, raising doubts about whether this attempt will achieve lasting stability.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharge incidents from water companies in half by the year 2030. The commitment comes amid public outrage over the state of Britain's waterways and data showing a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024. The government has set this clear target for the first time, with the secretary stating he should be judged on the results at the next election. The plan is part of a broader effort to reform the water sector, which faces scrutiny over executive bonuses and rising consumer bills.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to spend a family holiday in the Cotswolds region of England next month. The trip comes despite Vance's previous critical comments about the UK and European governments, including a claim that London was "not English any more." His choice of the picturesque and affluent English countryside for a vacation has drawn some notice. The visit is scheduled to follow President Donald Trump's own stay in Scotland, a country where Vance has also directed criticism at the government.</p>

          <p>While companies rarely cite artificial intelligence directly as a reason for job cuts, employment experts suspect AI's role in recent layoffs is larger than acknowledged. Firms often use terms like "restructuring" or "optimization" to describe workforce reductions that coincide with the adoption of new AI technologies. This strategic silence helps companies avoid public and employee backlash while they transition to more automated processes. Experts note that roles in customer service, content, and HR are particularly affected, though the full impact of AI on the labor market is still unfolding.</p>
