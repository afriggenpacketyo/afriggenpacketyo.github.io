          <p>The Trump administration has formally accepted a Boeing 747 jet gifted by the government of Qatar, according to the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth accepted the luxury plane following federal rules and regulations, and the Department of Defense will work to ensure the jet fulfills proper security measures and functional-mission requirements, as President Trump intends to use it as the new Air Force One. This acceptance follows previous discussions about the potential use of the gifted jet, with the administration now moving forward with integrating it into the presidential fleet.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan bill that would provide a tax break on tip income, with both President Trump and Vice President Harris previously expressing support for such a measure during appearances in Nevada. If enacted, workers could deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, though tips must be reported to qualify for the deduction. While the bill could benefit moderate to middle-income workers in tipped occupations, such as those in restaurants, hotels, and courier services, it may not significantly benefit part-time employees or the lowest income workers. Potential issues could arise, such as the introduction of tips in new occupations or misclassification of income as tips.</p>

          <p>Former CIA chief of disguise, Jonna Mendez, confirms that the mask technology used in "Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning" has real-world parallels. Mendez stated that the CIA developed realistic masks capable of changing an agent's gender and ethnicity, which she personally demonstrated to high-ranking officials. The masks were remarkably realistic and could be applied quickly, even in challenging conditions. While Mendez was more circumspect about self-destructing messages, she affirmed that the idea of quick-change masks was a very real and effective espionage tool.</p>

          <p>Republicans are pushing for a House vote on a comprehensive domestic policy bill to enact President Trump's agenda, which includes tax cuts, increased military spending, and cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. The bill faces internal divisions over Medicaid cuts and tax plan details, requiring negotiations to secure enough votes for passage. The legislation is being advanced through budget reconciliation, allowing Republicans to bypass a filibuster, but they can only afford to lose a few Republican votes. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cause millions to become uninsured while reducing federal spending on healthcare.</p>
