          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist, was released from ICE custody in Louisiana following a judge's order, after being detained for over three months. Khalil expressed gratitude and concern for those still detained, criticizing the Trump administration's policies. The Department of Homeland Security condemned the judge's decision, asserting that an immigration judge had denied Khalil's request for asylum and ordered his continued detention. Khalil's attorney argued that his detention was retaliation for his protected speech and viewpoint, emphasizing his role in Columbia's encampment protests against the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration laid off 639 employees at Voice of America (VoA) and its parent organization, the United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM). Kari Lake, a Trump ally and senior advisor to the USAGM, described the cuts as part of an effort to dismantle a bloated bureaucracy. Since March, approximately 1,400 people have been terminated from VoA and USAGM, with many staff members having been on administrative leave amid legal proceedings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "Total and Complete Moron" for maintaining steady interest rates, and suggested he might fire him. Trump has repeatedly urged Powell to lower interest rates more rapidly, though it's unclear if he has the legal authority to do so before Powell's term ends in 2026. The President's criticism stems from concerns that high interest rates could slow economic growth, but Powell has cautioned that lowering rates too quickly could cause inflation to spike again. Trump has previously attacked Powell's policies but praised him for slashing rates during the 2020 pandemic.</p>

The slow-paced nature of the game appeals to many, especially children, who enjoy the patience and competitive elements.

          <p>As summer approaches, the question of whether shorts are appropriate in the office remains a contentious topic. While some companies have relaxed dress codes, allowing employees to dress comfortably, wearing shorts is still a "grey area." Stylists suggest that context is key, and shorts may not be suitable for client-facing roles. Companies like Accenture and British American Tobacco expect staff to dress professionally but comfortably, while Santander advises against beachwear. The type of shorts also matters, with tailored shorts generally being more acceptable than beach, sports, or denim shorts.</p>

          <p>Diplomatic efforts are underway to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict within a two-week window set by President Trump, who is deciding whether to involve the U.S. in Israel's offensive. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European foreign ministers in Geneva, with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot noting that the Iranian nuclear program cannot be solved by military means alone. The U.S. has offered Iran a civilian nuclear program if it agrees not to enrich uranium, but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not yet responded to overtures. The U.S. intelligence assessment remains that Khamenei has not ordered the resumption of the nuclear weapons program.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering top national security officials who discussed military operations on Signal to notify the acting archivist of the United States of any messages at risk of deletion. However, the judge declined to order the government to recover past messages that may have already been lost. The lawsuit was brought by American Oversight, a government watchdog, after officials discussed a planned U.S. military attack against Houthi rebels in Yemen on Signal, which allows messages to be automatically deleted. The judge granted a partial victory by requiring officials to preserve messages that have not been erased.</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy books are experiencing a surge in popularity, with UK fiction revenue surpassing £1bn for the first time. Romantasy, a blend of romance and fantasy, has gained a cult following on TikTok, driven by tropes like "enemies to lovers" and a focus on female pleasure. The romance genre is becoming more commercially viable, with young women making up a significant portion of purchases. Despite this growth, some believe sexism keeps the genre from the mainstream, and critical appraisal remains lacking.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to center around President Trump's demand for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to give Trump a win by securing commitments to increase defense spending. The summit will be shorter than usual, reportedly due to Trump's preferences, and discussions will be limited to avoid divisions. While some European nations are already boosting their defense spending, many will struggle to meet the new target, and there are concerns about creative accounting to meet the requirements.</p>
