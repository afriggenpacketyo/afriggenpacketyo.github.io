          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to terminate visas for hundreds of foreign students, a move that had caused widespread panic and confusion among international students and universities. This reversal comes after more than 100 lawsuits were filed by students who had their legal status abruptly revoked, many of whom had participated in political protests. The Justice Department stated that it is restoring records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), while maintaining the authority to terminate records for other reasons. The initial policy and subsequent reversal highlight the administration's stance on immigration and political dissent.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are urgently requesting exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, citing the disproportionate impact on their operations due to thin margins and limited resources. Senator Ed Markey has criticized the tariffs as recklessly imposed and called for the White House to protect small businesses, noting that corporate giants have already been shielded from some trade policy impacts. Small business owners express concerns that the tariffs could force them to abandon orders and jeopardize their livelihoods. The tariffs, imposed on Chinese imports and other trading partners, are causing significant challenges for businesses lacking the financial cushion to absorb price shocks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California regulators have proposed new rules to permit the testing of self-driving heavy-duty trucks on public roads, potentially opening the state to autonomous vehicle technology already being tested in other states. The proposal, subject to a public comment period, is expected to face opposition from safety advocates and labor unions concerned about job displacement for commercial truck drivers. Governor Newsom previously vetoed a bill requiring human drivers in self-driving semi-trailer trucks, arguing existing laws were sufficient. The proposed regulations aim to enhance data reporting requirements and grant the DMV greater enforcement authority, while addressing safety concerns highlighted by past incidents involving autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claims to have saved $160 billion, but an analysis suggests its efforts have cost taxpayers $135 billion this fiscal year. The Partnership for Public Service (PSP) estimates costs associated with paid leave, rehiring mistakenly fired workers, and lost productivity. The analysis excludes legal expenses and lost tax revenue due to IRS staff cuts. While DOGE aims for a leaner federal workforce, critics argue that the cuts may have unintended negative consequences on the economy and essential services. The White House disputes the analysis, defending DOGE's work.</p>

          <p>The CBS newsmagazine "60 Minutes" faces an unprecedented crisis following the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited corporate interference related to Paramount Global's pending merger with Skydance Media. President Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against CBS over a 2024 interview with Kamala Harris adds further pressure. Concerns arise that Paramount Global may settle the lawsuit to appease Trump, potentially compromising the program's journalistic independence. Despite these challenges, the staff remains committed to upholding the program's hard-hitting reporting, though uncertainty over corporate support could impact their ability to aggressively cover the Trump White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of MercadoLibre, Marcos Galperin, believes that Latin America could benefit significantly from the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China. He suggests that Latin American firms, particularly in Mexico, stand to gain as American companies relocate manufacturing operations from China. Mexico's free trade agreement with the U.S. exempts some imports from Trump's tariffs. This perspective highlights the potential for shifting global trade dynamics to create new opportunities for Latin American economies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to address the declining U.S. birth rate, which has implications for the nation's long-term economic outlook. While President Trump expressed support for the idea, its implementation remains uncertain. Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried financial incentives with limited success. Experts suggest that addressing long-standing economic issues, such as affordable day care and paid parental leave, may be more effective in creating a family-friendly environment. A declining birth rate can lead to a shrinking labor force and strain on social security systems.</p>

          <p>Mark Allen made a 147 maximum break at the Crucible during his World Championship second-round match against Chris Wakelin, becoming only the 11th player to achieve this feat at the venue. Despite Allen's "incredible" break, Wakelin ultimately won the match 13-6. Wakelin, who had previously defeated former world champion Neil Robertson, expressed confidence in his game. Allen's maximum break was the 15th at the Crucible and the first since Mark Selby's clearance in the 2023 final.</p>
