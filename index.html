          <h2>Oil Prices Surge Following Trump's Threat to Iran</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 13:59:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase of over 3% after President Trump issued a stern warning to Iran's leader, demanding unconditional surrender. The rise in prices reflects concerns about escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel. Trump's remarks included a threat to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating that U.S. patience was wearing thin, and he called for the evacuation of Tehran, raising fears of potential military action. This development follows reports of Iran seeking a ceasefire with Israel, which now appears less likely given Trump's tougher stance. Optimism for market stability is tempered by geopolitical uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have proposed a tax break for tipped workers as part of a broader tax cut package, similar to a House GOP provision, both aiming to fulfill President Trump's campaign pledge. The Senate measure caps the tax deduction at $25,000 per year, unlike the uncapped House bill, and has different income limits for eligibility. While the concept has bipartisan appeal, tax experts suggest the tax break would only benefit a small percentage of workers. The Senate bill would gradually reduce the value of the tax deduction once an individual's income exceeds $150,000, or $300,000 for married couples (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tensions have emerged between Tucker Carlson and President Trump over the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, highlighting a divide within the Republican Party. Carlson, a prominent voice on the right, has been urging the U.S. to stay out of the conflict, while Trump has taken a more hawkish stance. Trump criticized Carlson's position, signaling a potential shift away from the "America First" foreign policy approach. This disagreement underscores the broader debate within the GOP regarding U.S. involvement in foreign entanglements.</p>

          <p>After decades of research, Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour has been confirmed to be in waters off Rhode Island. Two historians originally pinpointed the location of the ship in 1998, and a 26-year archival and archaeological research program ultimately confirmed that the Endeavour was at the bottom of Newport Harbor. After Cook's death, the ship was used for transporting British troops and detaining prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in 1778.</p>
