          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. projects a significant decline in operating profit for the fiscal year, citing a stronger yen and an estimated $1.3 billion hit from President Trump's tariffs. The company's chief executive, Koji Sato, acknowledged the extreme flux in the auto industry's trade relations, making it difficult to forecast future impacts. The tariffs, including a 25 percent levy on vehicle imports and auto parts, are already impacting Toyota's bottom line. This situation highlights the challenges Japan faces in trade negotiations with the U.S., where auto tariffs are a major sticking point, impacting Japan's top export industry.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalate between India and Pakistan, a comparison of their military capabilities reveals a significant disparity in resources. India possesses a larger military with approximately 1.5 million active service personnel and a defense budget of Â£58 billion in 2024. Pakistan, facing economic challenges, has a smaller military of about 660,000 active personnel and a significantly lower defense budget. While Pakistan can compete in limited exchanges, India's numerical and economic superiority could prove decisive in a full-blown war, although both countries possess nuclear weapons, raising the stakes significantly.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion of imposing 100 percent tariffs on films made in 'foreign lands' has sparked concern in Britain's film industry, which relies heavily on Hollywood productions. The industry is still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, and fears that tariffs could wipe out recent progress. British officials are in discussions with the U.S. administration, while trade experts question the enforceability of film tariffs and suggest potential increases in American tax breaks as an alternative.</p>

The operation, targeting Hamas and Islamic Jihad, has involved demolishing homes and expanding roads, undermining the Palestinian Authority's control. Some Palestinians fear a second 'nakba,' while Israeli officials maintain the actions are necessary to restore security.

          <p>An avatar of the late author Agatha Christie will teach an online writing course, prompting debate about the ethics of using artificial intelligence to resurrect deceased figures. While Christie's estate supports the project, which uses her words and a digital likeness, some ethicists question whether it constitutes a deepfake and infringes on the author's autonomy. The course raises broader concerns about the use of A.I. to create representations of deceased individuals and the potential for blurring the lines between fact and fiction.</p>
