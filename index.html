          <p>OpenAI has restructured as a public benefit corporation, ensuring that the nonprofit controlling it remains the largest shareholder. This decision addresses concerns from critics like Elon Musk, who argued that OpenAI was overly focused on profits and neglecting safety. The restructuring follows years of corporate drama and scrutiny from regulators and academics, particularly regarding the balance between rapid A.I. development and potential risks to humanity. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, stated that the change provides a more understandable structure for the company to operate effectively, and he is confident that ongoing funding negotiations will not be affected by this shift. The New York Times has a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement regarding news content used in A.I. systems.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, a prominent website for deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support. The site, which allowed users to upload and view AI-generated pornographic videos, also facilitated the buying and selling of nonconsensual content. This closure follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the posting of nonconsensual sexual imagery. Experts note that while this is a positive step, the issue of nonconsensual sexual deepfake imagery will persist, potentially pushing the community to less mainstream platforms.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are seeking stronger regulations for cryptocurrency, spurred by concerns that the Trump family is leveraging connections to profit from crypto trading. The proposed GENIUS Act, initially supported by both parties, now faces opposition due to worries that it would directly benefit the Trump-affiliated crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, which recently secured a $2 billion deal from an Emirati venture fund. Senators are particularly concerned about potential conflicts of interest, money laundering, and the influence of foreign crypto firms. Some Democrats are calling for investigations into the Trump family's crypto deals, citing potential national security risks, while the White House maintains there is no conflict of interest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to the abortion pill mifepristone, aligning with the previous Biden administration's stance. The lawsuit, filed by conservative attorneys general, challenges regulatory changes that expanded access to the drug. The Trump administration's filing avoids addressing the merits of the case, arguing that the lawsuit does not meet the legal standard to be heard in the current court. This decision may reflect a cautious political approach to abortion, especially after recent electoral outcomes favored abortion rights.</p>

The Department of Justice stated that Credit Suisse committed new crimes and breached its 2014 plea agreement, in which it paid $2.6 billion for similar misconduct.

Despite initial diplomatic efforts, Trump's focus has shifted, and he may now tolerate Israel's use of heavy force against Hamas. While Trump has expressed concern for Gazans, his attention to the conflict has been sporadic, with a greater emphasis on diplomacy with Iran.</p>

This incident, the second involving that model in five months, has put a spotlight on the process for approving amateur-built aircraft and their accident rates.

This research, which involves experimenting with pathogens to understand how they might become more transmissible or harmful, has been controversial due to biosafety concerns. The order aims to block U.S. funding for such research in 'countries of concern' and empowers research agencies to identify and end funding for biological research posing a threat to public health.

          <p>The Trump administration announced it would cut off all new federal research grants to Harvard University, citing a "systemic pattern of violating federal law." Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused Harvard of ignoring antisemitism, engaging in discrimination, and abandoning academic rigor. This action does not affect federal student loan funding or Pell Grants. Harvard has previously sued the administration over frozen grants and contracts, alleging violations of its constitutional rights.</p>
