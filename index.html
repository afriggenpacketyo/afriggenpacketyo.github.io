        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled comprehensive measures to stimulate economic growth, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks. These steps aim to alleviate the economic impact of ongoing trade tensions and bolster domestic credit demand, particularly for technology and real estate sectors. While analysts suggest these measures could ease depreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan, they also point out that borrowing has been somewhat insensitive to interest rates. The government is also planning further support for small and medium enterprises and the private sector, indicating a sense of urgency among officials to stabilize the economy.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations for the ninth consecutive day, primarily due to an air traffic controller shortage and persistent rain. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that multiple members are on trauma leave following a recent equipment failure that disrupted communication with pilots. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce plans to modernize the air traffic control system, which he describes as frail and in need of repair.

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is reportedly conducting raids targeting businesses, particularly restaurants, in Washington, D.C., according to reports and activist groups. Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed concern over the reports, emphasizing that local police are not involved and that the actions are disrupting the community. An organization called CASA received specific warnings about the operations, which are allegedly justified under President Trump's executive order aimed at the beautification of the U.S. capital. The Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington voiced deep concern about the potential impact on the local restaurant industry, which relies heavily on immigrant workers.</p>

          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in Parliament that would allow judges to impose an additional two years of imprisonment on criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings in England and Wales. This legislation aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and to provide a sense of recognition and reparation for victims' families. The bill comes after several high-profile cases where offenders did not attend court for their sentencing, prompting calls for changes to the law. Justice Minister Alex Davies-Jones thanked the families who campaigned for the change, emphasizing that justice is not optional.</p>

          <p>India has announced that its forces conducted strikes against alleged terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, following a deadly attack in Kashmir last month. The Indian Defense Ministry stated that the actions were focused and non-escalatory, targeting the roots of cross-border terror planning, and that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted. Pakistan's military reported casualties and launched a retaliatory attack, claiming to have shot down Indian aircraft. The U.N.

          <p>The United States and Houthi rebels in Yemen have reached an agreement to halt American airstrikes after the Houthis agreed to cease attacks against American vessels in the Red Sea. President Trump announced the truce, mediated by Oman, stating that the Houthis have capitulated and will no longer attack ships. However, the Houthis stopped short of declaring a full cease-fire, indicating they would continue to fight Israel. The agreement's effectiveness in stopping the Houthis from impeding international shipping remains unclear, and some experts doubt it will lead to a long-term cessation of attacks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 5-4 extra-innings loss to the Miami Marlins, highlighting the strain on their overworked bullpen. Despite a solid start from Tony Gonsolin and strong offensive performances from Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers' bullpen struggled to maintain the lead. Manager Dave Roberts was forced to use less-than-ideal pitching options due to workload concerns, ultimately leading to a walk-off single by Jesús Sanchez in the 10th inning. The loss exposed the Dodgers' need to manage their bullpen more effectively to sustain their early-season success.</p>
