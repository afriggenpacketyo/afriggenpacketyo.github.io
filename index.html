          <p>A 90-year-old amateur golfer in the U.K. celebrated his milestone birthday by scoring his first-ever hole-in-one. John Payne, who has played for three decades, accomplished the feat on a 200-yard par-three hole, despite having deteriorating eyesight. He didn't see the ball go in himself but was told by his playing partners, calling the "miracle" shot a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Payne stays active by playing golf three times a week and visiting the gym, maintaining his health and mobility in his retirement.</p>

          <p>Tesla investors are showing increasing skepticism towards CEO Elon Musk's futuristic promises as the company faces significant challenges. Despite Musk's announcements about imminent driverless capabilities and an expanding robotaxi service, the focus has shifted to declining vehicle sales, thinning profits, and rising competition. The company's stock has underperformed this year, reflecting concerns over immediate financial performance rather than long-term, ambitious projects like autonomous driving. Analysts note that while the vision is compelling, the company needs to demonstrate growth in its core automotive business now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman was stopped by the Transportation Security Administration at Miami International Airport after attempting to smuggle two turtles through a security checkpoint by concealing them in her bra. The turtles were found wrapped in gauze and plastic, and the TSA reported that one of them unfortunately died. The surviving reptile was handed over to the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife for care. The TSA used the incident to remind travelers that while pets are allowed through security, they must be properly declared and carried, not hidden on one's person.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-based Japanese nutritionist details her shopping experience at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting significant differences from American stores. She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional Japanese foods, including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal local produce. The store also offered healthier ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and an extensive range of green tea products. The article suggests these items, which are staples in the Japanese diet and linked to health benefits, are less common or more expensive in U.S. Costco locations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. study from the University of Notre Dame has detected per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as "forever chemicals," in some reusable period products like underwear and menstrual cups. These chemicals, which do not naturally decompose, are linked to serious health issues including cancer and fertility problems. Researchers found that while some products were PFAS-free, others contained high levels, suggesting intentional use in manufacturing. The study raises concerns about direct absorption through the skin and the broader environmental contamination when these products are eventually disposed of, urging consumer awareness and industry transparency.</p>

Despite initial hesitation, he underwent a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic, a procedure that has been curative.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of all grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, pending court approval. This move is seen as an attempt at damage control amid growing speculation about the extent of Donald Trump's relationship with the deceased sex trafficker. Justice Department attorneys have filed requests in federal courts to unseal testimony from both Epstein's and Ghislaine Maxwell's grand juries. However, legal experts suggest these transcripts may not reveal the full picture, arguing that more significant information likely exists in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal memos.</p>

          <p>Amid changes to federal student loan programs under the Trump administration, more employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits, a trend encouraged by new legislation. The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has made the tax-free status of employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) a permanent feature, removing a key barrier for companies. This benefit is becoming an increasingly popular tool for attracting and retaining talent, as millions of Americans grapple with significant student loan debt.

"Daisies" has already reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and its success is seen as filling a void in a music landscape that has been dominated by stale or melancholic tracks.

The administration has already halted most of PEPFAR's HIV prevention work and support for AIDS orphans, causing disruptions in care in countries like Mozambique.

When these mosquitoes mate with the wild population, they pass on the bacteria, effectively neutralizing their ability to transmit the disease.

The author notes that recent reports from outlets like the Wall Street Journal have intensified scrutiny, and Trump's furious reactions and his administration's reversal on releasing files have only fueled suspicion. While acknowledging Trump's "comeback kid" reputation, the piece speculates on various outcomes, from the story fizzling out to it hurting Republicans in the midterms, and emphasizes that the case's true importance lies with the victims who were failed by the justice system.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that while the Jeffrey Epstein case has consumed public attention, several other critical issues with far-reaching consequences are being overlooked. The author identifies four such stories: America's spiraling national debt and the massive cost of interest payments; a growing global hunger crisis reversing decades of progress; the demographic challenge of a "population bomb" caused by falling fertility rates in the U.S. and abroad; and a degrading U.S. military readiness at a time of rising geopolitical tension.

          <p>According to Gazan hospital officials, at least 25 Palestinians were killed overnight by Israeli airstrikes and gunfire as ceasefire talks have reportedly stalled. The majority of the victims were shot and killed near the Zikim crossing while waiting for humanitarian aid trucks to arrive. The incident comes amid dire warnings of famine from the United Nations, which states that aid delivery is severely hampered by Israeli military restrictions and looting. This follows a similar recent event where dozens of Palestinians were killed trying to access aid at the same location.</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Venus Williams humorously remarked that she returned to competition "for the insurance," a comment that resonates with the challenges many Americans face with the employer-linked healthcare system. After a break from the sport, Williams lost her regular benefits and was placed on COBRA, a notoriously expensive option to continue coverage. The article uses her situation, including her need for specialized care for an autoimmune condition and as an elite athlete, to explain the complexities of U.S. health insurance. It notes that while the Affordable Care Act has improved options, the deep connection between employment and health benefits remains a uniquely American struggle.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the latest move by Hong Kong authorities to offer cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of 19 pro-democracy activists, many of whom reside in Britain.

The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. Supporters of the recall were angered by the KMT's blocking of key legislation, including defense budgets, and passing measures seen as favoring Beijing. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance from the opposition bloc.</p>

The administration has used this law to justify major tariffs, including those on Canada, Mexico, and China, by declaring a national emergency. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, ruling Trump had exceeded his authority, but that decision was paused pending appeal. The outcome of this case and several others could invalidate nearly all of Trump's major trade deals and tariff actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, analysts report that the situation in the country has deteriorated. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification for its takeover, has overseen a period of increased job losses, particularly in the nonprofit sector, and a crackdown on press freedom and civil society. Human rights groups accuse the regime of intolerance and arbitrary detentions. With the coup leader recently sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>

Experts are exploring a rise in summer seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a rarer form of depression characterized by restlessness and insomnia, which can be exacerbated by both heat and a lack of sunlight from being confined indoors. While winter SAD is well-studied, the summer variant is less understood, but its prevalence may grow as heat waves become more frequent and intense, forcing a choice between enduring dangerous temperatures outside or the isolating effects of staying inside.</p>
