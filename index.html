          <p>Two female employees were critically wounded in a shooting at Spartan College of Aeronautics and Technology in Inglewood, California. The incident, which occurred on the school campus, is believed to be an act of workplace violence according to Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts. Police arrested Jesse Figueroa, a 40-year-old unarmed security guard employed by the school, near Berendo and Twelfth streets in Pico-Union after a 911 call from his family who reported the shooting and the location of the gun in his car. The college campus was thoroughly searched, and the investigation is ongoing with dozens of staff and students present outside the school.</p>

An emotional Lady Gaga, who last performed in Brazil in 2012, appeared in Brazil-themed costumes and sang her best-known hits to an electric crowd.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ezra Klein in a New York Times opinion piece, Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his vice president signaled a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, with Trump surrounded by loyalists and enforcers. Unlike Trump's first term, where he faced resistance from his staff and the Republican Party, his second term is characterized by a lack of dissenting voices and an embrace of accelerationist policies. This transformation, Klein argues, has resulted in a presidency defined by ferocity and recklessness, with guardrails removed and loyalty prioritized over skepticism. This selection of Vance revealed that Trump‚Äôs second term would offer no concessions, contain no skeptics.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall reflects on the importance of remembering victims of past atrocities, particularly those of World War II, while also acknowledging the ongoing horrors of current conflicts. The article emphasizes the need to recognize and protest against atrocities occurring in places like Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Myanmar, Sudan, and Gaza. The author criticizes the normalization of carnage, the paralysis of the UN system, and the reduction in overseas aid, urging individuals not to "switch off" in the face of overwhelming global breakdown but to remain engaged and demand accountability.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's "golden passport" program, the last of its kind in the EU, deeming it a mere "commercial transaction" that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. The program, which offered citizenship to foreign investors, raised concerns about security, money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption risks. While Malta's Prime Minister defends the scheme, stating it earned the country over ‚Ç¨1.4 billion, the ruling highlights the need for stricter regulations on "golden visa" programs that offer residence permits for investments, ensuring due diligence and background checks.</p>

          <p>Kenyans are facing increased payroll taxes and new excise taxes as President William Ruto's government attempts to raise revenue to pay off the country's foreign debt. The tax increases have reduced take-home pay and buying power, particularly affecting those with low incomes. With 40% of the population living in poverty and a large portion of the workforce operating outside the tax system, the burden falls heavily on salaried employees. The economic crisis has devalued the shilling, leading to higher import costs and growing anger over the lack of public services, with some fearing a repeat of deadly riots that occurred last year.</p>

The Conservatives suffered disastrous results, while Labour was punished by voters unhappy with government spending curbs and higher taxes. Experts suggest that Reform's surge in support, driven by Farage's vigorous campaigning, indicates a broader fragmentation of British politics, with voters increasingly disenchanted with the main parties. The success of smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and Greens further underscores the shifting political landscape.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Liberty International Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing issues. The announcement follows numerous delays and cancellations, with over 800 delays and 150 cancellations occurring since Tuesday. The FAA attributes the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia, where the traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is located. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has unveiled plans to revamp the air traffic control system, but the project is expected to take three to four years, leaving travelers frustrated in the meantime.</p>

          <p>Kumamoto Prefecture in southwestern Japan has initiated a two-day bus tour showcasing ten bronze statues of "One Piece" characters to promote tourism and recovery from the 2016 earthquakes. The statues, created by manga artist Eiichiro Oda, are located across nine municipalities, offering a chance to reflect on the disaster and witness reconstruction progress. The tour is organized for domestic tourists, with consideration for translation services if international interest grows. The cartoon's storyline centers on Monkey D. Luffy's quest to become the king of pirates, and Oda has been a vocal supporter of Kumamoto's recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships cite the country's surname law as a reason for not marrying, as it requires couples to adopt the same surname. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% indicating they would legally marry if separate surnames were permitted. Japan is the only country known to require couples to adopt the same surname, and while the opposition party supports allowing separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, citing concerns about traditional family values.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market is experiencing a boom, with a net increase of nearly 12,000 coffee shops in the past year. This growth is driven by aggressive expansion, price competition, and promotion of domestic beans, with President Xi Jinping endorsing coffee from Yunnan province. While the market expands, Starbucks' market share has declined from 34% in 2019 to 14% in 2024, as new entrants with innovative business models and flavors gain popularity. Much of the growth is concentrated in second-tier and "new first-tier" cities.</p>
