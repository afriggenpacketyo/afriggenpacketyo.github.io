          <h2>EU Levies Substantial Fines Against Apple and Meta for Antitrust Violations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has fined Apple $571 million and Meta $228 million for breaching the Digital Markets Act, which requires Apple to allow developers to inform customers of alternative offers outside its App Store. The EU Commission found that Meta illegally required users to consent to sharing their data or pay for an ad-free service. Apple plans to appeal, claiming unfair targeting and forced technology giveaways, while Meta argues the EU is handicapping American businesses. The antitrust decision risks potential retaliation from the U.S., escalating existing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Beradt, a German Jewish journalist, documented the dreams of people living under Nazi rule, believing they revealed the psychological impact of totalitarianism. These dreams, collected from 1933 onwards and rendered in code, exposed both anxiety and a disturbing desire to conform to the regime. Beradt interpreted dreams of collaboration as a side effect of Gleichschaltung, the Nazi policy of synchronizing thought, suggesting that freedom became a burden and unfreedom a relief. The article questions whether these dreams reflected a secret wish to conform or a subconscious warning, highlighting the hijacking of people's brains under authoritarianism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two documentaries, "Kiss the Ground" and "Common Ground," advocate for a widespread shift to regenerative agriculture, claiming it can reverse climate change and fix the food system. Regenerative agriculture focuses on improving soil health by reducing synthetic chemicals, eliminating tillage, planting cover crops, and using rotational grazing. While these practices have ecological benefits, the documentaries are criticized for oversimplifying the complexities of agriculture and ignoring tradeoffs, such as increased land demand and the limitations of carbon sequestration. Experts suggest reducing meat and dairy production as a more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand has plunged nearly 13% as interest rates hit a two-month high, driven by economic uncertainty and rate volatility.

          <p>This article explores the question of whether courts can force a president to comply with their rulings, especially in light of the Trump administration's defiance of court orders. While courts have coercive powers, their effectiveness relies on democratic cultural norms and public opinion. The article highlights historical examples of presidents complying with court orders, such as Nixon and Truman, and emphasizes the importance of a political culture that respects the rule of law. The article also suggests that clear directives from the courts and potential impeachment proceedings can help ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has increased rapidly since President Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on U.S. imports, reaching a record high of over $3,500 per ounce. The uncertainty and projected losses caused by the tariffs have sent investors flocking to gold as a safe haven investment. The value of the U.S. dollar has also declined, further increasing the attractiveness of gold. Goldman Sachs projects that gold prices will continue to rise, potentially reaching $3,700 by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>None of the current members of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet visited the war-linked Yasukuni shrine during a three-day spring festival. This decision was partly due to diplomatic considerations, as Ishiba sent a ritual offering to the shrine, prompting protests from China and South Korea. The neighboring countries view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Past visits to the shrine by Japanese leaders have drawn sharp rebukes from Beijing and Seoul.</p>

Inflation, high taxes, and concerns about Social Security benefits contribute to this fear. Gen Xers, who are approaching retirement age, are the most worried about outliving their savings. The study advises distressed savers to seek professional help to navigate the uncertainty and develop a sound financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

This dynamic is creating conflicts within these communities and contributing to the political polarization of American religion.
