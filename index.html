          <p>D. Wayne Lukas, a towering figure in horse racing, has passed away at the age of 89. Known for his 15 Triple Crown race victories and a record-tying 20 Breeders' Cup wins, Lukas was a Hall of Famer who transformed the sport. His family and colleagues remembered him as a mentor who brought "heart, grace, and grit" to horse racing, continuing to work from his pony in the early mornings even in his late 80s. His career saw a renaissance in recent years, culminating in a Preakness Stakes win in 2024.</p>

          <p>Warren Schaeffer, the interim manager for the Colorado Rockies, was ejected from a game for the first time in his managerial career after a vehement argument with the home plate umpire. The confrontation occurred after umpire Ramon De Jesus called a third strike on outfielder Tyler Freeman, prompting Schaeffer to storm the field, spike his hat, and get into a face-to-face dispute. Despite the team's poor season record, the passionate display appeared to energize the players, who went on to secure a 4-3 extra-innings victory against the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has started debating a comprehensive Republican domestic policy bill that includes significant tax cuts, increased immigration enforcement funding, and reductions in healthcare and nutrition programs. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the legislation is estimated to increase the national deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion over the next decade. The CBO also projects that the bill would result in 11.8 million more Americans becoming uninsured by 2034, posing significant challenges for Republican leadership as they aim for passage.

          <p>China is reportedly engaged in a widespread crackdown on writers of "danmei," a popular genre of gay erotic fiction, with at least 30 authors arrested since February. The writers, almost all young women, published their work on a Taiwan-hosted platform and are being accused of producing and distributing obscene material, which could lead to lengthy prison sentences. The campaign has sparked online debate about China's restrictive pornography laws and censorship, which are seen as disproportionately targeting LGBTQ+ content while often permitting graphic heterosexual scenes.</p>

          <p>A week after the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the White House and intelligence agencies have created uncertainty about the mission's success. While President Trump claimed the facilities were "obliterated," a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggested the strikes only set back Iran's program by months. Officials later appeared to shift the goalposts, emphasizing that the strikes successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel rather than focusing solely on the destruction of nuclear material. The varying accounts highlight the difficulty in assessing the true impact of the operation.</p>

The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, was intended to raise funds and address housing affordability but drew criticism from fellow Republicans, conservation groups, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal due to an inability to secure safeguards preventing the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations.

In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented that "independent thinking" has become an "endangered species" in Washington and that he was not excited about running for another term.

These oils are high in polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-6 fatty acids, which has led to concerns about inflammation. However, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations maintain that the evidence does not support these claims. They argue that when substituted for saturated fats, these oils can actually be beneficial for heart health, and the controversy is largely fueled by online influencers rather than robust scientific data.</p>

          <p>A private funeral was held for former Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, her husband Mark, and their dog, who were killed in their home earlier this month. The service was attended by hundreds, including Governor Tim Walz, who delivered a eulogy remembering Hortman as a "consequential speaker" and a dedicated public servant. Melissa Hortman was praised for her leadership and ability to work across the aisle to improve the lives of Minnesotans. She is the first woman in state history to lie in state at the Capitol Rotunda.</p>
