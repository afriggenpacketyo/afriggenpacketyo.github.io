          <p>A Paris court reached a verdict in the Kim Kardashian jewelry heist trial, finding eight of the ten defendants guilty of crimes related to the 2016 robbery. The charges included robbery and kidnapping, with the gang being referred to as the "Grandpa Robbers" due to their age. Kardashian testified during the trial, recounting the terrifying experience of being tied up and held at gunpoint, fearing for her life. The convicted individuals face varying consequences, from prison sentences to fines, while the acquitted defendants were released.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accused the administration of retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. The university argued that stopping the flow of international students would destabilize Harvard's existence, as they contribute significantly to the university and its mission. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from implementing the order, stating that it would cause "immediate and irreparable injury" to the university.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear power reactors. The orders mandate the NRC to decide on reactor licenses within 18 months and establish a regulatory framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct reactors on federal land. This initiative is intended to power critical defense facilities and AI data centers, with the departments using their own authorities for reactor construction. The move also focuses on jump-starting uranium mining in the U.S. and expanding domestic uranium enrichment capacity.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), established by Elon Musk, created a "2025 Survey of Surveys" to identify and eliminate U.S. government surveys, raising questions about potential duplication of efforts by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Concerns arise regarding bypassing OMB oversight and potential violations of laws requiring the reporting of statistics from canceled surveys. The survey asks agencies to justify the need for their surveys, and warns of adverse actions, including termination of grants, contracts, or programs, for non-participation. Critics argue that the information DOGE seeks is already publicly available and that the effort may violate federal statutes and disregard Congress' power of the purse.</p>

The House passed legislation that could create a federal school voucher program, allocating $5 billion for families to use for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning. This legislation could bring vouchers to states that have resisted the concept and potentially reach as many as 1 million students nationwide, with much of the money going to religious education.</p>

The survivor, Flor Molina, hopes the legislation will save lives by providing workers with information about their rights and a process to leave dangerous jobs.

          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt, typically occurring after 180 days of missed payments, can have severe financial consequences, including a damaged credit score and potential lawsuits. While credit scores can be affected by even one missed payment, the full impact of default includes charge-offs and potential sale to third-party collection agencies. Consumers facing potential default should consider options like hardship programs, credit counseling, or debt settlement.
