With average home equity levels exceeding $300,000, homeowners can leverage this asset for significant funds. As of mid-September 2025, average rates for home equity loans hover around 8.3-8.4%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 8.05%.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" faces significant legal challenges, as experts note the president lacks the authority to label domestic groups in this manner. Antifa is described as a decentralized movement or ideology rather than a formal organization, complicating any such designation. Legal scholars warn that attempting to prosecute an ideology could infringe on First and Fourth Amendment rights. While the move could prioritize antifa for federal law enforcement investigations, it does not create a new chargeable offense for domestic terrorism.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to address illegal migration across the English Channel. During a state visit, Trump advocated for using military force, but Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is responsible for border policing. Kyle emphasized that the military's primary focus should remain on national defense and global security issues. The discussion comes as the UK government continues its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France to manage Channel crossings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 10:12:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has proposed moving up its ban on Russian gas imports to January 2027, a year earlier than previously planned, following pressure from the U.S. The new sanctions package aims to further reduce Moscow's revenues from fossil fuels, which sustain its war economy. The proposal specifically targets Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and may also include measures against Chinese refineries and banks involved in the trade. Despite significant reductions since 2022, Russia still supplied 19% of the EU's gas in 2024, largely through LNG shipments.</p>

          <p>Following ABC's indefinite suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!," fellow late-night hosts responded with a mix of humor and solidarity, framing the issue as a defense of free speech. Jon Stewart returned to "The Daily Show" with a satirical, administration-compliant monologue, while Stephen Colbert called the suspension "blatant censorship." Jimmy Fallon also expressed support for Kimmel before his own monologue was humorously dubbed over with pro-Trump praise. The suspension followed Kimmel's comments about the reaction to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>After being banned from Eurovision following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia is launching its own international song contest called "Intervision." The event, backed by President Vladimir Putin, aims to promote "traditional family values" and will feature performers from 23 countries considered friendly to Russia, including China, India, and Brazil. Reviving a Soviet-era contest name, Intervision is positioned as a cultural alternative to the perceived values of Eurovision.

While the transit time is significantly shorter, the company notes that the cost per container is higher than the Suez route but lower than rail transport.

Despite these efforts, Apple reported an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the previous quarter, making Cook's statement a significant clarification of the company's pricing strategy.</p>

          <p>The death of a Black college student whose body was found hanging from a tree on a university campus in Mississippi this week was ruled a suicide after an autopsy, police said in a statement. Demartravion “Trey” Reed, 21, was found dead early on Monday near the pickleball courts on Delta State University’s campus in Cleveland, Mississippi, according to officials. Civil rights advocates had called for a thorough and transparent investigation into the death while noting Mississippi’s history of lynching and racially motivated violence in the 19th and 20th centuries. Authorities and investigators had previously said there was no evidence of foul play. The local coroner’s office said earlier this week there was no evidence to suggest Reed was physically attacked or assaulted before his death. The Mississippi state medical examiner’s office conducted an autopsy on Wednesday whose “findings were consistent with the initial investigation, determining the cause of death to be hanging and the manner of death as suicide”, the Cleveland police department said on Thursday, adding toxicology test results were pending and might take weeks. The Mississippi Democratic congressman Bennie Thompson earlier called for a federal examination of Reed’s death. All files and investigative material were turned over to the FBI and the US attorney’s office for review, the Cleveland police department said, adding they were in contact with federal officials during the investigation. The renowned civil rights attorney Ben Crump was retained by Reed’s family. Crump said on Tuesday the family “cannot accept vague conclusions”. The university had said multiple law enforcement agencies were assisting in the investigation. The FBI said on Wednesday it was prepared to investigate, “if, during the course of the local investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal violation”. Delta State University’s enrollment last year stood at over 2,600 students, more than 40% of whom were Black.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is purchasing additional shares of Boeing, citing the company's favorable position due to President Trump's international trade agreements. The club highlights a significant increase in aircraft orders from countries involved in recent trade talks, including the UK, Japan, and the UAE, with a potential large order from China pending. The rationale also points to improving operational results and a strengthened balance sheet under the company's current leadership. The purchase is timed ahead of a call between Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new ZipRecruiter survey, the job search process in the U.S. has accelerated, with 49% of recent hires finding a role within one month, up from 39% in the previous quarter. Candidates are also submitting fewer applications before receiving an offer, suggesting a better match between job seekers and employer needs. The trend is particularly strong in healthcare roles within public administration and in anticipatory hiring for the holiday season in retail and transportation. This indicates that businesses may be expecting strong consumer spending for the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated his support for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one approved this week. He argues that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will likely be a temporary, "one-time effect," allowing the Fed more room to ease policy. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite core inflation currently running above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly overhauling the U.S. immigration system to accelerate deportations, a move critics say subverts due process. A new Department of Homeland Security tactic involves dismissing long-standing court cases, which removes judicial oversight and allows for immediate "expedited removal" of migrants who have been in the country for years. This procedural shift, combined with arresting immigrants at courthouses and pressuring judges, is described by former officials and lawyers as an attempt to turn the executive branch into the sole arbiter of immigration enforcement, effectively dismantling the court system's role.</p>

          <p>To combat high tariffs from the ongoing trade war, retailers are adopting a "business-to-business-to-consumer" (B2B2C) model to lower costs for consumers. This strategy involves routing online sales through a third-party company that acts as a "merchant of record." This middleman buys the product from the retailer at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value before the item is shipped to the customer. Companies using this method report significant savings on tariff bills, allowing them to avoid passing the full cost increase onto their American customers.</p>
