          <p>OpenAI announced that its nonprofit arm will retain control of the company as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, following pressure from civic leaders and former employees. This decision was made after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware. The restructuring will allow employees, investors, and the nonprofit to own equity in the PBC, with the nonprofit holding a majority stake. The company is currently facing a legal battle with Elon Musk, who is trying to prevent OpenAI from becoming a for-profit entity.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that gasoline prices had dropped to $1.98 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates due to supposed lack of inflation. However, AAA data indicated the national average was actually $3.165, significantly higher than Trump's figure. Market analysts pointed out that Trump's claim likely referenced RBOB gasoline futures, which do not include taxes, transportation, or retail costs and are thus irrelevant to consumers. The article emphasizes the discrepancy between Trump's statement and actual prices paid at the pump.</p>
