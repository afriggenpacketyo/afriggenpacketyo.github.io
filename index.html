          <p>President Trump is set to announce a new round of tariffs on April 2nd, dubbed "Liberation Day."  Economists predict these reciprocal tariffs, designed to counter trade imbalances, will significantly increase prices for U.S. consumers and potentially spark a global trade war. The impact on U.S. GDP is uncertain, with concerns about depressed financial markets and consumer sentiment.</p>
