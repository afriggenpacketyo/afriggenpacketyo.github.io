          <p>Former CDC Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee that she was fired for refusing to preemptively accept vaccine recommendations without sufficient scientific review. She detailed a contentious meeting with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where she was allegedly pressured to alter the childhood vaccine schedule and fire career officials. Monarez's account contradicts Kennedy's previous testimony, where he claimed she was dismissed for admitting she was untrustworthy. The hearing highlighted deep concerns among public health officials about political interference in scientific processes at the agency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has reduced its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, placing it in a range of 4% to 4.25%, the lowest since late 2022. This decision, the first cut since last December, signals a response to a stalling job market, a shift from the central bank's previous descriptions of a "solid" labor economy. While inflation has decreased from post-pandemic highs, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the downside risks to employment and the challenging policy path ahead. The move comes after sustained pressure from President Donald Trump for more significant rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in JAMA Dermatology involving nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is linked to a reduced risk of non-melanoma skin cancers. The most significant benefit was observed in individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% lower risk of recurrence. This research reinforces previous findings and provides stronger evidence for dermatologists who often recommend the over-the-counter supplement for secondary prevention.

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company after 47 years, citing a conflict with parent company Unilever over social activism. In an open letter, Greenfield stated that Unilever has undermined the ice cream brand's independence and ability to speak on global issues, such as the conflict in Gaza. The departure highlights long-standing tensions that escalated in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it would cease sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Greenfield expressed profound disappointment that the independence guaranteed in the 2000 merger agreement has been lost.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many individuals are seeking effective ways to manage their balances. This article outlines several clever strategies beyond making minimum payments, including the "snowball" method (paying smallest debts first for motivation) and the "avalanche" method (targeting high-interest debts to save money). Other tactics discussed are utilizing low-rate balance transfer offers, negotiating directly with creditors for lower interest rates, and seeking guidance from credit counselors for a structured repayment plan. These approaches combine psychological and financial discipline to help accelerate the path to becoming debt-free. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The cost of homeowners insurance in the U.S. has risen by an average of nearly 70% over the last five years, with single-family homeowners now paying an average of $2,370 annually. This dramatic increase is attributed to a combination of factors, including the rising frequency of climate change-related disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, higher home values, and increased costs for construction materials. The soaring premiums are forcing some homeowners to switch insurers or consider forgoing coverage entirely, a risky decision that could lead to financial ruin.

          <p>Dozens of Israeli tanks and military vehicles have reportedly entered Sheikh Radwan, a major residential district in northern Gaza City, as part of a ground offensive. Eyewitnesses described heavy artillery fire and smoke bombs covering the advance into one of the city's most densely populated areas. The incursion has triggered a new wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing south. Israel states its objective is to free hostages and defeat Hamas fighters, but the operation has drawn widespread condemnation from international aid agencies, who warn of an unconscionable humanitarian situation.</p>

          <p>World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala offered a surprisingly optimistic perspective on the trade disruptions caused by President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs. She framed the challenges as an opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of "reglobalisation." Speaking at a WTO forum, she pushed back against claims that the organization has become irrelevant, noting that nearly three-quarters of global commerce still operates under its rules. Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged the system has been heavily disrupted but emphasized that this creates a chance to reform and improve global trade practices.</p>

          <p>The Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art and Culture, opened in 2022 in Riverside, California, is having a significant positive impact on both the local economy and the art community. An independent study found the museum attracted over 200,000 visitors in its first two years, generating approximately $29 million for the city's economy. The center, which exclusively showcases Chicano art, has also become a vital hub for emerging local artists by providing exhibition space, networking opportunities, and professional development. Marin's goal of fostering a Chicano art renaissance appears to be materializing, giving a platform to a historically underrepresented art form.</p>

          <p>A new report from Yale University researchers reveals that Russia's network of facilities for the reeducation of Ukrainian children is larger than previously known and includes military training. The study identified 210 locations where thousands of children, some as young as eight, are stripped of their Ukrainian identity and taught Russian patriotic narratives and combat skills, including grenade throwing. This system, which Ukraine and international bodies have condemned as a war crime, appears to be an organized effort to militarize abducted children. These findings provide further evidence for the International Criminal Court's arrest warrants against Russian officials.</p>

          <p>With Bitcoin's value nearly doubling in the past year, more Americans are considering adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts, a move made easier by new brokerage offerings. Financial experts remain divided on the wisdom of this strategy, with some emphasizing the extreme volatility and risk to long-term savings. Proponents argue that for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon, a small allocation to crypto could offer significant rewards. Advisors universally recommend thorough research and suggest limiting crypto holdings to a small percentage of a portfolio that an investor can afford to lose entirely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle publicly refuted comments from United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who recently declared the ultra-low-cost carrier business model "dead." At a travel conference, Biffle retorted that the issue is a flight oversupply in the U.S., not a flawed model, and pointed to Frontier's lower operating costs as a key advantage. The exchange highlights the intense competition in the airline industry, particularly as larger carriers adopt no-frills "basic economy" fares to compete with discounters. The debate comes as Spirit Airlines, a major discounter, struggles with bankruptcy, prompting competitors to vie for its routes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island, alleging that a student loan forgiveness program offered by the Providence Public School District is racially discriminatory. The program provides up to $25,000 in debt relief for teachers of color who work in the district for three years, but white teachers are not eligible. This legal action is part of the Trump administration's broader campaign against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. The DOJ is seeking to halt the program's use of race as an eligibility criterion and to provide relief to nonminority teachers who were excluded.</p>

The National Weather Service has warned of potential thunderstorms that could bring dry lightning, increasing fire risk, as well as heavy rainfall that could lead to flash floods and debris flows. While widespread rain is expected, the primary effect for residents will be a "warm and muggy" and uncomfortable feeling due to the increased humidity.</p>

The funds are included in a stopgap measure to keep the government open through November 21. However, the proposal has become entangled in a partisan dispute, as Democrats are refusing to support the funding bill unless it also addresses their healthcare priorities, such as extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. This disagreement has raised the risk of a government shutdown, with both parties blaming the other for the impasse.</p>
