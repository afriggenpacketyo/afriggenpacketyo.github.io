          <p>President Trump lauded Nippon Steel's partnership with U.S. Steel, emphasizing the Japanese company's $14 billion investment and the preservation of U.S. Steel's control by the USA. During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump highlighted the creation of at least 70,000 jobs and the $14 billion boost to the American economy. He also mentioned raising tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent, effective Wednesday, while stating that U.S. Steel will maintain its operating blast furnaces at full capacity for at least ten years. Trump indicated he still needs to approve the final deal between the two steelmakers. Optimism centers around potential economic benefits and job preservation for the American steel industry.

In Betts' absence, Miguel Rojas is filling in at shortstop, while Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim are other options for the position.

          <p>A New York court has blocked President Trump's signature trade policy, leading to a legal battle likely to reach the Supreme Court. The court ruled that Trump's blanket tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), exceeded presidential authority. This decision has created uncertainty for businesses navigating the global economy, as the administration appeals the ruling and explores alternative legal justifications. Despite the setback, the White House maintains its commitment to tariffs, viewing them as crucial for economic revitalization and national security. The situation remains fluid, with potential for further legal challenges and policy adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's tax bill, including a levy on remittances leaving the US, is expected to significantly impact African economies. Remittances are a crucial source of income for many African families, often outweighing aid and foreign direct investment. The tax could lead migrants to use unofficial channels to send money, reducing recorded transactions and potentially harming lower-income groups reliant on these funds. While the full extent of the impact is uncertain due to data limitations, the policy is criticized for taking money out of people's pockets. (not investment advice)</p>
