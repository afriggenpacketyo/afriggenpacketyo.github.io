          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, falling to $9.64 billion, compared to $11.22 billion in the same period last year; this decline was significantly impacted by a 48.6% decrease in insurance-underwriting profit, which fell to $1.34 billion from $2.60 billion the previous year. The conglomerate also faced a $713 million loss due to foreign exchange fluctuations, contrasting with a $597 million gain in the prior year. Warren Buffett cautioned that potential tariffs could further negatively affect the company's profits across its diverse business sectors including insurance, transportation, and retail.

          <p>Harvard President Alan Garber is facing a multifaceted challenge, simultaneously resisting the Trump administration's attempts to strip the university of federal funding while also addressing concerns about campus culture. Garber acknowledges the need to fix issues such as the exclusion of diverse viewpoints and unchecked antisemitism, mirroring some of the Trump administration's criticisms. He has rolled back policies related to diversity and race, such as ending university support for affinity graduations, sparking debate among students who argue these changes prioritize optics over values. Garber defends his actions as necessary to preserve the integrity and independence of the university amid external pressures and internal divisions.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party despite trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. Voters chose stability amid global uncertainties stemming from the Trump administration, rejecting the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton, who lost his parliamentary seat. Albanese emphasized Australia's commitment to addressing global challenges in its own way, distancing himself from overseas influences. While voters expressed concerns about the economy, both parties offered incremental solutions rather than addressing fundamental issues like reliance on the U.S. for defense and trade dependence on China.</p>

          <p>The US Department of Labor is facing a significant workforce reduction, with approximately 20% of its staff departing due to retirement, early retirement, or resignation buyouts, prompting concerns about the agency's functionality. Remaining employees fear further cuts under the Trump administration's reorganization plans, which could lead to a mass reduction in force. Insiders warn that the cuts will undermine core aspects of working life, including wage and hour enforcement, safety protections, and international labor rights, also affecting state and local governments that rely on Labor Department funds. Morale has declined, and workers report increased workloads and administrative tasks, diminishing the services provided to workers.</p>

          <p>Following a surge of sectarian violence that killed dozens, Druse leaders in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, Syria, have agreed to integrate their militia fighters into government forces in exchange for concessions and investigations into abuses.

Israel intervened with airstrikes, citing the protection of Syrian Druse.

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles, a major indicator of economic activity, is experiencing a significant decline in maritime traffic due to President Trump's tariffs on imports from China. Cargo arrivals are projected to decrease by 35% compared to the previous year, leading to job losses and disruptions in the logistics system. The unpredictable nature of the trade war has shaken global confidence in American economic policy, making it difficult for businesses to make informed decisions. The slowdown in shipping and trucking industries suggests that the stock market has yet to fully reflect the economic damage caused by Trump's tariff war.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the importance of curiosity in dating and how dating apps can sometimes hinder genuine connection. Experts suggest that knowing too much about a person beforehand can kill a date, and that maintaining an air of in-person wonder is vital. The piece also explores the benefits of blind dates and suggests questions to spark curiosity, such as asking about childhood memories or biggest fears. Ultimately, the goal is to be an active listener and connect with another person as an end in itself.</p>

          <p>The governing body of Formula One racing is cracking down on drivers using profanity, leading to complaints about inhibited speech. Max Verstappen, a four-time world champion, received a penalty for using an explicit word at a press conference, prompting concerns about freedom of expression. While the FIA considers easing punishments, the debate raises questions about what drivers are expected to say when faced with challenging situations on the track.

The U.S. has been unwilling to back off from duties on imports of automobiles and steel and aluminum, while Japan hopes for the elimination of such levies. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about the 25 percent duties on the auto industry, which accounts for a significant portion of its exports to the U.S. A 25 percent tariff on auto parts also took effect, causing disappointment in Japan.</p>

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, aimed at promoting domestic manufacturing, will affect even cars made in the U.S. due to the use of imported components. While some exemptions exist for parts from Canada and Mexico, the tariffs are expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and create uncertainty for carmakers. The financial stress could lead to supplier bankruptcies and parts shortages, with General Motors estimating a cost of up to $5 billion this year.</p>

          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is helping caregivers reduce their use of elderspeak, a form of communication that sounds like baby talk and can be demeaning to older adults. Studies have shown that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care and increased use of antipsychotic drugs. The CHAT program, which includes videos and training sessions, has been shown to decrease elderspeak and resistant behaviors. The program emphasizes treating older adults with respect and using appropriate language.</p>
