          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, seemingly rejecting President Trump's attempt to fire National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet. The institution emphasized that its secretary, Lonnie G. Bunch, has the support of the Board of Regents in his management of the Smithsonian. This announcement follows a White House proposal to reduce the Smithsonian's funding and an executive order demanding an end to federal funding for exhibitions based on racial themes. The Smithsonian's statement underscored its commitment to being a nonpartisan institution and a welcoming place for all Americans, free from political influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the deployment of the state's National Guard to respond to protests in Los Angeles, deeming it an "unprecedented power grab." The lawsuit argues that President Trump unlawfully bypassed Governor Gavin Newsom by placing the National Guard under federal control without the governor's permission. The state contends that the deployment has stoked fear and heightened tensions with protesters and residents, asserting that local police have effectively managed any violence. California Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the federalization deprives the state of resources needed to protect citizens, especially in emergencies, and increases tension.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline. The Treasury stated that Sizewell C will create 10,000 direct jobs and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment is necessary for a "golden age of clean energy." However, critics like Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's cost, given incomplete negotiations with private investors.</p>
