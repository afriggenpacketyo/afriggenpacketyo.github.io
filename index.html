            <p>In Spain, the VioGÃ©n algorithm, used to assess the risk of repeat domestic violence, failed to accurately predict the threat to Lina, who was later killed by her ex-partner. Despite being classified at "medium" risk, which should have triggered a police follow-up within 30 days, Lina was murdered before that could happen. This incident has sparked debate about the reliance on algorithms in determining police resource allocation and the potential for algorithmic bias. Experts emphasize the need for independent audits and transparency to ensure these systems effectively protect vulnerable women and avoid perpetuating existing inequalities.</p>

            <p>Two Pentagon officials, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were fired after being suspended earlier in the week as part of an investigation into unauthorized disclosures. The investigation was initiated by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, following a memo about leaks. Caldwell, Selnick, and a third official, Colin Carroll, expressed disappointment in a joint statement, claiming they were not informed of the specific allegations. The probe appears to be widespread, with discussions about potentially suspending more officials, and Kasper is also under review.</p>

            <p>Aditya Wahyu Harsono, an Indonesian student and father of a child with special needs, was detained by ICE after his student visa was secretly revoked. His attorney claims the revocation was based on a minor misdemeanor conviction from 2022 and that he was detained without clear explanation at his workplace. Harsono's wife, a US citizen, is struggling with the situation as he was the family's primary provider and has since been fired from his job. This case is part of a larger trend of student visas being revoked under the current administration, raising concerns about the targeting of students based on minor infractions or political views.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen criticized President Trump and El Salvador's President Bukele for staging a meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported from the U.S. Van Hollen claims that Bukele's officials placed glasses that appeared to contain margaritas on the table during the meeting to defame him and the deportee. He emphasized that the U.S. government is not complying with the Supreme Court's order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. Van Hollen also stated the case goes beyond Abrego Garcia, as it is about protecting the constitutional rights of everyone who resides in the United States of America.</p>
