          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop in nearly two years and extending a long deflationary trend. This decline, worse than economists' forecasts, reflects a deepening price war among manufacturers as they grapple with weak consumer demand and excess inventory. While the consumer price index (CPI) showed a slight rebound, economists remain cautious, citing persistent overcapacity and a weakening property sector. The government has pledged to regulate aggressive price-cutting that is hurting corporate profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has completed a massive 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, effectively containing the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project, part of the nation's broader "green great wall" initiative, aims to combat desertification and prevent sandstorms. Engineers utilized a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then followed by planting drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul. This large-scale ecological project is designed to build a more robust environmental barrier and control sand movement in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to significantly reduce the federal workforce. The court lifted a lower court's injunction that had previously blocked the job cuts, allowing terminations to proceed while legal challenges continue. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the sole public dissenter, warning the executive action could lead to mass terminations and the dismantling of federal government services. This ruling is one of several recent decisions where the court has sided with the administration on major policy initiatives.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom recently visited South Carolina, a key early primary state, sparking speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. While officially there to support local Democrats and criticize the Trump administration's policies, the trip served as an introduction to local voters and party officials. Newsom received praise from influential figures like Rep. James Clyburn and engaged with communities on issues like immigration. Despite his efforts to connect with the electorate, some locals noted his progressive California politics might be a tough sell in the more moderate state.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi and 20 other individuals to lengthy prison terms in a mass trial. Ghannouchi, leader of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year sentence, adding to previous convictions, on charges including inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government. Defense lawyers claim the accusations are based on false testimony from an anonymous witness. This event is part of a broader crackdown on dissent by President Kais Saied, which critics argue is undermining the country's democracy.</p>

          <p>Hydrologists report that the conditions leading to the deadly flash flood on Texas's Guadalupe River were recognizable, and historical data confirmed the area's high risk. The region, known as "Flash Flood Alley," has experienced major, deadly flooding over a dozen times in the last century, with the river having previously crested at even higher levels. Experts say that despite issuing a flash flood watch hours in advance, challenges in pinpointing the exact location of extreme rainfall and the difficulty of overnight warnings contributed to the tragedy.

          <p>The city and county of Los Angeles, along with several other local governments, are seeking to join a lawsuit aimed at stopping what they term "unconstitutional" immigration raids by the Trump administration. The lawsuit, originally filed by the ACLU, claims federal agents are engaging in unlawful detentions and flouting the Constitution. Local officials argue the raids instill fear, disrupt communities, and obstruct local law enforcement functions. This legal action comes as federal immigration arrests in the Los Angeles area have reportedly reached nearly 2,800 since the operation began in June.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting women and girls in Afghanistan. The court alleges that since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban has systematically deprived females of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense," while the move represents a significant step by the international body to hold the regime accountable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move intended to protect national security and boost domestic industry. The decision follows a Commerce Department investigation into the effects of copper imports. The new tax, which is expected to take effect by the end of the month, caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. The U.S. imports about half of its refined copper, primarily from Chile and Canada, for use in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flooding in Texas has brought renewed attention to significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, under the Trump administration. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, including meteorologists and hydrologists, leading to high vacancy rates in some offices. While experts believe the NWS performed well in forecasting this specific event, they warn that continued cuts could compromise the agency's ability to protect residents from future weather disasters.
