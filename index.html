        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans for large-scale reductions in the federal workforce and agency reorganizations. Judge Illston stated that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates, and a President cannot initiate executive branch reorganization without Congressional partnership. The lawsuit was filed by unions and advocacy groups challenging President Trump's February 11 executive order, which aimed to transform the federal bureaucracy through significant job cuts, and the Trump administration has requested an emergency pause of the injunction from the Supreme Court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite cultivating ties with right-wing populist leaders worldwide, President Trump's foreign policy decisions often contradict their interests. Examples include Trump's direct negotiations with Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran, which have alienated Israel's Netanyahu, and criticism of Apple's plan to move iPhone assembly to India, angering Modi's supporters. Even OrbÃ¡n, a staunch Trump ally, has maintained close economic ties with China, creating awkward political dynamics. Trump's approach appears guided by securing deals and quick wins, regardless of political affinity.</p>

          <p>During a severe ocean heat wave in Papua New Guinea, scientists discovered that clownfish shrank in size, which may be an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Researchers found that the fish got shorter by a few millimeters, and this downsizing appeared to increase their chances of survival. The study adds complexity to the narrative of climate change's impact on marine life, suggesting that some species can adapt to rising temperatures in unexpected ways.</p>

          <p>The combination of Trump's trade policies and tax cuts is pushing the U.S. economy into dangerous territory with rising interest rates and slowing growth, leading to concerns about a potential debt crisis. The downgrade of America's credit rating by Moody's and the passage of a tax bill that would add trillions to the deficit have shaken investor confidence. Economists warn that the U.S. could be headed for stagflation, with the Federal Reserve unlikely to intervene due to inflationary concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
