Relatives and activists highlighted the ongoing tragedy, attributing the disappearances to organized crime groups and, in some cases, security forces. These families, often forming search parties called "buscadores," continue their dangerous work at great personal risk, underscoring a national crisis that the UN has called a "human tragedy of enormous proportions."</p>

The opposition follows a recent raid at a Westlake location where federal agents used tear gas and arrested multiple people, part of a pattern of similar operations. While immigrant rights groups condemn the raids as acts of terror, Home Depot has stated it is not involved in requesting or being notified about these federal enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights by preventing city police from cooperating with any potential federal immigration enforcement operations. The order, largely symbolic, comes amid reports of a possible deployment of federal agents and seeks to bar them from wearing masks while requiring clear identification. The initiative directs city departments to protect residents and pursue legal action against federal efforts that violate constitutional rights, reflecting a growing tension between the city and the Trump administration over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Iowa Hawkeyes head coach Kirk Ferentz achieved a significant career milestone, tying Woody Hayes for the most all-time wins by a Big Ten football coach with his 205th victory. The win came in a 34-7 season opener against Albany, where the Hawkeyes' offense was led by running back Xavier Williams, who rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown. Ferentz, known for his humility, reportedly downplayed the achievement after the game, focusing instead on the team's performance.</p>

He posits that had the roles been reversed, Hayes, as a powerful executive, might not have faced the same legal consequences, ultimately concluding that the case raises complex ethical questions about shared responsibility.</p>

          <p>The planned loan of the nearly 1,000-year-old Bayeux Tapestry to the British Museum has sparked significant opposition within the French art community. Experts fear the 70-meter-long embroidered cloth is too fragile to be transported and that the journey could cause irreparable damage, calling the move a "cultural crime." The loan was announced by French President Emmanuel Macron as an act of cultural diplomacy, but critics argue the decision was made without proper consultation with specialists responsible for the masterpiece's conservation.</p>

          <p>Scientists in the UK are employing an innovative arsenal, including drones, sniffer dogs, and atmospheric dispersion models, to combat the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, a major threat to the nation's forests. The invasive pest, which has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe, is now being carried to the UK on the wind. This high-tech approach has successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southern and eastern England, though the threat is expected to grow as climate change stresses trees and aids the beetle's spread.</p>

          <p>A California state bill aimed at preventing wildfires by requiring utilities like Southern California Edison to remove decommissioned power lines has died in Sacramento. The legislation, SB 256, was introduced by Sen. Sasha Renée Pérez following the destructive Eaton fire, with some investigators suspecting an old power line as the ignition source. Despite a lack of formal opposition from utility companies, the bill failed to advance, causing frustration for the senator and residents who lost homes and believe it was a crucial step toward accountability and safety.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals the largely unregulated industry of "body brokers" in the United States, for-profit companies that acquire and sell dissected human bodies donated to science. While proponents argue these companies fill a crucial need for medical research and training, critics point to a lack of oversight that leads to exploitation of grieving families and disrespectful handling of remains. Unlike organ donation, the trade in whole bodies and parts for research is not federally regulated, allowing a legal market to flourish where families are sometimes misled about how their loved one's body will be used.</p>

          <p>New figures from England's Department for Education suggest that the first week of the school year is critical for student attendance throughout the rest of the term. According to the data, over half of the pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," meaning they missed at least 10% of their classes. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat the ongoing problem of high absence rates, which have remained above pre-pandemic levels.</p>

As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo can champion a "constructive pragmatism" that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation. This approach, leveraging the growing influence of middle powers, could serve as a practical model for a dysfunctional international system that is often paralyzed by competing national interests.</p>
