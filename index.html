          <p>A vehicle deliberately drove into a crowd outside a nightclub in East Hollywood, injuring thirty people, with seven reported in critical condition. The driver had reportedly been removed from a nearby business before ramming the vehicle into people waiting in line, also hitting a taco truck and valet stand. Bystanders intervened, attacking the driver who was later found to have been shot; a suspect who fled the scene remains at large. The incident prompted a massive emergency response and a statement from the mayor calling it a heartbreaking tragedy.</p>

          <p>Former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne has once again spoken out against a 2022 New York Times article that featured her under the headline "Sex Sells." Dunne claims the newspaper's staff instructed her to wear her team leotard for the photoshoot, which they then used to argue that female college athletes are rewarded for "traditional feminine desirability" over athletic skill. She recounted how she mocked the headline on social media, an act which she says led to a modeling opportunity with Sports Illustrated. Dunne has previously called the piece "BS," stating the reporter asked "weird" questions about her appearance.</p>

          <p>According to Gazan hospital officials and witnesses, Israeli forces opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to get food, resulting in 32 deaths near distribution sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The incidents occurred near Khan Younis and Rafah, adding to hundreds of similar reported deaths since the US and Israeli-backed GHF began operations. The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after suspects approached its forces and is investigating the reports. The GHF denied any incidents occurred at its sites, claiming the shootings happened hours before they opened.</p>

          <p>The US has reportedly revoked the visas of eight Brazilian supreme court judges as part of an effort to support former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing trial for an alleged coup attempt. The move, attributed to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, follows President Trump's announcement of 50% tariffs on Brazilian imports, which he linked to the supposed persecution of his ally. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the visa revocations as "unacceptable interference" in the country's judiciary and sovereignty. The actions have sparked nationalist backlash in Brazil, even among some right-wing voices.</p>

          <p>At least 63 people were arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations protesting the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. The majority of arrests, 55 in London, were on suspicion of terrorism offenses for displaying placards in support of the group. The ban, which makes supporting the group a criminal offense, followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. Protesters, including some elderly individuals, were arrested in multiple cities, with organizers vowing to challenge the ban in the High Court.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that releasing the grand jury transcripts related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell would not be enough to satisfy "troublemakers and radical left lunatics." His comments follow a Department of Justice request, prompted by Trump himself, to unseal the testimonies amid growing public pressure. Trump's social media post suggests he does not plan further action on the matter, framing the demands as a perpetual cycle. The statement comes as he is also suing Rupert Murdoch's Wall Street Journal for defamation over an article about a letter allegedly sent to Epstein.</p>

The report found that serious safety concerns, such as vibrations felt by workers, were raised long before the collapse, with one safety officer even resigning in protest.

However, they also caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have begun to increase prices on some consumer goods, risking inflation. Despite some rollbacks, Trump recently announced plans for new tariffs, creating continued uncertainty for businesses and the potential for a negative reaction from the Federal Reserve.

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress for his relative. He reportedly defied orders to stay out of the room after hearing the patient screaming. The machine's powerful magnet pulled the chain, drawing the man in and causing fatal injuries. Medical experts stress that such incidents are rare but underscore the critical importance of strict safety protocols that prohibit metal objects near active MRI machines.</p>

It highlights new survey data showing a majority of pregnant women and parents of young children do not intend to fully vaccinate their children, suggesting a growing and dangerous crisis of trust in modern medicine.</p>

          <p>While Americans on average believe they would need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, financial experts argue this metric can be misleading. A certified financial planner suggests that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of one's financial health, such as cash flow or alignment with personal values. True financial comfort, the article posits, comes from ensuring money management aligns with core values, like freedom or security. Experts advise focusing less on a target number and more on what that money would enable you to do. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that a recent IRS policy change, which allows clergy to endorse political candidates without risking their church's nonprofit status, is a "Faustian bargain." The author contends that while it may seem like a victory for religious freedom, it will likely lead to churches becoming de facto political organizations, susceptible to funding from PACs and internal pressure. This shift prioritizes political instruction over the formation of conscience, potentially alienating members and degrading the church's spiritual mission by entangling it with earthly, partisan battles. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has already stated its clergy will continue to refrain from endorsements.</p>

          <p>Despite a large parliamentary majority, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's authority is being questioned due to both internal party discipline issues and external pressures. His recent decision to expel several backbench MPs for opposing government plans is seen by some as a necessary show of strength, but by others as a sign of being "spooked" by dissent. The government is also constrained by economic realities, with senior figures admitting the financial markets are a "binding constraint" on policy.
