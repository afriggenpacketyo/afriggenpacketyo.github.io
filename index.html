        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty of sexual assault in New York after a retrial, adding to his previous conviction in Los Angeles. The jury found him guilty of assaulting Miriam Haley, a former television production assistant, but acquitted him of assaulting Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a charge of sexual assault involving Jessica Mann and will resume deliberations. Weinstein's spokesperson expressed concerns about the jury deliberations, suggesting some jurors had preconceived notions. The legal process has been fraught with tension, and serious appellate issues are expected to be explored, as an appeals court overturned Weinstein's previous conviction due to fairness concerns. Optimism about this outcome is low given the nature of the crime.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Buddy Carter launched a Senate campaign ad targeting Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff over the Los Angeles rioting sparked by immigration raids. The ad criticizes Ossoff's silence on the unrest, claiming he is "MIA" and supports progressive ideologies. Ossoff's office clarified that he is on paternity leave after welcoming a baby daughter. The ad also attacks Ossoff's continued use of pronouns on social media, framing it as support for "wokeness." This political maneuver underscores the increasing politicization of social issues and the use of current events in campaign strategies. The events are likely to have a negative impact on Ossoff's career.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated he regretted some of his recent criticisms of President Trump, following their public disagreement over a spending bill. Musk had previously engaged in a social media feud with Trump, even suggesting the creation of a new political party. Trump had threatened Musk with consequences if he funded Democrats, given Musk's companies' federal contracts. The White House indicated that Trump appreciated Musk's apology, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the president and the technology billionaire. The episode underscores the complex relationship between political figures and influential business leaders, but the situation seems to be calming down.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles experienced a relatively calm night after a curfew was imposed following protests against President Trump's immigration raids. Nearly 400 people were arrested, and federal prosecutors charged two men with throwing Molotov cocktails at police officers. The National Guard and Marine Corps were deployed to quell the unrest, while Trump vowed to "liberate" the city. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the president's actions as an "assault" on democracy. The events highlight the ongoing tensions between the federal government and state officials regarding immigration enforcement. It is unlikely that the conflict will be resolved any time soon.</p>

Separately, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. consumer, noting that spending data has not been significantly affected by macroeconomic uncertainties such as President Trump's tariffs.

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, according to estimates from The Senior Citizens League and an independent policy analyst. This adjustment aims to help monthly checks keep pace with inflation, with the official change announced in October based on third-quarter inflation data. The COLA may increase further if President Trump's tariff policies cause inflation and consumer prices to rise. The consumer price index rose less than expected in May, showing limited impact from Trump's tariff policies. The government will likely continue to monitor inflation to see how the COLA will be affected.</p>

          <p>R&B singer R. Kelly has filed an urgent request for release from federal prison, citing a serious threat to his life. His legal team claims that three Bureau of Prisons officials attempted to recruit another inmate to murder him. The motion includes a sworn statement from a terminally ill inmate alleging the plot. Kelly's attorneys argue that his continued incarceration under these circumstances constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. The court will need to assess the credibility and severity of these allegations to determine whether a release is warranted. Given his history of sexual abuse, the public is unlikely to support his release.</p>

          <p>Following the ousting of the Assad regime in Syria, neighboring states have stepped in to provide aid, with Turkey emerging as a significant player due to its ties with the interim government. Gulf states are offering financial assistance and seeking to strengthen their political and economic alliances with Syria. The U.S. is considering a larger role in Syria to counter Russian influence and potentially foster a Syrian-Israeli detente. Iran and Russia are considered the biggest losers in the power shift, but still maintain a presence in the region. The future of the region remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A significant number of extra police officers are being deployed in Northern Ireland following two days of violent disorder, primarily in Ballymena, after a peaceful protest related to a sexual assault case. Thirty-two officers were injured, and six people were arrested during the violence, which police have described as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers." Police Scotland is sending additional officers to assist, and investigations are underway to prosecute those involved. The unrest has caused fear among residents and has strained police resources.

          <p>Some left-wing critics argue that liberals, by denouncing left-wing illiberalism, have enabled Trump's authoritarian actions. This perspective suggests that by criticizing cancel culture and excesses in protests, liberals have provided a pretext for right-wing repression. However, others argue that it was the left's tactics and rhetoric that helped enable Trump's return to power. This debate mirrors historical divisions during the McCarthy era, with liberals caught between opposing both extremes. The article claims that this conflict has contributed to a more polarized political environment.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's weight-loss and diabetes drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic, are being linked to a rare eye condition, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), in very rare cases. The European Medicines Agency's safety committee has asked Novo Nordisk to list the condition as a "very rare" side effect. A separate study also found that diabetes patients using GLP-1 drugs were twice as likely to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Patients experiencing vision problems should discontinue treatment, but Novo Nordisk maintains that the benefits of semaglutide outweigh the risks. More investigation is needed to determine whether or not the drugs are safe.</p>
