          <p>The Trump administration has determined that Harvard University violated federal civil rights law through its discriminatory treatment of Jewish and Israeli students. In a letter, officials from several departments accused the university of enabling antisemitism and warned that its federal funding is at risk if immediate changes are not made. The finding is part of a broader conflict between the administration and Harvard, which includes frozen grants and challenges to the university's DEI programs and admissions policies.

          <p>Julia KlÃ¶ckner, the president of the German parliament, is facing scrutiny for her conservative and allegedly populist actions since taking office. Critics point to her decisions to ban the Pride flag from the Reichstag building and enforce strict dress codes, such as ejecting a lawmaker for wearing a "Palestine" t-shirt. A senior member of the center-right CDU, KlÃ¶ckner has a history of making controversial statements on immigration and has been accused of trivializing the far-right AfD party. Her actions have sparked a debate about whether her partisan stance is appropriate for the formally impartial role of Bundestag president.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to ease some U.S. sanctions on Syria, following the collapse of the Assad regime and the formation of a transitional government. The new Syrian leadership has been lobbying for sanctions relief to help pay civil service salaries, rebuild infrastructure, and restore the healthcare system after a 13-year civil war. This move aligns with the interests of U.S. allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who support normalizing relations with the new government. While some sanctions require congressional action to be revoked, the executive order marks a significant policy shift toward supporting Syria's recovery.</p>

The annual July 1 protests, once a symbol of the city's fight for autonomy, have been replaced by tightly controlled patriotic celebrations. This shift is highlighted by the recent disbandment of the League of Social Democrats, the city's last active pro-democracy group, whose members cited overwhelming political pressure.

Dunne was found strangled in her home nearly six decades ago, but the case remained unsolved despite extensive investigation. The breakthrough came when modern DNA testing linked semen from the original crime scene to Headley, a convicted rapist with a history of similar attacks on elderly widows. His conviction marks the culmination of a 58-year-long pursuit of justice, combining old-school police work with modern forensic technology.</p>

The raises are the result of ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments, standing in contrast to the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009.

          <p>The Canadian government has agreed to rescind its digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies, a move aimed at restarting stalled trade talks with the United States. The decision came just before the first tax payments were due and after President Trump had called the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened retaliatory tariffs. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta, and was expected to generate significant revenue for Canada. This reversal is seen as a crucial step to de-escalate trade tensions and strengthen the economic partnership between the two closely linked countries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from a group of Los Angeles landlords who sought financial compensation for losses incurred during the city's COVID-19 eviction moratorium. The landlords argued that the policy, which temporarily stripped them of their right to exclude nonpaying tenants, constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation. Lower courts had dismissed the lawsuit, citing long-standing precedents that allow for government regulation of property. By declining to hear the case, with two conservative justices dissenting, the Supreme Court leaves the lower court rulings in place and avoids a major reassessment of property rights and rent control laws.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As homeowners consider tapping into their home's equity, experts are highlighting the key differences between home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). While both currently offer lower interest rates than credit cards or personal loans, their rate structures are distinct. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially advantageous if rates fall later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates based on mortgage bond trading, offering stability but less direct correlation with Fed cuts. Experts suggest that borrowers weigh their need for predictable payments against the potential for future rate adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

Although Mbeumo is understood to want the move, Giles emphasized that a sale would only happen if it is the "right deal" for Brentford.

Officials confirmed there were no survivors and noted that the crash site was difficult to access but fortunately did not impact any of the nearby houses. The president of an aviation company at the airport described the pilots and passengers as "the best of the best." The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will lead the investigation into the cause of the tragic crash.</p>

          <p>In response to years of high electricity costs and frequent power outages, the town of Adjuntas in Puerto Rico's central mountains has established the island's first community-owned solar microgrid. This initiative represents a grassroots effort to build a more resilient and reliable energy infrastructure, independent of the island's fragile main power grid. The project provides a sustainable energy solution for local residents and businesses, serving as a model for other communities across Puerto Rico seeking energy independence. The move towards localized, renewable energy is a significant step in addressing the long-standing electrical problems that have plagued the U.S. territory.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike on a popular seafront cafe in Gaza City has killed at least 20 Palestinians and wounded dozens more, according to medics and eyewitnesses. The venue, Al-Baqa Cafeteria, was an outdoor space known as a hub for journalists, activists, and local residents seeking internet access. The attack left a deep crater and scattered bodies, overwhelming rescue crews. This strike occurred amidst a broader wave of Israeli bombardment across northern Gaza, which has triggered further mass displacement. The violence continues despite reports of intensified efforts by mediators to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear the case of Kari MacRae, a Massachusetts teacher fired for social media posts she made before she was hired. MacRae argued her termination was unlawful retaliation for exercising her First Amendment free speech rights. The posts were characterized by school officials as containing homophobic, transphobic, and racist themes. Lower courts had ruled against MacRae, finding that the school's interest in preventing disruption outweighed her speech rights, a precedent based on a 1968 Supreme Court case. By turning away the appeal, the court leaves the lower court's decision in place, reinforcing the ability of public employers to consider potential disruption from an employee's speech.</p>

          <h2>Families of Cartel Victims Urge US to Designate More Groups as Terrorist Organizations</h2>

          <p>A coalition of American families who have lost loved ones to cartel violence is formally asking the Trump administration to designate the JuÃ¡rez Cartel and its armed wing, La LÃ­nea, as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). In a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the group, American Families Against Cartel Terrorism, argues that the designation is crucial for keeping Americans safe and achieving justice. An FTO label would criminalize providing support to the group, block members from entering the U.S., and allow victims to sue for compensation. This follows the administration's earlier designation of eight other drug cartels as FTOs, broadening the use of the anti-terror tool.</p>
