          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that it is China's responsibility to de-escalate trade tensions, citing the trade imbalance between the two countries and the unsustainability of high tariffs. He noted progress in negotiations with other nations, suggesting a potential trade deal with India soon. Bessent also mentioned that European nations are likely concerned about the euro's strength against the U.S. dollar and may consider cutting rates. He insisted that the White House will not conduct trade negotiations in the press. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM announced a $150 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, with over $30 billion allocated to research and development, focusing on mainframe and quantum computer production within the United States. IBM's chairman, Arvind Krishna, emphasized the company's commitment to American jobs and its role as a hub for advanced computing and AI. The investment aligns with President Trump's tariff regime aimed at encouraging domestic manufacturing, although IBM did not directly cite tariffs as the primary motivation. Other tech leaders like Apple and Nvidia have also recently committed to expanding their U.S. manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's initial 100 days in office have seen the stock market's worst performance for a new presidential term since the 1970s, with the S&P 500 dropping 7.9%. This contrasts with the post-election surge driven by expectations of tax cuts and deregulation, as investors grew concerned over Trump's aggressive trade policies. The market experienced a sharp decline following the announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs, though a subsequent partial retraction eased some concerns.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine to coincide with Russia's World War II Victory Day commemorations.

The ceasefire comes amidst pressure from the Trump administration for both sides to negotiate an end to the conflict, with Vice President Vance warning that the U.S. may withdraw from the peace process if no agreement is reached.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is focusing on an expanded drone program, assembling unmanned systems within the country, as a strategy to sustain its war efforts amid uncertain peace talks and potential shifts in U.S. military support. This initiative emphasizes the use of small, exploding drones operated from shelters. The announcement of a three-day ceasefire by President Putin adds to the war's uncertainties, especially after recent intensified warfare and conflicting signals from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Several companies have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S. following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the reason, the White House touts these moves as supporting job creation. Economists are skeptical that tariffs alone are sufficient to drive such strategic shifts, noting that factors like labor costs and regulations play a significant role. However, economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one.</p>

          <p>The democratization of private equity, driven by a push to broaden the definition of an "accredited investor," presents both opportunities and risks for retail investors. While private equity offers the allure of diversification and higher returns, retail investors may lack the sophistication and resources to navigate its complexities. They may also be targeted to fill capacity, receiving less desirable opportunities compared to institutional players. The lack of transparency, illiquidity, and higher fees associated with private equity require caution and expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

India is under pressure to retaliate, but Pakistan warns of a strong military response to any Indian incursion.
