          <p>A 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck a rural area of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico on Saturday night, with the epicenter located about 35 miles south of Whites City, New Mexico. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 3.9 miles and was felt by many residents, but there were no immediate reports of damage.

          <p>Members of the South Texas community of Boca Chica, home to SpaceX's rocket launch facilities, voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase. The vote, tallied at 212 to 6, fulfills Elon Musk's long-held ambition to create a city centered around his company's operations. The community, covering about 1.5 square miles, will now be eligible to create its own police and fire departments, adopt ordinances, and apply for state and federal grants. Musk has frequently referred to the area as Starbase on his social media platform, X, and has expressed his commitment to the project.</p>

The Nuggets dominated the game, with six players scoring in double figures. The Clippers' coach, Tyronn Lue, had previously never lost a Game 7, but the Nuggets' strong performance ensured their victory and advancement to the next round.</p>

          <p>China is undergoing a shift towards a technocratic meritocracy, with a growing number of government officials holding PhDs and possessing technical backgrounds. Nearly half of the Communist Party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold doctoral degrees, many from prestigious universities like Tsinghua University. This trend signifies a philosophical shift rooted in Chinese tradition, where scholar-officials were revered, and today's technocrats are evaluated based on competence rather than ideology.
