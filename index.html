        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chicago area faced a rare dust storm that significantly reduced visibility on major Interstate highways, prompting dust storm warnings. The storms coincided with showers, leading to reports of "mud rain" in some areas. Wind gusts reached over 70 miles per hour, with the most significant storm threat east of I-55. Cooler, dry weather is expected over the weekend, but a rainy pattern is set to return next week, potentially bringing 1" to 1.5" of rain. Several schools were closed due to power outages resulting from the severe weather events.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, was stolen, leaving only its hacked-off feet behind. Residents suspect vandalism or melting for cash, with little indication of political motivation. The statue, initially made of wood and later replaced with bronze after arson, never gained local affection. The American artist who commissioned the statue viewed it as a critique of President Trump’s immigration policies. The town of Sevnica continues to capitalize on its connection to Ms. Trump through branded products.</p>

          <p>Facing record-low approval ratings, prominent Democrats are shifting from endorsing President Biden to acknowledging his cognitive decline during his term. Some, who previously vouched for Biden's fitness, now admit he was unfit for re-election. This shift reflects a broader effort within the party to rebuild trust by confronting how they handled the 2024 race. While some defend their past support based on information available at the time, others suggest that White House aides shielded Biden as his condition worsened. This issue could become a dividing line in the 2028 presidential primary as candidates seek to differentiate themselves.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of Americans face risks from severe weather this weekend, including high winds, tornadoes, and record-breaking heat.

Simultaneously, an early-season heat wave is forecast for south Texas, with highs reaching into the 90s and triple digits, making it hotter than Death Valley.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has stalled in the House of Representatives due to disagreements among Republicans. Primary sticking points include the extent of budget cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and the cap on state and local tax deductions. Conservative congressmen are demanding steeper cuts to avoid increasing the national debt, while lawmakers from high-tax states are objecting to the proposed cap on local tax deductions. Some Republicans warn against cutting Medicaid, arguing it would harm lower-income constituents and be politically damaging.</p>

          <p>Youth mobility and fishing rights are key issues ahead of the UK/EU summit, aiming to "reset" relations. The EU seeks a "youth mobility scheme" allowing young people to move freely, but concerns exist about immigration impacts. Fishing rights are another sticking point, with the EU pushing for an extension of the current post-Brexit deal, while UK fishing groups want changes. A UK/EU youth mobility scheme would likely increase net migration in the short term, but the long-term impact would be minimal if participants leave when their visas expire.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration intends to release audio recordings of President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, who investigated Biden's handling of classified information. Republicans have sought the audio to assess Biden's mental acuity. The decision follows the release of a transcript and new revelations about Biden's health during his presidency. Hur's report described Biden as "an elderly man with a poor memory," sparking controversy. The Biden administration had previously asserted executive privilege to withhold the audio.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation for posting an image on Instagram that federal officials allege was a call for violence against President Trump. The post featured seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47." Comey was interviewed by Secret Service agents about the post, which he later deleted. Trump administration officials interpreted the numbers as a call for his assassination, while Comey stated he opposed violence and didn't realize the numbers' association with violence. The incident has reignited tensions between Comey and Trump.</p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewelry store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan, following a landmark ruling. The men, along with a third individual, allegedly stole items worth £679,000 in 2015. This marks the first time Japan has successfully received fugitives from the UK, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries. The court rejected challenges against extradition, citing sufficient evidence to support the charges and compatibility with human rights.</p>

          <p>Australia's deadliest animals, such as the Sydney funnel-web spider and venomous snakes, play a crucial role in saving lives through antivenom programs. The Australian Reptile Park collects venom from these creatures to produce antivenom, which is distributed across the country. The program relies on public participation to safely capture and donate spiders and snakes. The antivenom is then used to treat bites, drastically reducing fatalities from these animals.</p>

          <p>A 28-year-old woman survived for weeks in California's eastern Sierra Nevada by foraging for food and drinking melted snow after a solo camping trip went wrong. She lost most of her equipment in an avalanche but managed to survive with a lighter, a knife, and some snacks. She eventually found shelter in an unlocked cabin. Her survival is considered remarkable given the harsh winter conditions.</p>

          <h2>Connswater Shark Sighting 'Quite A Surprise' in Belfast River</h2>

          <p>A man cycling through Victoria Park in Belfast spotted a 4ft-long starry smooth-hound shark swimming in the Connswater River. The shark was seen swimming in the river for about 30 minutes before disappearing upstream. Marine biologists noted that while uncommon, it's not unusual to find smooth-hounds in urban areas. The shark was likely feeding on crabs and small crustaceans in the river.</p>
