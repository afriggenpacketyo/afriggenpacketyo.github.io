          <p>Taiwan's top trade negotiator has dismissed a U.S. proposal to manufacture half of the chips it supplies to America locally, stating the idea was not discussed during recent trade talks. Instead, negotiations focused on reducing tariffs and preventing additional duties on Taiwanese exports. The U.S. Commerce Secretary had pitched the "50-50" split to decrease American reliance on Taiwan for semiconductors, a move some Taiwanese politicians condemned as an attempt to undermine the island's critical "Silicon Shield" and technology sector. This highlights ongoing tensions in global supply chain strategies.</p>

          <p>Thomas Wolf, co-founder of AI startup Hugging Face, suggests that current AI models like ChatGPT are not poised to make Nobel Prize-level scientific breakthroughs. He argues that these models are designed to predict the most likely outcome and often align with user prompts, whereas true scientific discovery requires contrarian thinking and identifying novel, unlikely truths. While AI can serve as a valuable "co-pilot" for researchers by aiding in data analysis, Wolf believes a fundamental shift in AI architecture is needed for it to generate truly revolutionary ideas. This provides a sobering perspective on the current limitations of generative AI technology.</p>

          <p>Major European defense contractors, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have welcomed a proposal to build a multi-layered "drone wall" to protect the EU's eastern flank from Russian aggression. The initiative has gained momentum following recent airspace incursions in Poland, the Baltic states, and Scandinavia, which have been attributed to Russia. While defense firms stand ready to contribute expertise and technology, some experts express concern that the project could be slowed by bureaucracy and that it must also account for drones launched from within EU territory. The plan underscores the growing importance of unmanned aerial systems in modern warfare.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" on child poverty, indicating a strong possibility the government will soon lift the controversial policy. Introduced by the previous Conservative government, the rule prevents families from claiming universal or child tax credits for a third or subsequent child. Phillipson emphasized the urgency of tackling the issue as child poverty rates continue to rise, stating children should not be punished for circumstances beyond their control. The Treasury is reportedly considering several replacement options, including a tapered system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS investigation has found that multiple failures by heart surgeon Karen Booth at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital contributed to the deaths of seven patients and significant harm to another. The inquiry identified clinical errors, a lack of skill for complex procedures she performed, and a failure to seek help from senior colleagues. Concerns about her performance were first raised by colleagues in 2018, but a formal investigation was not launched until 2021.

          <p>Two regional jets operated by Endeavor Air for Delta Air Lines were involved in a low-speed collision on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident occurred between an outbound flight to Roanoke and an inbound flight from Charlotte, with the wing of the departing aircraft striking the fuselage of the arriving one. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was taken to a hospital as a precaution, but no passengers were harmed. Passengers from both aircraft were safely deplaned and returned to the terminal, while airport operations remained unaffected.</p>

          <p>An Iraqi family that has been in legal limbo in Europe for 15 years has finally been granted provisional asylum in France, bringing a sense of stability after immense tragedy. The Alhashemi family suffered the loss of their seven-year-old daughter, Sara, who suffocated during a failed attempt to cross the English Channel in a small boat in April 2024. After her death, the family was housed in a migrant transit hostel for nearly a year, grappling with grief and bureaucratic hurdles. The decision to grant them residency, along with the recent birth of a new baby girl, offers the family a chance to rebuild their lives.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown poses an immediate risk to the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves nearly 7 million people. Unlike larger programs like Social Security, WIC funding could run out within weeks, as the shutdown occurred at the start of the new fiscal year, halting new federal money. If the shutdown persists, states may have to use their own funds to cover the gap, and some WIC offices could be forced to turn away preschool-age children to prioritize pregnant women and infants.

          <p>South Korea's benchmark Kospi index surged over 3% to achieve a new record high, largely propelled by significant gains in the stock prices of Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. The rally in these heavyweight chipmakers followed their announcement of a major partnership with the U.S. artificial intelligence firm OpenAI to supply advanced memory chips. The positive performance in South Korea contributed to a broader optimistic sentiment across Asian markets, which also saw gains in Hong Kong and Australia. This market activity occurred even as traders globally monitored the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a satirical nod to the U.S. housing affordability crisis, the 133-year-old Maxwell House coffee brand has launched a marketing campaign temporarily rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee." The tongue-in-cheek ads acknowledge that in the current economy, owning a house is out of reach for many, so the brand is adopting a "more affordable name." The campaign reflects the reality that the median age of first-time homebuyers has risen to a record high of 38, as high prices and interest rates make homeownership increasingly difficult for younger generations.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a lawsuit for a second time filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography and had caused him lifelong harm. The judge ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the photograph pornographic, comparing it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." The court had previously dismissed the case on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired, a decision that was later reversed by an appeals court, leading to this new ruling on the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first individual whose net worth has surpassed $500 billion, according to the Forbes billionaires index.

This further solidifies his position as the world's wealthiest person, significantly ahead of his nearest competitors in the global tech industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has ruled that graphic photos from the crime scene of the 2022 University of Idaho student murders will not be publicly released. The judge determined that the "incredibly disturbing" images showing the victims' bodies would cause "extreme emotional distress" for their families, which outweighs the public's interest in scrutinizing the investigation. The ruling came after family members of the victims requested the images be kept private. Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty to the stabbing murders of the four students and was sentenced to life without parole, concluding the criminal case.</p>

          <p>French asset management firm Amundi, which manages over €2.3 trillion, has reduced its investments in Chinese equities, cashing in on the recent market rally. The firm's deputy CIO stated that positions in "overvalued" Chinese stocks have been trimmed due to doubts about the sustainability of the country's economic rebound and an environment less supportive for equity markets. Amundi has reallocated some funds to safer, dividend-paying stocks and is selectively favoring onshore shares over those listed in Hong Kong due to valuation gaps. The move reflects a cautious sentiment among some global investors regarding China's near-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order promising that the United States will use all necessary measures, including military action, to defend Qatar from external attack. The order, which follows a recent Israeli strike in the country that targeted Hamas leaders, designates an attack on Qatar's territory or infrastructure as a threat to U.S. peace and security. This move is seen as an effort to reassure the key Gulf ally, which hosts a major U.S. airbase. The legal weight of the executive order as a defense guarantee is unclear, as such commitments typically require Senate approval as a formal treaty.</p>

          <p>On the first day of the U.S. government shutdown, the Trump administration announced it was freezing approximately $26 billion in federal funds designated for projects in Democratic-leaning states. The move targets about $18 billion for transit projects in New York and nearly $8 billion for green energy initiatives in 16 states, including California and Illinois. Top Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer, condemned the action as a partisan tactic that uses the American people as "pawns" for political blackmail. The freeze adds another layer of contention to the shutdown impasse, potentially making a resolution more difficult to achieve in Congress.</p>

          <p>A central point of contention in the U.S. government shutdown is the Republican claim that Democrats are seeking to provide free healthcare to immigrants in the country illegally. Democrats deny this, stating their proposal aims to restore Medicaid eligibility for lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, which was restricted by a recent law. The Republican argument focuses on rolling back these restrictions, while Democrats maintain their priority is extending Affordable Care Act tax credits for American citizens. This dispute over funding for legally present immigrants has become a key obstacle in negotiations to reopen the government.</p>
