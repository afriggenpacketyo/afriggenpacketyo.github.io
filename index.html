          <p>Elon Musk stated he regrets some of his recent social media posts directed at U.S. President Donald Trump following a public dispute. The feud had previously led to market concerns regarding Musk's Tesla and SpaceX businesses, particularly after Musk spearheaded the Department of Government Efficiency under Trump's administration. Musk acknowledged that his remarks on the X platform went too far, indicating a desire to mend the relationship. This comes after a period of tension that seemingly dissolved their tight partnership, potentially impacting Musk's business ventures and creating uncertainty in the tech sector. The tech mogul hopes to repair relations with the US president.</p>

          <p>Asia is increasingly reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties, monetary shifts, and currency hedging strategies. ASEAN is actively promoting the use of local currencies for trade and investment to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations and strengthen regional payment connectivity. This trend is part of a broader global move away from the dollar, driven by concerns that the dollar can be used as leverage in trade negotiations and direct sanctions. Asian economies with substantial foreign assets, such as Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China, are leading the repatriation of foreign earnings to their home currencies.

The defense argued that Jane willingly participated in the described activities and attempted to portray Combs as a drug addict seeking sympathy from the jury. The trial is expected to conclude by July 4, with Combs facing charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution. </p>

          <p>Taiwanese YouTuber Holger Chen Chih-han, also known as Gym Boss, is live-streaming his visit to Shanghai, urging fellow Taiwanese to experience the city firsthand. Chen, once critical of Beijing, now describes Shanghai as a "super first-rate city" and challenges anti-Beijing rhetoric in Taiwan. He claims that his perceptions shifted after observing mainland China through social media. Chen's self-funded tour aims to provide an unfiltered glimpse into mainland Chinese society, contrasting with official messaging in Taiwan. </p>
