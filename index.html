          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, a surprising upset for the 33-year-old Democratic Socialist. Mamdani, a relatively unknown figure outside his Queens district, defeated a prominent name in New York politics. The official confirmation is pending until mid-July, but the implications for the city and the Democratic Party are already under debate. This win signals a potential shift in the political landscape, reflecting the growing influence of progressive voices in local elections. Optimism surrounds the potential for new leadership and policy directions. </p>

          <p>Marcus Monzo, 37, was found guilty of murdering 14-year-old Daniel Anjorin with a samurai sword in Hainault and also convicted on three counts of attempted murder. The attacks, which occurred over 20 minutes, involved Monzo attacking a pedestrian, two police officers, and a couple in their home. Monzo, who had a blue belt in Brazilian jiu jitsu, had experienced a cannabis-induced psychosis before the attack, and witnesses described him as screaming and smiling after fatally wounding Daniel. The Anjorin family expressed their grief and the police conveyed their condolences, hoping the verdict brings some justice and relief. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, following a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. between Israel and Iran. Speaking at a NATO summit in The Hague, Trump stated that a formal agreement with Iran may not be necessary because Iranian nuclear sites were destroyed. He emphasized that the U.S. is primarily concerned with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, asserting that their enrichment efforts have been set back by decades. The president also expressed optimism regarding progress in Gaza, attributing it to the recent U.S. strikes. </p>

          <p>Tesla's European car sales experienced a fifth consecutive month of decline in May, with sales dropping by 27.9% year-on-year to 13,863 units. This decline is attributed to increased competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles, resulting in a decrease in Tesla's European market share from 1.8% to 1.2%. The company continues to face challenges from traditional automakers and emerging Chinese players like BYD, which registered nearly as many vehicles as Tesla in May. Tesla's stock has fallen more than 18% year-to-date, reflecting these market pressures. </p>
