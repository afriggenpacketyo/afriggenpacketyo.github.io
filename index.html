          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have co-authored an op-ed accusing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of jeopardizing the health of Americans. Their concerns stem from recent actions, including the abrupt firing of the current CDC director, the cancellation of mRNA vaccine research, and the replacement of expert advisory committees with unqualified individuals. The former leaders, whose service spans both Republican and Democratic administrations, are urging Congress to conduct oversight, stating that the nation's public health system is in major jeopardy and ill-prepared for future threats.</p>

          <p>Despite setting new age-related records at the US Open, Novak Djokovic's continued success hinges on his physical endurance through the grueling tournament. While he has played himself into good form, his matches have been marked by various physical issues requiring trainer attention, raising questions about his body's ability to withstand the strain of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents. As he prepares to face No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a dominant 10-0 record, the primary challenge remains whether his aging body can sustain his high level of play.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has traveled to Beijing aboard his heavily armored, slow-moving train to attend a military parade alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The event commemorates the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II and serves as a significant display of military power and deepening alliances between the three nations amid global tensions. This visit marks Kim's first trip to Beijing since 2019 and underscores Pyongyang's efforts to strengthen ties with its key allies, continuing a family tradition of using fortress-like trains for international travel.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka delivered her most commanding performance since returning from maternity leave, defeating American third seed Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 to advance to the US Open quarter-finals.

For Osaka, the victory marks a significant milestone in her comeback, demonstrating a return to the powerful and precise form that once took her to the world number one ranking, while Gauff's struggles under pressure continued despite recent changes to her coaching team.</p>

          <p>Despite repeated threats, President Donald Trump has refrained from imposing severe new sanctions on Russia for its continued aggression in Ukraine. Analysts suggest this hesitation is strategic, driven by two main factors: Trump's desire to be seen as a peace-broker who can bring both sides to the negotiating table, and a broader concern within Washington about pushing Russia into a deeper, more formal alliance with China. This inaction has reportedly left Ukrainian officials frustrated, as they believe stronger economic pressure could compel Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's deadline-day attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi for £35 million has fallen through despite a deal being agreed upon and the player starting his medical. The transfer collapsed because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a replacement defender in time, as their target opted for a move to West Ham instead. The failure to reinforce their defense is a significant blow for Liverpool, who have shown defensive frailties early in the season, while Guehi will now remain at Palace for the time being, though his long-term future is uncertain as he is in the final year of his contract.</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 800 people and causing widespread destruction in remote, mountainous provinces like Kunar and Nangarhar. Survivors described waking up to their homes trembling before collapsing and are now grappling with the shock and despair of losing family members and neighbors. Rescue efforts are severely hampered by the rugged terrain and blocked roads, forcing the Taliban government to rely on helicopters to airlift the injured, while many villagers are left to sleep in the open, in need of shelter and aid.</p>

          <p>Following Congress's decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, hundreds of local PBS and NPR stations across the U.S. are facing a severe financial crisis. Many have launched emergency fundraising drives and have seen a strong initial response from their communities, but the long-term outlook remains grim. Stations are already beginning to cut staff and programming, and there are concerns that some, particularly those in rural and less affluent areas, may not survive without the critical government support they have historically relied upon.</p>

          <p>An American man has died in the Bahamas following a collision between a vessel and a jet ski in the waters off of Paradise Island. This fatal incident is part of a series of recent events involving U.S. citizens, including an alleged sexual assault at a resort and another non-fatal jet ski crash. The U.S. Embassy had previously issued a security alert advising against renting jet skis in the area, citing reports that American women have been sexually assaulted by local operators, and prohibiting U.S. government employees from using them.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments made by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding "precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius labeled the public discussion of such a sensitive topic as "completely wrong" and premature, asserting that it should not be debated before Kyiv and Moscow are at the negotiating table. He also emphasized that the European Union currently lacks the legal jurisdiction or competence to deploy troops in such a manner.</p>

          <p>Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta by releasing a satirical short story. The move comes after her renowned novel, 'The Handmaid's Tale,' was among over 200 books removed from some school libraries under a new education ministry directive targeting "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story criticizes the policy by describing two perfect children who marry and have a family without ever having sex, taking aim at the perceived puritanical nature of the ban and its supporters.</p>

          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, driven by strong performance in the defense and health-care sectors. Defense company shares, such as BAE Systems, climbed after the UK announced its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion order from Norway. In the pharmaceutical space, Novo Nordisk's stock rose following the release of trial data suggesting its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than its main competitors, boosting investor confidence in the company's market position.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, as she faces criticism from the Conservative party over her purchase of a flat in Hove. The opposition has accused Rayner of hypocrisy and potential tax avoidance, alleging she may have saved on stamp duty by misrepresenting the property's status as her primary residence. Starmer defended Rayner as a "great story of British success" from a humble background and dismissed the attacks as a mistake, while a spokesperson for Rayner insisted all relevant taxes were paid properly.</p>
