          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 00:32:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-held rice stockpiles directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kg to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The government intends to bypass auctions, which previously hindered price control, and may explore online sales to ensure widespread distribution. This initiative follows mounting criticism over the government's failure to curb rising rice prices, exacerbated by poor harvests and increased demand due to tourism, with average supermarket prices reaching a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg. The government plans to initially release 300,000 tons and consider additional supplies if necessary.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, a decision welcomed by both companies despite previous concerns about national security risks. The planned partnership is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the U.S. economy, with Nippon Steel committing to significant investment over the next 14 months. This decision follows a review by federal agencies and discussions between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, marking a shift from earlier opposition to foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, which had also been a point of contention during the previous presidential election.</p>

          <p>As geopolitical tensions rise and de-dollarization discussions intensify, Hong Kong's financial system is becoming increasingly crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan. According to Mary Huen Wai-yi, businesses in Qatar are eager to utilize the yuan through Hong Kong's financial tools for joint ventures and investments with China. The trend towards yuan-denominated trades highlights a shift away from the U.S. dollar in international markets, aligning with China's long-term strategy to reduce risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. Hong Kong's role in facilitating yuan transactions is expected to grow, providing more opportunities for its financial sector.</p>

These centers will be open to walk-in patients, as well as those referred by GPs and police, providing immediate care from specialist staff for individuals in acute mental distress. While NHS England hails this as a pioneering model of care, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism due to the scheme being untested, and emphasized the need for proper funding of NHS mental health services, noting that the share of health spending on mental health treatment has recently decreased.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition cameras by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the search for escaped inmates from a New Orleans jail has ignited a debate over privacy and surveillance. Despite a recent pause in automated alerts from the group ordered by the New Orleans Police Department, the technology aided in the recapture of one fugitive. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise concerns about the potential for abuse and the lack of transparency, while supporters argue it's a valuable tool for law enforcement. Project N.O.L.A. operates around 200 facial recognition cameras in New Orleans, scanning faces, clothing, and license plates.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident, which occurred on May 1, was attributed to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction that failed to maintain contact. The Army stated that the aircraft's location was continuously broadcast, but federal air traffic controllers reported receiving inconclusive data. Following the incident, the Army temporarily suspended flights into and out of the Pentagon while working with the FAA to address safety concerns.</p>

Retailers have seen a surge in sales of disposable vapes, with some customers buying large quantities to last through the summer. While the ban aims to reduce environmental impact and curb youth vaping, some fear it will lead ex-smokers back to cigarettes, as disposable vapes have been credited with helping many quit smoking. The government hopes the ban will encourage the use of reusable vapes, but concerns remain about the availability and appeal of alternatives.</p>

          <p>A U.S. national was arrested in Chiba Prefecture, near Tokyo, on suspicion of assault after allegedly releasing pepper spray in a shopping mall parking lot, injuring more than 40 people. The incident reportedly began with a dispute over cigarette smoke, leading the suspect, Lin Eric Yen Ju, to use pepper spray. He admitted to the allegations, stating he was also attacked. Forty-four people complained of sore eyes and throats, with 12 requiring hospital treatment, though none sustained life-threatening injuries.</p>

          <p>"Sister Midnight," a British-Indian film, follows Uma, a restless housewife in Mumbai, as she explores her city at night and finds a hidden strength. The film captures the atmosphere of Mumbai slum life, combining elements of daydreams and night odysseys, though it struggles to reconcile its episodic nature with its feminist themes. Uma's journey leads her to a cleaning job and encounters with the city's oddities, reflecting her transformation. The film is visually captivating, blending Wes Anderson and David Lynch styles, with Radhika Apte's performance adding to the film's unique energy.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving Paul Weiss after the firm struck a controversial deal with President Trump to avoid government targeting. The departures follow an executive order by Trump that limited the firm's interactions with the government, which was later rescinded after Paul Weiss agreed to compromises. The deal proved controversial in the legal community, with some firms choosing to sue the administration instead. It remains unclear if the attorneys' departures are directly related to the agreement with Trump.</p>
