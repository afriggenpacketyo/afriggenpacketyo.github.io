          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records currently held at a naval base in Djibouti. The ruling lifts a lower court's injunction, permitting their removal to third countries, such as South Sudan, without first providing them a chance to contest their deportation over fears of persecution. The decision prompted a sharp dissent from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who expressed grave concerns about the migrants' safety.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology after broadcasting a controversial set by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan from the Glastonbury festival. During the performance, the band led the crowd in a chant of "Death to the IDF," a reference to the Israel Defense Forces. The incident has led to significant backlash, including a police investigation and the revocation of the band's U.S. visas, prompting the BBC to announce new policies for broadcasting potentially high-risk live performances.</p>

          <p>A recent diplomatic crisis, ignited by a violent police raid on ethnic Azeris in Russia, has placed significant strain on the relationship between Moscow and Baku. Azerbaijan's strong reaction, including canceling cultural events, follows existing tensions from the 2024 downing of an Azerbaijani airliner by a Russian missile. This escalating series of events has led regional analysts to speculate that Russia's long-standing influence in the Caucasus and its alliance with Azerbaijan may be weakening.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a group of former U.S. diplomats warns that Secretary of State Marco Rubio's proposed reorganization of the State Department would effectively dismantle the nation's human rights advocacy. The plan involves closing most offices within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL) and laying off a majority of its expert staff. The authors argue this move reverses decades of bipartisan foreign policy and signals that the U.S. no longer prioritizes global justice and human rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed signature law creates a highly favorable environment for the fossil fuel industry while simultaneously ending decades of federal support for renewable energy. The legislation mandates new oil and gas drilling on federal lands, reduces government royalties, and repurposes a carbon capture credit to boost oil production. In contrast, it phases out crucial investment and production tax credits for the solar and wind industries, a move that critics warn will undermine U.S. energy leadership and manufacturing.
