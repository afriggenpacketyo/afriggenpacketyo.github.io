          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are bracing for one of the hottest June days on record as a four-day heatwave is set to peak. The Met Office forecasts temperatures could reach 34C in central and eastern England, a level rarely surpassed in June since 1960. An amber heat-health alert remains active for five regions, signaling likely impacts on health services and potential travel delays. Authorities have also issued a "severe" wildfire risk warning, urging the public to take precautions during the hottest parts of the day.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is moving toward final votes on President Trump's significant tax and spending legislation, dubbed the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." After a weekend of debate, Republicans are aiming to pass the measure before a self-imposed July 4 deadline, which would require the House to approve the Senate's amendments. The bill increases spending on border security and defense while cutting some healthcare and nutrition programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent market speculation has positioned British oil major BP as a potential acquisition target, though rival Shell has denied reports of a planned merger. This article examines how BP's situation evolved, starting with its 2020 strategy shift toward renewable energy under former CEO Bernard Looney. Following Looney's abrupt departure and a period of underperforming shares compared to peers, questions about the company's direction have intensified. Despite current CEO Murray Auchincloss's confidence in BP's independence, activist investors and declining profits have fueled takeover rumors. (not investment advice)</p>

This development comes as the deadline for Chinese owner ByteDance to divest from the platform approaches, following a 2024 law aimed at addressing national security concerns. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline, indicated that any deal would likely need approval from Beijing.

          <p>Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) has passed a motion at its party congress calling for preparations to ban the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The move follows the recent classification of the AfD as a "confirmed right-wing extremist" group by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, a designation currently suspended pending a legal challenge. While the SPD and Greens support exploring a ban, senior conservative figures have urged a more cautious approach, preferring to await the outcome of the court case.</p>

Arguing that U.S. nuclear weapons stationed in Germany are no longer a sufficient deterrent against Russian aggression, Spahn suggested Europe must enhance its own defense capabilities. His proposal includes potential German participation in the nuclear arsenals of France and the UK. The call was met with sharp criticism from left-leaning parties, who reiterated their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the UK and the US has kicked in, allowing shiploads of British-made cars to head to America with a reduced tariff of 10%. The deal is expected to unleash pent-up demand after a 25% tariff imposed by the Trump administration had slowed exports. However, the agreement has drawn criticism from British farmers, who argue that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip to secure concessions for the auto industry. The National Farmers' Union expressed concern over tariff-free quotas for American beef and the removal of tariffs on U.S. ethanol. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators blocked major roads in Belgrade and other Serbian cities, escalating months of anti-government protests. The protests, originally sparked by a deadly train station roof collapse blamed on corruption, have grown into a movement demanding the resignation of President Aleksandar Vucic and early elections. The recent blockades were also a response to the arrest of numerous protesters following a massive rally the previous night. President Vucic has rejected the demands, accusing "foreign powers" of fueling the unrest and vowing not to concede to what he termed "terror."</p>

Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, Moscow offered only verbal condemnations and mediation efforts instead of tangible military or diplomatic support.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and researchers are beginning to understand why. Studies indicate that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs are a primary cause. In particular, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into battery power, create a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. Researchers are now exploring solutions, such as using specifically designed audio tones, to help counteract the physical sensations that lead to motion sickness in EV passengers.</p>
