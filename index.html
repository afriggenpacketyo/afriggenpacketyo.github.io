          <p>Cassie Ventura's cross-examination in the Sean Combs trial involved scrutiny of text messages between her and Combs, with the defense attempting to portray her as having more agency in their relationship than she claimed. Messages from 2007 showed Ventura expressing love and frustration, while texts from 2012 referenced "freak off" sessions and expressions of love. The defense questioned whether these messages contradicted Ventura's testimony about her lack of agency and the nature of their relationship. Ventura acknowledged writing the messages but maintained her overall narrative of the relationship. </p>

          <p>China has temporarily lifted export restrictions on 28 American companies following a trade agreement with the Trump administration in Switzerland.

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with softened tariffs on China, the company may soon be forced to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that tariffs are impeding Walmart's ability to maintain low prices for customers, despite the recent reduction in tariff rates on Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days. Rising cost pressures from tariffs, particularly on goods from China like electronics and toys, are impacting the retailer. Walmart will try to absorb some costs but anticipates price hikes later this month and has pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House proposes making Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while adding new reductions, including eliminating taxes on overtime pay. The bill would provide an average $1,300 tax reduction, including a new $4,000 deduction for those 65 and older with income limits, and increases the standard deduction for all taxpayers. It also extends and increases the Child Tax Credit, eliminates the 1099-K reporting rule, increases the pass-through deduction for small businesses, and allows car loan interest to be deducted. Democrats oppose the bill for its cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, and some tax cuts expire after 2028.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. could face more frequent and persistent supply shocks, posing a challenge for the economy and central banks. This warning comes after the Fed decided to hold interest rates steady amid economic uncertainty influenced by the Trump administration's tariff policies. Powell acknowledged that higher real rates could lead to greater inflation volatility compared to the 2010s. His comments reflect concerns about the impact of trade policies on supply chains and the potential for economic instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several Republicans have declined to run in key U.S. Senate races, raising concerns about the party's ability to recruit competitive candidates. The Georgia and Michigan seats could be toss-ups after high-profile Republicans opted out of the 2026 elections. Some Republicans believe Trump's influence has made it difficult to recruit centrist candidates. Others disagree, arguing that candidate decisions are personal and that public opinion can shift. The NRSC is considering involvement in Senate primaries on a case-by-case basis, while Democrats see opportunities to expand their Senate map.</p>

Offers in Compromise can settle debt for less than the full amount, and Currently Not Collectible status temporarily halts collection activities.
