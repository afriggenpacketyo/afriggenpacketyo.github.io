          <p>Actor Ben Stiller opened up about feeling like a "failure" during his separation from wife Christine Taylor, contrasting it with his parents' long marriage. In his new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," he explores his parents' comedy duo and the impact of working together on a relationship. Stiller and Taylor separated in 2017 after 17 years but reconciled during the COVID-19 pandemic, moving back into the same house with their children. Taylor also shared her perspective, noting they needed time to grow individually.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have revised their pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series, pushing Shohei Ohtani's next start to later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts stated that Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Game 2 instead, allowing him to maintain his regular rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This strategic shift sacrifices Ohtani's ability to make two starts but provides him with more time to focus solely on his hitting, following a challenging performance in the NL Division Series. The team hopes this adjustment will help Ohtani recalibrate his offensive game.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has recorded 1,563 confirmed measles cases this year, marking the highest annual total in over three decades, with some experts suggesting the true number could be much higher. Outbreaks are occurring in multiple states, including South Carolina, Utah, and Arizona, predominantly affecting unvaccinated individuals. Measles, one of the most contagious diseases, was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but declining vaccination rates have created vulnerable pockets. Public health officials are urging vaccinations, expressing concern over the current spread and its potential for severe outcomes.</p>

          <p>Swimming Australia has issued a statement refuting "fake news" and "fabricated quotes" falsely attributed to Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan concerning transgender swimmer Lia Thomas.

Swimming Australia confirmed O'Callaghan had not made such comments and requested the posts be removed.

Sorkin highlights the historical context of rampant speculation and heavy borrowing that characterized the 1920s, noting concerns about decreasing regulatory "guardrails" designed to protect investors since 1929.

This non-invasive technique detects altered blood flow in the face, with the nose cooling as blood is redirected to eyes and ears in a "fight or flight" response. Researchers believe this "nasal dip" could be a "game changer" for managing harmful stress, potentially identifying risk markers for anxiety or depression. The method is also being developed to monitor stress in non-communicative individuals, including babies and great apes.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice-President JD Vance has warned that more "painful" job cuts are imminent if the government shutdown continues, adding to the thousands of federal employees already on unpaid leave. Democrats are opposing a short-term funding bill, demanding the inclusion of federal health insurance subsidies, while Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham, refuse. The Trump administration initially announced layoffs for over 4,000 staff, including CDC employees, though some were later reinstated. Despite the impasse, President Trump directed funds to ensure military personnel receive their wages, highlighting the varying impacts of the political standoff.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, is actively pursuing a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming to reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. The potential acquisition, spearheaded by David Ellison of Skydance Media, would consolidate major media assets like HBO, CNN, CBS News, and Warner Bros. studios. This move is driven by Paramount's need for more content to compete with streaming giants and Warner Bros. Discovery's plan to divide its assets, despite having reduced significant debt.</p>
