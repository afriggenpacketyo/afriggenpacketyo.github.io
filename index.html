          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing, with a cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, following no winners in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This historic accumulation marks the sixth time the Powerball jackpot has surpassed $1 billion in its 33-year history, drawing immense public attention and participation across 45 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The continuous rollover, with no grand prize winner since May 31st, has fueled the prize's growth, significantly boosted by increased ticket sales leading up to each drawing. Despite the daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million, hopeful participants continue to purchase tickets for the Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday drawings, dreaming of life-changing wealth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to quickly reverse an appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's imposed tariffs illegal under an emergency powers law. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the appeals court decision creates significant uncertainty for ongoing foreign negotiations and jeopardizes existing trade deals, emphasizing the high stakes involved for national policy. Conversely, small businesses battered by these tariffs have twice prevailed in lower courts, highlighting the economic harm and uncertainty caused by the import taxes. This legal challenge will determine the extent of presidential power to regulate imports during emergencies, potentially impacting substantial tariff revenues and future trade relations.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite growing economic concerns. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed, though Nidec Corp shares plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also gained on positive household spending data, while South Korea's Kospi saw a modest increase. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 reversed course to fall, reflecting volatile trading conditions. Global bond markets remain under pressure, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% after a court ruling on tariffs, adding to the complex economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intense wildfires that ravaged Spain and Portugal this summer, claiming at least eight lives and forcing tens of thousands to evacuate, were massively fueled by climate change, according to a new report. The analysis by World Weather Attribution states that climate change, primarily driven by fossil fuel burning, made the weather conditions for these fires 40 times more frequent and 30% more intense. These devastating fires scorched over 640,000 hectares, breaking European records for burned land and demonstrating the escalating crisis. Experts emphasize the critical importance of sustainable land management and an urgent global shift away from fossil fuels to mitigate future catastrophic events, as rising temperatures create hotter, drier, and more ferocious wildfire conditions.</p>

          <p>A new survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that Chinese citizens hold a more nuanced view of their nation's role in global affairs than often perceived by Americans. While optimistic about China's future, economy, and military, nearly half of respondents expressed interest in a shared leadership role, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence with the United States. This perspective suggests potential avenues for reducing US-China tensions, despite ongoing skepticism among the Chinese public about American intentions. However, the survey authors cautioned that some findings might be influenced by self-censorship, reflecting the complexities of public opinion in China.</p>

          <p>A controversial Texas measure, allowing residents to sue out-of-state abortion pill providers for up to $100,000, has reached Governor Greg Abbott's desk. Supporters view it as a crucial tool to enforce the state's abortion ban, while opponents condemn it as an attempt to intimidate providers and encourage vigilantism, with legal challenges expected. The bill includes provisions to protect women who receive pills and bars men who committed sexual assault from suing. This legislation highlights the ongoing national debate over abortion access, particularly regarding medication abortion, which has seen increased use since Roe v Wade was overturned.</p>

          <p>A long-lost 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, looted by the Nazis during World War II, has been recovered in Argentina. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his death while escaping in 1940, after which his collection was seized by Hermann Göring. The painting was discovered last month in an online real estate listing, unwittingly uploaded by a daughter of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who escaped to Argentina. This recovery brings a measure of justice to the Goudstikker family and highlights ongoing efforts to repatriate stolen art.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers endured another frustrating defeat, losing 3-0 to the lowly Pittsburgh Pirates, marking their fourth consecutive loss at PNC Park. Manager Dave Roberts expressed dismay over the team's inability to capitalize on a bases-loaded, no-outs situation in the second inning, calling it a pivotal moment that "flipped the momentum." The Dodgers left 11 baserunners stranded and failed to record a hit in seven at-bats with men in scoring position, epitomizing their perplexing 22-29 slump since July 4. Despite their struggles, the second-place Padres have not gained ground, offering a slight reprieve, but the team acknowledges the urgent need for improved performance.</p>

Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard's argument that the freeze was retaliatory, violating First Amendment protections after the university rejected demands for reforms. The ruling vacates the freezing orders and bars their enforcement, preventing the halt of critical research projects across various fields. While acknowledging Harvard's past issues with antisemitism, the judge concluded that fighting antisemitism was not the administration's "true aim," but rather a pretext for ideological motives.</p>
