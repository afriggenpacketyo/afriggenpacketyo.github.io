          <p>North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed a bill that would have restricted access to sexually explicit materials in libraries, citing concerns about overreach and censorship.  The bill would have required libraries to keep such materials in areas inaccessible to minors, with non-compliance leading to potential prosecution.  The governor argued that the bill was vaguely worded, imposed unfair burdens on librarians, and could have negative consequences for communities. This highlights ongoing debates about censorship and access to information in libraries.</p>
