        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing India's continued importation of Russian oil as undermining efforts to counter Russia's war in Ukraine. This action raises the total tariff rate on Indian imports to 50%, one of the highest imposed by the U.S. The White House stated the measure is intended to deter countries from supporting Russia's economy. India has criticized the move as "unjustified," arguing that it began importing Russian oil at the encouragement of the U.S. to stabilize global energy markets and noting that the U.S. itself continues to trade with Russia.

          <p>A new study published in the medical journal JAMA estimates that recent wildfires in Los Angeles County were responsible for approximately 440 more deaths than officially recorded. Researchers attribute these excess fatalities to factors like poor air quality exacerbating pre-existing health conditions and disruptions to healthcare access during the emergency. The article also highlights related research on the long-term health impacts of the Maui wildfires, which found increased rates of heart, lung, and psychological issues, as well as a spike in suicides and overdoses. The findings underscore the broader mortality burden of climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Dresden, Germany, evacuated approximately 17,000 people after a 250-kg (500-pound) British bomb from World War II was discovered during construction work. The unexploded ordnance was found near the partially collapsed Carola Bridge, requiring a large-scale operation to safely defuse it. The evacuation zone included historic landmarks like the Frauenkirche, and around 330 police officers were deployed to manage the situation. Such discoveries remain a regular occurrence in Germany, serving as a stark reminder of the war's lasting legacy even 80 years after its conclusion.</p>

          <p>The president of the largest U.S. railroad labor union, SMART-TD, has warned of potential transportation "meltdowns" if the proposed merger between Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern proceeds without addressing labor concerns. The union, which plans to petition the government to block the deal, cites safety records and the risk of significant job losses as primary issues. The leader drew parallels to past rail mergers that led to massive operational disruptions. The union fears that creating the nation's first coast-to-coast freight operator without their input could lead to repeating past mistakes and harming both workers and shippers.

The company's forecast for the upcoming first quarter and full year also disappointed investors, signaling a slowdown from its recent rapid growth trajectory and raising concerns about its near-term prospects.

During his speech in Strasbourg, he criticized the Turkish government for police violence and "democratic backsliding." He was detained on charges of "publicly disseminating misleading information" and "inciting hatred." The Council of Europe's congress condemned the arrest as "scandalous and unacceptable," calling for his immediate release and highlighting broader concerns about the state of democracy and freedom of expression in Turkey.</p>

This pledge will increase Apple's total domestic investment to $600 billion over the next four years. The initiative reportedly includes a new "American Manufacturing Program" aimed at bringing more of the company's supply chain and advanced manufacturing processes to the U.S. The announcement follows President Trump's persistent calls for Apple to produce more of its products domestically rather than in countries like China and India.</p>

The talks occurred just days before a White House deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe economic penalties, which could include tariffs on countries purchasing its oil. The Kremlin described the conversation as "useful and constructive," touching on both the conflict and potential strategic cooperation. This diplomatic effort comes as Russia continues its attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas, and Western analysts suggest Putin is stalling for time rather than engaging in serious negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has characterized multi-billion dollar investment commitments from trade partners like the EU and Japan as "gifts" or a "signing bonus" for reducing U.S. tariffs. However, this portrayal is disputed by the trading partners themselves, who describe the pledges in more aspirational terms and note they are primarily from private sector entities, which governments cannot compel. The article highlights a significant disconnect in how these trade agreements are viewed, with the White House warning of potential retaliation if the investment commitments are not met. This discrepancy raises questions about the enforceability and true nature of these large-scale financial promises in international trade negotiations.</p>

Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant price drops of nearly 15% and 19% respectively over the last three years. This trend is attributed to higher housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising or stubbornly high prices, creating a divided national housing market where buyer and seller experiences vary greatly by region.

The research, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, showed that 10- and 18-year-olds who spent more time on devices like phones and computers had higher risks for conditions such as high blood pressure and insulin resistance. Each additional hour of screen time was associated with a measurable increase in overall risk.

          <p>This article explores the financial options available to homeowners in retirement, focusing on the choice between selling their home and obtaining a reverse mortgage. Experts suggest a reverse mortgage can be a valuable tool for those on a fixed income who wish to stay in their home, as it converts equity into cash without requiring monthly payments. However, it reduces the inheritance for heirs and comes with its own fees and risks. Selling the home offers a lump-sum of cash and the ability to downsize, but may have tax consequences and depends heavily on local market conditions. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, location, and personal goals.</p>

According to the safari company that organized the trip, Watkins was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by a Cape buffalo he was tracking.

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock dropped over 5% after the chipmaker's earnings missed analyst expectations and it raised concerns about its ability to ship certain AI chips to China. CEO Lisa Su highlighted that U.S. export restrictions had a negative impact on revenue, and the company's forward-looking guidance did not account for potential sales of its specialized chips designed for the Chinese market. While overall revenue grew, investors expressed concern over the uncertainty of restarting China shipments and the performance of the company's datacenter division, leading to a pessimistic market reaction.

          <p>An Airbnb host in Manchester has been suspended after declining a booking request from two women explicitly because they are from Wales. Jemma Louise Gough and Jamie Lee Watkins from Cwmbran were left "gobsmacked" when their request was refunded and the host replied, "Because you're from Wales." The pair, who had booked the stay to attend a concert, expressed their shock and pride in their Welsh identity. Airbnb stated that discrimination has no place on its platform and has launched an investigation into the incident involving the host, who was paradoxically listed as a "superhost."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2019 decision in Rucho v. Common Cause is directly responsible for the current wave of extreme partisan gerrymandering, such as the one being pursued in Texas. The author contends that by ruling that federal courts cannot intervene in partisan redistricting, the court's conservative majority gave a green light to state legislatures to rig electoral maps without fear of legal consequence. Justice Elena Kagan's dissent, which warned the ruling would damage democracy and fuel polarization, is presented as prescient. The piece concludes by urging Chief Justice John Roberts to reconsider the court's stance to protect the principle that governmental power derives from the people, not the other way around.</p>

          <p>This article provides a personal account of attending a free class for nervous fliers taught by a former commercial pilot, "Captain Ron" Nielsen. The program aims to help people manage their aerophobia, which affects millions of Americans, through a combination of education, practical tips, and exposure therapy on a stationary aircraft. The author explores the psychological roots of the fear, such as a lack of control, and shares stories of fellow attendees. While not a complete cure, the experience provided the author with new coping mechanisms and a sense of community, reframing the fear as a manageable challenge rather than a shameful secret.</p>

          <p>The University of California has entered into negotiations with the federal government after the Trump administration suspended $584 million in research grants at UCLA. The freeze was imposed over allegations that the university acted with "deliberate indifference" to antisemitism on campus. UC President James B. Milliken stated the cuts would be a "death knell" for vital research in medicine, science, and energy, and do nothing to address antisemitism. The administration has threatened to sue UCLA if a resolution is not reached, a tactic similar to that used against other universities that resulted in large financial settlements.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly considering the termination of its $7 billion Solar for All program, which was designed to provide affordable solar energy to low-income communities. The program had awarded grants to 60 recipients, including state agencies and tribal coalitions, with the goal of helping 900,000 households reduce their energy bills. The potential cancellation has caused alarm among grant recipients and advocates, who warn that it would be a "devastating" blow to energy affordability and a "broken promise" to disadvantaged communities, particularly tribal nations that face high energy burdens.</p>
