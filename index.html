          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced 21 individuals, including prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi, to lengthy prison terms on charges including attempting to overthrow the government and terrorism-related offenses. Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old leader of the Ennahda party, received a 14-year sentence, adding to previous convictions. His defense team claims the verdict is based on false testimony from an anonymous witness. This event is part of a broader crackdown on dissent by President Kais Saied, who critics accuse of dismantling the country's democratic institutions established after the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>State inspectors in Texas approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a catastrophic flood on the Guadalupe River killed dozens of campers and staff. While the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, the specifics of the plan are not detailed in the released records. The approval came despite National Weather Service warnings of potential flooding, raising questions about the camp's preparedness and decision not to relocate its 650 attendees to higher ground. The tragedy has intensified scrutiny of the adequacy of disaster warnings and response protocols in the flood-prone region.</p>

          <h2>China's Producer Prices See Largest Decline in Nearly Two Years, Deepening Deflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 23:26:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's producer price index (PPI) fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, marking the steepest decline in almost two years and extending a long-running deflationary trend. This drop was worse than economists' forecasts and reflects a deepening price war among manufacturers. In contrast, the consumer price index (CPI) saw a slight 0.1% increase, returning to growth after four months of declines. Despite the CPI rebound, which was aided by a government subsidy program, economists warn that persistent overcapacity and weak property sector momentum continue to pose significant risks to the economy.

          <p>The Department of Justice has secured guilty pleas from two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, for their roles in selling a rifle to Ryan Routh, the man charged with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Court documents state that Cooper acted as a middleman for Oxendine, who sold Routh an SKS rifle for $350 in cash. Routh was allegedly found with a similar rifle outside Trump's golf club six weeks later. The defendants claimed they were unaware of Routh's alleged plans, though prosecutors noted Cooper gave inconsistent statements and admitted to lying out of fear.</p>

          <p>Experts say the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River was a known risk, as the region is historically dubbed "Flash Flood Alley" due to its terrain that reacts quickly to heavy rainfall. Hydrologists at the West Gulf River Forecast Center recognized the dangerous conditions, leading the National Weather Service to issue a flash flood watch hours before the disaster. Historical data shows the river has experienced major, deadly flooding over a dozen times in the last century. The overnight timing of the storm and increased population density likely exacerbated the tragedy by hindering the reception of and reaction to emergency warnings.</p>

          <p>The prospect of additional U.S. tariffs under Donald Trump is casting a shadow over the economies of Japan and South Korea, two key Asian allies already impacted by existing duties. Both export-dependent nations are grappling with economic slowdowns, and new tariffs on crucial exports like automobiles and steel could exacerbate the situation. Trump has threatened a 25% tariff on both countries, which would significantly impact their GDP. While officials express hope for a negotiated deal, economists warn that the new levies could push Japan's already fragile economy into a recession and further slow South Korea's growth.

The Brics group, which has expanded to include several other emerging economies, aims to reform Western-dominated international institutions and unite the Global South.

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants for the Taliban's supreme leader, Haibatullah Akhundzada, and its chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani. The charges are for the crime against humanity of persecution based on gender, specifically targeting girls and women in Afghanistan. The court alleges that since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban have severely deprived females of fundamental rights to education, movement, and expression. The Taliban dismissed the warrants as "nonsense." The ICC, which has no enforcement power, relies on member states to execute its warrants.</p>

The operation, which involves ICE, CBP, the National Guard, and U.S. Marines, has been heavily criticized by local and state officials for creating a climate of fear in immigrant communities. Governor Gavin Newsom condemned a recent sweep through MacArthur Park as a "disgrace." The crackdown represents a test of the Trump administration's executive authority in a city with leadership hostile to its mass deportation policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows an investigation into whether these imports affect national security. The decision caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. The new levy, which matches recent tariffs on steel and aluminum, is expected to take effect by the end of the month. This action is part of a broader protectionist strategy that includes looming tariff threats on other sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, aimed at boosting American industry but raising concerns among firms that rely on imported materials.

          <p>The catastrophic flash floods in Texas have brought renewed attention to significant staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA, under the Trump administration. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, including meteorologists and hydrologists, raising concerns about the agency's ability to handle extreme weather events. While experts believe the NWS performed well in this instance, they warn that continued cuts could degrade forecasting models and response capabilities. The San Antonio NWS office, which led the forecast, currently has an 18% vacancy rate, highlighting the staffing challenges facing the agency.</p>

Other recommendations include reserving jury trials for the most serious crimes and increasing the use of out-of-court resolutions.

This article explores why it has been difficult to hold powerful figures accountable, pointing to a culture of silence reinforced by non-disclosure agreements and fears of career sabotage. Experts argue that in hip-hop, this is compounded by forces of racism and a desire to protect a genre that provides rare paths to success for Black artists. The phenomenon of "black protectionism" can make it especially difficult for victims, particularly Black women, to speak out.</p>

This action was part of a broader crackdown by the ASA, which banned eight other similar adverts from various companies for breaching its code.
