          <p>President Trump has fired Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who was the first woman and African American to hold the position since 2016. The termination was communicated via email by a White House personnel official, leading to strong criticism from Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who described the action as an effort to ban books and whitewash history. Hayden, who previously served as CEO of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, emphasized the significance of her role given historical restrictions on people of color's access to literacy. Democratic Rep. Joe Morelle condemned the firing as an ignorant decision impacting America's libraries and copyrighted economic interests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a mines developer, producers of tungsten products in developed nations are realizing the necessity of diversifying their raw material supply sources after China's tungsten exports suddenly stopped after three decades of readily available exports. Beijing recently added tungsten to its export restriction list amid trade tensions with the U.S., causing panic in the industry. The element, crucial for cutting tools, machinery, and defense applications, has not been commercially mined in the U.S. for a decade. The CEO of Almonty Industries, Lewis Black, said that US defense contractors face another looming supply chain challenge: they must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have not boosted its stock market due to persistent worries about economic deterioration and the ongoing trade war with the U.S. While the measures align with economic priorities laid out in a recent Politburo meeting, analysts view them as a temporary fix rather than a comprehensive solution. Unlike previous stimulus efforts, this round is more targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support.

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of a deceased veteran, Christopher Pelkey, to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas. This unprecedented use of AI in legal proceedings has ignited debate about the potential for manipulation and deception in victim impact statements. The AI avatar, created using the victim's image and voice profile, delivered a message of forgiveness, which the judge praised. While victims have broad latitude in Arizona courts, legal experts are divided on whether this use of AI could constitute reversible error, raising concerns about the ethical implications of AI in the justice system.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis to secure a trade agreement. This shift signals a departure from India's protectionist stance, which has historically relied on high import duties. Experts believe a trade deal with the U.S. could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding access to global markets. The US is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade hitting $129 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>Three former police officers were acquitted on all charges in the state trial over the fatal beating of Tyre Nichols in Memphis. The defense successfully argued for a jury from outside Memphis and deflected blame onto other officers. This verdict adds to a mixed record of outcomes for officers accused of wrongdoing since the death of George Floyd. The acquittal has sparked outrage in Memphis, with many feeling it contradicts the violence captured on video. RowVaughn Wells, Nicholsâ€™s mother, expressed disappointment, stating the jury failed her son.</p>

          <p>West Point is facing scrutiny after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the military academies to remove ideologies deemed "divisive." The academy responded by scrapping classes and purging works by Black authors, leading to faculty resignations.

The situation highlights the challenges faced by military leaders in balancing academic principles with political pressures. This comes after an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth led to cancelled classes, book bans and an argument about American greatness.</p>

Director Alex Ross Perry's approach aims to capture the band's essence by presenting them as "the world's most important and influential band" within a fictional world. The documentary includes interviews with band members, behind-the-scenes footage, and examines the band's impact on music and culture.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an AI tool that can estimate a personâ€™s biological age by analyzing photos of their faces. The tool, called FaceAge, was trained on over 56,000 images and found that cancer patients often appeared older than their chronological age. Researchers suggest that biological age estimates could help doctors make treatment decisions. However, experts raise concerns about the tool's limitations, including its bias towards white faces and potential misuse for denying insurance coverage or medical treatment.</p>
