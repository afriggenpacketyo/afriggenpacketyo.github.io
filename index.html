          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after their controversial deployment. President Trump had federalized the troops to address protests against ICE activities, a move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom. While the administration claims the withdrawal is due to subsiding lawlessness, Newsom is calling for the remaining forces to be sent home, stating they are being used as political pawns without a clear mission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that seeks to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is part of a broader Republican push to support the crypto industry and would allow banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins.

The article compiles statements made by Xi since 2012, emphasizing China's goal to promote trade and investment liberalization while opposing the building of economic walls and barriers, in a clear contrast to U.S. policies under President Trump.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.7% year-over-year in June, indicating a slight acceleration in U.S. inflation. This increase was driven by rising costs for food and energy, with significant price hikes in items like eggs and coffee. The data suggests that new tariffs may be starting to impact consumer prices, although core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, rose by a slightly less-than-expected 2.9%. Analysts believe this report makes a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in July highly unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation, requiring it to close for five years starting in 2027. The project will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants. A key goal of the ambitious makeover is to upgrade the heating system with heat pumps, which will reduce the building's carbon emissions to net zero while preserving the iconic Victorian structure for future generations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its products can help people feel calm and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that the advert's language, which promoted ingredients like magnesium and L-theanine as having calming effects, was not compliant with regulations for marketing food and supplements. The ASA ruled that the advert implied the drink could treat or cure human disease, which is prohibited, and ordered it not to appear again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has sharply criticized ex-Prime Minister David Cameron for his handling of the 2016 Brexit referendum, calling it "extremely cavalier." Smith, who served as chief whip under Theresa May, argued that putting such a fundamental question to the public without a clear plan for either outcome was unforgivable. He stated that crucial issues, like the Irish border, were overlooked, leading to years of political turmoil as if the decision were "some sort of Eton game."</p>

          <p>A Seoul court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the intelligence chief who assassinated South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues he acted to prevent greater bloodshed and restore democracy, not to seize power. The case is re-examining whether his conviction in a military court, held under martial law, was just. The retrial forces a national re-evaluation of two polarizing figures and the country's turbulent path to democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff of committing mortgage fraud, alleging he misrepresented his primary residence to secure a cheaper home loan. Schiff, a prominent Democratic critic of Trump, dismissed the claim as a baseless and false attempt at political retaliation. A spokesperson for Schiff stated that he has always been transparent about owning homes in both California and the D.C. area and has followed all laws and guidance. The accusation represents a significant escalation in the long-running feud between the two politicians.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Ukraine "shouldn't" use its military to strike Moscow, clarifying the U.S. position on the limits of its support. The comment follows reports that Trump had asked Ukrainian President Zelenskyy if it were possible to hit major Russian cities, a question the White House said was taken out of context. This development comes as the Trump administration signals growing frustration with Russia's ongoing war, threatening steep tariffs if a peace deal is not reached, while also managing the risk of escalation.</p>

The call for transparency puts Johnson at odds with President Trump and reflects growing pressure from some Republicans for more information.

          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills, including the Genius Act for stablecoins, failed to clear a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives. The surprising defeat, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats to block the legislation, is a significant setback for the crypto industry and a rare instance of House Republicans defying President Trump's direction. The failure to establish rules for debate leaves the future of the bills uncertain and highlights ongoing divisions within the GOP on how to regulate digital assets.</p>
