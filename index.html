        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist and executive counselor analyzes the common psychological factors that can lead individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, to engage in extramarital affairs. The article identifies five key pitfalls: a lifelong habit of being 'good' leading to a midlife identity crisis, perfectionism stemming from trauma, poor personal boundaries developed in childhood, being in an abusive marriage, and experiencing a recent significant loss. These situations can create an emotional void or a breaking point, making an affair seem like a form of escape or self-discovery. The piece concludes that understanding these underlying pressures is crucial for personal and professional well-being.</p>

          <p>Former reality TV star Kate Gosselin has responded to her estranged son Collin's social media posts alleging she was responsible for pitting her children against each other. In a TikTok comment, Kate cryptically wrote, "He knows why..," in response to a fan referencing Collin's claims that the siblings were "forced apart." The family, featured on "Jon & Kate Plus 8," has had a publicly fractured relationship since Kate and Jon Gosselin's divorce. Collin has previously accused his mother of abuse and of institutionalizing him to prevent him from revealing family secrets, allegations she has denied.</p>

          <p>The governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of their states' National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. This move is in support of the Trump administration's initiative to address what it has declared a public safety emergency due to crime and homelessness in the capital. West Virginia will send 300-400 troops, South Carolina will deploy 200, and Ohio will contribute 150 military police. The deployment follows President Trump's order placing the D.C. police under federal control, a decision that has sparked protests and legal challenges from local officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin escalated dramatically into a powerful Category 5 storm in the Caribbean before slightly weakening, a process known as rapid intensification. This phenomenon, where wind speeds increase by over 58 mph in 24 hours, was fueled by unusually warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. While the hurricane is not projected to make landfall in the continental U.S., its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Experts note that climate change is making such rapid intensification events more common, complicating forecasting and emergency preparations for coastal communities.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched to the White House to protest the Trump administration's recent deployment of National Guard troops and its attempt to assume federal control over the city's police force. The protest follows the declaration of a "crime emergency" in Washington, D.C., which critics and some residents argue is an overreach of federal power and an exaggeration of the city's public safety issues. The demonstration occurred after a federal court blocked the administration's effort to appoint an emergency police commissioner. Organizers have stated that more protests are planned to oppose what they describe as a move toward fascism.</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce in tariff escalations, Chinese merchants selling on international platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain anxious about the unpredictability of U.S. trade policies. At a recent trade fair, sellers expressed that the threat of tariffs creates significant business uncertainty, making it difficult to plan for the future. For example, one electronics company had to halt its U.S. operations for two months earlier in the year when trade relations soured. This ongoing concern highlights the fragile nature of cross-border e-commerce and its vulnerability to geopolitical tensions between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump has shifted his position, now advocating for a permanent peace agreement over a simple ceasefire in Ukraine. Trump is reportedly urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept a deal that would involve Ukraine ceding control of the Donbas region in exchange for Russia freezing the current front lines elsewhere. This represents a significant policy change, as Trump had previously focused on securing a rapid ceasefire. Zelenskyy, who is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington, has reiterated that a ceasefire must precede any long-term settlement talks.</p>

Some parents utilize local food pantries that provide surplus groceries for a small fee, which they describe as a lifeline. These measures highlight the growing pressure on household budgets, as the absence of subsidized school meals adds a significant cost for many families.</p>

However, the rise of online fast-fashion giants like Shein and Temu, which can replicate trends at lower prices and faster speeds, has eroded its market share.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to travel to Washington D.C. for a crucial meeting with President Donald Trump. The visit follows Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after which Trump publicly shifted his stance to favor a permanent peace settlement over a ceasefire. Reports suggest Putin offered to freeze the front lines if Ukraine cedes the Donbas region, a proposal Zelenskyy is now under pressure to consider. Zelenskyy stated that while a conversation between leaders is important, Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire complicates the path toward a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a plan to move Palestinians to the southern part of the Gaza Strip in preparation for a renewed military offensive targeting Gaza City, which it describes as the last major stronghold of Hamas. The military's civilian affairs agency, COGAT, stated that the supply of tents and shelter equipment for the displaced population would resume on Sunday via the Kerem Shalom crossing. This development comes as Israeli forces intensify their operations on the outskirts of Gaza City. Meanwhile, families of hostages held by Hamas are calling for widespread protests to demand a deal to end the war.</p>

The woman suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be revived. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian crisis in the region, where UN-backed experts have warned that famine conditions are unfolding.

          <p>Recent data indicates Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's slipped to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing consumer interest in innovative form factors, particularly Samsung's new foldable Z series phones, which offer a fresh alternative to the standard smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, its recent stock underperformance reflects this renewed competition. Analysts speculate Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservationists are raising alarms over proposed legislation that would weaken the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act, a landmark U.S. environmental law. Critics of the act argue that its success in helping some species recover warrants loosening regulations to better support industries like energy development and fishing. However, environmental advocates argue the law is more critical than ever, pointing to species like the North Atlantic right whale that remain critically endangered. They also highlight new threats from climate change, such as marine heatwaves and algal blooms, which are causing widespread harm to marine mammals and the ocean ecosystems they inhabit.</p>

Despite her valid work permit and pending residency application, the minor administrative error led to her and her son being transported to a detention facility in Texas.

          <p>This article provides context on the nationwide Air Canada strike, which has grounded the carrier's fleet and prompted federal government intervention. The dispute stems from a breakdown in contract negotiations between the airline and the union representing 10,000 flight attendants, with wages and unpaid work being the primary sticking points. The union rejected the airline's latest compensation offer, calling it a pay cut when accounting for inflation. The government has now forced both parties into binding arbitration to end the strike, which was causing widespread disruption to travelers and the Canadian economy.</p>
