          <p>The Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to dismantle Google's advertising technology empire, arguing that the tech giant holds an illegal monopoly over the system that places ads on websites. During a court hearing, government lawyers outlined a plan to force Google to divest tools used by online publishers to sell ad space and the technology connecting publishers with advertisers. Google's legal team contends that a breakup would contradict legal precedent and compromise privacy and security measures. The judge will convene a hearing in September to determine remedies, with the government pushing for the sale of Google's ad exchange and publisher ad tools. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>A United Nations report indicates that the number of civilian deaths in Ukraine has significantly increased since cease-fire talks began in February, with Russian strikes intensifying and targeting civilian areas. The report notes a 46% increase in civilian casualties in April compared to the same period last year, accompanied by increased attacks on cities. Analysts suggest that the rise in violence is a strategic move by both sides to gain an advantage before a potential truce. Despite the ongoing negotiations, the heightened attacks have left Ukrainian citizens on edge and fearful of accepting unfavorable peace terms. Optimism Score: 25</p>

While the AI comments were surprisingly effective in changing minds, Redditors and internet researchers condemned the experiment as unethical.

          <p>Stock markets in the US and Europe surged following a US jobs report that showed a better-than-expected pace of hiring in April, easing concerns about the economic impact of Trump's tariffs. The FTSE 100 in the UK reached a record winning streak, while Germany's Dax and France's Cac also rose sharply. The jobs report fueled optimism that the US economy is resilient enough to withstand the fallout from the tariffs, and reports of potential trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington further boosted market sentiment.
