          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, but with restrictions limiting its use to older adults and those with high-risk medical conditions. The decision requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, potentially costing the company millions. The FDA's decision reflects a more restrictive approach to COVID-19 vaccines and skepticism about vaccines from within the Trump administration. Experts express concern about limiting access to the vaccine, especially for healthy individuals under 65.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down on Saturday, marking the end of four decades of operation in line with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in Pingtung County ceased operations as the island moves to phase out nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster. The government's ability to fully achieve its goal remains uncertain, however, due to other factors.</p>
