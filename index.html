          <p>Republican Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has announced his resignation from Congress, effective July 20. This departure reduces the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212, potentially creating more challenges for Speaker Mike Johnson's legislative agenda. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public office to start a private business focused on competing with China. He has served in Congress since his election in 2018.</p>

          <p>Violence in Gaza on Saturday resulted in injuries to two American aid workers from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation during a grenade attack in Khan Younis. Concurrently, Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people, including a doctor and his children, in the Muwasi coastal area. Additional reports indicate at least 10 other Palestinians were killed while seeking food aid amid the dire humanitarian crisis. These events unfold as ceasefire negotiations show some movement, though significant disagreements remain between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring further actions to limit the influence of China's dominant drone manufacturing industry, following a recent executive order. This move reflects ongoing efforts by Washington to curb Beijing's technological reach, though industry experts note the significant challenge of removing Chinese products from global supply chains. Analysts suggest that a potential ban could disrupt the market and increase costs for commercial drone operators in the U.S., as there are few non-Chinese alternatives available. The policy is viewed by some as a negotiation tactic in the broader economic competition.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team defeated Argentina 35-12 in their first Test match in La Plata, driven by a dominant second-half performance. Fly-half George Ford, earning his 100th cap, was instrumental, orchestrating the offense and contributing points through a drop goal and penalties. England overcame being reduced to 13 men in the first half to score four tries after the break, with Tom Roebuck scoring twice. Despite a brief comeback from the Pumas, England's composed play and strong defense secured a convincing win ahead of the second Test next week.</p>

This announcement comes after a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, largely over a major spending bill. Musk, a major political donor, has framed the new party as a response to what he calls excessive government spending.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, the full autobiography of Mark Twain has been published 100 years after his death, revealing his uncensored thoughts on his life and times. The work was compiled from years of daily dictations where he spoke freely, knowing the contents would not be revealed while those he criticized were still alive. Curators at UC Berkeley have worked for years to reconstruct the unconventional, non-linear narrative. The book contains sharp critiques of figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw heartbreak over his daughter's death, offering a new, unfiltered look at the iconic American author.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris anticipates a "great race" at the British Grand Prix, suggesting that as many as six cars from Red Bull, McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari have a realistic chance of winning. Qualifying was exceptionally tight, with the top six drivers separated by just 0.23 seconds. Teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while Ferrari and McLaren have focused more on cornering performance. This strategic diversity, combined with the close pace and potential for rain, sets the stage for a highly competitive and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing criticism after using the antisemitic term "Shylock" to describe some bankers during a rally in Iowa. The term, derived from the ruthless Jewish moneylender in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," is widely considered an offensive slur. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's use of the term "very troubling and irresponsible." When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of its antisemitic connotations, stating he simply viewed it as a term for a moneylender charging high rates.</p>

Burns believes that despite current political divisions, which he sees as a recurring feature of U.S. history, the nation's founding principles provide a path for unity.

          <p>An analysis using ChatGPT to explore tax fairness reveals that the wealthiest Americans often have a lower effective tax burden not because of their income tax rate, but because of how wealth is taxed compared to wages. While billionaires may pay a similar or higher rate on declared income, the bulk of their financial gains comes from the appreciation of assets like stocks, which are not taxed until sold. The article highlights the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, where the wealthy live off tax-free loans against their assets and then pass them to heirs, largely avoiding the taxes that wage earners pay immediately.
