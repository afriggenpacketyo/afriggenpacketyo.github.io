          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union are engaged in intense negotiations aimed at resetting their relationship post-Brexit, with discussions focusing on defense, trade, fishing rights, and youth mobility. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are leading the efforts to strike a deal that addresses key issues such as access to the EU defense fund and reciprocal youth mobility schemes. While government sources indicate substantial progress, some Conservative and Reform UK leaders have criticized the potential agreement as a "surrender," highlighting the political sensitivities surrounding the negotiations. The outcome of these talks could significantly impact the future of UK-EU relations, particularly in areas of trade and security. </p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill has advanced in the House after negotiations with conservative Republicans who initially opposed the legislation due to insufficient spending cuts. The bill, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term and increases military and border security spending, is now headed to the Rules Committee for further updates. Despite progress, conservatives continue to push for stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, while some Republicans from blue states are demanding changes to the state and local tax deduction. The legislation faces additional hurdles in the Senate, highlighting the challenges of unifying the Republican party behind the budget package. </p>

The buildup includes new tents, warehouses for military vehicles, and renovations to fighter jet shelters, suggesting a long-term expansion strategy. While the troop presence is currently limited due to Russia's focus on the war in Ukraine, Finnish defense officials anticipate a significant increase in Russian forces along the border in the coming years. This development is particularly significant as Finland is one of NATO’s newest members, making the 830-mile frontier the Western alliance’s longest line of contact with Russia. </p>

          <p>Japan plans to introduce a pre-arrival screening system for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of its immigration process and support its growing inbound tourism sector.

The system, modeled after the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization, aims to prevent individuals with criminal records or previous illegal stays from entering the country.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. The cancer is Stage 4, which means it has spread, but experts say that advances in treatment and diagnosis now improve survival by years. President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris have issued supportive statements, and Mr. Biden is reviewing treatment options with his physicians. </p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an aggressive form of prostate cancer adds to the challenges he has faced, particularly given concerns about his age and health. The diagnosis underscores that the concerns about his age and the potential for health issues expressed by a majority of American voters in national polling were valid. Despite the seriousness of the diagnosis, it may temper some of the sharper criticisms prompted by recent book revelations about his presidency. President Donald Trump has released a statement extending his best wishes to the Biden family. </p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations, signaling that consumption remains a concern for the world's second-largest economy. Industrial output grew 6.1% year on year in April, stronger than analysts' expectations, indicating the impact from U.S. tariffs was not as harsh as was being expected. Trade-war fears have receded after a meeting of U.S. and Chinese trade representatives in Switzerland earlier this month led to a lower set of levies between the world's two largest economies. Beijing and Washington agreed to roll back most tariffs for 90 days, allowing some room for further negotiation to reach a more lasting deal. </p>

          <p>Medical experts say that former President Joseph R. Biden’s diagnosis of prostate cancer is serious, but that recent advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer have changed what was once an exceedingly grim picture for men with advanced disease. While prognoses for prostate cancer patients were once measured in months, experts say that advances in treatment and diagnosis now improve survival by years. Life is measured in years now, not months. Dr. Judd Moul, a prostate cancer expert at Duke University, said that men whose prostate cancer has spread to their bones, “can live 5, 7, 10 or more years” with current treatments. </p>

          <p>An agreement was reached on Sunday to end New Jersey’s first statewide transit strike in more than 40 years just three days after it started. The union that represents the state’s passenger-train drivers, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, said it called off the strike at about 6 p.m., and NJ Transit said its trains would begin running a full schedule again on Tuesday morning. For Monday, the agency said, it would rely on its original strike contingency plan involving chartered buses running from four satellite locations into New York City or to stations on the PATH commuter train service. The main sticking point had been the engineers’ demand that they be paid on par with their counterparts who drive trains for other passenger railroads, including Amtrak and New York’s commuter railroads. </p>

From June, patients signing up to a GP practice, who received a blood transfusion before 1996, will be offered a test for hepatitis C. It is one of the biggest treatment disasters in NHS history - 3,000 people who were infected with HIV and hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products have died. </p>
