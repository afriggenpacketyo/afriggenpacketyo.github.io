          <p>White House budget director Russell Vought clarified that the administration's criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stems from a desire for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. In a "Face the Nation" interview, Vought stated that President Trump believes Powell has been too slow to lower rates compared to global counterparts. He downplayed the significance of Project 2025's proposals for a Fed overhaul, insisting the president's focus is on monetary policy that aligns with his economic agenda, rather than a fundamental restructuring of the central bank's mandate.

          <p>Michigan authorities are seeking to file terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect, identified as Bradford James Gille, allegedly used a folding knife in the Saturday afternoon attack, injuring six women and five men. He was confronted by multiple citizens, including one who was armed, which prevented him from leaving or causing further harm before a deputy arrived and took him into custody. All victims are expected to survive, with their conditions reportedly improving at a local medical center.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed speculation about his own potential 2028 presidential run, instead endorsing Vice President JD Vance as a strong future candidate for the Republican party. In an interview on Fox News, Rubio praised Vance's performance as vice president and described him as one of his closest friends in politics. Rubio emphasized his satisfaction with his current role as the nation's top diplomat, stating he wishes to serve in President Trump's Cabinet for the duration of the presidency and would consider that the apex of his career.</p>

          <p>Jordan and the UAE have resumed aid airdrops into Gaza as Israel initiated a "tactical pause" in fighting to allow humanitarian corridors, though the pause has been tested by ongoing violence. The World Health Organization warns that malnutrition in the region has reached "alarming levels," with a third of the population going days without food. Despite the aid efforts, medics reported nine people killed by Israeli fire near an aid convoy route, and residents face significant risks trying to access the dropped supplies. International leaders are calling for more sustainable land routes to address the severe crisis.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has indicated there are no plans for a special bank holiday to celebrate the English women's football team's victory in the Euro 2025 final. Despite the Lionesses' historic win against Spain in a dramatic penalty shootout, the government appears to be following the precedent set after their 2022 win and the men's 1966 World Cup victory. While a celebratory parade is scheduled in London, the decision against a day off is likely influenced by the significant economic cost, previously estimated by the government to be over £1 billion.</p>

While the agreement brings stability, it sets a higher tariff rate than before the Trump administration and keeps a punitive 50% tariff on steel, creating some complex economic and diplomatic implications for various sectors and allies.

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Ohio State University President Ted Carter stated he is not feeling significant pressure from being on a list of universities under federal investigation for alleged antisemitic practices and diversity policies. He suggested the listing was a holdover from the previous administration and expressed confidence in the university's actions. Carter also addressed new state-level legislation, acknowledging faculty concerns but affirming the university's commitment to both academic freedom and compliance with the law. He emphasized the university's financial security and its vital role in workforce development for the state of Ohio.</p>

          <p>The recent cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" by CBS has sparked a debate about the future of late-night television. While some view it as a purely financial decision driven by high production costs and declining linear TV ad revenue, others see it as a potential harbinger of the format's decline. The article notes the significant financial losses associated with these shows and the shifting media landscape dominated by streaming and live sports. The fate of other programs, such as ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose host's contract is up in 2026, is now being watched closely.</p>

          <p>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has not ruled out using rescission packages to claw back more congressionally-approved funding before September. Speaking on CBS News, Vought confirmed his office is reviewing spending at agencies like the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Education, alleging wasteful expenditures. This approach, which follows a recent $10 billion clawback of foreign aid and other funds, signals a continued effort by the administration to use executive tools to reduce spending, a tactic that has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans.

          <p>The ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein files presents a significant political challenge for President Trump, as his typical strategy of deflection may be reinforcing public suspicion. This article argues that Trump, who has long benefited from promoting conspiracy theories about a "deep state," now finds himself in control of that state and its secrets, yet is unable to satisfy his base's demand for transparency. This dilemma is compounded by his own past association with Epstein, creating a situation where any attempt to change the subject only deepens the perception that something is being hidden.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old Wyandotte County Sheriff's Deputy, Elijah Ming, was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call in Kansas City, Kansas. Deputy Ming, a nine-year veteran of the force, was accompanying a woman to her residence to move out when a man inside opened fire without warning. The suspect also fired at other responding officers before being wounded in a gunfight and surrendering after an hour-long standoff. The suspect was taken to a hospital for treatment, and the Kansas Bureau of Investigation is leading the probe into the fatal shooting.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's decision to sign a law that weakened the country's independent anti-corruption agencies. The move, which came as investigators were reportedly closing in on his political allies, is framed as a betrayal of democratic principles and a step back for a nation that had been pressured to reform. Although public protests forced Zelensky to introduce legislation to reverse the law, the author argues that the initial action reflects a new global environment, influenced by the Trump administration, where pressure for good governance has diminished.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to stop funding the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the senators expressed "grave" concerns over the GHF's operations, which they describe as a "death trap" due to the high number of civilian deaths at its distribution sites. They are calling for the U.S. to cease its $30 million pledge to the GHF and resume support for established UN-led aid mechanisms to address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>
