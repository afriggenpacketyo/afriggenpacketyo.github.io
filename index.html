          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady during its recent policy meeting. However, the BOJ has revised its economic and inflation projections downward for the fiscal year 2025, indicating concerns about future economic performance. The central bank's decision reflects a cautious approach amid ongoing global economic uncertainties and domestic challenges, as the BOJ seeks to balance supporting growth with managing inflation risks. This adjustment signals a more tempered outlook for Japan's economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese energy firm Jera Co. has committed to ensuring a stable power supply this summer by utilizing its large-scale liquefied natural gas (LNG)-fired power plant in Mie Prefecture. The Kawagoe thermal power station, boasting a maximum output of 4.80 million kilowatts, aims to compensate for fluctuations in solar power generation, which is rapidly expanding in the region. With the area projected to have an electricity reserve rate topping 8 percent, Jera seeks to play a key role in Japan's transition from fossil fuels to renewables, as LNG emits less carbon than other fossil fuels and is considered a bridging fuel to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>

          <p>Stephen Cloobeck, a wealthy Democratic businessman, is suing former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa over the use of the phrase “proven problem solver” in campaign materials. Cloobeck, who has applied for a federal trademark of the phrase, claims he has been using it since March 2024 and that it has become associated with his campaign. Villaraigosa's representatives have dismissed the lawsuit as ludicrous, arguing that the phrase is commonly used by politicians. Legal scholars suggest the lawsuit has little chance of success, viewing it as a political tactic rather than a legitimate legal claim.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a long-negotiated agreement for the joint exploitation of Ukraine's energy and mineral resources, aiming to bolster Ukraine's economic recovery amidst its ongoing conflict with Russia. The deal establishes a reconstruction investment fund and grants the U.S. access to some of Ukraine's natural resources in return for future security assistance. Ukraine is believed to possess vast reserves of critical minerals like graphite, titanium, and lithium, which are essential for renewable energy, military applications, and industrial infrastructure. This partnership seeks to reduce U.S. dependency on China for rare earth minerals.</p>

The US seeks to reduce dependency on China, which controls 75% of rare earth deposits in the world, while Ukraine seeks to attract global investment into their country. The agreement comes at a time when some of Ukraine's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia.</p>

The judge found that Apple had not complied with a previous order to allow developers to display links to alternative payment options and had instead created a system that still levied commissions. The judge accused Apple's vice president of finance of lying under oath and referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a possible criminal contempt investigation.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Apple must loosen its control over the App Store and cease collecting commissions on certain app sales, concluding a five-year antitrust case brought by Epic Games. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rebuked Apple for obstructing a prior ruling and accused executives of lying. The ruling could alter the app economy by increasing developer revenue and reducing Apple's fees. Apple plans to appeal the decision. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney hailed the ruling as a major victory for developers and consumers.</p>

          <p>Apple has been referred for a possible criminal contempt investigation after a US district judge found the company wilfully violated her injunction in a case brought by Epic Games. The judge stated that a top Apple executive "outright lied" under oath. The injunction was supposed to block Apple from anticompetitive conduct and pricing, opening the App Store up to outside payment options. Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney proposed an end to the litigation if Apple extends the court's framework worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has requested more time to address the US economy after it experienced its first contraction in three years, raising concerns about a potential recession. Trump attributed the economic downturn to his Democratic predecessor and pointed to promised inward investments as a means to restore American manufacturing. The US economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.3%, a significant decline from the previous quarter's growth of 2.4%. This development coincides with Trump marking 100 days in office, amid public discontent over his economic stewardship.</p>

          <p>A court has found that Apple willfully violated a 2021 injunction stemming from the Epic Games case, with Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stating that Apple's Vice President of Finance, Alex Roman, "outright lied" to the court. The judge has referred the matter to U.S. attorneys to investigate potential criminal contempt proceedings against both Roman and Apple. The ruling is a strong condemnation of Apple's conduct, with the judge accusing the company of intentionally trying to circumvent her ruling that required them to allow developers to link to their websites inside of iPhone apps for customers to make purchases outside of Apple's ecosystem.</p>

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's recent visit to Vietnam and the Philippines underscored Japan's commitment to the region, particularly through its "official security assistance" program. With the U.S. implementing protectionist measures, Japan's stable cooperation with ASEAN is seen as vital for promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific and maintaining peace in the South China Sea. Japan's focus on Southeast Asia is benefiting the United States, as Washington does not provide the same level of commitment.</p>

He maintained that the trade war would ultimately be more detrimental to China, which relies on the U.S. market. Trump insisted that many of the goods imported from China are unnecessary, framing the situation as a necessary step towards achieving a fairer trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance cast a tie-breaking vote in the Senate to defeat a bipartisan resolution aimed at blocking President Donald Trump’s trade policy. The resolution sought to revoke the emergency order Trump is using to enact global tariffs, but failed due to absences and Republican opposition. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine criticized the move, arguing it makes Republicans fully accountable for the economic consequences of the tariffs. The Senate's action effectively prevents a future vote on the resolution, ensuring Trump's trade policy remains in place.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appeared divided during arguments over Oklahoma's effort to create the nation's first religious charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School.

Justices Alito and Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to the school's argument, while liberal justices expressed concern about weakening the separation of church and state. The outcome may depend on Chief Justice Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in the charter school program.</p>
