          <p>President Trump's military parade commemorating the Army's 250th birthday will include marching troops, tanks, and aircraft, alongside a unique addition: an Australian Cattle Dog named Doc Holliday, part of the 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment from Fort Cavazos, Texas. Doc, who rides in a wagon pulled by mules, is experienced in parades, having participated twice in the Rose Parade. The parade, estimated to cost up to $45 million, is intended to strengthen the connection between America and its Army, featuring historical reenactments and equipment displays, though there will be no singing of "Happy Birthday" to Trump. The Golden Knights will parachute onto the White House Ellipse and offer the president a folded American flag.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by revoking its ability to enroll international students, citing the university's failure to address antisemitism on campus. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard must comply with demands, including providing disciplinary records of non-immigrant students, to regain its certification. Harvard responded that it is committed to its international students and scholars and views the action as retaliatory and harmful to its academic mission. This decision could impact thousands of international students, who comprise 27% of Harvard's student body, and is part of a broader effort by the administration to curtail visas for international students.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports a significant global increase in antisemitic incidents since the Hamas attack in 2023 and the subsequent war, with offenses against Jewish people and property doubling or tripling in many countries. Groups monitoring hate crimes report tens of thousands of incidents, including verbal abuse, online attacks, vandalism, and violence. While defining antisemitism amid heightened political outrage is complex, experts note a clear trend of increased hate-fueled incidents, such as the recent shooting outside a Jewish museum in Washington, D.C., serving as a stark reminder of the dangers faced by Jewish communities worldwide. Despite the intensity of the conflict, most cases of reported antisemitism fall far short of the kind of extreme violence that erupted on Wednesday outside the Capital Jewish Museum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican budget bill, having passed the House, seeks to impose work requirements for Medicaid recipients, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. The bill mandates that able-bodied adults without dependents report at least 80 hours of work or community activity monthly to maintain benefits, with exemptions for seniors, disabled individuals, and pregnant people. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10.3 million people could lose Medicaid coverage by 2034, while other projections suggest up to 14.4 million could be affected. Critics argue that these requirements will harm those working or eligible for exemptions but who face administrative hurdles, citing experiences in states like Arkansas where similar policies led to widespread coverage loss without improving employment rates.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a gala hosted by Donald Trump for top holders of his cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, an analysis reveals that nearly half of the attendees suffered financial losses from purchasing the coin. Of the 220 winners, 95 experienced a combined loss of $8.95 million since the coin's launch, with some individuals losing over a million dollars despite achieving VIP status. This trend aligns with broader data indicating that the majority of $TRUMP holders have lost money, while a small number have made substantial profits. Experts raise ethical concerns about potential pay-to-play policymaking, given the presence of individuals with strategic policy incentives and those facing regulatory scrutiny among the attendees.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of international students amidst a crackdown on illegal behavior on college campuses. The order prevents the government from arresting, incarcerating, or transferring students outside their residence's jurisdiction while a court case is pending. This ruling comes after over 4,700 international students had their permission to study in the U.S. canceled this spring, prompting some to leave the country. The Department of Homeland Security has also eliminated the student visa program at Harvard University, citing "pro-terrorist conduct" at campus protests and the university's failure to comply with records requests.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is experiencing volatility as investors grow concerned about the rising U.S. national deficit and its impact on the country's global standing, leading to a "Sell America" trade where investors are selling off U.S. government bonds. The U.S. government is paying more to borrow in debt markets, with yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries spiking above 5%. The European Central Bank has warned that President Trump's tariffs pose risks to the global financial system, and Moody's downgraded the U.S. creditworthiness due to the mounting deficit. Investors now view the U.S. as a riskier place to invest compared to six months prior.</p>

Despite a drop in U.S. equities, bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value, further supported by a pro-crypto agenda from President Trump and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation.

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports to the U.S. led to a temporary increase in the drug's street price, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. The embargo, which added all fentanyl-related substances to China's list of controlled substances, may have prevented as many as 947 overdose deaths during that time.

          <p>The Senate blocked California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, setting up a legal battle that could reshape the electric car market in the United States. The 51-44 vote, which passed using the Congressional Review Act, marks the first time Congress has struck down a Clean Air Act waiver granted to California. The repeal deals a blow to Californiaâ€™s ambition of accelerating the transition to electric vehicles. The vote is expected to be signed into law by President Trump.</p>

          <p>The House passed a budget package that includes a provision to lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000, potentially providing tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or significant state income tax liabilities. The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts as a way to ease the tax burden for middle-class and working families. The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000, with a phaseout for those earning above that amount. If adopted, the higher SALT cap would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade.</p>

The review found that only about 20 books needed to be removed pending further evaluation by a Department of Defense panel. The initial ban used the Navy's own terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles from the libraries of their military educational institutions that touch on diversity, race, and gender issues using the Pentagon's specific search terms.</p>

          <p>Annuities are pitched as a way to ensure you won't outlive your money during retirement, but the reality is that these retirement products can also be quite confusing. Whether or not an annuity can run out of money depends heavily on the type of annuity you have. In general, immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent. However, fixed-term annuities, variable or indexed annuities, and annuities with withdrawal riders can run out of money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of white nationalist, hate, and anti-government extremist groups in the US has dropped, not because of their declining influence, but because many proponents feel their beliefs have become normalized in government and mainstream society, according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The report documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups across the country in 2024, down from 1,430 groups in 2023. The 5% drop in hate and extremist groups in 2024 can be attributed to the fact that many feel a lesser sense of urgency to organize, because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general, according to the report.</p>
