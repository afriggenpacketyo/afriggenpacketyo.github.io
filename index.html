          <p>Ex-President Moon Jae-in of South Korea has been indicted on bribery charges related to his former son-in-law's employment at a now-defunct Thai airline. Prosecutors allege that Moon's son-in-law received approximately $150,000 in salary and housing allowances from the airline between 2018 and 2020, which they consider a bribe paid by a South Korean businessman and former lawmaker who controlled the airline. The businessman allegedly favored Moon's family by appointing the son-in-law as an executive despite his lack of qualifications. This indictment adds Moon to a list of South Korean presidents facing criminal investigations after leaving office.</p>

          <p>Starting April 1, 2026, Japan will enforce a revised road traffic law, imposing fines on cyclists aged 16 and older for minor violations like using mobile phones or ignoring traffic lights. Police will issue 'blue tickets,' allowing offenders to avoid indictment by paying fines, targeting over 100 violations. This initiative aims to curb rule-breaking cyclists and reduce accidents, following a surge in bicycle commuting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fines range from 3,000 to 12,000 yen, depending on the offense.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci, experienced a significant drop following a weaker-than-expected first-quarter sales report, with revenues plunging 14% year-on-year. Gucci sales, which account for nearly half of the group's total revenue, fell by 25% as the brand's turnaround efforts continue. The company cited macroeconomic headwinds and a decline in sales in Asia as contributing factors to the overall weakness.

While existing laws like the Online Safety Act are meant to address harmful content, Fergus believes they are insufficient to prevent AI misuse for such purposes. Social media platforms have removed some videos, but advocates call for clearer definitions, accountability, and legal consequences for exploiting this technology, particularly when it involves real victims and their families.</p>

The administration has also reportedly demanded that Kyiv accept a plan that would grant Russia all the territory it has gained in the war, which President Zelensky has rejected.</p>

The traditional inverse relationship between Treasury yields and gold has broken down, as gold's inflation-hedging qualities and independence from any single nation's economic or political trajectory make it attractive to investors.

The seized ants, valued at approximately $9,300 in Kenya, could have been worth up to $1 million in Europe. The high value is driven by the demand for queen ants to establish colonies in formicariums, transparent vessels used to observe ant behavior. Experts warn that the illegal trade threatens Kenya's wildlife ecosystem, as queen ants are crucial for colony survival.

The resort will include a large hotel, conference facilities, and gambling areas on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka Bay. Measures are in place to minimize disruption to the expo, including scaling down work during peak visitor days and delaying heavy machinery operations until after the event concludes. The resort complex is the first IR to receive approval in Japan since the legalization of casinos in 2018.</p>

          <p>A baby boy has been described as being "born twice" following a rare life-saving operation on his mother, Lucy, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer during pregnancy. At 20 weeks pregnant, Lucy underwent a five-hour procedure where surgeons lifted her womb out of her abdomen to remove cancerous cells from both ovaries. The infant was then returned to Lucy's womb and subsequently delivered at the end of January. This complex procedure, with risks to both mother and child, has been performed only a handful of times worldwide.</p>

Measles cases have risen by 20% in a year, reaching 10.3 million in 2023, with the trend expected to continue.
