          <p>Chipmaker Broadcom reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, largely due to a significant increase in its artificial intelligence-related business. The company's AI revenue grew by 63% to $5.2 billion, and it provided a strong revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting continued growth. This performance reflects high investor optimism in Broadcom's potential to compete with Nvidia in the AI chip market, with its stock having nearly doubled over the past year.

          <p>Northwestern University President Michael Schill has announced his resignation following a turbulent three-year tenure marked by significant challenges. His leadership faced intense scrutiny over the handling of pro-Palestinian campus protests and his subsequent testimony before Congress regarding antisemitism. The university has also been grappling with a federal funding freeze of $790 million by the Trump administration, which led to a hiring freeze and hundreds of staff layoffs. Schill stated he believes it is the right time for new leadership to guide the institution forward.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department has released a preliminary list of 68 occupations eligible for a new tax break that exempts tips from federal income tax, a provision of a recent Republican-backed bill signed by President Trump. The list includes traditional tipped roles like bartenders and waitstaff, as well as surprising additions such as plumbers, electricians, and social media influencers. To qualify, workers must earn under $150,000 annually and can claim a maximum of $25,000 in tipped income per year, with the provision set to expire after 2028. (not investment advice)</p>

The remains were found in Washington campgrounds during a large-scale manhunt for Decker, who is accused of murdering his three young daughters in June. An analysis by Central Washington University confirmed the bones were animal. Decker, an Army veteran with survival skills, has been evading authorities for over three months, and the FBI stated there is no evidence to indicate whether he is alive or dead.</p>

This mission is part of President Trump's federal crime crackdown, which began in the district in August. The extension was announced on the same day that the D.C. Attorney General filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement is an overreach of federal power.

          <p>Boeing has announced its decision to hire permanent replacement workers for its defense unit as a strike by 3,200 unionized machinists extends into its second month. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 went on strike after rejecting a contract offer in early August. The company stated the move is part of its contingency plan to ensure it can continue supporting its customers, who rely on the production and maintenance of F-15 fighter jets and missile systems.

CEO Calvin McDonald admitted that the company's casual product offerings have become stale and predictable, failing to resonate with customers.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has reportedly launched a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook regarding allegations of mortgage fraud. The inquiry follows claims, amplified by allies of President Trump, that she misrepresented her primary residence on financial documents to secure better mortgage rates. Cook, who is currently suing the president over his attempt to fire her, has denied any wrongdoing and suggested a clerical error may be responsible for the discrepancies. Her lawyers have framed the investigation as a politicized attack intended to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced sharp criticism from both Democratic and Republican senators during a contentious hearing regarding his recent policy changes. Republicans, including physicians, invoked President Trump's Operation Warp Speed to challenge Kennedy's moves to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines and overhaul the CDC's advisory panel. Democrats accused him of politicizing public health and endangering children, with several calling for his resignation. Kennedy defended his actions as necessary to restore scientific integrity to the agencies.</p>

          <p>In a Senate hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. denied allegations made by the recently fired CDC Director, Susan Monarez. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Monarez claimed Kennedy pressured her to preapprove recommendations from a new vaccine advisory panel he had stacked with vaccine skeptics. When questioned, Kennedy called her claim a lie, stating he never had a private meeting with her.

          <p>Investors are cautiously awaiting Friday's August jobs report, which is anticipated to provide further evidence of a weakening U.S. labor market. Economists forecast the addition of just 75,000 nonfarm payrolls, a figure that would signal a significant cooling but could be viewed positively if it supports a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. However, a number that is too weak could heighten recession fears, while a stronger-than-expected report might reduce the chances of monetary easing. The report will also be the first released since President Trump fired the previous Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner. (not investment advice)</p>
