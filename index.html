          <p>The UK is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures exceeding 33C, marking the hottest day of the year so far. The Met Office has issued a warning for thunderstorms in parts of northern England, Scotland, and Wales, as the heat and humidity are expected to fuel torrential downpours. A heat-health alert is in place for England, with research suggesting a potential increase in heat-related deaths. Firefighters have responded to a surge in wildfires, and the public is urged to take precautions to prevent fires and ensure water safety, as scientists attribute the increased frequency of such heatwaves to climate change.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, has been released from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, sparking protests and debates over free speech. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, criticizing the government's attempt to deport him based on his anti-Israel speech. Khalil's attorneys argued that the government was using the immigration charge to punish him for his views on the Israeli war in Gaza, allowing him to return to his family.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon played a significant role in President Trump's decision to hold off on a potential strike against an Iranian nuclear facility. Bannon, despite holding no official government position, advised Trump against the attack, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the potential ineffectiveness of the "bunker-buster" bomb. Other advisors, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have also influenced Trump's stance, leading to a more cautious approach. The decision comes amid ongoing debates within the administration regarding the threat posed by Iran's nuclear program and the potential repercussions of military action.</p>

          <p>The suspect charged in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses was a doomsday “prepper” who instructed his family to “prepare for war.” Vance Boelter faces multiple murder charges after allegedly killing Melissa Hortman and her husband, and seriously wounding John Hoffman and his wife. Boelter’s wife told investigators they were preppers and that he had given her a “bailout plan.” Law enforcement found a storage locker rented by Boelter containing empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies, as well as a “hit list” of individuals, including the lawmakers and reproductive rights advocates.</p>
