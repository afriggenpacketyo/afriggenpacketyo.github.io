          <p>As the US tariff war intensifies, Beijing is reportedly considering new measures to stabilize its markets and bolster confidence. A joint press conference involving key financial regulatory bodies is scheduled to outline plans to support exporters, aid vulnerable businesses, stabilize employment, and stimulate domestic consumption. The Chinese government views stability as a priority, especially as US tariffs threaten to disrupt financial systems globally. The proposed measures aim to mitigate the impact of tariffs and reassure investors amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>Newly released audio captures the reactions of air traffic controllers as they experienced a 90-second radar and radio signal loss while guiding planes to Newark Liberty International Airport. Controllers expressed confusion and concern as they lost contact with aircraft, leading to temporary departure delays and uncertainty about the extent of the outage. The incident, which occurred prior to significant delays at Newark Airport, prompted the FAA to address staffing shortages and equipment issues. The FAA stated that safety is ensured by slowing the rate of arrivals during such disruptions, and they are working to resolve the problems.</p>

While companies have announced significant planned investments, the White House has not provided data to substantiate the $9 trillion figure. Some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Trump took office, and comparisons to the Biden administration are misleading.

          <p>As cardinals gather for the conclave to elect the next Pope, significant divides within the Vatican are surfacing. The influence of the late Pope Francis looms large, particularly regarding his efforts to shift the Church's focus toward the marginalized and the rank-and-file. While many cardinals appear to support building on Francis's legacy, critics remain skeptical, highlighting the challenges of reconciling diverse outlooks within the Church. The new Pope will inherit the responsibility of ensuring that reforms are evenly applied across the Catholic world and bringing greater clarity to the Church's direction.</p>

          <p>There are three broad spirits in which American television portrays the rich: aspiration, judgment and reassurance. The aspirational spirit makes you want to have what they have, the judgmental spirit condemns them for what they’ve done to get what they have, and the reassuring spirit tells you that you don’t want what they have, anyway. So the most interesting thing about “Your Friends & Neighbors,” a new Apple TV show in which Jon Hamm plays a New York City moneyman who starts thieving from his gilded neighbors to keep up appearances after he loses his high-paying job, is that it manages to eliminate almost any sense of aspirational identification from its portrait of leafy Connecticut hyperaffluence.</p>
