          <p>Starting August 1, interest will resume accruing for millions of student loan borrowers enrolled in the Biden administration's SAVE plan. This change follows court injunctions that had placed these loans in zero-interest forbearance. The Department of Education's decision could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower, prompting financial specialists to advise borrowers to re-evaluate their repayment options and consider making at least interest-covering payments to prevent their loan balances from growing.

          <p>The opening day of the decisive fifth Test between England and India was marked by erratic play and a significant injury to England's Chris Woakes. Woakes sustained a shoulder injury late in the day, a major blow to England's already depleted bowling attack as they aim to secure a series win. Despite the setback and inconsistent bowling, England managed to take six Indian wickets, leaving the tourists at 204-6 and the match finely balanced after rain-interrupted play.</p>

The plan includes optimizing staffing, implementing a "smart queue" to reduce wait times, and encouraging more personalized customer interactions. Niccol, who has a history of successful corporate turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, expressed confidence that this focus on operational fundamentals will lead to a strong recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the "95% rule," a consumer protection for federally-backed reverse mortgages that benefits heirs who wish to keep a family home. This rule allows heirs to settle the loan by paying either the full balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This prevents them from owing more than the property is worth if the loan balance has grown larger than the home's value. The provision offers peace of mind for senior homeowners and a predictable, more manageable path for their families to retain the property. (not investment advice)</p>

During arguments, judges questioned whether the law, which does not mention tariffs, could be used to bypass Congress's constitutional power to set levies. The case, brought by several states and businesses, is a major legal test of the president's economic agenda, with judges noting the administration's interpretation could grant it "unbounded authority" and disrupt the entire U.S. trade-relief framework.</p>

          <p>Apple is scheduled to report its fiscal third-quarter earnings, with investors focused on the potential impact of U.S. trade policies and the company's strategy in artificial intelligence. While the June quarter is traditionally Apple's slowest, analysts are watching for updates on how tariffs might affect future costs and manufacturing plans, particularly regarding production in India. The report will also be scrutinized for any new details on AI initiatives, an area where the company is perceived to be lagging behind competitors, against a backdrop of the company's stock being down for the year.

          <p>Despite reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and raising its full-year guidance, Bristol Myers Squibb's shares fell as investor confidence remains shaky. The market is primarily concerned about the growth trajectory of its key schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, pending crucial trial data for its use in Alzheimer's psychosis patients. Analysts are lowering their price target, viewing the stock as a potential "value trap" until there is more clarity on Cobenfy's potential. The uncertainty, combined with broader concerns about the Trump administration's pharmaceutical policies, is currently overshadowing the company's solid performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has reached a compromise in a trade dispute involving Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, granting it a temporary tariff exemption. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tax-free for six months in early 2026 as it ramps up its new factory in Bahia. However, Brazil also accelerated a planned tariff hike on EV kits to 35%, which will now take effect in January 2027. The decision balances BYD's request for relief against pressure from domestic automakers who warned that a broader exemption could jeopardize local jobs and investment.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest ever discovered in Australia. The new species, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was found in the high canopies of a remote mountainous region, a habitat that likely contributed to it remaining undiscovered for so long. Researchers believe its large body mass is an adaptation that helps it survive colder high-altitude conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether rolling over a 401(k) to an annuity is a wise move in the current economic climate of high interest rates and market volatility. While annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream and protect principal, which is appealing for risk-averse pre-retirees, they also come with fees and limited liquidity. The decision depends heavily on individual circumstances, including proximity to retirement, risk tolerance, and the need for a predictable income versus investment growth potential. It advises careful consideration and potentially consulting a financial advisor before making such a significant change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its decision to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that is vital for hurricane forecasting. The Navy had planned to end the data sharing as part of a modernization effort, but it changed course following feedback from government partners and scientists who feared the loss of data would lead to less accurate storm predictions. The information, which has been shared for over 40 years, is essential for monitoring storms as they form and for tracking sea ice in polar regions. The data will now continue to be available until at least 2026.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the withdrawal of over a thousand National Guard troops from Los Angeles, nearly two months after they were deployed by President Trump to address unrest related to immigration raids. The deployment was highly contested by California's Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued the federal government, calling it an illegal "armed occupation." Newsom's office stated that Trump's "political theater backfired," as the withdrawal signals a de-escalation of the controversial federal presence in the city, with only a small contingent remaining to protect federal buildings.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that Hamas is deliberately leveraging the humanitarian crisis in Gaza to achieve its strategic goals. The author contends that by creating conditions of mass hunger, the group generates international pressure on Israel, hoping to end the war on its own terms. The piece suggests that Hamas's intransigence in ceasefire talks and its supporters' criticism of aid efforts are evidence of this strategy. The author concludes that the best way to undermine Hamas is for Israel and the international community to flood Gaza with aid, thereby alleviating the suffering that the group exploits.</p>

          <p>A new late-stage trial shows that Eli Lilly's blockbuster drug Mounjaro provides cardiovascular health benefits for people with Type 2 diabetes. In a head-to-head comparison, Mounjaro was found to be at least as effective as the company's older drug, Trulicity, in reducing the risk of events like heart attack and stroke. The trial also showed Mounjaro offered a more comprehensive benefit, including a significantly lower rate of death from any cause and greater kidney protection. Eli Lilly believes these results strengthen the case for Mounjaro to be the first-choice treatment for this high-risk patient population.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Trump is undermining Brazil's democracy through economic pressure and political interference, actions described by experts as akin to a "classic tinpot dictator." Trump has imposed heavy tariffs and sanctioned a supreme court judge, reportedly in retaliation for the prosecution of his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, for an alleged coup attempt. This intervention has been condemned by many Brazilians as a foreign ploy to subvert their institutions, with some analysts suggesting Trump is using U.S. foreign policy to pursue personal political whims and support his allies.</p>
