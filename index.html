            <p>Technology stocks experienced a sharp decline, leading the Nasdaq Composite to its worst drop in five years, reversing gains from the previous day's record-setting rally. This reversal occurred after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on some tariffs, but the White House confirmed that the cumulative tariff rate on China would total 145%. Major tech companies like Apple, Tesla, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia all saw significant declines, reflecting market uncertainty surrounding trade policies and their potential impact on the technology sector. The market's volatility underscores the sensitivity of tech stocks to trade-related news.</p>

The company aims to become a transparent vehicle for crypto accumulation in public markets, drawing parallels to Strategy's bitcoin acquisition strategy.

            <p>President Trump congratulated the House on passing a budget blueprint, touting it as setting the stage for significant tax and regulation cuts. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the administration's commitment to certainty and stability to unlock long-term prosperity. However, the administration's actions on tariffs, specifically raising tariffs on Chinese exports to 145%, have drawn criticism from China, who accuses the U.S. of using tariffs for selfish gains. Meanwhile, the EU is pausing counter-tariffs on U.S. goods, mirroring Trump's move for a 90-day period.</p>

Van Damme's agent has dismissed the reports as unfounded, with the actor declining further comment. The case's next step would involve the High Court of Cassation in France potentially signing off on criminal proceedings.</p>

            <p>While recent data indicates cooling inflation, with consumer prices rising 2.4% year-over-year in March, President Trump's trade policies threaten to disrupt this progress. Despite suspending some new tariffs, a 10% tax remains on most U.S. imports, and a much higher 145% tariff is imposed on goods from China. This could lead to increased prices for clothing, toys, and other goods, potentially stalling progress on inflation and complicating the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding interest rate cuts. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs could make it harder for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year.</p>

            <p>The US House of Representatives passed a budget bill supported by President Trump, featuring substantial tax and government spending cuts, despite opposition from Democrats and some Republican hard-liners. The bill is a central component of Trump's legislative agenda, but it faces challenges in reconciling with the Senate's version, which proposes significantly smaller spending cuts. The House plan aims for $5 trillion in tax cuts and could add $5.7 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, leading to initial resistance from Republicans concerned about ballooning government debt.</p>

            <p>Inflation eased in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices, with the consumer price index rising 2.4% year-over-year. However, economists caution that President Trump's tariffs could reverse this trend, potentially pushing inflation up to 4% by the end of 2025. While housing disinflation is expected to continue, rising grocery prices and the impact of tariffs pose significant headwinds. Economists express concern that tariffs, a tax paid by U.S. importers, will increase costs for businesses, which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.</p>

This means higher consumer prices for Americans.

            <p>The possibility of higher iPhone prices in the U.S. is increasing due to President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China, which now stand at 145%. Analysts suggest that Apple may pass on these costs to consumers, potentially raising iPhone prices by hundreds of dollars. While Apple is diversifying its supply chain, shifting production from Asia to the U.S. would be costly and time-consuming. Consumers are already reacting to the uncertainty, with some reportedly rushing to purchase iPhones before prices increase.</p>

            <h2>Lasting Damage From Trump's Tariff Policies Remains Despite Pause</h2>

            <p>Despite President Trump's 90-day pause on some tariffs, lasting damage has already been inflicted on businesses, financial markets, and consumer confidence. The whirlwind of the past week has paralyzed businesses, rattled financial markets, undermined confidence in the dollar, frozen the Federal Reserve, and scared consumers. Trump's mercurial approach to tariffs has created uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to make investment decisions and for consumers to spend. The perceived safety of U.S. Treasuries has also been undermined, potentially leading to higher interest rates and a weaker dollar.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant decline after the White House clarified that the tariff rate on Chinese imports had risen to 145%. This clarification followed a previous announcement of a 125% tariff rate, further escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

            <p>A new Netflix docuseries, "Gone Girls," examines the Long Island Serial Killer (LISK) case, highlighting how local authorities could have solved the murders much earlier. The series reveals that corruption and hubris within the Suffolk County Police Department, under Chief James Burke, hindered the investigation. Burke's efforts to obstruct an FBI investigation into a separate incident led to criminal convictions for himself and others, ultimately derailing the LISK investigation. The series also sheds light on the victims not closely examined in the documentary and the challenges in solving their cases.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has created significant uncertainty in the oil market, causing price volatility, undermining investor confidence, and jeopardizing domestic oil production. The rapid pullback in crude prices threatens the president's "drill, baby, drill" agenda as companies will struggle to boost output at profit. While the 90-day pause on high tariffs for most trade partners with the exception of China, gave the market a temporary reprieve from fears of a spiraling trade war. But U.S. oil producers face an environment of "extreme uncertainty" that will make them hesitant about investment decisions.</p>

            <p>China's National Film Administration has announced it will reduce the number of American films allowed to be shown within China, escalating the tariff standoff between the two nations. This decision comes after President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. Chinese officials cited the United States' "abuse [of] tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience's favorability towards American films." China, the world's second-largest film market, has been a crucial audience for Hollywood blockbusters, and this move could significantly impact the revenue of American film studios.</p>

            <p>An economist at the University of Michigan discusses the impact of President Trump's recent tariff announcements and reversals. While Trump has paused reciprocal tariffs, tariffs on China have risen, with a minimum 10% tariff on every country around the world. The American average tariff rate today will be 10 times higher than it was in January and will be roughly as high, possibly higher, than the Smoot-Hawley tariffs during the Great Depression. The chances of recession skyrocketed and there is a significant risk of stagflation.</p>
