          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of President Donald Trump's decision to remove two Democratic appointees from federal boards, settling a dispute over presidential power to fire agency officials. The ruling reversed lower court decisions that would have reinstated Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris to their positions. The court's liberal justices dissented, arguing the decision grants the President excessive control over the Executive Branch. The case involved a challenge to the Humphrey’s Executor precedent, which limits a president's ability to fire independent board members without cause. </p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County judge has allowed the murder case against two men accused of killing a California State University, Northridge, official at L.A.

Prosecutors allege that Santana Kelly orchestrated the killing and Phillip Clark was the shooter, citing surveillance footage and phone records.

          <p>President Donald Trump hosted a gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, $TRUMP, drawing criticism for potential pay-for-play dynamics and conflicts of interest. The event offered exclusive access to the president for investors who spent millions on the coin, raising concerns about improper benefits and influence peddling. Critics, including some lawmakers, condemned the arrangement, while protesters demonstrated against what they called "crypto corruption."

          <p>The skincare industry is facing scrutiny for marketing products with harsh anti-aging ingredients to tweens, often through social media promotions by influencers. Nielsen data shows that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion on skincare and makeup in 2023, surpassing households with teens. Dermatologists warn that these products can cause painful rashes and increase sunburn risk in young skin. Lawmakers in California are considering a bill to ban the sale of certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18, but brands continue to use kid-friendly marketing tactics. </p>

          <p>A White House report, spearheaded by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., attributes a crisis of chronic illness in children to factors including ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lifestyle choices, and excessive prescription drug use. The report emphasizes the need for greater focus on the causes of disease and prevention. The report reflects Kennedy's long-standing concerns about the food system and environmental toxins. While some experts offer mixed reactions, the report is also criticized for misrepresenting scientific consensus on vaccines. </p>

The Department of Homeland Security maintains his presence hinders American foreign policy against antisemitism. The judge requested written closing arguments, and a federal judge has blocked his removal for now. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A domestic policy bill passed by House Republicans seeks to limit federal judges' power to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The bill would block judges from enforcing contempt citations if they hadn't previously ordered a bond, targeting cases involving nationwide injunctions. Democrats argue the measure would undermine the judiciary's power by removing consequences for officials ignoring court rulings. The provision could apply retroactively, affecting ongoing cases where administration officials are accused of violating orders regarding deportations. </p>
