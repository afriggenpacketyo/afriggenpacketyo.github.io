          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has pleaded not guilty to federal bank fraud charges in Norfolk, Virginia, with a trial date set for January 26. The indictment alleges she misrepresented the use of a house she purchased to secure a more favorable mortgage rate, which she and her legal team argue is a baseless and politically motivated prosecution driven by President Trump. Her lawyers are seeking to have the charges dismissed, citing vindictive prosecution and the allegedly unlawful appointment of the interim U.S. attorney overseeing the case. This legal battle unfolds as James continues her own high-profile civil fraud case against the Trump Organization in New York.</p>

          <p>A French court has imposed a whole-life sentence on 27-year-old Dahbia Benkired for the sexual assault and murder of 12-year-old Lola Daviet in Paris in October 2022. This sentence, the harshest possible in France, is extremely rare and requires her to serve a minimum of 30 years in prison, making her the first woman to receive it. The case has deeply shocked the nation and has been highlighted by right-wing politicians as Benkired was an Algerian immigrant under an order to leave the country. Psychiatric experts found her to have psychopathic traits but deemed her sane and fit for trial.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia's Media Authority has suspended nine Deutsche Welle correspondents, accusing the broadcaster of disseminating unbalanced and conflict-aggravating reports without providing specific evidence. This move is part of a wider crackdown on press freedom in the country, which has seen a surge in journalist detentions and the weaponization of media laws to silence independent reporting. Media rights watchdogs like the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders have condemned the action, highlighting a concerning trend of repression and censorship as the country heads toward its 2026 general election. Ethiopia currently ranks 145th out of 180 countries on the press freedom index.</p>

          <p>Taco Bell is expanding its drink-focused "Live Más Café" concept, which operates as a store-within-a-store, to target younger consumers and build a $5 billion beverage business by 2030. The cafes feature "bellristas" who prepare a menu of specialty coffees, churro chillers, and colorful "refrescas," moving beyond the chain's traditional soda offerings. This strategy taps into the growing trend of fast-food chains leveraging unique beverages and snacking moments to appeal to Gen Z and millennials. The initial locations have seen significant success, with some menu items like the agua frescas already being rolled out nationwide.</p>

          <p>In the continuing fallout from his association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Prince Andrew's banner of arms has been removed from St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The banner signified his membership in the prestigious Order of the Garter, an honor he relinquished last week along with the use of his royal titles. This development comes amid increasing pressure for the prince to lose further privileges, including his formal titles and his residence at Royal Lodge. The move follows the recent publication of a posthumous memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who accused the prince of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have officially left left-handed relief pitcher Alex Vesia off their World Series roster due to a "deeply personal family matter." His absence is a significant blow to the team's bullpen, which had relied on him as a trusted arm throughout the postseason. To fill the gap, the Dodgers have added right-handed pitchers Edgardo Henriquez and Will Klein to the relief corps for the championship series. The team's position player group remains unchanged from the previous round, prioritizing defense and speed for the final roster spots.</p>

Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also came in slightly below expectations, rising 0.2% for the month.

          <p>President Trump announced a halt to all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an ad campaign by the province of Ontario that he deemed "egregious." The ad used edited audio from a 1987 Ronald Reagan radio address to argue against trade tariffs, a move the Ronald Reagan Foundation also criticized. The White House stated that Canada's use of the ad demonstrates a lack of seriousness in negotiations over what it calls "longstanding, unfair trade barriers." This abrupt termination of talks further strains the trade relationship between the two closely linked economies, which has been frayed by U.S.-imposed tariffs and Canadian retaliatory measures.</p>

          <p>A UK court has jailed six men for carrying out an arson attack on a London warehouse that was providing aid to Ukraine. The plot was orchestrated on behalf of the Russian state through the Wagner Group, a mercenary organization designated as a terrorist group by the UK. The ringleader, Dylan Earl, was recruited on Telegram and received a 17-year prison sentence for his role in the attack, which caused £1.3 million in damages. The judge described the act as a "planned campaign of terrorism and sabotage," highlighting the extension of Russia's hostile activities onto British soil through hired operatives.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of being a major international fentanyl trafficker and money launderer, has been extradited from Cuba to the U.S. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, from which Zhi had previously escaped house arrest. He is alleged to have worked closely with the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels, laundering at least $20 million and moving fentanyl from China to the Americas and Europe. This extradition comes as the Trump administration increases pressure on both Mexico and China to combat the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals into the United States.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged multiple figures in a wide-ranging NBA gambling scandal, alleging the use of insider information, high-tech cheating devices, and ties to New York's organized crime families. The criminal complaints detail schemes where individuals, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, allegedly rigged high-stakes poker games backed by the mob. Another part of the investigation accuses retired NBA player Damon Jones of using non-public information, such as when prominent players would sit out games, to profit from sports betting. The sweeping allegations have sent shockwaves through the professional sports world.</p>

          <p>According to Kelley Blue Book, the average transaction price for a new vehicle in the U.S. reached $50,080 in September, the first time this figure has exceeded the $50,000 mark. The increase was partly driven by a rush to buy electric vehicles before a federal tax credit expired, as well as strong sales in the luxury segment. For a typical buyer, financing a $50,000 car with a 20% down payment over five years could result in a monthly payment of around $796 before factoring in insurance and fuel. When all costs are included, the total monthly expense for a new car owner can easily surpass $1,200. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A viral social media graphic claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" is highly misleading, despite using officially sourced data. Experts and statistical agencies like Eurostat warn that such cross-national comparisons are flawed due to major differences in how countries legally define sexual assault, record crimes, and the varying levels of victim trust in law enforcement. For instance, the UK's consent-based laws and its practice of recording each transgression in a group assault as a separate offense inflates its numbers relative to other nations. Criminologists suggest that victim surveys provide a more accurate measure of the prevalence of sexual violence.</p>

He argues that targeting low-level workers is easy but fails to dismantle the powerful drug cartels, urging for a collaborative approach focused on capturing cartel leaders instead.

          <p>While there is no exact minimum amount that triggers a lawsuit from a debt collector, legal action often becomes a consideration for debts ranging from $1,000 to $5,000. The decision depends on factors like the cost of litigation versus the potential recovery, the type of debt, and state-specific laws governing small claims courts. Unsecured debts like credit cards are more frequently litigated than medical bills. For consumers facing overwhelming debt, experts advise communicating with creditors, exploring debt management or settlement programs, or considering a consolidation loan before the situation escalates to a lawsuit.

While Milei's drastic austerity measures have curbed inflation, they have also led to significant public sector job cuts and rising costs for citizens, causing his approval ratings to plummet.

He reflects on how the novel, which he first read as a child, resonated with his own feelings of abandonment and inadequacy, presenting a tragedy that requires no villain. Del Toro views the story as a powerful parable about an uncaring creator and a creation burdened with a lonely existence, a theme he connects to his own films like "Pinocchio."
