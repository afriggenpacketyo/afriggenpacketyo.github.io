          <p>In a surprising turn, key allies of Rudy Giuliani are publicly backing Andrew Cuomo for New York City mayor, rather than Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Joe Lhota, Giuliani's former deputy mayor, cited Cuomo as a "proven manager" against a "socialist" and a "fruit loop," referring to other candidates. Anthony Carbonetti, another former Giuliani aide, stated Sliwa lacks a path to victory and risks being a spoiler. This move underscores a complex political landscape ahead of the election, with polling showing a significant lead for Zohran Mamdani.</p>

          <p>A terrorist attack on Yom Kippur at a Manchester synagogue resulted in the deaths of two Jewish individuals and left three others seriously injured. The assailant, identified as Jihad Al-Shamie, drove a car into a crowd and then used a knife before being shot dead by police. Worshippers and security staff demonstrated immediate bravery, preventing the attacker from entering the building. This horrific incident, occurring on the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, is being treated as a terror attack, prompting widespread condemnation and a swift emergency response.</p>

          <p>Opie, a five-year-old corgi shepherd mix, was reunited with his owner two months after disappearing from his Northern California home during a storm. The dog was found over 2,000 miles away in Illinois, with authorities locating his owner thanks to his microchip. The cross-country journey remains a mystery, though the owner suspects Opie was taken by someone. This heartwarming reunion highlights the importance of microchipping pets and keeping their registration information current for such unexpected circumstances.</p>

The prime minister condemned the "horrific" act, which occurred on Yom Kippur, and confirmed increased police presence at synagogues nationwide. International figures, including King Charles III and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also expressed condolences and called for action against anti-Jewish sentiment.

          <p>A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, David Butler, initiated a crowdfunding campaign that has raised over $300,000 for the family of Thomas Jacob Sanford, the gunman in a deadly Michigan chapel attack. Sanford, who killed four and injured eight before being killed by police, left behind a wife and chronically ill son. Butler stated his actions were inspired by religious teachings to "love our enemies" and care for the vulnerable. This controversial effort aims to support the perpetrator's family, who are also seen as victims of the tragic event, despite blowback from some who believe funds should only go to direct victims.</p>

          <p>Eyewitnesses have described the "horrendous" scene of a car ramming and stabbing attack at a Manchester synagogue that killed two people and injured three others. Accounts detail a vehicle "rushing past" and a man with a knife "stabbing the window," attempting to breach the building on Yom Kippur. Police quickly responded, shooting the attacker dead, and later confirmed a suspicious device worn by him was not viable. The community expressed shock and trauma, while praising the swift actions of the police and synagogue staff who barricaded doors, preventing further tragedy.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning of an escalation in violent, pre-planned attacks against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and facilities. The memo highlights a shift from property damage to targeted violence, citing incidents like a Dallas attack that killed two detainees and a Fourth of July shooting in Alvarado, Texas. The Trump administration attributes these threats partly to "domestic violent extremists" and has increased military deployments and law enforcement assistance to guard facilities. This reflects heightened tensions surrounding immigration enforcement and domestic security concerns.</p>

Founder MacKenzie Price emphasizes the advantage of customized learning, with students reportedly testing in the top 1% on standardized assessments. However, the $40,000 annual tuition and the reliance on unproven AI models have drawn skepticism from educators regarding the long-term implications and accessibility of such a system.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval among Latino voters is reportedly slipping, primarily due to economic concerns like rising grocery and housing prices, despite his strong support from this demographic in 2024. Recent polls show a majority of Hispanics disapprove of his economic handling and fear deportation. However, this decline in Trump's support has not translated into significant gains for Democrats, who are urged to focus on offering concrete solutions for Latino families rather than solely criticizing Republicans. The upcoming off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia will serve as a test for both parties.</p>

          <p>Yunnan, China's "coffee capital," is significantly increasing its coffee and derivative product exports, with outbound shipments reaching US$1.1 billion in the first eight months of 2025. The province now exports to over 30 countries, including Germany and Vietnam, driven by robust global demand. Benchmark coffee futures hit a 50-year high, pushing raw bean prices up and providing a windfall for local growers. This surge is also driving industrial reforms, with factories upgrading technology to meet evolving consumer needs and solidify Yunnan's position in the international coffee market.

          <p>The president of the PGA of America, Don Rea Jr., has issued a belated apology for "disrespectful, inappropriate" fan behavior at this year's Ryder Cup, admitting some actions "clearly crossed the line." This follows earlier comments where he minimized the abuse, which included homophobic slurs and insults directed at players' wives, with Rory McIlroy's wife reportedly hit by a thrown beer. Rea's apology comes after criticism from European players and a separate apology from PGA of America CEO Derek Sprague.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a request for Evita Solutions to manufacture a new generic version of mifepristone, a key drug used in most medication abortions. This decision has sparked outrage among anti-abortion advocates, who had been pressuring the federal government to restrict access to the pill since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including Senator Josh Hawley, expressed disappointment, citing a non-peer-reviewed paper with debunked claims about mifepristone's safety. Abortion rights supporters, however, celebrated the approval as a victory for evidence-based medicine and expanded access to care.</p>

Experts note a "massive rise" in medical misinformation, exacerbated by social media, leading to declining vaccination rates and potential life-threatening consequences.

The report argues that simply telling workers to "save more" ignores the financial realities they face, underscoring the inadequacy of the 401(k) system.
