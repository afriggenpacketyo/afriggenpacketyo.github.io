          <p>Following a multi-hour summit in Alaska, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin did not secure a ceasefire for the war in Ukraine. Instead, Trump announced a mutual decision to pursue a direct peace agreement, which he claimed is more durable than a temporary truce. This outcome has created tension with Ukrainian and European leaders who prioritize an immediate cessation of hostilities. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was not present at the summit, is now scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington to discuss the proposed path toward a comprehensive peace deal.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police have arrested a 47-year-old man on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offense during Liverpool's Premier League match against Bournemouth. The incident occurred when Bournemouth player Antoine Semenyo, who is Black, reported the alleged abuse to the referee, causing a brief pause in the game. Semenyo, who went on to score two goals, later released a statement thanking the football community for its unified support against discrimination. The Premier League has also launched its own investigation into the matter to ensure appropriate action is taken.</p>

She was suffering from severe emaciation and muscle loss, and her death was caused by cardiac arrest. This case highlights the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, where the UN has warned of widespread malnutrition and the Hamas-run health ministry reports over 250 hunger-related deaths. The incident comes as other nations, including the UK, face calls to establish similar evacuation schemes for sick and injured children from the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>After a brief period of cooler, more humid weather allowed firefighters to gain control over several large blazes, Southern California is bracing for a return to high heat and dangerous fire conditions. The National Weather Service forecasts temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in inland areas, coupled with dry conditions and potential "sundowner winds" that could fuel new ignitions. Crews made significant progress on the 132,000-acre Gifford fire, reaching 73% containment, but officials warn that the region is not yet out of danger. The forecast raises concerns for heat-related illnesses and the potential for new, fast-spreading wildfires.</p>

          <p>Six prominent Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Elizabeth Warren, have sent a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to cancel a deal that permits Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI chips to China. The agreement involves the U.S. government receiving a 15% commission on the revenue from these sales. The senators argue that this arrangement trades away America's technological advantage and poses a significant national security risk by potentially strengthening China's military capabilities. The Trump administration dismissed these concerns, while reports suggest China is already discouraging its tech firms from purchasing the U.S. chips.</p>

This potential shift in U.S. policy diverges significantly from the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, who have consistently opposed changing international borders by force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington to discuss the path forward.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian political analysts have largely condemned the Alaska summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, viewing it as a strategic win for Russia with no tangible benefits for Ukraine. Experts argue that the meeting served primarily as a photo opportunity to legitimize Putin on the world stage and end his international isolation, without achieving any concrete steps toward peace. Many in Ukraine fear that President Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to Washington will result in increased pressure to accept unfavorable terms, such as territorial concessions. The lack of a ceasefire agreement is seen as a failure that allows Russia to continue its military operations unabated.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has undergone rapid intensification, escalating from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane over the Atlantic. This meteorological phenomenon, where a storm's wind speeds increase by over 58 mph in 24 hours, was fueled by exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. While the hurricane is not projected to make landfall in the United States, its outer bands are bringing heavy rain and the threat of flooding to the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Climate change is believed to be making such rapid intensification events more common and severe.</p>

After its parent company Arcadia went into administration, the brand was acquired by online retailer Asos, but its physical presence was lost.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has instructed its officers to conduct a more "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal background check. This new policy will place greater emphasis on positive contributions like community involvement and stable employment, while also increasing scrutiny of minor offenses, such as reckless traffic infractions.

          <p>In their first head-to-head 100-meter race since the Paris Olympics, Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American rival Noah Lyles at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second in 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who narrowly lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Both athletes are now looking ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, with this race setting the stage for another intense showdown.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, has publicly denied any intention of running for president in 2028. His statement came in response to accusations from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who claimed one of Kennedy's top aides was laying the groundwork for a future campaign. In a social media post, Kennedy dismissed the claim as a "flat-out lie" pushed by the "swamp" to create a rift between him and President Trump. He affirmed his loyalty to Trump and the administration's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man from Long Beach, California, was rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area south of Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Shift Away from Ceasefire Demand Causes Alarm in Ukraine and Europe</h2>

          <p>President Trump's decision to pivot from demanding an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a direct peace agreement with Russia has caused significant concern in Kyiv and other European capitals. This move is seen as aligning with Russia's long-held position that a ceasefire can only be part of a comprehensive settlement, which critics fear implies Ukrainian capitulation. The shift provides Vladimir Putin with more time to advance his military objectives on the battlefield. This development underscores the ongoing diplomatic challenge for Ukraine's allies as they try to navigate the volatile U.S. administration's approach to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Ge Changchun, a prominent academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is urging China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology. This technology involves placing solar power stations in orbit to collect intense solar radiation, convert it into electricity, and transmit it back to Earth. Ge argues that a more robust, top-down national strategy is needed to close the technological gap with the United States and secure a leading position in the future of energy and space exploration. He notes that current efforts are fragmented and lack the capacity for such a large-scale, complex project.</p>

          <p>A detailed account of the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska highlights the day's key moments, from a show of military force to tense exchanges with the press. The meeting began with a flyover of a B-2 stealth bomber, which appeared to surprise the Russian leader. During a press availability, Putin seemed visibly uncomfortable as U.S. journalists shouted questions about Russian aggression and civilian casualties in Ukraine. The talks, which lasted about three hours, concluded without a ceasefire but with Putin publicly validating Trump's claim that the war would not have happened under his presidency, a significant rhetorical concession.</p>

          <p>An internal review has revealed that Grant Hardin, a convicted murderer and former police chief, spent six months meticulously planning his escape from an Arkansas prison. Hardin told investigators that lax security in the prison kitchen, where he worked, allowed him to gather supplies and create a fake law enforcement uniform. He escaped by walking through a gate that a tower guard unlocked without verifying his identity. The incident has led to the firing of two employees and a review of systemic security failures, including Hardin's misclassification at the medium-security facility, from which he should have been excluded due to a past sexual assault conviction.</p>

          <p>Heavy monsoon rains have triggered catastrophic flash floods and landslides across northern Pakistan and neighboring India, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of people. In Pakistan, the death toll has surpassed 340, with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province being the most severely affected. Rescue operations are underway but are hampered by continued rainfall and washed-out roads. In India-administered Kashmir, at least 60 people have been killed in a remote Himalayan village crowded with pilgrims. Experts attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of these events, known as cloudbursts, to climate change and unplanned development in mountainous regions.</p>
