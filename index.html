          <p>Stellantis, facing President Trump's 25% automotive tariffs, has temporarily suspended production at its Windsor (Canada) and Toluca (Mexico) assembly plants.  This decision leads to temporary layoffs for approximately 900 US-represented employees and 7,000 others at the plants. The company is reviewing the long-term effects of these tariffs on its operations. The plants produce vehicles such as the Chrysler Pacifica minivan and the Jeep Compass SUV.</p>
