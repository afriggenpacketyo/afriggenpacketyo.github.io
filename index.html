        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data indicates a significant drop in U.S. usage for e-commerce giants Temu and Shein following President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the 'de minimis' loophole, which previously allowed tariff-free shipments of low-cost goods under $800. Temu's daily active users (DAUs) in the U.S. fell by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs decreased by 25%. These declines are also reflected in lower rankings on the Apple App Store and reduced U.S. advertising spending by both companies in recent months. The impact of these changes highlights the sensitivity of these businesses to trade policies and regulations.</p>

          <p>Automotive industry groups are expressing increasing concern over potential rare earth shortages due to China's recent export controls on rare earth elements and magnets, which are vital for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. Several European auto supplier plants and production lines have already been shut down, and the industry warns of more outages as inventories deplete. While hundreds of export license applications have been submitted to Chinese authorities, only around 25% have been approved, leading to production delays and potential stoppages. German automotive industry leaders are urging lawmakers to address this issue with China to find a quick resolution.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are leading with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected 'winter fuel U-turn,' restoring payments to pensioners but recouping funds from wealthier recipients through higher taxes. Concerns are raised about potential 'chaos' as tax officials may pursue bereaved families of deceased pensioners to recover the payments. Immigration policies are also a key focus, with contrasting approaches from Labour and Conservative leaders highlighted. Other stories include potential side effects of weight-loss jabs, Trump's economic policies increasing US debt, and expanded free school meals for children. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying military resources, including Stryker combat vehicles previously used in Iraq and Afghanistan, to the US-Mexico border to deter illegal crossings. This deployment, involving over 8,000 soldiers, spy planes, and drones, raises legal questions about the military's role in domestic law enforcement. The administration has created National Defense Areas along the border, allowing the military to detain migrants as trespassers. Critics argue that this militarization undermines the distinction between armed forces and domestic police, while the administration asserts it is necessary for national security to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>A charity, Thin Blue Paw, is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complex medical needs and vet costs. These dogs risk their lives in the line of duty, apprehending suspects and dealing with public disorder, and often retire with chronic health issues and injuries. Adopters face significant expenses, averaging £3,000 more per year compared to other dogs, and insurance can be difficult to obtain. The charity argues that providing pensions is a responsibility to these animals who have served and protected the community.</p>

The heightened emphasis on stalking cases follows the death of Asahi Okazaki, who had previously reported abuse from her former partner.

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting solar power, potentially creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The report highlights that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants financed by China, leading to stranded assets. It advocates for developing indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. A Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is economically viable, initiating a debate about the role of Chinese solar technology in developing nations.</p>

          <p>Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, argues that President Trump's tariffs disrupt the global trading system and weaken economic links that stabilize international relations. The constant threat of tariffs undermines trade, disregards free trade agreements, and threatens the World Trade Organization. This retreat from free trade could hurt consumers worldwide through higher prices and more limited choices, potentially leading to political discontent. Prasad suggests that business interests have historically kept relationships between rivals on an even keel, but this is being eroded by current trade policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation banning all travel from certain countries, fully restricting and limiting the entry of nationals from 12 nations: Afghanistan, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The ban, effective at 12:01 a.m. Monday Washington time, is justified by concerns over inadequate screening and vetting processes, high visa overstay rates, and lack of cooperation in sharing identity and threat information. Visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela will also face heightened restrictions, marking a revival of controversial measures from Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation restricting foreign student visas at Harvard University, suspending the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs for an initial six months. Trump claims allowing Harvard to continue hosting foreign students jeopardizes national security, citing concerning foreign ties and radicalism. Harvard has responded by calling the proclamation an illegal retaliatory step that violates the university's First Amendment rights.

The vote also has cultural implications, asking citizens to make a statement about their own identity and whether they prioritize inclusivity and diversity over ethnic and cultural homogeneity. Prime Minister Meloni and several high-profile ministers have been encouraging people to skip the vote, hoping the referendum will not reach quorum.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after the Palisades fire damaged their high school. The venue provided a special setting for the 740 graduating seniors, though students expressed sadness at not being able to graduate at their beloved Stadium by the Sea. The ceremony featured remarks from Steve Kerr, coach of the Golden State Warriors, and comedian Billy Crystal, whose home burned down in January. Perseverance in the face of tragedy was a key theme of the event.</p>
