          <p>China's cyberspace regulator has summoned Nvidia to address national security risks associated with its H20 AI chips, which are designed for the Chinese market. The concerns stem from reports of potential "backdoors" and tracking capabilities, amplified by a proposed U.S. bill that would mandate location reporting for advanced chips. This scrutiny from Beijing adds another layer of geopolitical complexity for Nvidia, which is trying to navigate U.S. export restrictions while serving the profitable Chinese market. The company had previously taken a significant financial writedown due to the sales halt on these chips.</p>

          <p>The United States has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Judge Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing a case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, for allegedly suppressing free expression. In a related move, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order imposing a 50% tariff on many Brazilian goods, directly linking the trade measure to the "politically motivated persecution" of his ally, Bolsonaro. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the actions as an unacceptable interference in the country's sovereignty, escalating diplomatic and trade tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A system failure at the UK's national air traffic control provider, NATS, led to the cancellation of over 150 flights and grounded thousands more, causing significant travel disruption. Airlines, including Ryanair and EasyJet, are demanding answers and accountability, with some calling for the resignation of the NATS CEO, referencing a similar major outage in 2023. While NATS stated the radar-related issue was resolved in 20 minutes by switching to a backup, the knock-on effects are expected to last for days during the peak summer travel season.</p>

Ukrainian officials have condemned the strike as a deliberate act of war against civilians, targeting homes, schools, and hospitals.

          <p>Canada and Malta have declared their intention to officially recognize the state of Palestine in September at the United Nations General Assembly. They join France and potentially the United Kingdom in a growing movement among Western nations to advance a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

          <p>Australia's new law to ban social media for individuals under 16, while popular with the public, is facing scrutiny from experts who question its effectiveness in addressing youth mental health. Critics argue there is a lack of causal evidence linking social media directly to the mental health crisis and that a ban could push young people to less safe corners of the internet. Some researchers suggest the focus should be on reforming mental health systems and educating youth for a digital world, rather than a prohibition that may ignore other factors like social inequity and climate anxiety.</p>

          <p>A new Republican-led plan to redraw Texas's congressional districts is facing fierce opposition from Democrats, who argue it is a "blatant gerrymander" designed to dilute minority voting power. The proposed map, encouraged by President Trump, could flip five Democratic-held seats to Republican-leaning, potentially impacting the balance of power in the U.S. House. Democrats warn that the plan fractures Black and Latino communities for political gain and may violate the Voting Rights Act. The move has prompted some Democratic states to consider their own mid-decade redistricting in response.</p>

          <p>Artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award at Australia's prestigious Archibald Prize for her portrait of musician William Barton. Spirovski created the work by painting with her fingers, as a nerve injury in her hand made using a brush difficult and painful. She described the experience of painting without a brush as a "beautiful reprieve and reward" during a difficult recovery period. The award, which is voted on by the public, celebrates a unique work born from personal adversity and artistic adaptation.</p>

          <p>A jury has convicted Colorado dentist James Craig of first-degree murder for killing his wife, Angela, by poisoning her protein shakes with arsenic and cyanide. Prosecutors argued that the crime was premeditated and driven by greed, pointing to a struggling dental practice, $4 million in life insurance policies, and extramarital affairs. The investigation revealed internet searches by Craig on undetectable poisons and that he administered the final fatal dose while his wife was already in the hospital. He faces an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese diplomat has asserted that the European Union's recent trade agreement with the United States may deepen the bloc's economic and security reliance on Washington. Speaking at an event in Beijing, former ambassador Shi Mingde argued that this increased dependence on the U.S. contradicts the EU's stated goal of achieving "strategic autonomy." He criticized the EU's "de-risking" policy aimed at reducing reliance on China, suggesting it is a flawed strategy that overlooks the bloc's even stronger dependence on America, which the new trade deal reinforces.</p>

FBI Director Kash Patel stated the move aims to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific, enhance cooperation on cybercrime and counter-narcotics, and strengthen the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. While FBI staff have been present in the country since 2017, this establishes a formal, permanent presence.

          <p>Ford Motor Company now expects to incur approximately $2 billion in costs this year due to U.S. tariffs, a higher figure than previously anticipated. The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in the U.S., has already paid an extra $800 million in duties in the second quarter alone. The increased costs are attributed to sustained high tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has facilities, as well as levies on imported steel and aluminum. The announcement underscores the significant financial impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on major American corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. and South Korea have reached a trade agreement that sets a blanket 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a reduction from the 25% previously threatened by President Trump. The deal also includes a commitment from South Korea for a $350 billion investment in U.S. industries and a $100 billion purchase of American energy products. However, there appear to be differing interpretations between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and profits of the investment fund. The agreement negates many benefits of the previous free trade agreement, marking a significant shift in the economic relationship. (not investment advice)</p>
