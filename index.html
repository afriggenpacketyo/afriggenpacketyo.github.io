          <p>Following an incident in Leicester where a car struck pedestrians, police have made two additional arrests. The incident occurred on De Montfort Street in the city center, resulting in serious injuries to three individuals and minor injuries to another. A 31-year-old man had already been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing serious injury by dangerous driving, and was later released on police bail. The two newly arrested individuals, a 28-year-old man and a 34-year-old man, both from Leicester, were taken into custody, with the 34-year-old also subsequently released on bail. </p>

          <p>China maintained a subdued presence at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's premier security summit, deviating from the customary practice of robustly countering American messaging. This year, the rebuttal was led by Chinese military academic institutions rather than the defense minister. The absence of Defense Minister Dong Jun and the cancellation of a plenary session on China's security led to speculation and surprise among attendees. The Chinese delegation also informed other countries that they would not be conducting bilateral engagements during the dialogue, disappointing those seeking discussions on the sidelines. </p>

          <p>According to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, at least 21 individuals were killed and 179 injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid distribution site west of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that there were "no known casualties from IDF gunfire" within the site at this stage and that the matter is under investigation. Local witnesses reported that the shooting occurred around 1,000 yards from the aid site, which is run by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The GHF issued a statement before the report of the shooting emerged, saying aid "was again distributed today without incident."</p>
