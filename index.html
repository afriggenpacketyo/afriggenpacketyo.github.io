        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the government's recent U-turn on a £5 billion welfare reform package has made future spending decisions more difficult. The reversal, prompted by a rebellion from Labour MPs, puts pressure on the upcoming budget. Phillipson acknowledged that removing the two-child benefit cap, a policy limiting benefits to two children per family, now faces greater financial hurdles. She emphasized that while the government is exploring all options to reduce child poverty, the recent policy changes have significant fiscal implications for future initiatives.</p>

          <p>Germany's Green Party is struggling to redefine its identity and role after being relegated to the opposition. Following a disappointing election result, the party leadership is developing a new strategy to reconnect with voters, particularly on their core issue of climate change. The party is grappling with a perception of being overly restrictive, a problem highlighted by the public backlash against a previous heating law. Compounding their challenges, the Greens lack sufficient personnel, especially in eastern Germany, to effectively engage with the populace and rebuild their support base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a novel data sorting system that is significantly faster and more energy-efficient, potentially revolutionizing fields like AI and scientific computing. The new method utilizes memristors, electronic components with memory capabilities, to overcome the data transfer limitations of traditional computer architecture. Published in the journal Nature Electronics, the research details a hardware prototype that demonstrated improved performance in tasks such as route finding and neural network inference. This innovation addresses the 'Von Neumann bottleneck,' a long-standing challenge in computing.</p>

          <p>The family of a Canadian woman who supported Donald Trump's immigration policies is now feeling betrayed after she was detained by ICE agents in California. Cynthia Olivera, who was brought to the U.S. without authorization at age 10, was detained during an interview for permanent residency and is now facing deportation. Her husband, a U.S. citizen and Trump voter, expressed his shock, stating they supported mass deportations believing it would target criminals, not individuals like his wife. The case highlights the broad impact of the administration's immigration crackdown, which affects many regardless of their criminal record.</p>

          <p>Pop star Miley Cyrus has revealed that she used Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to overcome a long-standing battle with stage fright. In recent interviews, Cyrus described the therapy as life-saving, stating she has not experienced performance anxiety since. EMDR is an alternative therapy designed to help individuals process unresolved trauma by using bilateral stimulation, such as eye movements, to shift distressing memories from the emotional to the logical part of the brain. Experts note that by addressing root causes rather than just symptoms, the therapy can be highly effective for performance anxiety.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that over 1.4 million pensioners in Germany are still employed after reaching retirement age. The data, released in response to a query from the Left Party, shows that as of late 2023, nearly 375,000 of these individuals held jobs that were more substantial than minor side employment. A Left Party politician criticized the trend, attributing it to a pension level that is significantly lower than the EU average, compelling many older Germans to continue working out of necessity rather than choice.

          <p>A new gene therapy, administered through a single injection, has successfully reversed hearing loss in a clinical trial involving children and adults with a specific genetic form of deafness. Researchers from Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet reported that delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear led to rapid and considerable hearing improvement in all ten participants. The study, published in Nature Medicine, noted particularly strong results in younger children, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. The therapy was found to be safe and well-tolerated, offering hope for treating other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

Board argues that this lack of significant punishment sends the wrong signal and fails to deter repeat offenses, reflecting a national trend where a majority of reported shoplifting cases do not result in charges.</p>

The military success, which included defeating Hezbollah and striking Iran directly, was the culmination of decades of strategic and intelligence reforms following the 2006 Lebanon war.

          <p>In a jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who was convicted for the 2017 murder of beauty executive Fabio Sementilli, has claimed his former lover and the victim's wife, Monica Sementilli, was not involved. Baker, who pleaded no contest and received a life sentence, insisted that Monica had no knowledge of the plan to kill her husband. This assertion comes as Monica Sementilli faces her own trial for conspiracy to commit murder. Prosecutors allege a powerful circumstantial case against her, while her defense maintains she is innocent and plans to call Baker to testify.</p>

          <p>After a trial that detailed a secret love affair and a complex murder plot, a Los Angeles jury found Monica Sementilli guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy. She was convicted of masterminding the 2017 killing of her husband, famed hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, for financial gain. The prosecution built its case on circumstantial evidence, including Monica providing home security credentials to her lover and killer, Robert Baker, and monitoring the home remotely during the murder. Sementilli was sentenced to life in prison without parole and plans to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>The confirmed death toll from catastrophic flooding in central Texas has reached at least 50, with recovery efforts ongoing. Authorities are still searching for 27 girls missing from Camp Mystic, a summer camp on the Guadalupe River that was devastated when the river rose 26 feet in under an hour. The disaster has prompted a massive search-and-rescue operation and raised questions about the effectiveness of warning systems, as officials admit they did not anticipate the intensity of the rainfall. The event is highlighted as an example of increasingly common extreme weather linked to the climate crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have found that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the brain's "criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This balance is widely believed to enhance the brain's information processing capabilities and is linked to cognitive function. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrates that genetics influence this critical state across various brain regions and large-scale networks. These findings establish brain criticality as a biological phenotype, opening new avenues for understanding brain function and disorders.</p>

          <p>Chilean tennis player Nicolas Jarry is preparing to face Britain's Cameron Norrie in the fourth round of Wimbledon after overcoming significant health challenges. A year ago, Jarry was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis, a condition causing severe vertigo and vision problems, which saw his world ranking plummet. His current run at Wimbledon, matching his grandfather's 1974 performance, is an emotional achievement after a difficult year of recovery. Jarry described his journey back to form as tough physically and psychologically, making his success at his favorite tournament particularly meaningful.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew, who was previously charged with the murder of his wife Suzanne Morphew before the case was dropped, has publicly denied any involvement in her disappearance. In a televised interview, Morphew claimed authorities had "tunnel vision" and wrongly focused on him. The charges were dismissed in 2022 after a judge sanctioned prosecutors for failing to turn over key evidence, including DNA linked to other cases. Morphew has since filed a $15 million lawsuit against prosecutors, while his daughters continue to support him, insisting on his innocence.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew alleges his murdered wife, Suzanne Morphew, was drugged with a tranquilizer and her body was moved at least twice. Her remains, found in a shallow grave in September 2023, contained a mix of animal tranquilizers that only Barry Morphew had access to in the area. Anthropological analysis suggests her body decomposed at a different location before being moved to the grave site. This is the second time Morphew has been charged with his wife's murder, following a dismissal of initial charges in 2022.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the start of the 12-day war with Israel, attending a religious ceremony in Tehran. His absence during the conflict had fueled speculation that he was in a secure bunker, especially after U.S. President Donald Trump issued warnings via social media. During the war, Israel targeted Iran's nuclear facilities, military officials, and defense systems, while Iran launched over 550 ballistic missiles at Israel. The conflict resulted in significant casualties and damage, and Iran has since suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog.</p>

          <p>Japan is planning to export used Abukuma-class navy destroyers to the Philippines in a move to bolster the country's maritime deterrence capabilities against China. According to a report, the deal for six destroyer escorts was agreed upon by the two nations' defense ministers last month. This marks a significant step in the growing military cooperation between the U.S. allies, who both face challenges from Beijing's assertive actions in the region. To comply with Japan's pacifist constitution, the transfer will reportedly be structured as a joint development project for equipment installation.</p>

This financial pressure comes as global conflicts rise and the international rules-based order is increasingly challenged by nations like Russia and China.

          <p>A UK High Court has ruled that investigations by the security service MI5 into its own false testimony were "deficient" and has ordered a new, more robust inquiry. The case stems from MI5 repeatedly lying to courts about its handling of a violent neo-Nazi informant, identified as 'X,' who abused women. The BBC revealed that MI5 misled judges by claiming it had not confirmed the agent's status to a journalist, a claim later proven false. This article details how MI5 continued to provide misleading information and conceal evidence even during its internal reviews, undermining its own conclusions.</p>
