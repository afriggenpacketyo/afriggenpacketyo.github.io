          <p>Joey Chestnut won the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, marking a triumphant return after being banned from the previous year's event. He consumed 70.5 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes to reclaim the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt, though he fell short of his own world record. On the women's side, Miki Sudo secured her 11th victory by eating 33 hot dogs, also not reaching her personal best but comfortably winning the competition. The annual Fourth of July event in Coney Island continues to be a major spectacle, drawing large crowds to witness the high-stakes eating competition.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ individuals serving in the Ukrainian military are fighting for both their country and their civil rights, facing a mix of acceptance and prejudice. While some soldiers report neutral or supportive reactions from their comrades, others have experienced harassment and threats, highlighting a lack of formal protections. A key legislative goal is the legalization of same-sex civil partnerships, which would grant partners crucial rights, such as medical decision-making and inheritance. Despite ongoing debate and opposition in parliament, activists point to growing public support for equality as a reason for hope amid the hardships of war.</p>

          <h2>Filmmaker Ken Burns Discusses the Enduring Global Impact of the American Revolution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 13:25:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most significant events in world history, arguing it fundamentally "turned the world upside down" by creating the concept of a citizen rather than a subject. He emphasized that the Declaration of Independence's ideals have inspired global movements for centuries, even though its original text excluded women, the poor, and minorities. Burns, whose new film on the topic is forthcoming, asserted that embracing the complexities and internal struggles of historical figures makes history richer and more accessible to everyone, enhancing its glory rather than diminishing it.</p>

          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be officially banned as a terrorist organization in the United Kingdom after a High Court judge denied its request for a temporary injunction. The proscription, which takes effect at midnight, will make it a criminal offense to be a member of or express support for the group, with penalties of up to 14 years in prison. The government's decision follows actions claimed by the group that caused an estimated £7 million in damages. Lawyers for Palestine Action argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience group that does not advocate for violence.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protestors gathered in front of Los Angeles City Hall on the Fourth of July to demonstrate against what they describe as President Trump's "dictatorial tendencies" and the presence of ICE in immigrant communities. The event, organized by the 50501 movement, featured a 1.5-mile march and a 15-foot-tall balloon depicting Trump in a Russian military uniform. Organizers connected domestic issues with global conflicts, demanding an end to oppression both at home and abroad. The protest comes as a significant tax and spending bill from the Trump administration, affecting low-income and immigrant communities, heads to the president's desk for signature.</p>

The settlement covers Trump's legal fees and a contribution to his future presidential library, and it prevents further lawsuits over a subsequent critical "60 Minutes" segment.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested a plan to exempt undocumented agricultural workers from deportation if their employers are willing to vouch for them, an idea that could also extend to the hospitality sector. Speaking in Iowa, Trump indicated that legislation for this carve-out is already being drafted with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The proposal acknowledges the critical labor shortages faced by the agriculture industry, which has been heavily impacted by the administration's deportation drive. This potential policy shift reflects an internal administration debate between immigration hardliners and those advocating for concessions to support key economic sectors.</p>

          <p>Health experts are examining the significant physical strain that competitive eating places on the human body, as exemplified by events like the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest. Ingesting dozens of hot dogs in minutes can lead to a permanently stretched stomach, impacting its ability to contract and empty properly. A 2007 study revealed a competitive eater's stomach can expand into a massive, distended sac, unlike a normal person's. Besides stomach issues, the massive intake of sodium and fat poses risks like soaring blood pressure, potential heart attack or stroke, and severe gastrointestinal distress, though the long-term consequences remain largely unknown.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump drew sharp criticism from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. The term, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," was used to describe predatory moneylenders while he was discussing tax changes. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," stating it reinforces harmful stereotypes. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he only understood it to mean a moneylender charging high rates, a defense that did not quell the controversy.</p>

          <p>Germany has approved a significant increase in national defense spending, aiming to modernize its armed forces and make them "ready for war," a move celebrated by the country's arms industry. While proponents, like defense contractor CEOs, label the spending a "gigantic economic stimulus program," many economists are skeptical about its broader impact. Studies suggest that every euro spent on the military may generate only 50 cents of additional economic activity, a much lower return than investments in infrastructure or education. The analysis indicates that while defense companies will see profits rise, the overall economic boost for Germany may be quite moderate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Parts of central Texas are under disaster declarations after more than a foot of rain fell in a few hours, causing what the National Weather Service called a "catastrophic flooding event." The intense rainfall, following a long drought, led to rapid river surges and life-threatening flash floods, with authorities confirming fatalities. Water rescues and evacuations were underway as officials urged residents to shelter in place and avoid travel. The Guadalupe River rose 22 feet in just three hours, reaching its second-highest level on record before the gauge was damaged by the floodwaters, underscoring the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence, reflecting on significant advancements, particularly in education and healthcare. Since 1975, the country has drastically reduced illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and greatly expanded its healthcare system. Despite this progress, challenges like youth unemployment and migration persist, with many young, educated Cape Verdeans seeking opportunities abroad. The government has implemented social policies to combat extreme poverty, which affects a small but significant portion of the population. Today, Cape Verde is considered one of Africa's most stable and developed nations.</p>

A key challenge will be for Hanoi to define what constitutes a "made in Vietnam" product versus a transshipped good with Chinese components, a distinction that will determine the pact's true impact.

While the Boston Massacre in 1770 heightened tensions, it was Britain's response to the 1773 Tea Party—the Coercive Acts of 1774—that proved to be the tipping point. By shutting down Boston's port, dissolving its government, and deploying an occupying army, Britain transformed a protest over criminal activity into a full-scale rebellion.
