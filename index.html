            <p>Lanzarote experienced severe flooding due to torrential rain, leading the government to declare a state of emergency. Hundreds of homes and roads were flooded after 6cm of rain fell in just two hours. While no injuries were reported, the head of emergency services noted that some homes were submerged and floodwaters left behind a large amount of mud. The state of emergency was lifted the following morning after the island recovered from the incident.</p>

            <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the Trump administration's decision to exempt electronics from tariffs is temporary.

They propose using psychological flexibility from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) to build new habits. This includes "surfing" the urge to scroll, engaging in simple movements while surfing the urge, savoring enjoyable activities, adding novelty to familiar movements, turning worry into compassionate action, and combining news consumption with outdoor movement.</p>

            <p>Recent market volatility caused by Trump's trade war has raised concerns about stock market savings. However, historical context suggests that the current economic problems are not as severe as past crises. Despite recent losses, markets remain significantly higher than previous levels, and the economy shows signs of strength. Pro-growth policies and a potential cooling of inflation could provide further support. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>There is a rising interest in parenting styles, particularly authoritative parenting, often confused with authoritarian parenting. Authoritarian parenting is characterized by a rigid, top-down approach with high control and low warmth, often resulting in negative long-term effects on children's emotional well-being. In contrast, experts recommend authoritative parenting, which involves setting clear boundaries while fostering open communication and emotional support, leading to more positive outcomes for children.</p>
