          <p>Nvidia has announced its expectation to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, stating it has received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, were previously halted in April. This development occurs amid a preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing and follows increased lobbying by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued against the export controls. The company also announced a new, fully compliant GPU to support its global market strategy.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding economists' forecasts but decelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The data reflects an economy navigating challenges, including deflation, a housing market downturn, and the lingering effects of trade tensions with the United States. While industrial output was strong, key indicators like retail sales and fixed asset investment showed signs of slowing, pointing to insufficient domestic demand. Economists caution that underlying fragility remains, suggesting further fiscal stimulus may be necessary to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intense storms on Monday triggered flash flood warnings across the New York City metropolitan area, leading to significant disruptions and damage in the city, as well as parts of New Jersey and New York state. The heavy rainfall caused severe delays on the NYC subway system and Metro-North Railroad due to flooded stations and tracks. Numerous drivers were stranded on inundated highways and local roads, particularly in areas like Westchester County, New York, and Scotch Plains, New Jersey, where emergency rescues were performed. A state of emergency was declared in New Jersey to address the rapidly developing situation.</p>

          <p>John MacArthur, the influential pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, and a prominent figure in American evangelicalism, has died at the age of 86 following a battle with pneumonia. Known for his extensive media ministry "Grace to You," he also served as president of The Master’s University and The Master’s Seminary. Over his long career, MacArthur authored nearly 400 books and became a significant voice in theological circles. He gained national attention in recent years for challenging COVID-19 restrictions on in-person church services, a legal battle his church ultimately won.</p>

          <p>A group of major UK freeholders, including wealthy landowners and charities, has initiated a High Court challenge against the government's Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act. They argue that provisions in the 2024 law, which aim to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, violate their property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The claimants fear significant financial losses, while leasehold campaigners worry the legal battle will delay much-needed reforms. This case highlights the deep-seated conflict between freeholders' financial interests and the rights of millions of property owners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has revealed a plan to send "top-of-the-line weapons" to Ukraine, facilitated through NATO countries who will be reimbursed by the United States for sending their own systems. This policy shift is coupled with a significant threat to Russia: the imposition of 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Moscow if a peace agreement is not reached within 50 days. The announcement, made alongside NATO chief Mark Rutte, marks a tougher stance against Russia from the Trump administration. The move aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities and pressure Vladimir Putin into negotiations.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual salary report often omits many of its highest-paid stars, a situation explained by the corporation's commissioning structure. Many top-tier presenters and actors are not directly employed by the BBC but by independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Because BBC Studios competes in the commercial market, it is not required to disclose talent salaries funded through its productions, unlike those paid directly by the public license fee. This means the published list provides an incomplete picture of talent earnings for popular shows like "Strictly Come Dancing" or "The Traitors."</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary administrative stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the country. The decision comes after the immigration advocacy group CASA filed an emergency motion challenging the administration's move to terminate the protections.

          <p>At least four firefighters have sustained injuries, including heat-related illnesses and blunt force trauma, while battling a series of wildfires in Northern California. Crews are contending with extreme heat, steep terrain, and bone-dry conditions as they fight multiple blazes, including the Green fire in Shasta-Trinity National Forest and the Orleans Complex fires. These fires, sparked by lightning in early July, have collectively burned nearly 20,000 acres of remote, thickly forested land. Fire officials report that gaining access to the fires has been extremely challenging due to the difficult terrain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June on record for container traffic, a surge attributed to a "tariff whipsaw effect." Shippers rushed to import goods, particularly from China, to get ahead of President Trump's looming tariff deadlines. Port officials noted that this spike in volume highlights the uncertainty in global trade rather than organic economic growth. They anticipate that import volumes will likely ease in the coming months once the new tariffs are in place, reflecting the significant impact of trade policy on supply chain logistics and costs for American businesses.

          <p>Following a weekend incident where gunshots were fired from a crowd of young people in downtown Little Rock, Mayor Frank Scott Jr. has announced a plan to implement a citywide weekend curfew.

The move comes after reports of illegal activity involving groups of youths over consecutive weekends. While no one was injured in the latest incident, police arrested two 16-year-olds, and the event has prompted city leaders to seek stricter measures to ensure public safety.</p>

Paraguay is one of the few remaining countries that officially recognizes Taiwan over the People's Republic of China. The stance underscores Paraguay's commitment to a sovereign foreign policy in the face of China's diplomatic efforts to isolate Taipei on the global stage.</p>
