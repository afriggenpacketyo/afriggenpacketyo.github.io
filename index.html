          <p>Shares of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a major producer of high-fructose corn syrup, fell sharply following a social media post from Donald Trump. Trump claimed he had secured an agreement with Coca-Cola for the company to switch to using real cane sugar in its U.S. products. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, the announcement also prompted a warning from the Corn Refiners Association about potential job losses and negative impacts on American farmers. The news created significant volatility for companies involved in the corn syrup supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>African Nations Move Slowly on Ratifying Continental Free Movement Protocol</h2>

          <p>Despite the African Union adopting a protocol for the free movement of people in 2018, only four of the bloc's nations have ratified it, hindering progress toward continental integration. The protocol, intended to complement the African Continental Free Trade Area, requires 15 ratifications to take effect. Officials express concern that without the free movement of people, the full economic benefits of free trade in goods and services cannot be realized. Key reasons for the reluctance among member states include security concerns and fears of losing revenue from visa fees.</p>

          <p>NPR President and CEO Katherine Maher has warned that proposed federal funding cuts to public broadcasting could endanger public safety across the country. Maher emphasized that many local public media stations are integral to state emergency alert systems, particularly in rural areas that rely on them for critical information during natural disasters. The warning comes as the Senate passed a rescissions package that includes a $1.1 billion reduction for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, following President Trump's call to defund the entities over alleged bias. This move could force many smaller stations to reduce services or close entirely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is implementing new trade agreements with Southeast Asian nations like Vietnam and Indonesia that include high tariffs on "transshipped" goods, creating economic uncertainty in the region. This policy is designed to curb the practice of Chinese goods being rerouted through other countries to evade U.S. tariffs. The economic impact on nations like Vietnam will depend heavily on how broadly the U.S. defines transshipment, as many locally manufactured products rely on Chinese components. Analysts suggest the move aims to decouple regional economies from China and create diplomatic friction between Beijing and its neighbors.</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a prominent singer of the late 1950s and early 1960s, has died at the age of 87. With major hits including “Who’s Sorry Now?” and “Where the Boys Are,” she became one of the biggest recording stars of her era, known for her adaptability across pop, rock, and adult contemporary genres. Her career was marked by immense success but also significant personal tragedies, including a violent sexual assault in 1974 that she later said led to a PTSD diagnosis. After a long battle with mental health issues, she returned to performing in the 1990s and became an advocate for victims' rights.</p>

Although she had previously apologized and withdrawn the comments, her latest statements have prompted the party to take the matter "incredibly seriously."

Beauty critic Jessica DeFino explains that this expansion is driven by market capitalism and the collapse of age-appropriate media, exposing young people to adult beauty standards and products with potent active ingredients. This can lead to physical harm, such as skin sensitization and inflammatory conditions, and psychological consequences like anxiety and body dysmorphia.

          <h2>Article Critiques DHS Rationale for Detaining Immigrants Without Criminal Records</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically examines the Department of Homeland Security's justification for detaining over 250 individuals without criminal convictions in a Florida internment facility. A DHS official claimed these individuals are "terrorists, human rights abusers, gangsters and more" who simply lack a U.S. rap sheet, and that entering the country illegally is itself a crime. The author argues this logic is circular and dangerously broad, suggesting it allows the government to preemptively punish people based on suspicion rather than evidence. The piece contends that such actions undermine due process and redefine criminality to fit a political agenda.</p>

          <p>A fact-check by DW has determined that social media claims linking sunscreen use to a higher risk of skin cancer are false. Health officials and scientific studies confirm there is no evidence to support this assertion. The rising global incidence of skin cancer is attributed to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and historically inadequate sun protection products, not the use of modern sunscreens. While countries with high sunscreen use, like Australia, also have high melanoma rates, this correlation is explained by other factors, including greater awareness and a sun-intensive climate, rather than a causal link to sunscreen itself.</p>

The closure highlights the fragility of small businesses operating under state agency agreements and has immediate ripple effects on the community.

          <p>As smartphone addiction becomes an increasingly prevalent issue linked to anxiety and depression, scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to combat it. Proven methods include physical changes like leaving the phone out of the bedroom, turning off notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to make the device less rewarding. Behavioral retraining through apps that limit screen time can also be effective. For more severe cases, experts suggest therapies like mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to address the root causes of the addiction, which often stem from using the phone as an escape from stress.</p>

          <p>Russian customs officials, in collaboration with the FSB security service, have seized 1,800 pounds of cocaine valued at over $153 million. The drugs were discovered hidden in a shipment of bananas from Latin America, marking Russia's largest bust of its kind this year. The cocaine packages were concealed in a hidden compartment and disguised in briquettes with a luxury brand label. This seizure is part of a growing trend of traffickers using Russia as a transit hub and concealing narcotics in banana shipments, a method also seen in recent busts in Norway, Greece, and the Dominican Republic.</p>

          <p>At Donald Trump's urging, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This mid-decade redistricting is a risky political maneuver that would likely further dilute the voting power of the state's rapidly growing non-white population, which accounted for 95% of its recent growth. Critics argue the move is an undemocratic effort to gerrymander districts and would trample on minority voting rights.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is on the verge of collapse, now operating as a de facto minority after losing the support of its ultra-Orthodox partners. The coalition is unraveling due to two key conflicts: the deeply unpopular military draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox community and pressure from far-right parties to continue the Gaza war indefinitely. Netanyahu is caught between the demands of his radical coalition partners and the will of the Israeli majority, the Supreme Court, and the U.S. administration.
