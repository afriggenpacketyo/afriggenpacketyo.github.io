          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave," which explores the selection of a new Pope, has drawn parallels between the process and the TV show "The Traitors." He suggests that the dynamics of a conclave, where cardinals secretly elect a new Pope, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying "traitors" among a group. Harris believes the conclave is a "brilliant device" for finding the right leader, but questions the exclusion of women from the process.</p>

Reform performed best in areas characterized as 'left-behind' Britain, where concerns about immigration and globalization are prevalent.
