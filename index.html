        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant cooling as employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' forecasts and marking a continued slowdown. The unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, while revised data revealed a loss of 13,000 jobs in June, the first monthly decline since late 2020. This trend is attributed to economic uncertainty, including the impact of tariffs, which has made businesses hesitant to hire. The weak report intensifies pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its upcoming meeting to stimulate the economy and avert a potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that a comfortable retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement earnings, though the actual amount varies significantly based on location and lifestyle. The article notes that the median retirement income in the U.S. is around $47,000 annually, which may be insufficient in high-cost areas. To supplement savings and Social Security, it explores strategies for creating guaranteed income streams. Options discussed include purchasing annuities, utilizing reverse mortgages for homeowners over 62, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70.

          <p>The massive $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot is driving a significant increase in business for lottery courier services, particularly Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in ticket sales on its platform, with 15 million Powerball tickets ordered during the current jackpot run. This surge highlights the strategic value of DraftKings' acquisition of Jackpocket, which it uses to cross-sell customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming offerings. The high demand underscores the widespread public enthusiasm for the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches $1.7 billion, potential winners face significant tax liabilities that vary by state. Regardless of the payout option chosen—a lump sum or a 30-year annuity—a mandatory 24% federal tax is withheld upfront, with winners likely owing more at tax time under the top 37% bracket. The article provides a breakdown of how state income taxes further reduce the take-home amount. However, eight states, including Florida, Texas, and California, do not tax lottery winnings, offering the largest possible after-tax prize for residents in those locations.</p>

          <p>A large-scale federal operation at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 workers suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The raid, described as the largest single-site enforcement in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, was part of a monthslong probe into unlawful employment practices. The majority of those detained were reportedly Korean nationals working for various subcontractors at the facility. Labor organizations criticized the raid as politically motivated, stating it creates an atmosphere of fear among immigrant workers and their families.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has surprise-released "Swag II," a 23-track album that serves as a follow-up to his July release, "Swag." The new record continues his exploration of indie rock and '80s R&B sounds, a departure from his earlier pop and EDM work but consistent with albums like "Journals" and "Changes." The album features collaborations with artists such as Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris, and was created with many of the same producers from its predecessor. Thematically, the article notes that Bieber continues to focus on marriage, fatherhood, and religion in his lyrics.</p>

The committee is examining whether Biden's aides used an autopen to sign official documents, including thousands of pardons, without his full awareness, potentially covering up signs of cognitive decline.

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as Britain's deputy prime minister and housing secretary after an ethics adviser found she breached the ministerial code by failing to pay enough tax on a property sale. Rayner admitted she made an error by not seeking specialist tax advice regarding her complex family arrangements, which resulted in an underpayment of around £40,000 in stamp duty. Her departure has triggered a major cabinet reshuffle, with David Lammy appointed as the new deputy prime minister. Rayner's resignation is a significant blow to the Labour government and opens a potentially divisive deputy leadership election within the party.</p>

          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been convicted of sexually assaulting two teenage girls. A jury at St Albans Crown Court found the 53-year-old guilty of four counts of sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl and two counts of sexual assault against a 15-year-old girl. The incidents occurred at a friend's house in 2022 after Alford had purchased alcohol that the victims consumed. Alford, who denied the charges, reacted with disbelief in the courtroom and has been told to expect a custodial sentence.</p>

          <p>The ownership of "A Young Girl," a 1901 painting by German expressionist Paula Modersohn-Becker, is under review by Germany's looted-art commission. The artwork, held by the Hamburger Kunsthalle museum since 1958, was donated by the widow of a Nazi party member who acquired art during the dictatorship. Heirs of Robert Graetz, a Jewish businessman deported and killed by the Nazis, filed a restitution claim in 2020, arguing he was the original owner. The case is one of the last to be heard by the current Advisory Commission before it is replaced by a new arbitration system.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed legislation raising the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This reverses a key provision of his 2017 tax law, which limited the deduction to $10,000, a move that disproportionately affected taxpayers in high-tax states. The original unlimited deduction was intended to prevent double taxation, and its capping was a contentious issue. While the increased cap will provide relief to many homeowners, particularly in states like New York and California, it is projected to add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade.

As deputy prime minister, she was a powerful and popular figure, known for her combative style and ability to connect with working-class voters. Her story of social mobility was a significant asset to the Labour Party, but her career ultimately unraveled due to a tax scandal, leading to her fall from power.</p>

According to authorities, girls are offering their services on encrypted messaging apps, sometimes choosing more violent missions to prove they are tougher and more ruthless than their male counterparts. This development highlights the evolving and dangerous role of young women in the country's organized crime networks, which have been described by the government as a systemic threat.

With hiring at its slowest pre-pandemic pace since 2013 and the number of unemployed people now exceeding job openings, competition is fierce. Career experts advise job seekers to focus on networking, keeping their skills current, and leveraging platforms like LinkedIn to maintain visibility.

With job growth slowing for three consecutive months, investors now see a rate cut as a near certainty.
