        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court seeking the removal of Democratic Representative Gene Wu from office. The lawsuit alleges that Wu, as the "ringleader" of a group of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a Republican-backed redistricting plan, has effectively abandoned his post. Abbott's petition claims Wu's actions deprive the House of the necessary quorum to conduct business and argues this constitutes a forfeiture of his elected position. This legal maneuver escalates the political standoff over redistricting maps favored by Republicans ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, a phenomenon explored by a veteran BBC forecaster. The article explains that while modern forecasts are highly accurate, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere means tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, an idea known as the Butterfly Effect. Communicating complex meteorological data and uncertainty to the public in a simple format presents a major challenge. The piece also looks toward the future, where AI could provide more granular and long-range predictions but may struggle with unprecedented climate-change-driven weather events.</p>

          <p>A sheriff's deputy in San Bernardino County, California, has been arrested and charged with soliciting bribes and extortion while on duty. The investigation into Deputy Cameron Romo, 27, began in June 2024 following a citizen complaint, leading to his placement on administrative leave. The district attorney's office filed charges after investigators determined Romo allegedly committed the criminal acts while assigned to the Hesperia station. Sheriff Shannon Dicus expressed disappointment but praised the investigators for holding the deputy accountable, emphasizing the importance of maintaining public trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The political conflict in Texas over redistricting has intensified, with Republican Senator John Cornyn requesting FBI assistance to locate Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a vote. This move is part of a broader Republican effort, including threats of legal action from the state's attorney general and governor to remove the absent Democrats from office. The standoff, initiated by a Republican plan to redraw congressional maps, has drawn national attention, with Democratic governors in other states vowing to protect the Texas lawmakers. The situation highlights the growing partisan divide and the high stakes involved in controlling legislative maps.</p>

          <p>A recent Realtor.com report indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in certain U.S. metropolitan areas, particularly in the South and West, after reaching a peak in 2022. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen significant drops in median listing prices, driven by an increase in housing inventory from new construction and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices due to persistent inventory shortages and stricter building regulations. The data suggests a regional divergence in the housing market's rebalancing, offering varied conditions for buyers and sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to revoke approximately $7 billion in grant funding previously awarded for the Solar for All program. This initiative, part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, was designed to help low- and middle-income households install solar panels. The targeted funds have already been allocated to 60 state agencies and other entities, making the administration's attempt to claw them back legally complex and likely to face court challenges. This action represents the latest move in a broader campaign against renewable energy, which has also included attempts to cut other climate grants and electric vehicle tax credits.</p>

          <p>A House committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case. The bipartisan panel is examining the federal government's handling of the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. The subpoenas are part of a wider effort that also targets the Department of Justice for records and seeks testimony from former high-level officials. The committee's letter to the Clintons cites reported flights on Epstein's private jet and other alleged connections as the basis for their summons.</p>

          <p>The anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out has reported a record number of discriminatory incidents in English football during the 2024-25 season. The 1,398 reports represent the highest total ever received by the organization, with notable increases in sexism, transphobia, and faith-based abuse. Reports of sexism and misogyny surged by 67%, while transphobic incidents doubled. While overall racism reports declined, racist incidents within the professional game increased. The charity's CEO called the findings a "wake-up-call," urging football authorities and tech companies to take stronger action, particularly against online abuse.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is alerting the public after wild pigs in Monterey County were discovered with bright blue fat and muscle tissue. Officials believe the discoloration is caused by the animals consuming diphacinone, a type of rat poison often dyed blue and used in agriculture to control rodents. The agency warns that consuming meat from contaminated animals could lead to secondary poisoning and advises hunters not to eat any animal showing signs of blue pigmentation. This discovery highlights the unintended consequences of rodenticides on the wider ecosystem and the potential risks to human health.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from redirecting funds from the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 Democratic-led states, which argued the administration could not cancel the congressionally approved program without legislative consent. The BRIC program provides billions in grants to help communities protect infrastructure against natural disasters. The judge determined that the states faced irreparable harm if the program were terminated and that the public interest lies in ensuring the government follows the law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to launch a pilot program to test coverage of expensive weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound under Medicare and Medicaid. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans, as cost and lack of insurance coverage are major barriers to these treatments. The plan, which could start in 2026, would allow state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover these drugs for weight management. This potential policy shift is viewed as a major victory for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk amid broader administration pressure to lower drug prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The issue of "debanking," where financial institutions close customer accounts, has become a political flashpoint, with some conservatives, including President Trump, claiming they are targeted for their political views. Banks can close accounts for various reasons, including suspected fraud or regulatory compliance under the Bank Secrecy Act, and are often not required to provide a reason. While data on politically motivated debanking is scarce, the debate highlights a tension between banks' risk management obligations and principles of fair market access. Financial institutions maintain that decisions are based on risk, not politics, but welcome regulatory clarity on the matter.</p>

          <p>Tennessee has executed Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, without deactivating his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a move his lawyers condemned as cowardly. The execution proceeded after legal battles over whether the lethal injection would cause the device to deliver painful electric shocks, with the state arguing Black would be unconscious. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. His case also involved failed appeals based on claims of intellectual disability.

The incoming heat, with temperatures projected to reach triple digits in many inland areas, will dry out vegetation and create more challenging conditions for firefighters.

          <p>Ion Iliescu, the dominant figure in Romania's transition from communism to democracy, has passed away at the age of 95. Iliescu rose to power during the violent 1989 revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and served as the country's first democratically elected president. His legacy is complex; he is credited with steering Romania toward NATO and EU integration, but he is also criticized for his role in the violent suppression of protests in the early 1990s, known as the Mineriads. His leadership embodied the contradictions of a nation struggling to escape its authoritarian past while building a new democratic identity.</p>

          <p>The term "Russia hoax" has become a recurring phrase for Donald Trump, often used when he is facing political pressure, such as during the recent Epstein files controversy. This article explores the origins and shifting definitions of the term, which Trump uses to dismiss any allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election or improper contacts with his campaign. Despite intelligence community consensus and a special counsel report detailing Russian meddling, the "hoax" narrative persists, fueled by allies and selective document releases. Recent investigations have even suggested that some evidence supporting the "hoax" theory may itself have been a Russian fabrication.</p>
