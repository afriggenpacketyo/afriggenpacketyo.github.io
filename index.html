          <p>On the 20th anniversary of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, survivors and community members reflect on the tragedy that killed 52 people and injured over 770. The article recounts the experience of a bus driver, George Psaradakis, whose vehicle was one of the four targets in the coordinated terrorist attack on the city's public transport system. He emphasizes the importance of remembrance and choosing love over the hatred that fueled the attacks, highlighting the acts of humanity that emerged from the gruesome day.</p>

          <p>A Scottish paramedic, Stephen Doohan, has been sentenced to over 10 years in prison for secretly administering an abortion drug to a woman, causing her to have a miscarriage. Doohan, who was married, gave the woman the drug without her consent after learning she was pregnant with his child. The court heard he manipulated the victim under the guise of consensual sexual activity and later attempted to silence her. The judge described the crime as exceptionally serious, leaving the victim with a lifetime of pain and loss.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zambia has enacted new cybersecurity laws that have drawn criticism from rights groups who argue they threaten freedom of expression and privacy. The legislation grants the government broad powers to surveil electronic communications and has moved the national cybersecurity agency under the Office of the President. While the government defends the laws as necessary to combat digital crimes like fraud and identity theft, critics, including the Law Association of Zambia, fear they will be used to stifle dissent and target journalists. The laws reflect a broader trend of restrictive cybersecurity legislation across Africa.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its use of denaturalization, a process to strip citizenship from naturalized individuals, raising concerns among civil liberties advocates. This new push targets those deemed a national security risk or who made misrepresentations on their citizenship applications, but critics fear it will be weaponized against political opponents. The article draws parallels to the Red Scare era, when denaturalization was used to suppress dissent and target individuals with disfavored political views. Legal scholars express concern over the potential for abuse and the erosion of due process for millions of naturalized citizens.</p>

          <p>A massive East African Crude Oil Pipeline project, led by French and Chinese energy companies, is causing significant social and environmental disruption in Uganda. The project is set to displace an estimated 100,000 people, severing deep cultural ties to ancestral lands and fracturing family structures due to compensation disputes and relocations. Residents report inadequate compensation, environmental damage to water sources, and a feeling of powerlessness against corporate and government interests. Advocacy groups highlight this as a familiar pattern in large-scale energy projects worldwide, where the human cost is often overlooked.</p>

          <p>This article explores the nature of political violence in America, questioning what it will take to end the current cycle of escalating threats and attacks. Drawing on historical examples like the 1859 duel that killed a U.S. senator, the author suggests that a collective, public rejection of violence is required, often spurred by a shocking event. The piece notes that with leaders like Donald Trump actively stoking division and fantasizing about violence, and a significant portion of the population believing violence may be necessary, the nation is in a perilous state. It concludes that a society that tolerates violence will ultimately be consumed by it.</p>

          <h2>The American Suburban Sprawl Model Is Faltering, Forcing a Rethink of Housing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that the traditional American model of suburban sprawl, which has driven housing growth for decades, is becoming unsustainable, even in the Sunbelt. Economists have found that housing construction in booming metros like Phoenix and Dallas has slowed dramatically, causing prices to surge, similar to what happened in coastal cities decades ago. This is attributed to restrictive single-family zoning that prevents densification. The piece advocates for a paradigm shift in housing policy, embracing YIMBY principles to allow for more diverse and dense housing types, transforming static suburbs into more dynamic communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an advice column, a reader asks how to balance the desire for a contemplative life of reflection with an altruistic drive to do good in the world. The columnist uses the examples of Buddhist figures Matthieu Ricard and Thich Nhat Hanh to argue that the two goals are not opposed but can actually bolster each other. Contemplative practice can make altruistic action more effective, while engagement with the world's suffering can deepen spiritual insight. The advice suggests pursuing a career of action while intentionally building in periods for contemplation, such as retreats, to find a healthy synthesis.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, "Bring the House Down," is a satirical look at the lives of arts critics, set during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. The story follows two newspaper critics: the acerbic and powerful Alex Lyons, whose scathing reviews can make or break careers, and his junior colleague, Sophie Ridgen. The plot ignites when Alex gives a one-star review to a performer he then sleeps with, leading to a public unraveling that becomes a national spectacle. The review praises the novel as a delightfully readable story, though it notes some characters could be more fully developed.</p>

          <p>Edgar Veytia, a former state attorney general in Nayarit, Mexico, known as "El Diablo," is being sued in a U.S. federal court by families who accuse him of torture, extortion, and other atrocities. Veytia, who admitted to working with drug cartels, was released early from a U.S. prison sentence after testifying against another high-level narco-politician. The lawsuit, filed under the Torture Victim Protection Act, seeks accountability for the reign of terror he oversaw. The case highlights the deep-seated corruption linking Mexican officials to organized crime and the frequent need for victims to seek justice in U.S. courts.</p>

          <p>Legislation in California that would require major fossil fuel companies to pay for climate-related damages has stalled again due to intense lobbying from the oil and gas industry. The "Polluters Pay Climate Superfund Act" aimed to create a fund for climate mitigation and adaptation projects by assessing fees on companies responsible for over a billion metric tons of emissions. Despite momentum following recent wildfires, the bill failed to advance, with opponents arguing it would raise consumer costs. Proponents contend the costs of climate disasters are already being paid by taxpayers.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Trump is systematically purifying the Republican party by ousting or marginalizing anyone who defies his agenda, prioritizing personal loyalty over ideological consistency. It cites the recent retirements of Senator Thom Tillis and Representative Don Bacon, who clashed with the president over his "Big Beautiful Bill," as prime examples of this trend. The author contends that Trump's actions are not about growing the party but about consolidating power, creating a smaller, more compliant base. This process has seen former critics become staunch allies and dissenters forced into early retirement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has experienced its most significant drop in decades, prompting concern among some investors that it may signal a long-term shift in America's global financial standing. The slump reverses a long period of strength and is attributed to factors like President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies, a ballooning national debt, and deep political divisions. While some analysts see it as a temporary correction, others view it as an acceleration of a broader trend of moving away from the dollar, potentially toward a more multi-polar currency system.
