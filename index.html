          <p>The United States and China have reportedly established a framework deal concerning the social media platform TikTok. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the commercial terms have been agreed upon between the private parties involved. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled to meet on Friday to finalize the details. This development comes amid a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban, a measure that has been repeatedly postponed by executive orders.</p>

          <p>Despite geopolitical tensions and other challenges, there are signs that younger Europeans are increasingly considering career opportunities in China. This renewed interest is driven by the country's rapid growth in technology and infrastructure, particularly in cities like Shenzhen and Shanghai. The article suggests a generational divide, with younger individuals being more curious and open to the prospect of working in China's dynamic environment compared to older generations. This trend marks a cautious reversal of the foreign exodus seen during the country's stringent COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

          <p>Following widespread, youth-led anti-corruption protests that resulted in the prime minister's resignation, former chief justice Sushila Karki has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister. The 73-year-old is known for her integrity and lifelong pursuit of justice, making her a consensus choice among protest leaders and civil society. Her immediate challenges include overseeing the rebuilding of public structures destroyed in the unrest and ensuring fresh elections are held on schedule. The international community has broadly welcomed her appointment as a stabilizing force.</p>

          <p>Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, is visiting Berlin for talks with German leaders, setting a tense diplomatic tone. A key point of contention is Nawrocki's renewed demand for approximately €1.5 trillion in World War II reparations from Germany, an issue Berlin considers legally settled. The visit also occurs amid heightened security concerns after Russian drones recently breached Polish airspace, which may push the two NATO partners toward closer security cooperation despite their political differences. However, analysts remain skeptical of a major breakthrough in relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, mortgage experts are offering guidance to prospective homebuyers. They recommend immediately getting a fresh pre-approval to reflect increased buying power and promptly comparing offers from multiple lenders to secure the best terms. Conversely, they advise against assuming rates will continue to fall, which can backfire, and warn against overextending one's budget simply because a lower rate allows for a larger loan. Disciplined and prompt action is key to navigating the competitive market that often follows a rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia and Belarus have commenced major joint military exercises, named Zapad, featuring thousands of troops, aircraft, and tanks. The drills are taking place amid extremely high tensions with NATO, particularly after a recent incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace, which Warsaw deemed intentional. This year's exercises are significantly smaller in scale than previous iterations, as Russia's military capacity is strained by the ongoing war in Ukraine. The maneuvers are being closely watched by neighboring NATO countries, which have increased their military readiness in response.</p>

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are reporting confusion and frustration as their loans are transferred to new servicing companies with little to no direct warning. The article details a borrower's experience of discovering the change only through an email from an unfamiliar company, CRI, and finding her loans unexpectedly placed in administrative forbearance. Experts advise that while such transfers are authorized by the Department of Education, they can create risks, such as lost payments if sent during the transition.

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to every six months. In a social media post, he argued that a semiannual system would save money and encourage corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The idea echoes previous proposals from business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, who have criticized the unhealthy focus on short-term results prompted by quarterly guidance.

          <p>In local elections held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party made significant gains, nearly tripling its result from five years ago. While the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) received the most votes, the AfD's strong showing and the Green party's substantial losses are being interpreted as a major test of public opinion. The results are seen as a protest vote reflecting public discontent with the federal government's handling of issues like housing, migration, and the economy.</p>

          <p>A rare weather event saw at least two tornadoes touch down in southeastern Utah, an area where only two had been confirmed since 1950. The storms destroyed three homes within the Navajo Nation near Montezuma Creek. Authorities have thankfully reported no human injuries as a result of the destructive weather. However, an unknown number of livestock and pets have been reported missing in the aftermath. The National Weather Service is working to determine the exact tracks and wind speeds of the tornadoes.</p>

          <p>A data analysis shows that African nations are increasingly vital to the global supply of critical minerals essential for green technologies, such as cobalt, platinum, and manganese. This resource wealth could boost the continent's GDP by 12% over the next 25 years, representing a transformative economic opportunity. However, the report also highlights significant challenges, including fragile governance, environmental degradation from mining, and inequitable revenue sharing. Currently, African countries are estimated to be generating only about 40% of the potential revenue from the extraction of these valuable minerals.</p>

          <p>Kim Seong-Min, a prominent North Korean defector and founder of Free North Korea Radio, has died at the age of 63 after a battle with cancer. From his base in Seoul, Kim used shortwave radio broadcasts and USB sticks smuggled into the country to provide North Koreans with uncensored foreign news and information about their own government. His work, which aimed to counter the regime's propaganda, made him a target of Pyongyang's state media. He is being remembered by fellow defectors as a leader and a source of hope.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global demand for critical minerals is exacerbating instability and conflict across Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Disputes over control of coltan mines in the eastern DRC have fueled a three-decade conflict, with armed groups, backed by Rwanda, smuggling the mineral and undermining supply chain traceability. This instability has caused mining companies to shift investment away from the Sahel region and toward more stable countries like the Ivory Coast. The extraction is also causing social disruption, with entire communities being displaced to make way for expanding mining operations.</p>

          <p>Germany has launched a €100 million pilot project to address the massive environmental threat posed by 1.6 million tons of World War II ammunition rusting on the floors of the Baltic and North Seas. The decaying munitions are leaking toxic substances, such as TNT, into the marine ecosystem and also pose a risk of spontaneous explosion. A specialized mobile platform is being used off the coast of Boltenhagen to test methods for safely recovering the ordnance. The long-term goal is to develop automated, sea-based systems to recover and destroy the ammunition.</p>
