          <p>Former President Trump has publicly criticized Leonard Leo, a conservative legal activist, and the Federalist Society, a group that previously advised him on judicial nominations. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society's advice on judicial picks and suggested that Leo, who has left the organization, harbors anti-American sentiments and personal ambitions. Leo responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the federal courts. The attacks follow a court ruling against Trump's tariffs, which was decided by judges, some of whom were appointed with the Federalist Society's input, potentially fueling Trump's frustration. Optimism surrounding the political landscape is tempered by these internal conflicts within the conservative movement.</p>

          <p>Nathan Laatsch, an IT specialist for the Defense Intelligence Agency, has been charged with attempting to provide classified information to a foreign government. The FBI initiated an investigation after receiving a tip that Laatsch offered to share classified intelligence due to his disagreement with the current administration's values. Laatsch allegedly transcribed classified information and hid it in his socks and lunchbox, later attempting to deliver it via thumb drive to an undercover FBI agent posing as a foreign emissary. This arrest highlights concerns about individuals with access to classified information potentially selling it to foreign governments amid current unease within the intelligence community. The seriousness of this breach of trust is reflected in the circumstances surrounding the arrest.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration had indicated it would seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court if the tariffs were not reinstated quickly. The appeals court's decision provides the administration with some respite as it prepares to argue that the trade court's ruling should be halted throughout the appeals process. Trump officials insist they have alternative methods for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail in the case, although the initial ruling had already destabilized Trump's economic agenda. The back-and-forth legal battle adds uncertainty to the economic landscape.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports expected to resume once China completes necessary procedures. The deal is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Japan will register fishery processing facilities with Chinese authorities and provide inspection and certification of the seafood, confirming the absence of radioactive substances. The resumption of trade signifies a potential thaw in relations and reduced economic strain on Japanese seafood producers.</p>

Kerik's career included a period as head of a provisional police force in Iraq during President George W. Bush's administration. His legacy is complex, as his rise in law enforcement was later overshadowed by his guilty plea to federal tax fraud and false statement charges, leading to a prison sentence. Kerik received a pardon from President Trump in 2020 and remained active in political circles, highlighting the intersection of law enforcement and political life.</p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly dropped this year, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association, with positive sentiment falling from 67% to 31%.

Nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, and 27% expect business travel spending to decrease. The report also indicates that a third of business travel buyers are reconsidering travel policies to or from the United States, reflecting concerns about costs and visa processing issues.

          <p>President Trump's use of tariffs as an economic weapon is under threat after a court ruling challenged his authority to impose them unilaterally. Although a federal appeals court has temporarily stayed the trade court's ruling, the legal battle continues to raise questions about the extent of presidential power in trade matters. The administration argues that a ruling against Trump would cripple his ability to negotiate trade deals and respond to national emergencies. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs has caused concern among businesses and global leaders, potentially weakening Trump's negotiating position.

Badenoch argues that both leaders are engaging in a "race to the bottom" by considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that limits means-tested benefits to two children in most families. She claims that Starmer and Farage are advocating for taxpayers to fund unlimited child support, which the country cannot afford.

          <p>Nika Melia, a key figure in Georgia's largest opposition group, Coalition for Change, has been detained by police, accused of insulting law enforcement officers. This is the second such detention in recent days, following the pre-trial detention of another leader, Zurab Japaridze. Critics accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of mimicking authoritarian tactics employed by Moscow and steering the country away from its aspirations of joining the European Union. The government denies these allegations, but the detentions have raised concerns about the state of democracy in Georgia. The political climate in Georgia is tense.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an Oval Office press conference with Elon Musk to mark the end of Musk's official role in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's government service is ending due to the legal 130-day limit for his "special government employee" designation. Despite his departure, Trump suggests Musk will continue to assist the administration. DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, although the initiative has faced criticism from Democrats in Congress. Markets are welcoming Musk's return to the private sector, with Tesla shares rising upon news of his exit.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's tenure in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is coming to an end after 129 days marked by significant spending cuts and controversy. DOGE claims to have saved $175 billion through various measures, though the accuracy of these figures has been questioned. Musk's presence in the White House has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given his companies' business dealings with the government. Additionally, cuts to international development programs led by DOGE have been seen as a shift towards US isolationism. Musk's time in government has highlighted the intersection of business, politics, and policy.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume on June 7 after crews spent nearly six weeks reinforcing tracks subject to landslides and coastal erosion. The rail line, serving Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, was closed in April for construction. Emergency construction was approved after several sections of the rail were deemed unstable, with crews placing thousands of tons of boulders and sand to stabilize potential runoff. The Orange County Transportation Authority estimates the total cost of the projects to be around $300 million, addressing recurring interruptions to passenger rail service.
