          <p>Coca-Cola has reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts for both earnings and revenue. The company achieved adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share on $12.62 billion in revenue, beating expectations despite challenging comparisons to a strong performance in the same period last year. Analysts remain optimistic about the beverage giant's future, citing its significant pricing power and extensive global presence. The company's stock has seen a 13% increase this year, pushing its market capitalization over the $300 billion mark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that is 99% effective in preventing HIV through sexual contact, a significant awareness gap exists in the U.S. According to the CDC, only about a third of the 1.2 million people who could benefit from PrEP are currently using it. The article highlights major disparities, with Black and Hispanic communities, as well as women, having much lower uptake rates compared to White individuals. Cost and accessibility remain significant barriers, and a pending federal court case could further threaten insurance coverage for the preventative drug.</p>

          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations, reporting adjusted earnings of $2.53 per share on $47.12 billion in revenue. Despite the positive results, the company affirmed its full-year guidance which accounts for a potential multi-billion dollar impact from U.S. auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives. The company's performance and future outlook are also shaped by the evolving landscape for electric vehicles, particularly with the impending end of federal EV tax credits.

          <p>The Cincinnati Bengals' front office is publicly expressing frustration with first-round draft pick Shemar Stewart, who is holding out from training camp due to a contract dispute. Executive Duke Tobin and owner Mike Brown have commented on the "peculiar" situation, which reportedly centers on contract language regarding the voiding of future guarantees in cases of league disciplinary action. Stewart, the 17th overall pick, argues he is not asking for anything unprecedented and feels the team is prioritizing winning arguments over winning games. The impasse continues as the team's training camp is set to begin.</p>

          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has accused NHS England of putting patients at risk with its new strategy for the upcoming resident doctors' strike. The union warns that the NHS's plan to limit the cancellation of routine procedures will overstretch the senior doctors who are providing cover, potentially leading to last-minute cancellations and patient harm. This approach, overseen by new NHS chief executive Sir Jim Mackey, marks a shift from previous strikes where non-urgent care was widely rescheduled to ensure safety. Talks between the government and the BMA are ongoing to avert the walkout, which is centered on a long-running dispute over pay restoration.</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, a 52-year-old unarmed White man, has been officially ruled a homicide by the Jefferson County medical examiner. The autopsy concluded his death was from heart failure associated with cocaine use and restraint during an altercation with Irondale police in August 2024. Reeder's family and their attorney, who have viewed unreleased body camera footage, state that an officer knelt on his neck for over three minutes as he said he couldn't breathe. The city of Irondale disputes this characterization, claiming no knee was placed on his neck and that officers used minimal force on an erratic individual.</p>

His arguments, aligning with key White House advisors, posit that limiting U.S. tech exports ultimately aids Chinese competitors.

          <p>New research from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that a specific "social populist" strategy could help Democrats win back a crucial segment of Donald Trump's supporters. The study analyzes decades of survey data, finding that while working-class voters are more socially moderate than the Democratic base, they are strongly supportive of an "economic egalitarian" agenda. This includes policies like raising the minimum wage, protecting jobs, and strengthening Social Security. The research identifies that approximately 11% of Trump's working-class voters hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views, representing a small but potentially election-swaying portion of the electorate concentrated in key swing states.</p>

This contrasts with participants without their dogs, whose short-term response was flat, a potential sign of a dysregulated system from chronic stress. The findings suggest that dogs don't just calm us down, but help keep our bodies in an optimal, more resilient zone for handling stressful situations effectively.</p>

The measures will include asset freezes and travel bans aimed at disrupting the criminal networks that facilitate small boat crossings of the English Channel. The initial list is expected to name about two dozen individuals, with future sanctions potentially targeting corrupt officials and financial middlemen. While the government hails this as a key tool to "smash" smuggling gangs, some experts express skepticism, noting that the impact may be limited without broader international cooperation.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 61 leading companies in Germany, including Siemens, Volkswagen, and SAP, has launched a major investment initiative called "Made for Germany." The group has collectively pledged to invest €631 billion in the country over the next three years in factories, research, and development. This move signals a significant return of optimism to the German economy, which has been struggling with recession and low investment. The initiative follows a meeting with Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whose new government has prioritized reviving the economy through infrastructure spending, tax relief, and reduced energy prices for industry.

The move comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period during which the party has struggled in opinion polls following a poor showing in the last general and local elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government borrowed £20.7 billion in June, a figure £6.6 billion higher than the same month last year and more than analysts had expected. The Office for National Statistics attributed the increase to higher spending on public services and rising debt interest payments, which have been pushed up by inflation. This data intensifies the pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with economists suggesting that tax hikes or spending cuts may be necessary in the autumn Budget to meet fiscal targets. The government's debt interest payments alone nearly doubled to £16.4 billion for the month, highlighting the difficult fiscal environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bus driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing serious injury by careless driving after a double-decker bus crashed into a low canal bridge in Eccles, Salford. The impact tore the roof off the vehicle, injuring 20 people, three of them seriously. A passenger was reportedly thrown from the top deck during the incident, which occurred on a road with clear height restriction warnings. Transport for Greater Manchester has launched an urgent investigation, noting that the bus was not on its usual route. This is the second time in just over a year that a bus has had its roof ripped off at the same bridge.</p>

The agency has temporarily reassigned field office staff to answer phones, but workers say this is straining local offices and increasing wait times for other vital services like processing claims. This shuffling of responsibilities is a direct result of chronic understaffing at the agency, which has seen thousands of employees leave in recent months.

Policy experts and humanitarian organizations have condemned the move as coercive, neo-colonial, and a distortion of development goals. The policy would condition aid on a country's willingness to manage returns, readmissions, and border controls, effectively turning them into Europe's border guards. Critics argue this approach ignores the root causes of migration, such as poverty and conflict, some of which are exacerbated by European policies, and undermines trust and partnership between the continents.</p>

          <p>Scientists who monitor the Earth's rotation have noted a recent trend of slightly shorter days, with some days in July being a millisecond or more short of the standard 24 hours. While variations in the planet's spin are normal, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity and atmospheric winds, the last decade has seen a notable number of faster-than-average days. This has raised the theoretical possibility of a "negative leap second" to keep atomic time synchronized with Earth's rotation, though experts consider this unlikely. Researchers also note that human-induced climate change, by melting polar ice, is now a measurable factor influencing the planet's rotational speed.</p>

When the U.S. government ordered the incarceration of people with Japanese ancestry, she chose to go to the Manzanar concentration camp with her young, half-Japanese son, Tommy, rather than let him be taken alone. The book details the desolate conditions of the camp and the family's subsequent fight for reparations.

His situation challenges the political narrative of widespread fraud, revealing instead a "benefit cliff" where a minor pay increase can lead to the loss of essential, unaffordable healthcare.
