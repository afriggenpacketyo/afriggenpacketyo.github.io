          <p>Activists are organizing a second wave of "No Kings" protests across the U.S. to challenge President Donald Trump's administration, citing concerns over immigration crackdowns and troop deployments. Organizers, expecting millions of participants, aim to connect frustrated Americans with local advocacy groups. Republicans have criticized the rallies as "Hate America" events, linking them to the ongoing federal government shutdown. The protests underscore deep political divisions and a pushback against perceived authoritarian actions by the administration.</p>

          <p>A 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 in Southern California will close for four hours as U.S. Marines conduct a live-fire artillery demonstration over the freeway. The event, part of the Marines' 250th anniversary celebration at Camp Pendleton, has drawn sharp criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who called it an "absurd show of force" and dangerous. The closure coincides with "No Kings" anti-Trump rallies, further highlighting tensions between the state and the federal administration. Military officials maintain safety protocols are in place.</p>

          <p>Ferrari chairman John Elkann publicly affirmed his "full confidence" in team principal Frederic Vasseur amidst reports of potential leadership changes. The statement comes as the Italian Formula 1 team faces a challenging season, risking a drop to fourth in the constructors' championship after an earlier strong start. Elkann emphasized the importance of teamwork and focus on performance, dismissing speculation about Vasseur's position. This public backing aims to stabilize the team and rally support for their ongoing efforts.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his Duke of York title and other honors, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre has urged King Charles to strip him of his "prince" title. Giuffre, who alleged she was sexually assaulted by Andrew when she was 17, died by suicide earlier this year, with her posthumous memoir detailing the alleged encounters. Her family views Andrew's latest move as vindication for survivors, calling for full accountability in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. Andrew continues to deny all accusations against him.</p>

          <p>McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri crashed out of the United States Grand Prix sprint race in Austin after a collision shortly after the start. Piastri's car clipped Nico Hulkenberg's Sauber, sending him into Norris and eliminating both McLarens, along with Fernando Alonso. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions between the title-contending drivers, despite team management's efforts to allow them to race freely. Max Verstappen of Red Bull capitalized on the chaos to win the sprint, further closing the championship gap.</p>

          <p>Krislyn Massey, a Texas student, found her trip to China unexpectedly complicated by high-level political tensions between Washington and Beijing.
