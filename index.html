          <p>Seventeen police officers were injured during a second night of unrest in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, following a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault. Protesters threw petrol bombs, bricks, and fireworks at police, who responded with baton rounds and a water cannon. Five people were arrested, bringing the total number of injured officers to 32. The violence has been described by police as "racist thuggery," and First Minister Michelle O'Neill condemned the disorder, calling for it to stop immediately as PSNI Chief Constable Jon Boutcher said the violence endangered lives and risked the ongoing criminal justice process. The events have led some residents to display signs indicating their nationality, and tensions have been rising in the town, with concerns about illegal immigration. The situation is tense and dangerous.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reached an agreement on a trade framework after high-level talks in London, now pending approval from President Trump and President Xi Jinping.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will brief President Trump on the deal. While the framework signals a commitment to de-escalate and continue dialogue, the outcome of concrete agreements remains uncertain. The agreement is a step forward.</p>

          <p>Following days of protests in Los Angeles sparked by immigration operations, a curfew has been implemented in downtown L.A. after California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized President Trump's deployment of National Guard and U.S. Marines troops. Newsom accused Trump of abusing power and inflaming the situation, while Mayor Karen Bass cited escalating violence and looting as the reason for the curfew. Demonstrations have continued, with clashes between protesters and law enforcement, resulting in numerous arrests. The protests began after immigration raids in several downtown locations, with protesters denouncing the arrests and the deployment of military troops to the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hall of Famer Tim Brown, now commissioner of The Arena League, proposes eliminating kickers from the NFL, drawing from his experience in arena football where kickers are absent. Brown argues that removing kickers would speed up the game and enhance its entertainment value, suggesting a throw-off instead. The NFL has already made changes to kickoff rules, and the United Football League has removed kicking for points after touchdowns. Any rule change in the NFL requires approval from 24 of the 32 team owners. The change could potentially lead to a faster-paced and more exciting game.</p>

          <p>An appellate court has ruled that President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs can remain in effect until at least the end of July, pausing a lower court ruling that blocked them pending appeal. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously deemed many of Trump's tariffs illegal, including those on major trading partners like Canada, Mexico, and China. Trump has justified the tariffs using a 1977 law allowing presidential regulation of imports during emergencies, but businesses and state governments sued, arguing he lacks the legal authority. The trade war has impacted markets and faced bipartisan criticism, but Trump maintains the tariffs are necessary to address trade imbalances and restore U.S. manufacturing.</p>

The administration claims the military's role is to protect federal facilities and employees, raising questions about potential policing activities, which are restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. Meanwhile, an appeal hearing is scheduled for Trump's criminal conviction and sentencing related to hush money payments made before the 2016 election. The case centers around falsifying business records to conceal a payment, and Trump's legal team argues the case should be moved to federal court.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in Europe are experiencing a strong rebound in 2025 after a slowdown last year, with registrations surging by 20% from January to April. The recovery is primarily driven by corporate sales spurred by an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions. However, consumer enthusiasm for EVs remains stagnant, with concerns over battery range and charging infrastructure persisting. While Tesla's sales have plummeted, Chinese brands like BYD are gaining ground, intensifying competition in the European auto market. The industry faces new challenges, including potential tariffs on cars exported to the United States, as threatened by US President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Google is offering buyouts to employees across several divisions, including Search, as part of ongoing efforts to reduce headcount and cut costs. The "voluntary exit program" applies to U.S.-based employees, and some teams are mandating office returns for remote workers. This move comes after Google's finance chief emphasized the need for cost-cutting as the company expands its investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The buyouts aim to provide a supportive exit path for employees who feel misaligned with the company's strategy or are struggling to meet expectations.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel stated that Commerzbank's current share price is too high for a takeover offer, despite UniCredit holding a 28% stake in the German bank. Orcel emphasized that UniCredit would not see value for its investors at the current share level and would first seek a "constructive solution" to opposition from the German government. Commerzbank's shares have surged this year, benefiting from a broader rally in German equities. Orcel indicated that UniCredit is "far away" from a merger bid and believes the share price has exceeded its fundamentals.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk issued a statement expressing regret for his recent social media posts criticizing President Trump, stating that they "went too far." The dispute, triggered by Musk's opposition to Trump's tax-cut bill, had threatened Musk's wealth when the president raised the possibility of retaliating by cutting off his government contracts. Tesla shares rose following Musk's post, after sliding previously. It remains uncertain whether Musk's expressions of regret will repair his relationship with Trump. The scale of the blow-up casts doubt on whether the two will ever resume the close friendship they had during the first several months of Trumpâ€™s second term.</p>

The right sees progressives and left activists as an existential threat to the United States. This is rooted in a fear of chaotic, violent left-wing radicals, paired with a sense that mainstream liberals are in thrall to these extremists. The protests have thus brought the various factions of the Trump right together.</p>
