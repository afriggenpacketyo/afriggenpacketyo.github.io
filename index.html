            <p>BBC Sport has launched Uefa Champions League Squares, an interactive game for UK users to play alongside live Champions League matches. Players answer trivia questions for a chance to edit their bingo-style gamecard and mark off squares as corresponding events occur during the games. The chance to answer trivia questions ends at 17:00 GMT, but users can still receive a gamecard after that time, though without the ability to edit it. The game aims to enhance the viewing experience by providing a fun and engaging way to follow the matches, as players await the first full house card.</p>

            <p>Avelo Airlines, a budget carrier, has entered into an agreement to operate deportation flights for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from Mesa Gateway Airport in Arizona, starting in May. The decision has sparked controversy, with Avelo's CEO acknowledging the sensitivity of the topic but citing the move as beneficial for expansion and job security. The flights, both domestic and international, will be supported by three Boeing 737-800 planes. The mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, where Avelo also operates, has voiced his opposition, and a local immigrant advocacy group is urging a boycott of the airline.</p>

            <p>Birmingham, the second-largest city in the U.K., is struggling with a growing garbage crisis as a sanitation strike enters its fifth week, creating unsanitary conditions and public health concerns. The strike, led by Unite union members, stems from disputes over job eliminations and pay cuts, exacerbating the city council's existing financial troubles due to a historic pay discrimination settlement. Piles of uncollected waste have led to illegal dumping, vermin infestations, and even reports of garbage fires, prompting the council to declare a major incident. Talks between the union and the council are ongoing, but a resolution remains elusive.</p>

            <p>Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, advocates for a significant interest rate cut to at least 4% in May to counteract the economic fallout from Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Bean believes aggressive action is necessary to address the uncertainty and potential recessionary impact of the tariffs on businesses and consumer confidence. David Blanchflower, another former rate setter, suggests an emergency meeting to consider a deeper rate reduction. Financial markets have already priced in some rate cuts, but Bean argues for a more substantial response to the disinflationary shock caused by the tariff war. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry has declared its firm opposition to U.S. President Trump's threat of escalating tariffs and pledged to implement countermeasures to protect its rights and interests. The statement comes after Trump threatened to impose an additional 50% duty on U.S. imports from China if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory 34% tariff. China views the U.S. threat as a mistake and insists that it will not accept it. The escalating trade war between the two economic giants has raised concerns about its potential impact on the global economy.</p>

            <p>Defense stocks in Europe and Asia are outperforming their U.S. counterparts as countries increase their defense spending amid growing uncertainty about American alliances. Analysts suggest that President Trump's realignment with Russia and perceived betrayal of Ukraine have led some countries to question their reliance on the U.S. As a result, European countries are increasingly inclined to purchase weapons from European firms or allies with similar strategic goals. The shift reflects a desire for greater autonomy in defense policy and a reduced reliance on U.S. arms transfers.</p>

The former officer suggests that time is on Beijing's side in the Taiwan Strait, as mainland China concentrates on military development and expanding its global presence.</p>

            <p>Global stock markets experienced significant volatility following President Trump's tariff rollout, prompting fears of economic damage. Despite the turmoil, Trump has doubled down on his trade policies, threatening additional tariffs on China.

The administration has also announced direct talks with Iran to prevent the country from obtaining an atomic bomb. Israeli PM Netanyahu met with Trump to discuss Gaza and tariffs.</p>

While the administration is claiming the ruling as a win, the justices mandated that deportees must be given a chance to challenge their removal. The act, last used in World War Two, grants the US president sweeping powers to order the detention and deportation of natives or citizens of an "enemy" nation without following the usual processes.
