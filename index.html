          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met with President Trump at the White House to discuss economic developments, emphasizing that monetary policy decisions would be based on careful, objective, and non-political analysis. The meeting occurred amidst Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to lower interest rates, using his Truth Social platform to pressure the FOMC. Powell had previously stated he would not initiate a meeting with the president. Markets largely expect the Fed to hold steady on rates until there is more clarity on tariff uncertainty, with futures market pricing indicating rate cuts may not resume until at least September. The Fed remains committed to its dual mandate of full employment and stable prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, arguing that the ruling poses a national security and economic threat. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the judges who struck down Trump's tariffs, accusing them of abusing their judicial power and undermining the credibility of the United States. The administration is also requesting the trade court to pause enforcement of their ruling while the case is appealed. A separate case in Washington, D.C., also declared many of Trump's tariffs unlawful, prompting accusations of judicial tyranny from White House officials. Optimism is low as the executive and judicial branches clash over the reach of presidential authority.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic suggests several books to combat boredom, including Alexander Chee's "The Queen of the Night," Peter Cornell's "The Ways of Paradise," Bae Suah's "Untold Night and Day," Simone de Beauvoir's "America Day by Day," and Lydia Sandgren's "Collected Works." These books offer various escapes from monotony through immersive storytelling, intriguing facts, surreal narratives, and complex character studies. "The Queen of the Night" provides high drama, while "The Ways of Paradise" delves into occult murmurs. "Untold Night and Day" offers a detective novel with a poetic twist, and "America Day by Day" chronicles de Beauvoir's journey through the United States. "Collected Works" is a reverse bildungsroman with a central mystery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction to allow Harvard University to continue enrolling international students, halting the Trump administration's efforts to ban the practice. The decision comes after the same judge granted a temporary restraining order last Friday. Harvard has nearly 7,000 international students, comprising more than a quarter of its student body, and their tuition represents a crucial financial lifeline for the university. The judge's decision provides temporary relief for international students, although the situation remains part of a larger, ongoing process. The ruling helps to stabilize a potentially volatile situation.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 kitchen faucets sold on Amazon have been recalled due to potentially harmful levels of lead exposure, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The faucets, manufactured in China and sold under the brands Vfauosit, Kicimpro, and Basdehen, were found to contain lead that could leak into the water supply, posing a risk to infants and young children. Consumers are advised to stop using the faucets immediately and contact the vendor for a refund, providing a photograph of disposal. Until the faucets are replaced, consumers should run the water for 15 seconds before consumption. The recalls highlight the importance of product safety testing.</p>

          <p>Focus groups reveal that Trump voters prioritize loyalty to the president over the traditional role of Congress as an independent branch of government. Participants praised lawmakers who supported Trump and criticized those who deviated from his agenda, expressing disdain for both the hard-right House Freedom Caucus and moderate Republicans. They reserved particular aversion for Senator Mitch McConnell, viewing him as an obstructionist to Trump's agenda. These perspectives help explain why many Republican lawmakers have aligned themselves with the president, despite potential reservations. The findings highlight the continued influence of Trump within the Republican base.</p>

Musk thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending, stating that his Department of Government Efficiency's mission will continue. The White House confirmed that Musk is leaving on good terms and will remain a friend and advisor to the president. Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts and the termination of billions of dollars in government contracts, claiming to have cut around $160 billion in spending.

          <p>Research reveals that sexual exploitation and domestic violence soared after the Lahaina wildfire in 2023, with pre-existing gender and racial inequalities exacerbated by the disaster response. One in six female fire survivors surveyed felt forced to engage in sexual acts for basic necessities. Immigrant women and limited English speakers felt particularly unsafe in emergency shelters. The decision to reopen West Maui to tourists shortly after the fire may have compounded a sense of powerlessness among survivors and fueled domestic violence. The report calls for urgent reform of emergency management, putting gender at the heart of future disaster planning.</p>

          <p>Harvard's graduation day was marked by both celebration and visible signs of the university's ongoing fight with the Trump administration. Protests against the government and campus antisemitism took place near the ceremony, while alumni distributed stickers supporting the university. The ceremonies provided reassurance that the university's mission would endure. Harvard has been resisting the Trump administration's attacks on academic freedom, arguing that the government is attempting to stifle critical voices. The university has found itself at the center of political controversy.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Juliana Leon, who died during a 2021 heat wave in the Pacific Northwest, has sued seven oil and gas companies for wrongful death. The suit alleges that the companies failed to warn the public of the dangers of planet-warming emissions and funded campaigns to obscure the scientific consensus on global warming. This is reportedly the first wrongful death case targeting fossil fuel companies over their role in global warming. The case is expected to be closely watched for how it could affect a wider range of energy projects. This lawsuit could set a precedent for holding fossil fuel companies accountable.</p>
