          <p>A devastating 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has claimed over 1,400 lives and injured more than 3,100, with rescue operations continuing in severely affected areas. The disaster, which destroyed thousands of homes, was followed by a 5.2 magnitude aftershock, further complicating relief efforts. Many health facilities remain functional, but injured children are being treated without their parents, highlighting the profound human cost. Earthquakes are frequent in this region due to the intersection of tectonic plates.</p>

          <p>Constellation Brands, parent company of Modelo and Corona, has significantly cut its fiscal-year earnings and sales forecasts, causing its stock to drop by 6%. CEO Bill Newlands attributed the decline to a challenging macroeconomic environment and a notable deceleration in high-end beer sales among Hispanic consumers. The company plans to address this by divesting "mainstream" wine brands and continuing its share repurchase program, aiming to regain market stability.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has experienced a cyberattack that "severely disrupted" its vehicle production, including at its main UK plants, and impacted its retail business. The company, owned by Tata Motors, took immediate action to shut down IT systems to minimize damage and is working to restart operations. While there is no evidence of customer data theft, the incident occurred at a crucial time for UK car sales. This attack represents a fresh blow to JLR, which recently faced a slump in profits.</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt hits a record $1.21 trillion with average rates near 22%, many consumers face payment struggles. Credit card forbearance offers temporary relief by pausing or reducing payments without penalty, typically requiring proof of financial hardship like job loss or unexpected expenses. Eligibility often favors those with a good payment history prior to hardship. If forbearance isn't an option, alternatives include debt consolidation, management plans, or negotiating debt forgiveness. This article emphasizes proactive steps to manage debt.

          <p>American policymakers are increasingly viewing China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as a cohesive unit, dubbed the "axis of upheaval" or "CRINKs," united by a shared interest in challenging the U.S.-led international order. This article notes their deepening cooperation, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, involving military agreements, economic support, and shared opposition to Western influence. While an alliance of convenience, some experts argue U.S. economic pressure has inadvertently strengthened these ties. The article also discusses the potential for a new U.S. administration to approach these relationships differently.</p>

          <p>The UK government's long-term borrowing costs have surged to their highest level since 1998, with 30-year bond yields reaching 5.698%. This rise makes it more expensive for the government to borrow, putting significant pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Budget. Analysts anticipate potential tax increases to meet fiscal rules, while the pound also fell against the dollar. Global factors like geopolitical tensions and U.S. trade policies contribute to the rising costs, signaling difficult economic choices for the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has again targeted Chicago, calling it the "worst and most dangerous city," and promising to solve its crime problem "fast" following a violent Labor Day weekend that saw eight deaths and over 50 injuries. Trump's suggestions of federal intervention, including the National Guard, have been rejected by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who view such a move as "un-American." Despite Trump's claims, official data indicates a significant drop in violent crime in Chicago during the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>Colombia's natural gas industry expects a 34.6% increase in investment to $1.1 billion in 2025, primarily driven by exploration and production efforts. This surge aims to address an anticipated gas deficit, which is projected to reach 20% by 2026 due to reduced exploration linked to President Gustavo Petro's energy transition policies. The Naturgas association highlighted 11 identified projects to boost the country's gas supply, indicating a strategic response to energy needs. (not investment advice)</p>
