          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 17:40:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund forecasts that the Bank of England might implement three more interest rate cuts this year due to higher-than-expected inflation in the UK. The IMF predicts UK inflation will be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%, attributing this to increased energy and water bills. The organization also lowered its economic growth forecast for the UK to 1.1% in 2025, citing global repercussions from US trade tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves responded by highlighting the UK's stronger projected growth compared to other major European countries and emphasized her commitment to advocating for free and fair trade during upcoming meetings in Washington.
