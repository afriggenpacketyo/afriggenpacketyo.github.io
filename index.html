          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded in what authorities have described as a "total ambush" in Idaho. The incident began when a gunman intentionally started a 20-acre wildfire on Canfield Mountain to lure first responders into a trap, subsequently opening fire on them with a high-powered rifle. After an hours-long standoff involving over 300 law enforcement officers, a deceased male suspect was located near the scene. The motive for the attack remains unknown, and the investigation is ongoing as crews also work to contain the blaze.</p>

The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, Kisenosato, in 2017, and his rapid rise has garnered significant attention. Onosato expressed his desire to overcome his past mixed results in Nagoya and bring energy to his hometown of Tsubata in Ishikawa Prefecture, which was heavily affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year.

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is facing a critical court decision that could declare its recent party congress null and void, potentially delegitimizing its entire reform-minded leadership. The legal challenge was brought by the party's old guard, led by former chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu, following their defeat in a leadership vote last November. Analysts suggest the trial may be a strategic maneuver by President Erdogan to weaken the resurgent opposition, which has gained popularity under its new leadership. A ruling against the current leadership could plunge the party into chaos and sideline its popular presidential candidate, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has commenced debate and a series of amendment votes, known as a 'vote-a-rama,' on a major Republican legislative package dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by President Trump. The process allows senators to offer unlimited amendments before a final passage vote, which requires a 51-vote majority. President Trump has urged Republican senators to support the bill while cautioning them not to make overly drastic cuts, reminding them they need to be reelected. The legislation has faced opposition from some Republicans, including Senator Thom Tillis, who criticized its deep cuts to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>Canada has rescinded its plan to impose a Digital Services Tax on large technology firms, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the proposed 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users a "blatant attack on our country." The tax would have retroactively affected companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the policy reversal after a phone call with Trump, aiming to make progress on a new economic and security relationship ahead of a July 21 timeline.

          <p>This opinion article analyzes the racist and Islamophobic reaction to Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary, arguing it exposes a deep-seated prejudice within the American political establishment. The author contends that the backlash, which includes calls for his deportation and smears labeling him a terrorist sympathizer, is not just about his Muslim identity but also his progressive politics on economics and Israel. Despite Mamdani's efforts to clarify his positions and condemn hate, the vitriol continues, largely unchallenged by senior Democratic leaders. The piece concludes that this reaction reveals the establishment's fear of marginalized views becoming mainstream.</p>

          <p>Japan's industrial output saw a modest increase of 0.5 percent in May compared to the previous month, according to preliminary government data. This marks the first rise in two months and was primarily driven by strong production of manufacturing machinery, including metal molds used in vehicle production. The seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8 against the 2020 baseline of 100. This slight rebound follows a revised 1.1 percent decrease in April, offering a tentative sign of stabilization in the country's industrial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

He proposed German or European participation in the nuclear arsenals of France and the UK, or even a separate program with other European states. The proposal was met with sharp criticism from leftist and coalition partner parties, who emphasized commitment to nuclear non-proliferation.</p>

          <p>Recent market speculation has positioned British oil giant BP as a potential takeover target for rivals like Shell, driven by a combination of strategic shifts and leadership changes. The article traces this vulnerability back to BP's 2020 pivot towards renewable energy under former CEO Bernard Looney, a strategy that has led to share price underperformance compared to its peers. Looney's abrupt resignation in 2023 further destabilized the company. Despite a subsequent strategic reset to increase investment in oil and gas, investor confidence has not recovered, fueling rumors of acquisition by competitors like Shell, Chevron, or Exxon Mobil.

This article details how the pastime is driven not only by tradition but also by widespread poverty and unemployment, offering a desperate gamble for many. Men gather in secret to bet on the fights, treating their roosters like prized athletes. The events are often a source of both community and conflict, with disputes over bets sometimes escalating into violence. For many participants, cockfighting represents a livelihood and a brutal escape in a city long shaped by conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" who are prepared to purchase TikTok, and that he could reveal their identities within two weeks. This development comes as the social media platform faces a divest-or-ban law in the U.S. due to concerns over its Chinese ownership by ByteDance. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline to September 17, suggested that any deal would likely require approval from Beijing, but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would agree to it.

Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, which has supplied Russia with drones for its war effort, Moscow offered only platitudes and calls for peace rather than tangible military or diplomatic support.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and new research explains why. Studies reveal that the unique characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness. The rapid and smooth acceleration of EVs also contributes to the effect. Researchers are now exploring solutions to mitigate this issue and improve passenger comfort in new energy vehicles.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came just hours after President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The threat was a response to Tillis's opposition to the president's major spending and tax bill, which the senator argued would betray promises by making devastating cuts to Medicaid. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that leaders with independent thinking are becoming an "endangered species." His departure opens up a key Senate seat in a competitive state.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy from Sun Valley, who was allegedly murdered by his youth soccer coach, died from acute alcohol poisoning, according to the family's attorney. The victim, Omar Hernandez, was found dead in a ditch in early April after he had gone to visit his coach, Mario Edgardo Garcia Aquino. Garcia Aquino has been charged with murder with the special circumstance of committing lewd acts with a child. This new finding raises further questions about the events leading to the boy's death, as the case against the coach, who had prior allegations of sexual misconduct, proceeds.</p>
