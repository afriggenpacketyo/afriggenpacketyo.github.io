          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 23:43:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has officially approved the $8 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global. The deal, which transfers broadcast licenses for 28 CBS television stations, was cleared after Skydance made several commitments, including ensuring unbiased journalism and ending diversity initiatives. The 2-1 vote faced dissent from a Democratic commissioner who criticized Paramount's "cowardly capitulation" to the administration, suggesting the public will pay the price for the decision. The merger follows Paramount's settlement of a lawsuit with Donald Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the policies release criminals onto the streets, while immigrant advocates argue the laws are crucial for public safety by ensuring all residents feel safe reporting crimes. The lawsuit specifically targets city provisions that obstruct communication between local and federal law enforcement, escalating tensions over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have agreed to a 50-year commitment to deepen their AUKUS defense and economic ties, focusing on the development of nuclear-powered submarines. The new treaty is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and could result in £20 billion in British exports over the next 25 years. This reinforcement of the pact comes amid signals of uncertainty from the United States regarding its long-term role and growing concerns over China's military activities in the Indo-Pacific. The agreement underscores a renewed focus on collective security in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a joint visit to the Federal Reserve's headquarters, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell openly disagreed about the cost of an ongoing renovation project. Trump claimed the cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining the president was including a separate building completed five years ago. Despite the disagreement and prior threats from Trump to fire Powell over the project's budget, the president stated he doesn't think firing him is necessary. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions, with Trump also reiterating his demand for lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics in China has become the first to directly observe quantum friction between solid materials. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds actually slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect was traced to how bending the material altered electron movement, locking them into fixed energy levels and reducing the conversion of motion into heat. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for creating ultra-efficient nanodevices with minimal wear.</p>

The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for around $300,000 in a county where the median price is nearly $475,000. This rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines and roads to catch up. With another 13,000 homes already approved, Princeton is racing to manage its growth, with projections to reach 100,000 residents within five years.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced a new stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving the team closer to building a new home at the RFK Stadium site. The deal was reached despite President Trump's recent threat to block it unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name, a moniker widely condemned as a racist slur. Council chairman Phil Mendelson called the president's comments an unhelpful distraction and expressed confidence the deal would pass. The amended agreement reportedly includes $950 million in revenue benefits for the district and is supported by Mayor Muriel Bowser as a driver of jobs and investment.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested while dressed as the restaurant's mouse mascot on charges of debit card theft.

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired by the Justice Department are speaking out, calling their terminations "arbitrary" and "unfair." The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases in Boston and Chicago, said they received no explanation for their dismissals. They also alleged they were pressured on how to rule in certain cases to make it easier for ICE to apprehend immigrants at courthouses. Their firings are part of a larger trend, with over 100 immigration judges reportedly fired or transferred under the Trump administration, exacerbating a backlog of nearly four million cases.</p>

Coach Todd Bowles stated the move is about helping Watson become a "healthier player" and that he is currently "day to day." Watson, who weighed 464 pounds at his pro day, had reportedly lost 25-30 pounds before the draft but is still working with a team nutritionist to reach a more ideal playing weight.

The four men—Jay Merchant, Jonathan Mathew, Philippe Moryoussef, and Christian Bittar—were convicted in an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the manipulation of interest rates that was central to the 2008 financial crisis.

The unusually hot weather is disrupting tourism, forcing Santa to stay indoors, and causing reindeer to flee to roads to escape mosquitoes. Scientists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events to human-caused climate change, noting the Arctic is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The heatwave has broken a record for length that stood since 1972.</p>
