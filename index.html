The club parted ways with Nuno after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite his success in securing their highest Premier League finish since 1995 and qualifying for European competition last season. Postecoglou, who was recently sacked by Tottenham after a difficult season but also led them to a Europa League victory, is expected to be in place before Forest's upcoming match against Arsenal.</p>

These plans, which feature lower monthly premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs, were previously restricted to individuals under 30 or those granted a rare hardship exemption. By expanding this exemption, the administration hopes to reduce costs for consumers and encourage more uninsured individuals, particularly younger and healthier people, to purchase coverage, potentially stabilizing the insurance market.

          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister, Khadga Prasad Oli, has resigned following escalating anti-government protests that have turned violent, resulting in at least 19 deaths. The unrest was initially triggered by a government ban on several social media platforms but has since grown into a broader movement against widespread corruption and poor governance, led primarily by young people. Despite the lifting of the social media ban and the prime minister's resignation, protests have continued, with demonstrators setting fire to the residences of several senior politicians, signaling deep-seated public anger.</p>

          <p>The latest results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), also known as the Nation's Report Card, reveal a continued decline in student academic performance. Eighth-graders' science scores have dropped since 2019, while 12th-graders' scores in both math and reading have also fallen, with the lowest-performing students reaching historic lows. This release of scores is the first since the Trump administration implemented significant cuts at the U.S. Education Department, which oversees the testing. The data points to ongoing challenges in the American education system, exacerbated by factors like increased student absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Recent cuts to Medicaid enacted under President Trump are projected to significantly impact children's hospitals, which rely on the program for nearly half of their revenue. The law, which reduces federal Medicaid spending by approximately $900 billion over a decade, includes a cap on supplemental payments that many hospitals use to cover the gap between low reimbursement rates and the actual cost of care. Hospital administrators warn that these funding reductions could force them to cut essential services, including mental health support and specialized pediatric care for low-income and vulnerable children.

          <p>At a recent BRICS summit, India urged fellow member nations, particularly China and Russia, to address significant trade deficits that disadvantage New Delhi. While the bloc presented a united front against U.S. trade tariffs, India's focus highlighted internal economic friction, with its trade deficit with China reaching a record $99.21 billion. India's External Affairs Minister called for a review of trade flows within the group to find expeditious solutions. This appeal contrasts with China and Russia's view of BRICS as a geopolitical counterweight to the West, underscoring differing priorities within the economic alliance.</p>

Instead of a structural breakup, Google will be required to share some information with rivals and establish an oversight committee.

          <p>North Korean state media announced that leader Kim Jong Un has overseen the final ground test of a new high-thrust, solid-fuel engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Solid-fuel technology is a significant concern for international observers because it allows missiles to be fueled in advance, making them quicker to launch and harder to detect before deployment. Analysts believe this successful test signals that North Korea is preparing for a full-scale test launch of a new, more advanced ICBM, potentially before the end of the year, further escalating regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech company Baidu is set to raise 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) through a "dim sum" bond, which is denominated in yuan but issued outside mainland China. The funds are intended to support the company's aggressive expansion into artificial intelligence and provide operational flexibility, particularly after reporting weak second-quarter earnings. This move allows Baidu to capitalize on relatively low Chinese interest rates and strong investor demand for non-dollar assets. It is the company's second such bond issuance this year, reflecting a broader trend among Chinese firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Shanghai subsidiary of French fashion house Dior has been fined by Chinese authorities for transferring customer data overseas without conducting the required security assessments. According to state media, the company sent personal data of Chinese customers to its headquarters in France without obtaining proper consent or implementing adequate security measures like encryption. The investigation was launched after Chinese customers received data breach alerts. This penalty reflects China's increasingly strict enforcement of its data privacy and cross-border data transfer regulations for multinational corporations.</p>

          <p>French artificial intelligence startup Mistral AI has achieved a valuation of nearly $14 billion after a new funding round led by Dutch chip-making equipment giant ASML. ASML invested 1.3 billion euros to acquire an 11% stake in the company, which is considered a leading European competitor to OpenAI. The investment more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation and underscores the continued massive flow of capital into the generative AI sector. Existing investors, including Nvidia and Andreessen Horowitz, also participated, signaling strong confidence in Mistral's development of large language models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison sentence, overturning a controversial arrangement that allowed him to stay in a hospital instead of a jail cell. Thaksin, who returned to Thailand in 2023 after years in exile, spent only hours in prison before being transferred to a hospital, a move the court has now deemed unlawful. The ruling is a significant development for the influential Shinawatra political dynasty and addresses public criticism that the wealthy and powerful receive preferential treatment within the justice system.</p>

          <p>Indian companies are fast-tracking the development and testing of electric vehicle (EV) motors that do not rely on rare-earth magnets, a direct response to China's export restrictions on these critical minerals. Firms like Sterling Gtake E-Mobility are working on alternative technologies, such as high-density reluctance motors, to reduce dependence on China, which controls over 90% of the global rare-earth processing capacity. With several Indian automakers already reviewing these new motors, commercial production could begin much sooner than planned, aiming to create a more resilient domestic EV supply chain.</p>

In a separate case, federal prosecutors are seeking a nine-year prison sentence for a 30-year-old woman accused of being part of a left-wing extremist group that violently attacked suspected neo-Nazis in Budapest.

A recent HSBC survey confirmed this trend, finding that China remains the top target for companies looking to expand their global trade capabilities.

The new lineup is not expected to feature radical changes but may include incremental improvements to the camera and battery, along with a potential new ultra-thin "Air" model.

          <p>Russia is facing significant social and political challenges as it prepares for the eventual demobilization of hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the war in Ukraine, including many pardoned convicts. Reports and court records indicate a rise in violent crimes committed by veterans who have already returned, raising fears of a repeat of the crime wave that followed the Soviet-Afghan War. The Kremlin is reportedly aware of the risks and is implementing programs to integrate veterans into civilian leadership roles to manage potential discontent and instability. The large number of soldiers presents a complex problem for Russian society.</p>
