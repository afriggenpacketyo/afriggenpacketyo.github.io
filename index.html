          <h2>Moody's Downgrades U.S. Credit Rating Due to Rising Government Debt</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the government's increasing debt and interest payment ratios. The agency highlighted the failure of successive administrations and Congress to address large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs. Moody's expects federal deficits to rise from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% by 2035, driven by increased interest payments, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. This downgrade follows similar actions by Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings in previous years, reflecting broader worries about U.S. fiscal management. (not investment advice)</p>

According to Gates, Putin will insist on occupying eastern provinces, recognizing Russian ownership of Crimea, establishing a pro-Russian government in Kyiv, and ensuring Ukraine's military remains weak, with no NATO or EU membership.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports found that Kroger is overcharging customers for items marked as being on sale. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, revealed price tag errors leading to customers paying more than advertised. Expired discount tags were found on various products, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. While Kroger disputes the findings, similar allegations have been made against other retailers. The article also notes that understaffing could contribute to pricing errors, as stores struggle to manually update price labels.</p>

          <p>Moody‚Äôs downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing rising debt levels and a deteriorating fiscal outlook, potentially increasing borrowing costs. The agency criticized Washington‚Äôs decades of gridlock and dysfunction, including the failure to address rising debt and underfunding of programs like Social Security and Medicare. Moody's specifically pointed to the Republican push to renew the 2017 tax cuts, estimating that an extension would add $4 trillion to the deficit. Despite the downgrade, investors are still likely to purchase U.S. debt due to the dollar‚Äôs status as the global reserve currency. (not investment advice)</p>

No food or supplies have entered Gaza during Israel's two-month blockade, leaving nearly half a million people in a "catastrophic situation of hunger".

The article notes that President Trump's policies could slow or reverse these positive trends, particularly through cuts to violence prevention programs and economic policies that may lead to recession.</p>
