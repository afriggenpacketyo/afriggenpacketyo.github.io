          <p>The price of Ether has surged, significantly outperforming Bitcoin, following the U.S. House's passage of the GENIUS Act, the first major stablecoin and crypto-focused legislation in the nation. The bill is now headed to the president's desk, with its expected signing being hailed as a pivotal moment for the industry's legitimacy in the world's largest financial market. This legislative momentum, combined with record inflows into Ether-based ETFs and a move by BlackRock to add staking to its fund, has created strong positive sentiment. The renewed confidence also lifted stocks of crypto-related companies like Coinbase and Robinhood. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains has been closed for over a month because of a bull moose demonstrating strange and unresponsive behaviors. The Goodman Mountain trail was temporarily closed in early June, and officials report the moose continues to linger near the path, not reacting to efforts to move it. Wildlife staff from the Department of Environmental Conservation suspect an underlying illness may be influencing the animal's actions. For public safety, the trail will stay closed until the situation is resolved, as moose can be dangerous if approached. </p>

          <p>Meta has announced it will not sign the European Union's new artificial intelligence code of practice, arguing that its measures are an overreach that will stifle innovation. The company's global affairs chief stated the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the original EU AI Act. This positions Meta against the new framework, which aims to enhance transparency and safety in AI development and is set to take effect next month. While other major tech companies like OpenAI have committed to the code, some European businesses have also expressed concerns about its potential to throttle growth.</p>

          <p>The traditional royal swan count on the River Thames has revealed a hopeful recovery in the swan population after a significant decline in recent years. The five-day census, known as "swan upping," recorded 115 young swans (cygnets), an increase from 86 last year, signaling a potential reversal of a 45% drop over the past two years. The decline was largely attributed to avian flu and human-related incidents, including pollution and attacks. While the numbers are still below previous highs, the results offer an optimistic outlook for the conservation of this iconic royal bird.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, gaining access to significant oil reserves in Guyana.

Exxon, which leads the project, stated that it disagrees with the interpretation but respects the ruling and will welcome Chevron to the venture. The resolution removes major uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock, solidifying its position in one of the world's most important new oil regions.</p>

          <h2>Trump's 'No Tax on Tips' Provision Raises Questions About Implementation and Eligibility</h2>

          <p>A newly enacted provision from President Trump's recent legislation, called "no tax on tips," is creating uncertainty for workers and tax professionals. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but rather a deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028. However, the IRS has yet to clarify which specific occupations will qualify for the tax break, with guidance not expected until October. Key questions remain about how the deduction will apply to workers who receive tips through apps or in cash, especially as reporting thresholds for forms like the 1099-K have been changed.

          <p>This article pays tribute to Andrea Gibson, the late poet laureate of Colorado, celebrating their unique contribution to contemporary poetry. Gibson, who passed away on Monday, was known for their intensely confessional and emotional spoken-word performances that explored themes of queerness, anxiety, and love. They built a powerful connection with audiences both live and online, using platforms like Instagram to make their work accessible to a broad readership beyond traditional poetry circles. The author notes that Gibson's unabashedly open-hearted and straightforward style was a defining feature, used to spread a consistent message of gentleness and empathy.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has stated that he and House Republicans support "maximum transparency" regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case and want the American public to see the documents. His comments follow a report about a letter allegedly from Donald Trump being included in an album for Epstein. Johnson said he spoke with the President, who called the allegation "patently absurd" and is considering legal action against media outlets. In response to pressure, Trump has asked the Attorney General to release grand jury testimony, though such records are typically sealed, raising questions about the scope of the potential disclosure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government spent £2.1 billion on hotels to house asylum seekers in the last fiscal year, a 30% decrease from the £3 billion spent the previous year. According to Home Office figures, the savings were achieved by moving people into cheaper accommodations, including shared housing, and by negotiating lower per-person costs. Despite the reduction in spending, the number of people in asylum hotels remains over 32,000. Experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse this trend and lead to a renewed reliance on costly hotel placements in the near future.</p>

          <p>Analysts are defending Abbott Laboratories' stock, with Jefferies upgrading it to a "buy" rating following a significant sell-off. The company's shares dropped 8.5% after it slightly lowered its growth outlook, a market reaction that analysts and Abbott's CEO have called an "overreaction." The downgrade was attributed to a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business in China, which is viewed as a transitory issue. Wall Street sentiment suggests the company's fundamentals remain strong, with potential for accelerated growth in 2026, making the current stock price an attractive entry point for investors.

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence (GRU) units and 18 officers for conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activities.

One sanctioned unit was also linked to a deadly strike in Mariupol, Ukraine. The move comes as the EU also announced its strongest sanctions yet against Russia, aiming to undermine Moscow's ability to finance its ongoing war, though a former Russian president dismissed their potential impact.</p>

          <p>A woman who acted as a surrogate for a California couple at the center of a child endangerment investigation says she was misled throughout the process. Kayla Elliott claims she was contacted by Mark Surrogacy, a company linked to Guojun Xuan and Silvia Zhang, and given a false story about the couple's inability to conceive. The couple was arrested after a nanny was allegedly filmed abusing a 2-month-old baby, leading to the discovery of 21 children in protective care. Elliott, who gave birth in March, says she was lied to and is now fighting for custody of the child, who is currently in foster care.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, the contributor argues that the Democratic Party is in a state of structural decline, evidenced by historically low approval ratings and the collapse of its Obama-era coalition. The author contends that the party's focus on "woke grievances" and "intersectional obsessions" has alienated a large portion of the American electorate. The rise of figures like New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, described by the author as a communist, is presented as proof that the party is moving further leftward. The author concludes that this trajectory towards radicalism will only lead to continued political failure for Democrats.</p>

          <p>An Iranian father was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the parking lot of his child's preschool in Oregon. ICE officials stated they arrested Mahdi Khanbabazadeh for overstaying his visa after he allegedly resisted during a traffic stop and was permitted to first drop off his child. Witnesses described a chaotic scene, and an immigration lawyer for the family claims the arrest was based on false information, as Khanbabazadeh had a pending green card application. The incident is part of a broader increase in immigration enforcement actions under the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how a fundamental policy disagreement between the U.S. and Israel regarding Syria is contributing to sectarian violence in the region. While the Trump administration has backed a strong, centralized Syrian government under its new leader, Israel remains distrustful and has supported local minority groups like the Druze. This divergence led to a recent crisis when Syrian forces entered the Druze province of Sweida, sparking a bloody clash that prompted Israeli airstrikes on Damascus. The author argues that without alignment between Washington and Jerusalem, prospects for stability remain dim, risking further conflict and displacement.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation found that hundreds of videos promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery are easily accessible to underage users on TikTok, violating the platform's own community guidelines. By creating an account for a hypothetical 15-year-old, researchers found content idealizing dangerously low-calorie diets and certain body types, which was then further promoted by the app's algorithm. TikTok responded by stating the findings were based on a limited sample, but child safety advocates argue it highlights a systemic problem where harmful content continues to reach vulnerable young users despite platform policies designed to prevent it.</p>
