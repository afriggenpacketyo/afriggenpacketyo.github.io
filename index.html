          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are deepening their partnership in artificial intelligence, driven by mutual ambitions for global leadership in the field. The UAE seeks to diversify its economy beyond oil and enhance its geopolitical influence through AI, while the U.S. aims to ensure American companies lead the AI race against China. Recent deals, including the Stargate Project, involve significant investments from companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia, providing the UAE with access to advanced compute and talent. This alliance marks a shift from a relationship centered on oil to one focused on compute, with the UAE re-shifting its geo-economic focus from China to the U.S. to secure access to Nvidia chips and other U.S. technologies.</p>

          <p>David McBride, an Australian whistleblower who leaked classified documents alleging Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, lost his appeal to reduce his prison sentence. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's argument that he acted in the public interest by exposing the documents.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about potential capital flight from the U.S. as long-dated yields approach record highs. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering a global financial market downturn. Some analysts warn that this could lead to a carry trade unwind, impacting U.S. tech stocks and global markets due to increased borrowing costs. However, other analysts believe the impact may be gradual due to the erosion in confidence in the U.S. dollar and the structural nature of Japan's holdings of U.S. Treasuries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>European companies operating in China are finding it increasingly difficult to do business due to weak economic demand and opaque government regulations. A recent survey by the European Chamber of Commerce in China revealed that nearly three-quarters of businesses reported worsening operating conditions. Despite these challenges, some European companies are increasing their reliance on Chinese components due to lower prices and improved quality. This trend complicates efforts by the U.S. to reduce dependence on Chinese exports through tariffs, as European companies seek alternatives to American-made components.</p>

The company's fortunes reflect the broader economic landscape of the U.K., which has seen a decline in global significance. While Vodafone is expanding in markets like Germany and the U.K., it remains a frustrating company for investors due to its dependence on mature European economies and reliance on metrics like free cash flow and EBITDAal.</p>

          <p>A former 999 call-handler, Izzy Vine, resigned from the Met Police after a colleague she reported for making offensive comments, including describing a sexual assault victim as a "slut", was reinstated after being initially sacked. Vine is suing the force for constructive dismissal, claiming the Met Police broke its promise to listen to whistleblowers. She alleges that bosses told her the original disciplinary panel was too heavily influenced by the Casey Review, which found the Met to be institutionally misogynist, racist, and homophobic. The Met acknowledged the "discriminatory comments" were "entirely unacceptable" but said the outcome of the misconduct process had been "subject to a thorough review".</p>

          <p>A new Covid variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. after a surge in cases in China, though it is not yet included in federal variant-tracking dashboards. The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a SARS-CoV-2 variant under monitoring, with increasing proportions globally. While it may be more transmissible, current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation. Currently-approved Covid shots are expected to remain effective against this variant, but access to vaccines is being limited by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is “unlikely in the near future” but “not impossible”, given the risks of misperception and miscommunication with the US under President Donald Trump, a British think tank has warned. The US–China relationship is “more strained than it has ever been at any other point in the 21st century”, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). The report notes that some tactical improvements during the previous Biden administration are unlikely to “significantly alter the strategic direction of the two great powers” during Trump’s second term in office.</p>

          <p>The trial of health care workers involved in Diego Maradona's treatment before his death is in doubt after a judge recused herself due to her involvement in a documentary about the case. Judge Julieta Makintach stepped down after being accused of violating impartiality rules and influence peddling over her role in the "Divine Justice" miniseries. The remaining judges will decide whether the trial will proceed or if a new trial will be ordered. The trial involves seven members of Maradona's medical team who are accused of negligent homicide.</p>
