        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Food Programme (WFP) reports that aid trucks in Gaza are being overwhelmed by crowds of civilians desperate for food, leading to chaotic scenes. Despite bringing 77 trucks of flour into Gaza, the WFP stated that all trucks were stopped and looted by hungry people trying to feed their families. The situation is dire after nearly 80 days of blockade, with a UN-backed assessment indicating that the entire population of Gaza is at critical risk of famine. While Israel eased the blockade on May 19, the UN says the amount of aid sent in the last week is just over 10% of the people's daily needs, leading to escalating insecurity and challenges in distributing aid effectively.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes mandatory genetic sex testing, as mandated by World Boxing. The organization announced it will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers, following controversy surrounding Khelif's participation in the Paris Olympics. Khelif had faced scrutiny over misconceptions about gender, particularly after the International Boxing Association disqualified her from the world championships. World Boxing emphasizes that its priority is ensuring safety and competitive fairness for all athletes through this new testing procedure, which begins July 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza, though the details of their response remain unclear. While the militant group says it will release living and deceased hostages, there appear to be other demands that need to be addressed before a ceasefire can be declared. The proposal, which includes a 60-day ceasefire, was presented by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and has been accepted by Israel. Hamas is reportedly seeking a comprehensive withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a permanent end to the war, complicating the prospects for a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity among employees, especially Gen Zers who are used to instant answers. Studies show that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, often as a way to cope with feeling insecure. The article suggests that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, with the author advocating for the use of plain language instead. By using real-human-people words, the author argues, communication can be more effective and genuine.</p>

          <p>The European Union has criticized President Donald Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports to 50%, warning that it undermines efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the ongoing trade war. An EU spokesperson stated that the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures in response to the tariff increase. The United Steelworkers union also criticized Trump's announcement, calling it a direct attack on Canadian industries and workers. The new import duties are set to take effect June 4, increasing pressure on manufacturers dependent on industrial metals for production (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former First Lady Michelle Obama is facing backlash for stating that creating life is the least of what a woman's reproductive system does. During a podcast episode, Obama lamented that women's reproductive health has been reduced to the question of choice, arguing that there is much more at stake. Critics, including pro-life activists, have condemned her remarks, asserting that motherhood and creating life are beautiful and powerful gifts. The comments have sparked debate about the broader context of women's reproductive health and the value placed on motherhood.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for effective parenting. These rules include trusting your instincts, following your culture, following your child's interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being your real self rather than striving for an unattainable ideal. The psychiatrist emphasizes that children need love and attention more than perfection, and that a joyful, supportive environment is conducive to healthy development. By prioritizing these simple guidelines, parents can navigate the complexities of modern parenting with greater confidence.</p>

While the AfD does not cultivate close ties with the churches, the party draws on Christian traditions when it suits its agenda. Critics see the AfD's relationship with Christianity as instrumental, using it to capitalize on social uncertainty and appeal to a broader audience. This alliance is seen as a way for the AfD to downplay their own views and curry favor with the evangelical movement.</p>
