          <p>Gary Grant, founder of The Entertainer, the UK's largest toy chain, is transferring 100% ownership of his multi-million-pound business to an employee trust. This move, chosen over a sale for profit, ensures staff receive a share of profits and a say in operations, preserving the company's legacy and family values. The company, which navigated challenges like the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, is in strong financial health with £6.7m pre-tax profits last year. This model aims to reward employees and maintain the company's Christian ethos, including Sunday closures and charity donations.</p>

          <p>Orsted, the world's largest offshore wind developer, saw its shares drop over 25% after announcing a 60 billion Danish kroner ($9.4 billion) rights issue. This decision follows a "material adverse development" in the U.S. market, preventing the company from divesting a stake in its Sunrise Wind project. The rights issue, backed by the Danish State, is intended to strengthen Orsted's capital structure. This financial move reflects difficulties in raising funds for their investment and business development programs due to current market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its "deport now, appeal later" scheme to include 15 new countries, bringing the total to 23, allowing foreign criminals to be deported before their appeals are heard. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated this aims to prevent exploitation of the immigration system and fast-track removals. Offenders will appeal from their home countries via video link. This initiative also seeks to alleviate overcrowding in English and Welsh prisons, where foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the population, costing £54,000 per prisoner annually.</p>

This marks the 27th recovered meteorite in Georgia's history and one of only six witnessed falls. Scientists will propose naming it the McDonough Meteorite, emphasizing the importance of analyzing such space rocks for planetary defense.</p>

          <p>New road safety proposals in England and Wales could require drivers over 70 to pass compulsory eye tests every three years upon licence renewal. This shake-up, expected in a new government strategy, also considers reducing the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers. The move follows a coroner's report criticizing the UK's "laxest in Europe" licensing system after four deaths linked to drivers with poor eyesight. While some defend older drivers, the government aims to reduce the 1,600 annual road deaths.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the past two seasons, all three newly promoted Championship teams have been immediately relegated from the Premier League, a trend Burnley, Leeds, and Sunderland aim to defy. Historically, 40 points were considered enough for survival, but recent seasons show a lower average for the 18th-placed team, suggesting the competitive gap between leagues has widened. Financial disparities, including profit and sustainability rules, create a significant budget disadvantage for promoted clubs. While early season performance is a key indicator, the article highlights the challenge for these teams to break the recent pattern and secure top-flight survival. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirmed Australia will recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September, joining France, Britain, and Canada. This decision follows internal pressure and criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza, which Albanese described as a "humanitarian catastrophe." The recognition is conditional on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no role for Hamas, demilitarization of Gaza, and elections. Albanese views a two-state solution as the best path to end violence, despite Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu's criticism that such moves would bring war.</p>

          <p>Historic Marine Protected Area (MPA) status has been granted to World War One shipwreck sites in Scapa Bay, Orkney, by the Scottish government. This designation makes it a criminal offense to remove items from the 52-strong German High Seas fleet, deliberately scuttled in 1919. While some wrecks were previously protected as war graves, this widens legal powers against artifact removal, addressing concerns about vulnerability and loss of historical features. The sites, popular with divers, will see enhanced preservation, ensuring future generations can explore and learn from Scotland's underwater heritage, including the Queen of Sweden wreck off Shetland.</p>

          <p>Chinese citizens are increasingly venturing into African goldfields, particularly in Mali, driven by global uncertainties, despite significant security risks. The Chinese embassy in Mali has repeatedly warned its citizens and ordered gold mining companies to halt operations and evacuate due to worsening security, including attacks and kidnappings targeting Chinese nationals. This surge in activity comes against the backdrop of Mali's deteriorating security situation since its 2020 military coup. The article highlights the perilous conditions faced by these miners as they seek opportunities in resource-rich but unstable regions.</p>

          <p>The Perseids meteor shower, renowned as one of the best celestial displays, is set to peak this week, specifically early Wednesday for North America. However, the moon will be 84% full during this peak, significantly compromising visibility. Experts predict that bright moonlight will reduce the number of visible meteors by at least 75%, allowing only the brighter ones to be seen, with an expected rate of 10-20 per hour instead of the usual 50. Viewers are advised to seek dark, rural areas and consider watching a week after the peak for better conditions.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Lucy Letby case highlights significant flaws in the medical evidence presented by both prosecution and defense, leading to conflicting narratives about her guilt. Letby's defense, supported by a panel of experts, argues that unreliable medical evidence was used to convict her of multiple infant murders and attempted murders. For example, questions arise regarding the prosecution's claims about Baby O's liver injuries and the air embolism theory. Defense experts propose alternative explanations, such as accidental needle punctures or birth trauma, underscoring the lack of consensus among medical professionals and the complexity of the case.</p>

          <p>A Chinese state media outlet has labeled Nvidia's H20 AI chip as unsafe, urging Chinese buyers to boycott the processors due to alleged "backdoor" vulnerabilities. Despite Nvidia's denials, the outlet, associated with China Central Television, claims the U.S. government embeds tracking features, referencing historical attempts and recent legislative proposals. Nvidia's chief security officer, David Reber Jnr, explicitly stated in a blog post that their chips contain "no back doors, no kill switches, no spyware."

The match also served as a celebration of the Galaxy's 2005 championship, with 5,000 fans receiving commemorative rings and former players honored.

          <p>Federal agents have been deployed across Washington D.C. following President Trump's promise of a swift crackdown on crime and homelessness in the capital. Trump stated homeless individuals must "move out, IMMEDIATELY," offering alternative accommodations away from the Capitol. He also warned criminals of intensified enforcement, despite official data showing declining crime rates in D.C., including a 26% drop in violent crime. While uniformed agents from various federal agencies were visible, the immediate impact was less dramatic than suggested. Homeless residents expressed concern over potential displacement, advocating for more government support for housing and healthcare.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing significant mockery and criticism, being labeled a "dead man walking," just over 100 days into his tenure. His government, a coalition with the Social Democrats, began with a symbolic act of defiance during his election, casting a shadow over the administration. Merz is attempting to forge a modern yet culturally conservative mainstream, but is accused of both leftward concessions and far-right alignment. The political culture is increasingly polarized, with the far-right AfD aiming to undermine his coalition, pushing him to demonstrate consistent governance amidst relentless negativity.</p>
