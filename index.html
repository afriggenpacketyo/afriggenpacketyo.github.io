          <p>Linda Stermer has been found guilty again of murdering her husband, Todd Stermer, in a 2007 incident where prosecutors argued she set their house on fire and then ran him over with a van as he escaped. Her initial conviction was overturned by a federal judge in 2018 due to ineffective legal counsel, leading to her release after nearly nine years in prison. However, prosecutors refiled charges, and a new jury has once again convicted her of first-degree premeditated murder, sending her back to prison for life in a case that has deeply divided her family.</p>

          <p>A draft of the new U.S. National Defense Strategy indicates a potential major shift in priorities, urging the Pentagon to focus more on protecting the homeland and the Western Hemisphere. This move is seen by some as a deprioritization of countering adversaries like China and Russia on the global stage. The strategic pivot has raised concerns that it could weaken U.S. commitments to allies, with particular anxiety expressed over the potential implications for Taiwan's security in the face of increasing pressure from mainland China.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot, which had grown to an estimated $1.8 billion, has been won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas, ending a three-month period without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers drawn were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. This jackpot stands as the second-largest in the game's history, with a cash value option of approximately $826.4 million.

          <p>In an opinion piece, Bishop Robert Barron strongly criticized a statement by Senator Tim Kaine suggesting that rights do not come from a divine creator but from government and laws. Barron referenced the Declaration of Independence, arguing that the nation's founding principle is that rights to life and liberty are "endowed by their Creator" and are therefore inalienable. He warned that viewing rights as government-granted makes them easily revocable and gives the state a dangerous, godlike power over its citizens.</p>

          <p>One year after Brian Niccol became CEO of Starbucks, the company's union, Starbucks Workers United, reports that progress on securing a first contract has stalled. Despite Niccol's initial promises to engage constructively, workers claim that new corporate strategies have increased their workload without improving pay or staffing. The union highlights the vast disparity between Niccol's $97.8 million compensation package and the median worker's salary, arguing that the company is prioritizing shareholders over the employees who are driving its record sales.</p>

          <p>Multiple attorneys representing approximately 50 survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse claim they have not been contacted by the Department of Justice, despite President Trump's public promises to fully investigate the matter. This lack of outreach casts doubt on the administration's commitment to transparency and justice for the victims. The silence from the DOJ contrasts sharply with its high-profile interview of convicted trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, leading to accusations that the government is failing to center victims in its investigation.</p>

          <p>A growing number of federal student loan borrowers are using deferment and forbearance options to pause their monthly payments, with over a quarter of all borrowers now in such a status. The article explains the critical differences between the two, noting that interest may not accrue on certain loans during a deferment, making it a more favorable option. While these tools are vital for preventing default, experts caution that they are not long-term solutions and can lead to higher overall debt compared to income-driven repayment plans.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration is pursuing a large-scale deportation campaign, aiming to remove one million undocumented immigrants annually. According to an analysis by Derek Thompson, this aggressive policy, combined with America's low birth rate, could lead to the U.S. population shrinking for the first time in its history. Such a decline could create significant labor shortages and economic challenges in crucial sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare, which heavily rely on immigrant labor.</p>

          <p>While England's Premier League consistently outspends its European rivals, Spain's La Liga has prioritized financial sustainability through a strict economic control framework implemented in 2013. This move successfully stabilized clubs that were previously facing bankruptcy and debt. Despite having less financial firepower for transfers, Spanish clubs continue to excel in European competitions, demonstrating that a model based on fiscal discipline and strong youth academies can still deliver elite-level success on the pitch.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the UK have an opportunity to witness a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full moon to take on a reddish tint, creating a spectacular "Blood Moon." The full eclipse will occur in the evening, with the best viewing available in eastern parts of the country shortly after moonrise. Astronomers explain the phenomenon is caused by sunlight refracting through Earth's atmosphere, and advise finding a location with a clear view of the eastern horizon to enjoy the celestial event.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is advancing its defense capabilities by developing a new class of low-cost, long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in collaboration with the U.S. firm Kratos. These suicide drones, known as Chien Feng IV, reportedly have a range exceeding 1,000km, enabling them to strike deep into mainland China. This strategy aims to provide Taiwan with an affordable yet potent alternative to expensive cruise missiles, enhancing its deterrent posture as part of a broader effort to counter Beijing's military arsenal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric on immigration enforcement, threatening to send military personnel to Chicago to conduct deportation raids. He amplified this threat by posting an AI-generated parody image of the movie "Apocalypse Now" on social media, with the caption referencing a "Department of WAR." The post was strongly condemned by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who accused the president of threatening to go to war with an American city and attempting to manufacture a crisis.</p>
