          <p>During his commencement address at West Point, President Trump congratulated the cadets and took credit for rebuilding the U.S. military, highlighting his administration's shift away from foreign interventions and nation-building. He emphasized the focus on crushing America's adversaries and defending the flag, also noting the end of critical race theory instruction at military academies. While touting a new peacetime recruiting record, CBS News found that enlistments began rebounding during the previous administration due to recruitment reforms. The Vice President also spoke at the U.S. Naval Academy, reinforcing the administration's foreign policy goals. </p>

          <p>Myanmar is facing a scramble for rare-earth minerals, causing environmental harm and deaths in Kachin State. Activists report that the in-situ leaching technique used for mining is posing a huge risk to the environment and local villagers. Chinese producers are sourcing rare earths from Myanmar, and the lucrative trade risks financing conflict. The Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) has wrested control of the mineral-rich region, leading to new negotiations on taxing extraction. </p>
