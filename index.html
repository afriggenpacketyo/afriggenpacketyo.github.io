          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who died by suicide in April, contends that Lord Mandelson's appointment as UK ambassador to the US was a profound mistake, given his past supportive communications with Epstein. Giuffre's brother, Sky Roberts, emphasized the deep-seated corruption implied by such a decision, a view partially supported by Business Secretary Peter Kyle, who acknowledged that Mandelson's selection would have been improbable with the information now available. The family also reiterated their demand for thorough investigations into Prince Andrew and other individuals linked to Epstein, asserting that everyone, regardless of status, must be held accountable. Mandelson's recent dismissal, prompted by the publication of revealing emails, underscores the ongoing fallout from the Epstein scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of car owners, now at a four-year high of 26.6%, find themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicles are worth, according to Edmunds data. This situation poses a significant challenge when trading in for a new car, forcing individuals to either cover the deficit in cash or roll it into a new, potentially larger loan. Experts point to factors such as vehicle depreciation, increasingly long loan terms, and minimal down payments as key contributors to this financial predicament. To navigate this, consumers are advised to meticulously research, assess their credit standing, and consider guaranteed asset protection (GAP) insurance, which covers the difference between a car's value and the loan balance in case of an accident.

The Cincinnati Bengals also clinched a 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but their celebration was tempered by a toe injury to star quarterback Joe Burrow, who did not return to the game. Other notable results included the Seattle Seahawks defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-17, the Detroit Lions dominating the Chicago Bears 52-21, and the Buffalo Bills overcoming the New York Jets 30-10. The New England Patriots secured a 33-27 win against the Miami Dolphins, marking Mike Vrabel's first victory as their coach, while the San Francisco 49ers beat the New Orleans Saints 26-21.</p>

          <h2>Limestone Application in Agriculture Offers Breakthrough for Carbon Emission Reduction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 17:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified a promising method to combat agricultural carbon emissions by spreading crushed limestone across farmlands. A Yale-led study, published in Nature Water, reveals that limestone reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form bicarbonate ions, which are then washed into waterways and transform into calcium carbonate, effectively storing carbon for millions of years. This discovery is significant because agriculture accounts for approximately 10% of global annual carbon emissions, making this inexpensive and sustainable solution a vital tool. While it doesn't prevent emissions from being produced, it offers a long-term sequestration mechanism. Experts stress that modifying liming practices should be a priority, contributing to broader efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere, as halting emissions alone is deemed insufficient to meet climate targets.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals a tragic increase in maternal and infant deaths in Afghanistan following the Trump administration's abrupt cut of nearly all US aid, leading to the closure of over 400 medical facilities. Personal accounts, like Abdul's story of his wife Shahnaz and their baby dying during childbirth after their local clinic shut down, highlight the devastating human cost. The US justified the cuts over concerns of funds benefiting the Taliban, an allegation the Taliban denies. The closures have overwhelmed remaining hospitals and exacerbated the country's already high mortality rates, particularly as Taliban policies restrict women's access to education and medical training, further endangering women's health and lives.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 pro-Palestinian protesters in Madrid led to the premature abandonment of the final stage of the Spanish Vuelta cycling race, resulting in clashes with police and two arrests. This significant demonstration, which involved blocking roads and displaying anti-Israel banners, marked the culmination of ongoing disruptions targeting the Israeli-owned Premier Tech team throughout the race. Although Jonas Vingegaard was declared the overall winner, the podium ceremony was canceled due to pervasive security concerns. The incident highlights the escalating diplomatic tensions in Spain, particularly following the country's recognition of a Palestinian state and its recent move to join South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide at the UN court, underscoring the intersection of sports and global political issues.</p>

Authorities noted that Corral was wearing a shirt strikingly similar to that of Tyler Robinson, the alleged assassin of Kirk, intensifying the gravity of the act. Phoenix police, already on site for crowd control, swiftly took Corral into custody. This event underscores the charged atmosphere and strong emotions surrounding the recent assassination of the conservative activist, further polarizing public sentiment during a period of national mourning.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) services, which enable consumers to divide purchases into short-term, often interest-free installments, are experiencing a surge in popularity, with usage projected to reach 91.5 million Americans by 2025. This growing adoption directly challenges the credit card industry, as these transactions divert potential revenue from traditional credit offerings. However, large banks and financial institutions harbor significant caution regarding BNPL, primarily because these loans create a substantial "black hole" in a consumer's credit profile. This lack of transparency impedes their ability to accurately gauge an individual's overall credit quality and debt obligations, leading to increased risk and uncertainty for traditional lenders.

          <p>The tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed scrutiny to Utah's recently passed HB 128, a law that permits individuals with concealed-carry permits to openly carry firearms on college campuses. This legislation, which built upon Utah's already Second Amendment-friendly stance by allowing permitless open and concealed carry since 2021, had previously raised safety concerns among university staff. While the legality of the suspect Tyler Robinson's possession of the hunting rifle on campus remains under investigation, the timing of the shooting has intensified the debate. Critics argue that Utah's lack of red-flag laws and its focus on "school hardening" measures are insufficient to address politically driven violence, prompting experts to question the effectiveness of widespread gun accessibility as a deterrent in such contexts.</p>

Hatton transitioned to a successful post-fighting career as a trainer, manager, and promoter, cementing his legacy as a true "people's champion" in British boxing history.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) described the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a potential "turning point" for the nation, urging political leaders to "turn down the rhetoric." Speaking on "Face the Nation," Johnson cautioned against treating policy disputes as "existential threats" and condemned the use of inflammatory language like "Nazis and fascists," which he believes can incite violence among "deranged people." He highlighted the bipartisan consensus emerging to address political violence and outlined efforts in Congress to honor Kirk's memory and ensure security for public officials. Johnson emphasized Kirk's model of vigorous debate motivated by love, not hatred, as a path forward for the country.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially announced the termination of its negotiations with Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com concerning the potential sale of its general merchandise subsidiary, Argos. This decision was made after JD.com presented a "materially revised set of terms and commitments" that Sainsbury’s determined were no longer aligned with the best interests of its shareholders. Despite the halted talks, Sainsbury’s reiterated its financial outlook, maintaining its expectation to deliver a retail underlying operating profit of around £1 billion for the financial year 2025-2026, signaling confidence in its independent operational strategy. This development brings an end to a period of market speculation surrounding the future of Argos, a well-known UK retailer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has secured the 100m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, a landmark achievement that heralds a new era for Jamaican men's sprinting, making him the first Jamaican man to claim a global 100m title since Usain Bolt's last victory nine years prior. The 24-year-old, who trains under Bolt's former coach Glen Mills, triumphed with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds, overcoming previous setbacks, including a disappointing last-place finish at the Paris 2024 Olympics. His emphatic victory, witnessed and celebrated by an ecstatic Usain Bolt, effectively silenced his critics and realized his long-anticipated potential. This win, alongside other national successes in the championships, signifies a powerful resurgence for Jamaica in the highly competitive men's sprint events.</p>

His financial moves also include converting marketing earnings into Bitcoin and strategic real estate purchases.

Athletic Director Martin Jarmond accepted accountability for Foster's hiring, acknowledging the challenging circumstances he inherited, including a tight timeline and limited resources from Pac-12 membership. Tim Skipper will assume the role of interim coach while UCLA initiates a comprehensive national search for a permanent replacement, seeking a leader who embodies "Bruin values" and possesses a clear vision for achieving top-tier success and playoff contention.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vehemently condemned the incursion as an "obvious expansion of the war," a sentiment echoed by the EU's foreign policy chief, who labeled it an "unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty."
