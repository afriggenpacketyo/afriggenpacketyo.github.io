          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, China has launched a diplomatic initiative to strengthen ties with Russia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe, promoting a shift towards a multipolar world order. Beijing aims to position itself as a defender of the "rules-based, UN-centered" international system, contrasting its approach with Washington's "America First" policy. However, analysts caution that divergent world views and competing national interests may hinder China's vision. China emphasizes its role in diplomatic platforms like the UN and WTO, highlighting its contributions to the post-World War II order, but the true intentions behind this charm offensive remain a subject of debate. The article suggests that while China presents itself as a champion of multilateralism, its actions might also serve its own strategic interests.</p>

Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon thanked the U.S. for its support, while U.K. Ambassador Barbara Woodward defended her country's vote in favor, citing the intolerable situation in Gaza.

          <p>President Trump's recent pardons, including those of former Republican politicians convicted of tax evasion and individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol attack, are being criticized as "patronage pardoning." This practice is described as reducing the expected penalty for loyalist misconduct by conspicuously pardoning political allies. The author argues that such pardons undermine the rule of law by signaling that loyalty to the regime is rewarded, even if it involves criminal behavior. The author contends that this approach treats law enforcement institutions as tools of regime compliance, prosecuting enemies while sparing friends, thereby eroding democratic principles.</p>

Critics argue that this judicial overhaul represents a triumph of politics over justice and a potentially fatal blow to the separation of powers.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly developing a plan to impose time limits on federal rental subsidies and add work requirements as a condition of funding. This initiative, spearheaded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), aims to encourage self-sufficiency and economic independence among recipients. While millions of people currently receive federal housing assistance, most are elderly or disabled and would be exempt from the new policies, but millions could still be affected. Critics argue that such policies are unlikely to increase employment or help people move off subsidies, potentially leading to devastating consequences for families.</p>

          <p>The government in England has announced that any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents Â£500 a year and potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, and has pledged Â£13m to food charities to fight food poverty. While the rule change has been largely welcomed, some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child limit, would be more effective at reducing child poverty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its dispute with Columbia University by notifying the institution's accreditor of an alleged violation of federal anti-discrimination laws. This action means that Columbia, in the administration's view, has failed to meet the standards set by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, the body responsible for accreditation. The notice marks the latest step in the administration's effort to dictate to Columbia, following accusations that the college failed to protect students from antisemitic harassment. This move follows the cancellation of $400 million in federal grants and contracts, after which the university yielded to a series of changes demanded by the administration.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has criticized the US proposal for a new nuclear agreement, insisting that Iran will not halt uranium enrichment. Iranian negotiators are set to respond to the plan, which reportedly requires Iran to cease enriched uranium production and rely on a regional consortium for supplies. Khamenei stated that this idea contradicts the Islamic Republic's founder's slogan, "We can." President Trump has warned Iran of potential US and Israeli military action if negotiations fail, setting a two-month deadline and demanding a halt to all uranium enrichment under any deal.

          <p>The California Supreme Court heard arguments regarding whether the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) violated state law when it reduced financial incentives for residential rooftop solar panels in 2022. Environmental groups argued that the CPUC failed to consider all the benefits of solar panels and ensure their expansion in disadvantaged communities. Lawyers from the Attorney General's office defended the CPUC's decision, citing a "cost shift" to non-solar panel owners. The justices focused on whether a state appeals court erred in deferring to the CPUC's interpretation of the law, with a decision expected within 90 days.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Republican members of the Senate Finance Committee at the White House to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The bill, which has already passed in the House, includes key priorities for Trump, such as the extension of the 2017 tax cuts and increased spending for the military and border security. However, the bill could add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and some Senate Republicans are expressing doubts about the package. Trump's meeting is an opportunity to sway those senators who have concerns about the bill.</p>
