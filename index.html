          <p>The former mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, is under investigation for suspected corruption by China's top anti-graft body. Zhou gained international attention for his defense of the city's slow response during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019. In a rare admission for a Chinese official at the time, he stated that local authorities could only disclose information about the new virus after receiving authorization from higher up, suggesting constraints from the central government.</p>

          <p>Online fashion retailer Shein has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, reportedly as a tactic to pressure UK regulators who have delayed its London listing. The company's London IPO has been stalled for months due to disagreements between UK and Chinese regulators over the risk disclosures in its prospectus. The primary issue concerns Shein's supply chain exposure in China's Xinjiang region, where alleged human rights abuses have drawn heavy scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

By heavily investing in automation and industrial robotics, China remains a manufacturing powerhouse and is emerging as a formidable challenger in key sectors like electric vehicles.

          <p>A new study has identified Virginia as the top state for French fry consumption in the United States. According to a poll of 5,000 adults commissioned by McCain Foods, the average Virginian reports eating at least 21 pounds of fries annually. Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland followed closely behind, with residents consuming about 20 pounds per year. On a national level, the study suggests that the average American eats a minimum of 17 pounds of fries each year.</p>

          <p>Norman Tebbit, a formidable figure in the British Conservative party and a key architect of Thatcherism, has died at the age of 94. Known for his philosophy of self-reliance and plain-speaking style, he served as employment secretary and party chairman during the 1980s. He was instrumental in curbing union power but was also a figure of controversy, remembered for his "on your bike" speech and a 'cricket test' for immigrants. He and his wife were severely injured in the 1984 IRA hotel bombing, an event that shaped the remainder of his life.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, have been found. The fatal blast occurred at a facility owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, which was reportedly not permitted by the county to store fireworks. The incident, which also caused a large grass fire, is now the subject of a multi-agency investigation involving state and federal authorities, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially notified multiple trading partners of new, higher tariff rates that will take effect on August 1, escalating its global trade war. The U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on imports from allies Japan and South Korea, with other nations like South Africa, Indonesia, and Thailand also facing steep duties. The move follows the expiration of a 90-day pause, during which countries were encouraged to negotiate new trade agreements with Washington to avoid the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
