          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition party after securing the second-most seats in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. This rise coincides with similar gains by far-right forces in other European countries. Chega, meaning "Enough," won 60 of the 230 National Assembly seats, campaigning on a hardline stance against immigration. The party's leader, Andre Ventura, hailed this as a profound change, challenging the traditional dominance of center-right and center-left parties in Portugal. </p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to halt the tariffs, but the Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The court also blocked levies imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada related to drug and illegal immigration flows. </p>

          <p>An article explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind this choice, particularly in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It cites the example of Edan Alexander, an American who moved to Israel to join the military, and notes that thousands of other Americans serve in Israeli ranks. The article discusses the social and ideological factors that contribute to the radicalization of young Zionists, including Zionist summer camps and a sense of fierce commitment to the Jewish state. It also contrasts this with Americans who fight alongside Ukrainians, highlighting the difference between fighting occupation and propagating it. </p>

The increase comes as the company braces for the impact of additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. The company anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. </p>

Japan is seeking the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum imposed by the U.S. to reduce its trade deficits.

This move is expected to create anxiety on university campuses and likely provoke retaliation from China. The definition of "critical fields" remains unclear, but likely refers to research in the physical sciences.

          <p>Despite legal guarantees and pressure from international bodies, racial segregation in schools remains a reality for Roma children in Slovakia. More than 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are in the majority, often in overcrowded buildings with lower academic expectations. Roma pupils are frequently placed in schools for children with mental disabilities. While the Slovak government has acknowledged the issue and introduced reforms, these measures often reinforce segregation. The EU's goal of reducing segregation by only 50% by 2030 undermines the illegality of segregation, and the EU must respond to this systemic failure. </p>

          <p>An article examines President Trump's approach to conflict, arguing that he consistently frames his actions as reactions to others' behavior. According to the article, Trump views conflict as a zero-sum game, where he can only win if someone else loses. This worldview extends to institutions and individuals who push back against him, such as Harvard University. The administration's aggressive pressure campaign against Harvard, including investigations and funding suspensions, is portrayed as a response to the university's resistance. </p>
