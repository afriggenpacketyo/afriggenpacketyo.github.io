          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 04:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how China has strategically responded to perceived weaknesses in Donald Trump's policies, compelling him to retreat on certain issues, contrasting this with the perceived lack of effective checks and balances from US courts, Wall Street, and the business community. It highlights Trump's attempts to influence the Federal Reserve and his dismissal of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman criticizes Trump's actions as a "policy disaster in the making", indicating a broader concern about the erosion of governance standards in the US. The piece suggests that China's assertive stance reflects a calculated exploitation of vulnerabilities in Trump's administration, while US institutions struggle to effectively restrain his agenda. The context revolves around Trump's second term and his approach to global trade and domestic governance. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Porsche, the luxury car manufacturer, is set to be removed from Germany's DAX index due to a decline in share price, influenced by US tariffs on European autos. The company has faced challenges including weak demand in China and a slow transition to electric vehicles, leading to lowered outlooks. Porsche CEO Oliver Blume aims for a swift return to the DAX, attributing the exit to technical factors; the company will become a member of the midcap MDAX index later in September. The context involves the impact of international trade policies on the automotive industry and the challenges faced by companies in adapting to evolving market conditions. </p>

          <p>The UK and its allies are preparing to support Ukraine both before and after any peace deal is reached with Russia, according to the UK defence secretary. Ahead of a summit in Paris, John Healey stated that allies would help secure Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once a peace agreement is established. Discussions involve potential security guarantees and the possible deployment of European troops to deter future Russian aggression, contingent on a ceasefire negotiated by the US. The situation is complicated by Vladimir Putin's continued insistence on maximalist demands and uncertainty regarding US commitment. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nasdaq is introducing new listing requirements that will make it more difficult for smaller Chinese companies to go public in the U.S., mandating a minimum capital raise of $25 million for companies primarily operating in China. This move follows a surge of small Chinese IPOs and rising tensions between the U.S. and China. The Nasdaq cited concerns about U.S. investors' risks due to the inability to take legal action against entities involved in manipulative trading activities, noting compliance issues among Chinese companies listing with smaller offerings. The changes come amid broader trade tensions, including China's new tariffs on some U.S. optical fiber producers, signaling increasing complexity in business relations between the two countries. </p>

          <p>Accusers of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are calling for the full release of the Epstein files, believing it will help them be heard amidst the disruption and trauma caused by their alleged abuse. The call for transparency came during a press conference organized by US House representatives, emphasizing the need to protect survivors and hold predators accountable. The article notes the release of a first batch of documents by the House Oversight Committee, but critics argue that much of the information was already public and heavily redacted. Victims hope the files will lead to further investigations and charges against individuals involved, framing the issue as a test of who is allowed to abuse power in America. </p>

          <p>Nidec Corp's shares experienced a significant drop after the company announced an investigation into potential accounting irregularities within its group. The probe was initiated after an internal review of Nidec Techno Motor, a Chinese subsidiary, revealed possible links to management. The company had previously delayed its financial report due to concerns about erroneous declarations related to the origin of certain motors. The announcement has negatively impacted investor confidence, resulting in the largest one-day decline in Nidec's share value. </p>

          <p>Experts have determined that the Sycamore Gap tree, illegally felled in Northumberland, was at least 100 to 120 years old. Historic England researchers counted the tree's rings to narrow down its age, finding the wood to be in good condition. The tree, a famous landmark along Hadrian's Wall, was felled in September 2023, leading to the imprisonment of two men. The section of wood will be preserved for further analysis, potentially using advanced imaging techniques. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that deemed many of the president's tariffs illegal. The administration argues that the tariffs are essential for ongoing foreign negotiations and that the lower court's decision creates uncertainty. The lawsuit challenges the tariffs' legality and their impact on global markets and U.S. businesses. The case could have significant implications for the president's trade policy and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches. (not investment advice) </p>
