        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite public efforts, less than 10% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, with most ending up in landfills or the environment. The primary obstacles are the variety of plastic types, many of which are not mechanically recyclable, and the presence of hazardous chemical additives that contaminate recycling streams. Experts argue that policy changes, such as holding producers accountable and significantly reducing overall plastic production, are crucial. Meanwhile, innovative solutions like 'microfactories' that transform mixed plastic waste into new high-value materials offer some hope.</p>

Al Sharif, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer, was previously accused by the Israeli military of being a Hamas operative, a claim both he and Al Jazeera rejected. Press freedom groups have condemned the killing, describing it as a targeted attack and part of a pattern of suppressing journalism in the conflict zone.</p>

A 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder. The priest, Fr.

He is currently in stable condition, while the community has expressed deep shock over the two violent events.</p>

Bell was working for the precursor to the British Antarctic Survey and was part of early scientific exploration of the continent. His 86-year-old brother expressed astonishment and relief, stating that after all these years, his brother has finally "come home."</p>

Kennedy Jr., in his role as Health and Human Services Secretary, has initiated $500 million in cuts to the U.S. mRNA vaccine research portfolio, including funding for a late-stage H5N1 avian flu vaccine. This move is seen by public health experts as a significant setback for pandemic preparedness, dismantling infrastructure that was vital during the COVID-19 response. Critics argue the decision, rooted in RFK Jr.'s long-standing anti-vaccine advocacy, leaves the U.S. and the world more vulnerable to future pandemics by eroding scientific expertise and response capabilities.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Tariff Revenue Surges Under Trump, But Remains a Fraction of Federal Income</h2>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff policies have caused a significant spike in federal revenue from customs duties, with projections suggesting it could reach 5% of total federal income. However, this amount is still dwarfed by income tax revenue and is a tiny fraction of the nearly $37 trillion national debt. Economists note that this revenue comes from American businesses and consumers paying higher prices. Furthermore, the economic drag caused by the tariffs may reduce overall tax receipts, and incentivizing domestic production would inherently lower the import-based tariff revenue.</p>

          <p>This article explains the key features of sunscreen, clarifying what SPF numbers and star ratings mean for consumer protection. SPF (Sun Protection Factor) primarily measures protection against UVB rays, which cause sunburn, with higher numbers offering more filtering. The star rating indicates the level of protection against UVA rays, associated with skin aging and cancer. Experts recommend using a sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and a high star rating, and reapplying it every two hours, as "once-a-day" products often lose effectiveness over time.</p>

Speaking at the United Nations, China's ambassador stated that military solutions are not the answer and called for an immediate ceasefire to save lives and secure the release of hostages. The ambassador emphasized that Gaza is an inalienable part of Palestinian territory and that any attempt to alter its population or structure must be firmly rejected, reiterating China's support for a two-state solution.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Explore Water-Based Theories for the Origin of Life on Earth and Beyond</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The scientific mystery of how life began on Earth is being explored through two primary water-based hypotheses: deep-sea hydrothermal vents and shallow tide pools. Both theories suggest that the unique chemical environments created by water were essential for the emergence of life's building blocks. This focus on water as a key ingredient is also driving the search for extraterrestrial life in our solar system. Scientists are particularly interested in the "water worlds" of Jupiter and Saturn's moons, where conditions could potentially mirror those that sparked life on our own planet.</p>

          <p>Turkey's top football clubs, including Galatasaray and Fenerbahce, are spending record-breaking sums on international stars, rivaling the financial power of Saudi Arabian teams. This lavish spending occurs despite the clubs carrying over a billion euros in combined debt and the country facing economic hardship. Critics suggest the government tacitly supports the high-profile signings to distract the public from economic problems, a form of "bread and circuses" politics. The clubs' close ties to the state allow them to operate with financial impunity, raising questions about long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>The Japanese boxing community is in mourning after two fighters, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died from brain injuries sustained in separate fights during the same event in Tokyo. Both men suffered subdural hematomas and passed away in the hospital days after their respective bouts. The tragedies have prompted the Japanese Boxing Commission to hold an emergency meeting to address safety measures. In an immediate response, all regional title bouts have been reduced from 12 rounds to 10.</p>

          <p>Biddy Baxter, the long-serving and formidable editor who shaped the iconic BBC children's show "Blue Peter" into a national institution, has died at 92. During her tenure from 1965 to 1988, she introduced the show's enduring format of crafts, pets, and charity appeals, passionately championing audience involvement. While celebrated as a creative force, she was also known as a rigid and demanding leader who often clashed with the show's presenters.

          <p>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has stated that the club will have to sell captain and England defender Marc Guehi during the current transfer window. Guehi has entered the final year of his contract and has not agreed to an extension, meaning the club must sell him now to avoid losing him for free next year. The club rejected a £65m offer from Newcastle in January but is now reportedly seeking around £40m. Liverpool is known to have an interest in the highly-rated defender.</p>

The majority of arrests were for showing support for a proscribed group, an act protesters intentionally committed to challenge the ban, which they claim restricts freedom of expression. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended the ban, citing the group's history of violent and destructive acts. The arrests highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding pro-Palestinian activism in Britain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A statistical analysis of the Premier League reveals a growing trend of newly promoted teams being immediately relegated back to the Championship. For the last two seasons, all three promoted clubs have gone straight back down, a rarity in the league's history. Financial disparity is a key factor, as Profit and Sustainability Rules allow established Premier League clubs to sustain significantly larger losses than newcomers, creating a "middle class" of teams unlikely to be relegated. A fast start is crucial, as historically, promoted teams with 11 or more points after 10 games have always survived.</p>

          <p>The remains of the German High Seas Fleet, scuttled by its own crews in Scapa Bay, Orkney, at the end of World War One, have been granted legal protection as a historic Marine Protected Area (MPA). The new designation makes it a criminal offense to remove any items from the popular dive sites, preserving the wrecks for future generations. The fleet was deliberately sunk in 1919, and over the years, many artifacts have been salvaged. The protection aims to stop further loss from what is considered a significant heritage asset.</p>
