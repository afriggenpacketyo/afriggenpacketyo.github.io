        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a downturn on Friday, attributed to a decline in the company's profits, which were impacted by the significant decrease in oil prices throughout the year. The company's net income saw a reduction of over 30%, falling to $3.5 billion, or $2 per share, from $5.5 billion in the previous year. Despite these challenges, Chevron intends to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, although this is less than the $3.9 billion repurchased in the first quarter. The company's U.S. production business also saw a profit decline of more than 10% due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co., and other Japanese carmakers reported a combined 11.8 percent increase in U.S. sales for April, totaling 464,372 vehicles, as reported in a Kyodo News digest. This surge in sales is attributed to increased buying activity in anticipation of price increases due to a recently implemented 25 percent tariff on cars produced outside the United States. The Kyodo News digest also noted that over 90 nations, including Japan, advocated for preserving memories of the devastation caused by nuclear attacks during a U.N. meeting, marking the 80th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.</p>

          <p>Zhao Xintong delivered an outstanding performance, establishing a commanding 12-4 lead against Ronnie O'Sullivan, a seven-time champion, in their World Championship semi-final match at the Crucible. Zhao secured all eight frames during Friday morning's session, becoming only the fourth player to achieve an 8-0 session win against O'Sullivan at this venue. O'Sullivan, who has openly discussed issues with his cue, made changes after the opening session but struggled to capitalize, missing several key shots. Zhao, competing as an amateur, displayed precision and compiled breaks of 112 and 115, suggesting he is ready to become the first Chinese player to win the title in Sheffield.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced a joint economic investment deal granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities against Russia. This agreement is particularly significant for the American economy amidst its escalating trade war with China, a major producer of rare earth and critical minerals. The deal encompasses a variety of resources, including rare earth elements, oil, and natural gas, with the U.S. providing financial or military assistance and Ukraine contributing half of any royalties from future licenses. Experts suggest Ukraine's existing workforce and metallurgical expertise could provide a more readily available source of these strategically vital natural resources compared to other potential sources like Greenland.</p>

          <p>President Trump's goal to increase fossil fuel extraction in the U.S. has been hindered by the economic turmoil caused by his own tariffs, yet the country is still projected to increase oil and gas production, leading to a surge in greenhouse gas emissions. The article reports that the expected amount of greenhouse gas emissions from active and planned projects in US oil and gas fields has increased under Trump, reversing a previous decline under Biden. This shift threatens a new wave of pollution, exacerbating the effects of climate change, including heatwaves, floods, and droughts. The International Energy Agency has warned that no new major fossil fuel projects can proceed if the world is to meet agreed temperature limits.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending federal funding for NPR and PBS, citing political bias, according to an NPR report. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to cease federal funds for both media entities, which could significantly impact local stations. A federal judge also ruled that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants from South Texas was "unlawful." The judge stated that the president's invocation of the act exceeded the statute's scope, as the activities of Tren de Aragua members did not constitute an "invasion" or "predatory inclusion."</p>

          <p>President Trump ended a rule allowing cheap Chinese goods to bypass U.S. tariffs, closing the "de minimis" exemption but potentially raising consumer prices on platforms like Amazon and Temu, according to the New York Times. Trump's administration is simultaneously negotiating trade deals with over a dozen countries before a July 8 deadline. In a cabinet shake-up, Trump removed Michael Waltz as national security adviser, nominating him as U.N. ambassador, and appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim national security adviser. A federal judge also barred the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans from a Texas district.</p>

          <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announced an immediate ban on transgender women competing in all levels of women's cricket. The ECB stated that "only those whose biological sex is female" will be eligible to participate in women's and girls' cricket, while transgender women and girls can still play in open and mixed cricket categories. This policy change is a result of a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines a woman based on biological sex. The ECB emphasized its commitment to inclusivity and respect in cricket.</p>

A shortage of female lynxes in the European breeding programme led to the unusual request being made for the cat from Newquay Zoo. Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe.</p>
