          <p>Despite forecasting a near-tripling of its net profit for the first half of 2025, shares of Chinese jewelry brand Laopu Gold have fallen, marking nine consecutive sessions of decline. The company, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, has seen its stock skyrocket over 2,000% since its 2023 listing but is now experiencing a retreat as investors lock in profits. Analysts attribute the decline to a reset in market expectations and concerns over rising gold prices, though some believe the company's growth story remains intact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Attorneys for immigrant children have filed court documents detailing "unsafe and unsanitary" conditions in U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities, where children are allegedly held for weeks. The filings describe neglect, such as lack of access to medication and clean clothes, and come as the Trump administration requests an end to the Flores Settlement Agreement, which mandates basic standards of care for detained minors. Advocates fear that terminating the agreement would remove crucial oversight and transparency, potentially leading to further abuses and a deterioration in the treatment of children in custody.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the significant drop in crime across the United States is directly correlated with the Trump administration's robust enforcement of immigration laws. Citing a Council on Criminal Justice report showing declines in homicide, robbery, and other crimes, the author contends that increased ICE arrests and the reversal of sanctuary city policies are removing criminals from communities. The piece posits that these results prove that enforcing existing laws, rather than creating new ones, is the key to improving public safety and securing the border.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has enacted a new law, effective July 2026, that will require social media platforms to display a pop-up warning to users before they log on. This label will inform them that prolonged use can be hazardous to their mental health, a measure supported by former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy. While youth advocates and suicide prevention groups praise the law as a tool for public education, tech industry group NetChoice opposes it, arguing it compels private companies to carry the state's message and may lead to a legal challenge.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg warned the Democratic party against a simple "restoration" project aimed at repairing institutions damaged by the Trump administration. He argued that the pre-2024 status quo was already failing many Americans and that Democrats have been "too attached" to it. Buttigieg suggests that key institutions, from the Department of Education to USAID, require fundamental rethinking rather than just being pieced back together, asserting that a politics of courage is needed to counter the current politics of fear.</p>

          <p>English golfer Charley Hull, currently ranked world number 19, is preparing for the AIG Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl, hoping to secure her first major championship victory. Now 29, Hull has been a prominent figure in golf since winning a major amateur title at age nine, but a major professional title has so far eluded her. Her preparation has been disrupted by a recent virus that forced her to withdraw from the Evian Championship. Known for her unconventional training and candid personality, Hull remains a key contender despite the setback.</p>

          <p>An attack on a Catholic church in the northeastern town of Komanda in the Democratic Republic of Congo has left at least 43 people dead, including nine children. The raid was carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an insurgent group affiliated with the "Islamic State," as worshippers were gathered for Sunday prayer. The UN peacekeeping mission condemned the targeted attack on civilians, which also involved burning nearby houses and shops. The massacre ends a period of relative calm in the Ituri province, a region long plagued by violence.</p>

          <p>A growing number of students in China are choosing to attend lower-ranked universities to pursue majors with strong job prospects, such as computer science, rather than prioritizing the prestige of an elite institution. This trend reflects increasing anxiety about the competitive job market and a shift in focus toward immediate employability and career security. The surge in demand for tech-related fields, fueled by the rise of AI, means many students are making pragmatic choices about their education to better position themselves for future employment in a challenging economy.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the new US-EU trade deal highlights several key outcomes and lingering issues. Firstly, significant uncertainty remains, with steel tariffs still high and confusion over sectors like pharmaceuticals. Secondly, the deal is a political agreement that could be altered by the Trump administration if investment promises are not met. The deal also creates a tariff disparity on the island of Ireland, disappoints Germany's export-heavy industries, and establishes tariff rates that remain much higher than historical norms.

          <p>This opinion piece describes the starvation in Gaza as a "foreseeable and thus deliberate" crisis created by Israel's siege, where children are dying at an alarming rate. The author argues that the world's political establishment is failing to take meaningful action, instead offering "hollow" statements and performative gestures. The article contends that despite feeling like "screaming into a void," relentless public protest is the only remaining lever to pressure governments into taking concrete steps, such as ceasing military and trade relations with Israel.</p>

This campaign is displacing numerous low-wage migrant workers who rely on these crowded, jerry-rigged living spaces as their only affordable housing option in the booming city-state. Workers earning a few hundred dollars a month live in modified closets or share rooms with many others, and now face eviction with nowhere else to go.

          <p>While a new trade deal lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese-made cars from 25% to 15%, industry experts caution that this offers little comfort to Japan's auto industry. The bigger and more persistent threat comes from the rapid rise of Chinese automakers, who are eroding Japan's market share in key regions like Southeast Asia and Australia. Analysts note that China's dominance in electric vehicles and critical components presents a significant challenge. This external competition, combined with domestic economic issues, creates a difficult outlook for Japanese car companies. (not investment advice)</p>
