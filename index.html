          <p>Russian missile and drone attacks on Kyiv have resulted in at least 26 deaths, including three children, and injured 159 people. The assault, which destroyed an apartment block and damaged other civilian infrastructure, represents one of the largest single-night casualty events in the capital since the war began. These strikes continue despite a US-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, a demand Moscow has evidently ignored. Meanwhile, Russia claims to have captured the strategic town of Chasiv Yar, though Ukrainian officials dispute this assertion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's latest round of tariffs is set to have a widely varied impact on economies across Asia. Key US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan successfully negotiated lower rates than initially proposed, with Japan and South Korea securing 15% tariffs. In contrast, India faces a 25% tariff along with penalties for purchasing Russian oil. Within the ASEAN bloc, outcomes differ sharply; Vietnam negotiated a rate of 20%, while most others face similar levies, but Laos and Myanmar were hit with much higher 40% tariffs, potentially due to their close ties with China.

          <p>Countries across Asia are responding to the finalized US tariff rates announced ahead of a looming deadline, with reactions ranging from relief to concern. Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments after their initial high tariffs were significantly reduced to 19%, which they believe will boost their economic competitiveness. Taiwan's president noted its 20% tariff is temporary pending further negotiations, while Japan welcomed the certainty of its finalized 15% rate. In contrast, India, facing a 25% tariff, stated it is negotiating for a trade agreement later this year to protect its national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has established a dedicated attaché office in Wellington, New Zealand, explicitly stating that one of its primary goals is to counter the influence of the Chinese Communist Party in the Indo-Pacific region. The move was announced by a U.S. official who identified countering the CCP as a top priority for America and its allies. In response, the Chinese embassy in Wellington strongly opposed what it called "groundless assertions" rooted in a "Cold War mentality." Beijing's statement asserted that such actions are against the will of the people and are destined to fail.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, contain any "back doors" that would allow for remote access or control. The statement came after China's top cybersecurity regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), summoned the company for an interview regarding potential security risks. This regulatory scrutiny highlights the significant challenges the U.S. chipmaker faces in navigating the complex relationship between Washington and Beijing. The company must balance U.S. export controls with the demands and security concerns of the critical Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski for the 1994 murders of his wife and two children, marking the state's ninth execution this year. This figure establishes a new record for the highest number of executions in a single year in Florida since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. The state has now carried out more executions this year than any other, with two more scheduled for later in the month. Opponents of the execution noted Zakrzewski's military service and the non-unanimous jury recommendation for his death sentence, which would not be permissible under current state law.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" her from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, the family criticized the term, with Giuffre's brother stating she was "preyed upon," not stolen like an object, and questioned how much Trump knew at the time. The family's remarks come as Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's convicted accomplice, has been interviewed by the Justice Department. The family is calling for public answers and urging that Maxwell remain imprisoned for her crimes.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to combat rhino poaching, scientists in South Africa have launched the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. The initiative, a collaboration between the University of the Witwatersrand and conservationists, aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at international borders and airports. This would help identify and intercept smuggled horns, leading to the arrest of traffickers. After successful trials confirmed the process is safe for the animals, the first group of rhinos received the injections in a wider rollout to protect the country's declining population.</p>

This pivot is driven by Mars' more Earth-like conditions and its potential for sustained habitation.

          <p>An investigation has uncovered a widespread black-market rental sector in London, where tenants are forced to live in dangerously overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. Properties intended for a few occupants are illegally housing 10 to 15 people, with residents facing issues like black mould, rat infestations, and severe safety hazards. These unlicensed Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) often operate under the radar, and evidence suggests they may outnumber legal ones in some areas. The problem can be fatal, as highlighted by a fire in an overcrowded flat that killed one resident, leading to a large fine for the landlords.</p>

Despite working tirelessly, many find themselves financially insecure, a stark contrast to the stability their parents' generation achieved.

          <p>This article explains the function and purpose of tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods, in the context of the Trump administration's recent trade policies. Tariffs increase the cost of foreign products for importers, who may then pass those costs to consumers or reduce imports. President Trump argues these taxes protect American jobs and encourage domestic manufacturing by reducing the U.S. trade deficit. However, critics contend the policy creates economic chaos, and many firms have already raised prices for U.S. consumers as a direct result of the new and threatened duties on goods from around the world.

He emphasized the importance of collegiality among the justices despite their differing views on difficult issues.</p>

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under President Biden, had her appointment to a distinguished chair position at West Point rescinded. The reversal came after a pro-Trump activist targeted her on social media, accusing her of undermining the Trump administration due to her work countering election disinformation. In response to the outcry, the Secretary of the Army directed West Point to rescind the offer. Easterly described the decision as a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage" that drowned out her record of integrity and service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the U.S. blaming countries like Australia for its high prescription drug prices is a misguided grievance. The author points out that the U.S. healthcare system is an outlier among wealthy nations, spending nearly twice as much per person for worse health outcomes. While Americans do pay more for drugs, the solution lies in domestic policy reform, such as adopting a system similar to Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), which controls prices. The piece concludes that the Trump administration's approach of bullying trading partners is less effective than addressing the systemic failures within America's own healthcare system.

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is currently "broken." She explained her decision not to run for California governor was because she did not want to re-enter a system that she feels is not as strong as it needs to be to defend fundamental principles. Harris clarified she is not giving up the fight for those principles but wants to engage with Americans outside of a transactional political context. The interview was a significant booking for "The Late Show," which is slated to end its run next year.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), announced an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion and slightly surpassing analyst expectations. Despite this growth, AWS faces strong competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which reported higher percentage growth rates in their recent earnings. AWS remains a significant profit driver for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income, and continues to expand its infrastructure globally. The company noted that ongoing supply constraints, particularly for power, are a challenge in meeting the high demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's political party, PTI, to prison for their involvement in protests against the military in May 2023. The sentences, including a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, are a major blow to the party. The protests erupted after Khan's arrest on corruption charges, leading to violent clashes and a subsequent crackdown on his supporters. The PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to challenge the verdict in a higher court.</p>

          <p>Annual tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since they were frozen in 2017. Maintenance loans for living costs have also been increased to help students cope with rising expenses. The fee hike comes after universities warned of significant financial pressures due to high inflation and a decline in international student enrollment, which could lead to cuts in staffing and courses. Student rents have also risen sharply, with research indicating that maintenance loans may barely cover average housing costs, forcing more students into part-time work.</p>
