          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show returned after a suspension due to controversial comments about President Trump's supporters. Audience members described the monologue as emotional, noting that Kimmel did not issue an apology. Several local stations preempted the show's return, reflecting the ongoing scrutiny of media companies. Protesters and supporters gathered outside the studio, highlighting the divided reactions to Kimmel's return, which underscores the ongoing debate around free speech and media responsibility in the current political climate. The event was held across from the TCL Chinese Theater, and the Hollywood Walk of Fame was just outside the venue.</p>

          <p>Claudia Cardinale, the Italian actress known for her roles in films like *The Leopard* and *The Pink Panther*, passed away at the age of 87 in France. Cardinale's career spanned six decades, during which she worked with renowned directors such as Federico Fellini and Luchino Visconti, and she was considered a symbol of Italian cinema's golden age. Born in Tunisia to Sicilian parents, she initially aspired to be a teacher, but her life took an unexpected turn after winning a beauty contest. Her legacy remains as a free and inspired woman, both as an artist and as an individual.</p>

The installation is similar to other recent art pieces that mock the former president. The statue's appearance underscores the ongoing scrutiny of Trump's associations, highlighting the persistent controversy surrounding his past connections.

          <p>President Trump made several inaccurate statements about autism during a press conference about Tylenol and autism risks. He repeated claims about Amish children, vaccines, and Tylenol's link to autism, all of which lack scientific support. Medical experts and studies refute these claims, highlighting the importance of accurate information regarding vaccines and prenatal care. Trump's assertions contradict medical consensus, which is why it is important to rely on verifiable sources. The best quality evidence does not show that acetaminophen causes autism.</p>

High costs of rent, utilities, and council tax are major obstacles. Industry experts warn that nearly half of young adults' income would be consumed by housing expenses if they moved out. The situation is also impacting parents who are unable to downsize, exacerbating the financial strain.</p>
