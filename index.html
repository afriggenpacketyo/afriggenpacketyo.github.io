A third juvenile suspect remains at large. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro stated that Tarpinian-Jachym was an innocent bystander and used the announcement to criticize the D.C. City Council's policies regarding juvenile offenders. The investigation utilized video surveillance and interviews to identify the suspects, who reportedly have prior violent records.</p>

          <p>A new telescope image from the International Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the growing tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The image indicates the comet has become more active as it approaches the sun, with its coma and tail appearing more extended than in previous photos. Scientists are studying the light spectrum from the comet to understand its composition and how it changes during its journey. The comet poses no threat to Earth and is expected to be visible through September.</p>

          <p>In court documents filed before his guilty plea, Bryan Kohberger, who murdered four University of Idaho students, claimed he was diagnosed with four mental health disorders. The listed conditions were autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, ADHD, and an eating disorder, all diagnosed in February 2025. His defense team had previously attempted to use the autism diagnosis to argue against the death penalty, a request that was denied by a judge. Kohberger ultimately accepted a plea deal, receiving four consecutive life sentences instead of facing a potential death sentence.</p>

          <p>A congressional investigation by House Republicans has found that the Pentagon funded hundreds of research projects in collaboration with Chinese universities and institutes, some of which are linked to China's military. The report released by the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party argues these partnerships have allowed China to leverage U.S. research for its own military advantage. The findings raise concerns about national security and whether American taxpayer funds are inadvertently strengthening a strategic competitor. Some Defense Department officials reportedly argued for keeping research open as long as it is not classified.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This decline brings rates to their lowest point since October of the previous year, offering potential relief to homebuyers facing high housing prices. The drop provided a boost to homebuilder stocks, though it remains uncertain if the lower rates will be enough to significantly reinvigorate mortgage demand. For a buyer of a median-priced home, the rate drop could translate to a monthly payment savings of nearly $170.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for breaching EU competition laws in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that Google abused its dominant market position by favoring its own online ad display products and its advertising exchange, AdX, over those of its rivals. This is the third time the EU has found Google guilty of anti-competitive behavior, leading to an increased fine. The Commission has ordered Google to end these practices and has warned that a structural remedy, such as selling parts of its ad tech business, may be necessary.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Democratic party's recurring strategy of framing President Trump's controversial actions as deliberate distractions from his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. The author argues that while Trump's connection to Epstein is a valid issue, labeling everything from National Guard deployments to policy changes as a "distraction" may be an ineffective political tactic. This approach, the article suggests, risks trivializing genuinely concerning authoritarian actions and reveals a potential lack of more potent messaging from Trump's opponents. It implies that Democrats may be distracting themselves from focusing on more substantive vulnerabilities.</p>

The party claims these would be funded by scrapping net zero policies and cutting government waste, with savings figures that independent bodies like the Institute for Fiscal Studies have questioned.

          <p>A winner of the $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S. history, would face a substantial tax bill. The lump sum cash option is estimated at $826.4 million, which would be immediately reduced by a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding of about $198.3 million. However, because the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a much larger tax payment would ultimately be due. State taxes could further reduce the take-home amount, though some states do not tax lottery winnings.</p>

Given economic uncertainties like inflation, experts advise creating multiple income streams to ensure financial security. Strategies include purchasing annuities for a guaranteed income, using a reverse mortgage to convert home equity into cash for homeowners over 62, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70. These approaches can help bridge the gap between savings and actual living expenses in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet has told customers they are unlikely to recover any of their principal from a series of defaulted marine loans totaling $89 million. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, but stated this amount will not even cover its own extensive legal expenses incurred while trying to recover the funds. The loans, intended to finance ship-breaking operations, soured after Yieldstreet lost track of the vessels used as collateral. This outcome is another significant blow to the platform's customers, some of whom have also recently seen real estate investments wiped out. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has sanctioned three Palestinian human rights organizations for asking the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate alleged Israeli war crimes and genocide in Gaza. The groups—Al-Haq, the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, and Al Mezan Center for Human Rights—were designated by the Treasury Department for engaging with the ICC's efforts to prosecute Israeli nationals. The sanctions will impede the groups' ability to operate and collaborate with international partners. The organizations condemned the move as "immoral, illegal and undemocratic," which comes after the ICC issued arrest warrants for Israeli and Hamas leaders.</p>

          <p>Following audience feedback regarding a recent edited interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, CBS News has changed its policy for its "Face the Nation" program. The network announced that it will now only broadcast interviews live or live-to-tape to ensure greater transparency. This change means the television audience will see the full, unedited conversation, a practice the network already followed by posting full transcripts and videos online. The initial interview with Noem drew criticism from the Department of Homeland Security, which accused the network of distorting the truth.</p>

          <p>With global stock markets at record highs but facing headwinds from a weakening labor market and tariff uncertainty, analysts suggest investors should consider defensive portfolio adjustments. A key concern is the heavy concentration of mega-cap tech stocks in major indexes like the S&P 500, creating significant risk if the market rotates. Investors are advised to review their exposure to avoid over-concentration in tech and large-cap growth funds. Shifting some capital toward value and defensive sectors that have underperformed in recent years could help insulate portfolios from potential downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has laid off nearly 100 employees in recent months as a direct result of significant cuts in its federal funding. The workforce reduction follows a congressional vote in July that eliminated $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting, creating financial uncertainty for its 350 member stations. In response to the financial pressure, PBS also announced a 21% cut to its overall budget and a reduction in the dues it collects from local stations.

          <p>Washington D.C.'s Kennedy Center is facing a dramatic drop in ticket sales and subscription revenue following President Trump's appointment as its new chairman. An analysis by Washingtonian magazine reports that audiences are staying away in protest of the new leadership, with some upcoming performances booked at less than 20% capacity. Subscription revenue is reportedly down by about 50%, and the new leadership team has replaced the dance programming staff with a self-described "Maga former dancer." The slump indicates a significant challenge for the prestigious performing arts venue as it navigates a politically charged transition.</p>

          <p>The once-booming industrial warehouse sector is experiencing a significant slowdown, with quarterly demand falling for the first time since 2010. A report from NAIOP attributes the decline to economic uncertainty driven by shifting tariff policies and high inflation, which has dampened the e-commerce surge that began during the pandemic. Net absorption of industrial space was nearly flat for the second half of the year. While a recovery is projected to begin in 2026, the report suggests that future demand growth will be slower than the pace seen over the last several years.</p>
