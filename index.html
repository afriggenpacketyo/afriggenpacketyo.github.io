        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is reportedly easing export restrictions on rare earth elements for U.S. and European auto manufacturers, offering a "green channel" for export license applications. This move follows warnings from industry groups about potential production disruptions due to a rare earth shortage. China's Ministry of Commerce expressed hope for reciprocal steps from the EU to promote compliant trade of high-tech products. The restrictions were initially imposed in response to U.S. tariffs, impacting components critical for both combustion engines and electric vehicles. While this is a positive development, uncertainty remains regarding the scope and implementation of the expedited approval process, and the EU will likely be pushed to increase diversification of supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Trump called for the immediate deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to escalating immigration protests. Trump cited reports of increasingly aggressive behavior from protesters and urged swift action to quell the unrest. This came after Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell indicated a reassessment of the situation and potential need for National Guard assistance. The president's remarks followed reports of demonstrations against federal immigration sweeps in downtown Los Angeles, with protesters engaging in confrontations with law enforcement, leading to property damage and arrests, as well as property destruction by arson. The situation underscores the heightened tensions surrounding immigration enforcement policies in the region, as well as a desire to de-escalate the violence.</p>

          <p>Florida Republicans, including State Senator Ileana Garcia and U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar, have publicly criticized President Trump's immigration-related arrests. Garcia described the arrests as "unacceptable and inhumane," stating that they contradict the values she voted for. She expressed concern over the arrest of individuals at immigration courts with credible persecution claims, attributing it to a desire to satisfy deportation goals. Salazar echoed these sentiments, emphasizing the need for due process for asylum seekers and urging a focus on removing criminals illegally present in the U.S. The situation highlights growing divisions within the Republican party over immigration policy, particularly concerning the treatment of asylum seekers and those complying with immigration hearings.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a goal to boost Japan's economy to 1,000 trillion yen in nominal terms by 2040. This target, included in a pledge for this summer's nationwide election, represents a significant increase from the current nominal GDP of around 600 trillion yen. Ishiba also aims to achieve over 50 percent growth in average income within the same timeframe, prioritizing wage growth that consistently outpaces inflation. The announcement comes as major political parties seek to attract voters with campaign promises, with opposition parties advocating for consumption tax reductions to alleviate inflation's impact on households. This goal reflects Japan's ambition to revitalize its economy and improve living standards amidst global economic challenges (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Chinese military drone factory has successfully replaced master technicians with robots in the production of carbon-fiber drone bodies. The robots, equipped with real-time sensors, perform drilling tasks with greater speed and precision, reducing errors to a mere 0.04-0.1mm. This breakthrough from the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) has transformed the production line, increasing efficiency and lowering costs. The shift reflects a global trend towards unmanned and intelligent military operations, as highlighted by CAST researchers. This transformation challenges traditional stereotypes of Chinese manufacturing, showcasing advanced automation and technological innovation.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its cable networks (including CNN and TNT Sports) from its streaming and studios business (including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television). David Zaslav will lead Streaming & Studios, while Gunnar Wiedenfels will lead Global Networks, with the split expected by mid-2026. The move effectively reverses the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros. Discovery, as cable networks face declining viewership due to the shift to streaming services. The company aims to scale up HBO Max and reach 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026, and this restructuring is intended to allow each company to pursue investment opportunities and drive shareholder value.</p>

          <p>Shares of Robinhood experienced a decline after the online brokerage was not included in the latest quarterly rebalance of the S&P 500. Despite speculation and anticipation of its potential inclusion, the S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the S&P 500 would remain unchanged. Bank of America had previously identified Robinhood as a top candidate for inclusion, which typically triggers significant trading activity and passive fund investments. While Robinhood's stock has seen a substantial recovery this year, doubling in price, it was ultimately passed over for inclusion in the benchmark index. The market's reaction underscores the importance of S&P 500 inclusion for a company's visibility and investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Four members of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) sustained minor injuries in an explosion while handling an unexploded bomb near the U.S. military's Kadena Air Base in Okinawa. The incident occurred at a GSDF storage facility during preparations for disposal of unexploded bombs from World War II. The injured members were removing rust and mud from the bomb when the explosion occurred. No evacuation order was issued for nearby residents, and authorities are emphasizing the need for continued efforts to safely dispose of unexploded ordnance in the area, which remains a concern due to the history of conflict in the region.</p>

This shift involves splitting a 24-word Bitcoin seed phrase into four sets of six words, some digitally encrypted and others etched onto steel plates. This change reflects growing concerns about physical attacks on crypto holders and a desire for complete decentralization of financial risk.</p>
