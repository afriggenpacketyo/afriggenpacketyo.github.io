          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has begun a two-day visit to India, leading the UK's largest-ever trade mission to build upon a recently signed free trade agreement. The deal is set to significantly boost bilateral trade by reducing tariffs on goods like British whiskey and cars, and eliminating them for 99% of Indian exports to the UK, including textiles. Starmer emphasized the importance of implementing the deal quickly to seize growth opportunities for both nations, though discussions with PM Modi may also touch on India's relationship with Russia.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military killed at least 24 people and wounded dozens more after using a motorized paraglider to drop bombs on a crowd attending a Buddhist festival. The gathering in the Sagaing region was a peaceful protest against the ruling junta, which seized power in a 2021 coup, sparking a widespread civil war. This attack highlights the military's increasingly brutal tactics, including the use of paramotors and advanced drones, as it struggles to control large parts of the country held by resistance forces.</p>

          <p>France is facing significant political and fiscal turmoil following the resignation of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu after just 27 days in office, marking the fifth PM to depart in under two years. The political deadlock is jeopardizing the country's ability to address its severe budget deficit, which stands at 5.8% of GDP, and a national debt of 113% of GDP, both far exceeding EU limits. This instability raises serious concerns in Brussels and among investors about France's fiscal discipline and economic future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government did not provide evidence classifying China as a "threat to national security" during the period of the alleged offenses. This specific legal threshold, clarified in a recent case involving Russian spies, was deemed essential for a successful prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. The failure to secure this classification led to the charges being dropped, prompting criticism and questions about the government's stance on China.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice, relating to his congressional testimony in September 2020. The charges focus on his answers to questions about his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian interference in the 2016 election. The case revives a highly contentious period in US politics and has drawn sharp reactions, with critics of President Trump suggesting the indictment is politically motivated.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to reduce tariff-free quotas on imported steel and increase tariffs on excess imports from 25% to 50%, causing stocks of European steel producers like SSAB and Thyssenkrupp to rise. The move is intended to protect the industry from global overcapacity but has sparked concern among automobile manufacturers, who warn that the measures go too far. Carmakers fear the tariffs will significantly push up their production costs and are advocating for a better balance between producers and users of steel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale rescue operation has successfully concluded on the Chinese side of Mount Everest, with nearly 900 people, including 580 hikers and over 300 local guides and workers, brought to safety. The groups were stranded by a severe weekend snowstorm that trapped them in tents at an altitude above 16,000 feet, cutting off access routes. Rescue teams provided essential supplies like food, medicine, and oxygen before escorting everyone down, though the scenic area remains temporarily closed to visitors.</p>

          <p>A misconduct hearing has revealed that six Cambridgeshire Police officers participated in a WhatsApp group where they shared jokes about murder victims, including George Floyd, and posted racist, misogynistic, and ableist content. One inspector was dismissed following the investigation, while five other officers resigned before their hearings; a panel determined they too would have been dismissed. The chief constable condemned the behavior, describing the message history as a "grotesque carnival of discrimination and abuse" with no place in policing.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is facing significant political pressure from an increasingly fragmented and polarized European Parliament, exemplified by two no-confidence votes filed against her in just three months. The challenges, coming from both the far-right and the radical left, target her leadership and policies on migration, climate, and foreign affairs. While she is expected to survive the votes, the turmoil highlights a fragile trust within the EU's political center and the growing influence of extremist parties.</p>

          <p>The ongoing US government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel, with nationwide flight delays and cancellations linked to staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. As essential workers forced to work without pay, many controllers are calling in sick, exacerbating an already critically understaffed system. The FAA has been forced to slow traffic into major hubs like Nashville and Dallas, highlighting the shutdown's cascading impact on critical national infrastructure and the financial strain on federal employees.</p>

          <p>The government of Chad has ended its 15-year conservation partnership with African Parks, a prominent wildlife charity where the Duke of Sussex serves on the board of directors. Chadian officials accused the organization of failing to effectively curb poaching in the two protected areas it managed and of displaying an arrogant and disrespectful attitude toward government authorities. The charity, which manages 22 protected areas across Africa, stated it has begun talks with the ministry to understand the decision and find a way forward.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed a groundbreaking technique using enzymes to convert kidneys to the universal O blood type, a breakthrough that could significantly expand the pool of available organs for transplantation. In a recent study, a converted kidney was transplanted into a brain-dead recipient and functioned for two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. This medical innovation holds the promise of shortening organ wait lists, saving more lives, and addressing long-standing inequities in organ allocation for patients from ethnic minorities.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has addressed his decision-making regarding the use of star rookie reliever Roki Sasaki during a critical playoff game. Roberts explained that he initially hesitated to use Sasaki in order to manage the young pitcher's workload, as he is new to the high-leverage relief role. Although the initial plan nearly backfired, Roberts confirmed that Sasaki is now the team's primary closing option, but stressed that his usage will continue to be carefully balanced to ensure his health throughout the postseason.</p>
