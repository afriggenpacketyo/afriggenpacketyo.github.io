          <p>Former President Donald Trump visited his golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, sparking nationwide protests against his visit and recent UK trade policies. While security kept demonstrators at a distance from the golf course, hundreds gathered in cities like Edinburgh and Aberdeen, with groups forming a "Stop Trump Coalition" to express their opposition. Protesters criticized the visit as inappropriate, holding signs and chanting, while the Scottish government simultaneously announced public funding for a golf championship at another Trump-owned course. The article highlights the contrast between Trump's connection to his Scottish heritage and the significant public disdain he faced during his trip.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guess advertisement in Vogue magazine featuring a flawless, AI-generated model has ignited controversy over its implications for beauty standards and the modeling profession. Critics and models express concern that using artificial figures reinforces unrealistic and non-diverse ideals, potentially undermining years of progress toward inclusivity in fashion. The company behind the AI model defends its creation as realistic and supplementary, not a replacement for human models, though it acknowledges a lack of diversity in its portfolio. The debate extends to the lack of transparency and the potential negative mental health effects on consumers, particularly young people, exposed to digitally perfected, unattainable images.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. This ancient device, described in historical texts as an ornate jar with dragons and toads, was reportedly capable of detecting distant earthquakes and indicating the direction of their epicenters. Despite its historical acclaim for being 'as accurate as the gods,' the device was removed from the Chinese school curriculum in 2017 amid scholarly debate over its authenticity. Supported by modern science and new clues, the project aims to restore the lost wonder and validate its sophisticated, early-warning capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military announced it will begin airdropping aid and establishing humanitarian corridors for UN convoys in Gaza in response to growing international pressure over a severe hunger crisis. This move aims to improve the humanitarian situation and counter claims of deliberate starvation, though the IDF stated combat operations against Hamas will continue. The announcement comes amid reports of dozens of malnutrition-related deaths, including many children, and criticism from aid groups about access restrictions. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, however, called the airdrops an inefficient 'distraction,' insisting that only lifting land-based restrictions can address the man-made famine.</p>

          <p>Emerging scientific research is revealing the potential long-term health consequences of nanoplastics, microscopic particles originating from degraded plastic waste. A University of New Mexico lab has found these particles in human brain tissue for the first time, with higher concentrations observed in the brains of people with dementia. Other studies link nanoplastic pollution to increased risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, with one researcher tracking its impact on over 64,000 children. Experts describe the particles as 'toxic drug delivery systems' that can cause physical damage to arteries and hormonal disruption, underscoring the urgent need to reduce plastic consumption.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna, Austria, to Hamburg, Germany, were stranded inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The outage, which occurred shortly after departure, also disabled the air conditioning and lighting, leaving passengers in heat and darkness. The evacuation was complicated when some individuals left the train and entered the tunnel on foot, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety reasons. Ultimately, around 100 rescue workers assisted in evacuating everyone through emergency exits, with two people receiving on-site medical treatment but no serious injuries reported.</p>

The Boeing 737 experienced a maintenance issue with a tire, which led to smoke and a small fire that was quickly extinguished by the fire department. Passengers were evacuated using emergency slides, and while five people were evaluated at the scene, only one was transported for a minor injury.

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament. This news came as a relief to the team, as it avoids a potential long-term layoff that would require major surgery. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a PRP injection and hopes to return in 10 days to two weeks, initially as a designated hitter. He first felt pain during a game against Toronto, and the injury primarily affects his throwing, not his hitting.</p>

          <p>The early 2000s reality show 'The Osbournes' pioneered a new genre by blending the mundane family life of Black Sabbath's Ozzy Osbourne with his rock-star fame, creating what producers called a 'reality sitcom.' Before the Kardashians, the show captivated millions by portraying Ozzy as a lovable but bumbling father, turning everyday frustrations like battling a TV remote into iconic television moments. It humanized the 'Prince of Darkness' and his family, establishing a format that influenced a wave of celebrity-driven reality TV. While the constant filming took an emotional toll on the family, the show is remembered for its authentic portrayal of a loving, albeit chaotic, household.</p>

          <p>A recent UK government report indicates that almost half of working-age adults, particularly the self-employed, low earners, and women, are not contributing to a private or workplace pension. The article shares anecdotes from individuals who prioritize immediate financial survival, such as covering daily expenses or saving for a house deposit, over long-term retirement planning. This trend raises concerns about future financial security, as many may have to rely solely on the state pension, which is significantly less than the income considered necessary for a minimum standard of living in retirement. The success of auto-enrolment is noted, but it doesn't cover everyone, leaving significant gaps in savings. (not investment advice)</p>

Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions as a respite from extreme heat seen elsewhere, the persistent cold has become a notable topic of conversation in the city. Forecasters warn that despite the cool start, summer is not over, and hotter temperatures could still arrive later in the season.</p>

The opposition KMT party defends its actions as necessary government oversight and claims it is the only party capable of dialogue with Beijing. With this effort to flip control of parliament failing, President Lai will likely face an emboldened opposition for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a 'fantasist' and convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an elaborate, non-existent music festival called Monmouth Rising. The event promised a star-studded lineup including The Killers and Pulp, claiming to be the world's first hydrogen-powered festival, but it was all built on lies. Kenny fabricated investor support, forged documents, and made false claims to employees and suppliers, many of whom lost money and time on the project. The festival ultimately collapsed when promised payments never materialized, leaving a trail of broken promises and revealing a pattern of deceit from its creator.</p>

Czuba was convicted of murder and attempted murder for the October 2023 attack on the boy and his mother, Hanan Shaheen, which prosecutors argued was motivated by their Palestinian-American identity and the Israel-Hamas war. The brutal attack, in which the boy was stabbed 26 times, drew global attention and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence in the U.S. An Islamic relations council noted that while the killer is dead, the hate that motivated him persists.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas made a rapid descent of several hundred feet to avoid a potential midair collision with another aircraft. The incident occurred shortly after takeoff when the pilots of Flight 1496 responded to an onboard traffic alert, prompting the evasive maneuver. The other aircraft was identified as a decommissioned Hawker Hunter fighter jet, and data showed the two were in the same airspace. The flight continued to its destination and landed safely, though one flight attendant was transported to a hospital for minor injuries, and the FAA is now investigating the event.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's broad use of tariffs is facing significant legal challenges in federal court, with multiple lawsuits questioning his authority to impose them under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A key case is set for oral arguments, challenging the legal basis for many of Trump's major tariffs, including the 'reciprocal' duties on numerous countries. A lower court previously ruled that the president exceeded his authority, and while that decision is on hold, the outcome of the appeal could have massive implications. If the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could invalidate nearly all of the trade deals and tariff actions of the past year. (not investment advice)</p>

After Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu secured the withdrawal of Indian troops, Modi's visit signals a diplomatic reset, with Muizzu calling India the nation's 'closest and most trusted partner.' During the trip, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line, announced reduced debt repayments for the struggling Maldivian economy, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects.

          <p>England's push for victory against India on the final day of the fourth Test is clouded by uncertainty over captain Ben Stokes' fitness to bowl. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on day four, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick stating he was 'a bit stiff and sore.' Stokes, who has a history of injury issues and retired hurt with cramp while batting, appeared weary in the field, raising concerns about his condition. His absence from the bowling attack could be a significant blow to England's chances of securing a win.</p>

Trump replied that it was something he hadn't thought about, a response Honig called a botch of 'the easiest question in human history.' Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in helping Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse underage girls. Honig stated the obvious answer should be an emphatic 'no,' though he acknowledged that some close to Trump believe a pardon could potentially happen, adding to the controversy surrounding the president's past association with Epstein.</p>

Inspired by the recent success of England's Lionesses, Chadha feels it is the right time to revisit the characters that inspired a generation of female footballers. The new installment is tentatively planned for 2027 to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the FIFA Women's World Cup. Chadha hopes to reunite the original cast, including Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, and potentially feature cameos from current England players.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has completed the signing of Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting, addressing a long-standing need for a consistent goalscorer. The 27-year-old arrives with a formidable record, having scored 97 goals in 102 appearances in Portugal, ranking as the top scorer across Europe's top 10 leagues last season. While Arsenal was the third-highest scoring team in the Premier League, their lack of a clinical finisher was seen as a key factor in falling short in title and Champions League races. Gyokeres's physical strength, intelligent movement, and proven finishing ability bring hope that he can be the final piece in Arsenal's quest for major trophies.</p>
