          <h2>Experts Assess Damage to Iran's Nuclear Program After Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 18:07:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, independent experts analyzing satellite imagery suggest that while the Iranian nuclear program has been damaged, it has not been entirely destroyed. Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies notes that critical elements, including Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium, appear to have been untouched by the strikes. David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security echoes this concern, emphasizing that significant amounts of enriched uranium still exist and could be moved to covert facilities for further enrichment. The experts' assessments contrast with claims from the Trump Administration that the strikes obliterated Iran's nuclear ambitions, pointing to potential efforts by Iran to conceal or relocate enriched uranium before the attacks. Optimism is tempered by the recognition that diplomacy and international cooperation are essential for a lasting resolution. </p>

The U.S. military mission, involved B-2 bombers dropping Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs, also known as "bunker busters". Additionally, Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from a U.S. Navy submarine at targets inside Iran.

          <p>General Dan Caine outlined the U.S. military's operation, codenamed 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. The mission involved a continuous 18-hour flight, multiple mid-air refuelings, and decoy flights to mislead observers. Seven B-2 stealth bombers, carrying powerful "bunker buster" bombs, struck Iran's most secure nuclear sites, including the Fordo facility, which is buried deep underground. The operation also included the launch of Tomahawk cruise missiles from a U.S. submarine toward a nuclear site near Isfahan, with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claiming the U.S. had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear regime, although the full extent of the damage remains to be measured.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, U.S. leaders, including President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth, urged Iran to pursue a diplomatic resolution rather than retaliation. Trump stated that Iran must now make peace, while Vance clarified that the U.S. is at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself. Hegseth emphasized that the U.S. action was intentionally limited and not aimed at regime change, signaling that the U.S. is open to negotiations and has communicated steps Iran can take to allow for peace, while also threatening further military action if Iran retaliates.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites suggests that the actions could lead to further escalation between the two countries. While the Trump administration claims the strikes were a success, the long-term consequences and Iran's potential response remain uncertain. Possible escalation pathways include the U.S. needing to conduct additional bombings to fully disable Iran's nuclear capabilities, Iran retaliating against U.S. forces or international shipping lanes, and the situation devolving into a broader conflict akin to the Iraq War. The article warns that the Trump administration may not have fully considered the potential ramifications of its actions, raising concerns about a possible quagmire in the Middle East.</p>

The plan, aimed at boosting growth, will potentially cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. A new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce costs by up to £40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms, while the most energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also includes measures to expedite the connection of new factories to the energy grid and support the creation of over one million new jobs over the next decade.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports and warned that closing it would be "economic suicide" for Iran, as it would halt the country's crude exports to China. The U.S. retains options to address any Iranian attempt to close the strait, with the U.S. Fifth Fleet stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the Persian Gulf.

          <p>Following President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, Washington is preparing for a potential response from Iran. U.S. military officials claim the strikes caused "extremely severe damage and destruction," while Iran downplays the impact. The main question is how Tehran will respond, both militarily and with its nuclear program, and Tehran’s nuclear-armed allies, in Russia and North Korea, have been critical of the military campaign. Vice President Vance denied that the United States was “at war” with Iran, stating that the nation is, instead, “at war with Iran’s nuclear program.”</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the US has carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, which he claims have been "obliterated", though the Pentagon said it will take time to fully assess the effect of the attack. Gen Dan Caine said Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 US military aircraft including seven B-2 stealth bombers, and that three nuclear facilities were targeted - Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. Israel says they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes, and Iranian officials have confirmed the facilities were struck but denied it had suffered a major blow. The strikes mark a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including the possibility of blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz, located between Oman and Iran, is a crucial global trade route that facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day. While Iran has long threatened to close the strait to ward off Western pressure, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that any effort to block the strait would be a "suicidal move" for Iran, potentially triggering a backlash from powerful countries. The U.S. Navy, with its 5th Fleet stationed in Bahrain, has pledged to uphold freedom of navigation in the strait. </p>

Administration officials claim the president has the authority to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, some lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, argue that Congress should have been consulted before any action was taken, citing the lack of an imminent threat to the United States. Top Democrats were reportedly kept in the dark about the mission until after U.S. forces left Iranian airspace, raising concerns about the legality of the strike without Congressional approval. </p>

          <p>The United States carried out an unprecedented attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, delivering what American military leaders believe is a knockout blow to a nuclear program that Israel views as an existential threat. Taking off from the U.S. heartland, B-2 stealth bombers delivered a total of 420,000 pounds of explosives, aided by an armada of refueling tankers and fighter jets — some of which launched their own weapons. U.S. officials said Iran neither detected the inbound fusillade, nor mustered a shot at the stealthy American jets. The operation relied on a series of deceptive tactics and decoys to maintain the secrecy, U.S. officials said hours after the attack, which was preceded by nine days of Israeli attacks that debilitated Iran's military leadership and air defenses.</p>

Vance instead said that he believes the US has “substantially delayed” Iran’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon, and an Iranian member of parliament claimed on Sunday that the Fordo enrichment plant, the focus of seven B-2 bombers armed with 14 premier bunker-busters from the US arsenal, was not seriously damaged. Nuclear non-proliferation analysts are conflicted on whether the strikes will be effective in bringing Iran to the negotiating table or convince them to move more decisively toward enriching uranium stockpiles to weapons-grade, assembling a bomb, and manufacturing a delivery system.</p>
