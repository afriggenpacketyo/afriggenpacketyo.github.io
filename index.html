          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, located near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, was stolen, with police investigating the theft reported on Tuesday. Residents speculate vandalism or melting for cash, but not political motives. The statue, commissioned by an American artist, had previously been torched in 2020 and replaced with the bronze version. Locals expressed little affection for the statue, describing it as unaesthetic and embarrassing, though the town has capitalized on its connection to the former first lady through branded products. The statue's disappearance coincides with global expressions of dissatisfaction with Trump's policies through vandalism of Tesla vehicles and satirical advertisements.</p>

Commander Dominic Murphy of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command described the investigation as "very complex and fast-moving".

          <p>Nine people were killed in a Russian drone attack on a civilian bus in north-eastern Ukraine, according to local officials. The bus was hit in the town of Bilopillia, with seven others injured as the bus traveled to Sumy. Ukrainian officials described the attack as a "cynical war crime," while Russia claimed it hit a "military staging area" in Sumy. This attack occurred hours after Russia and Ukraine held peace talks, which resulted in an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war. The US has claimed that progress on ending the war would only be made if President Donald Trump and Putin held face-to-face talks.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen, who "accidentally defected" to South Korea after their boat was swept south of the maritime boundary, have been stuck in South Korea for over three months. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, North Korea has refused to communicate with the South, showing displeasure with Seoul's hard-line policies. With South Korea now officially designated as a "hostile state" by Pyongyang, communication lines are severed, leaving the fishermen in limbo. The situation may improve after South Korea's upcoming presidential election, with a potential shift towards reconciliation.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups to uncover insights into population history, migration, and adaptation. The study suggests that languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The findings also reveal genetic traits that may have evolved through adapting to extreme environments and long-term isolation, impacting modern South Americans' health.</p>

Biden responded by asserting he knows what he's doing and doesn't need the special counsel's recommendation.

Ventura described years of abuse and drug-fueled sexual encounters, known as "freak-offs", with Combs. Prosecutors are using her testimony to build a case that Combs was not just an abuser but the mastermind of a criminal enterprise. The defense concedes abuse but argues it does not constitute sex trafficking. The trial explores issues of consent versus compliance, and the role of Combs's associates in the alleged criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>Ammunition manufacturers in Gorazde, Bosnia, face uncertainty due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, potentially impacting their exports to the United States. Ginex, a local company, has stalled expansion plans due to tariff concerns. The United States has been a key market for Gorazde's weapons factories since the Balkan wars. The tariffs, ranging from 10% to 35%, risk scaring off American customers. The situation is complicated by the Bosnian trade minister's lack of interest in intervening and the dismantling of U.S.A.I.D. projects in the region.</p>
