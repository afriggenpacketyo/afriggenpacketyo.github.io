          <p>This New York Times article analyzes the Trump administration's increasing disregard for ethical norms and legal guardrails, highlighting instances where the president and his family are leveraging his position for personal enrichment. Examples include accepting a luxury jet from Qatar, promoting a meme cryptocurrency that benefits his family, and pressuring law firms for donations. The article suggests a pattern of transactional behavior and a blurring of lines between public service and private interests, raising concerns about potential corruption and abuse of power. The article suggests that the removal of constraints extends to law enforcement, such as the disbanding of a Justice Department unit dedicated to investigating cryptocurrency crimes and the suspension of enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p>

This led to criticism from Democrats and ethics lawyers, who accused Trump of selling access to the government for personal profit.

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes President Trump's decision to impose and then walk back triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products. The article states that the tariffs disrupted global trade but did not appear to result in major concessions from Beijing. The article suggests that the tariffs proved too painful for American businesses, leading to the decision to reduce them. The article also notes that the agreement to reduce tariffs did not generate any immediate concessions from China other than a commitment to keep talking.</p>
