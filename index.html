          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, convicted of murdering two of her children, argued in her Arizona trial that the shooting of her fourth husband was a "tragic family event," not premeditated murder. Prosecutors contend she conspired with her brother to kill Charles Vallow for his $1 million life insurance policy and to be with Chad Daybell, invoking religious beliefs as justification. The prosecution argued the shooting was an execution staged by Daybell and her brother, Alex Cox. The jury is currently deliberating the verdict in the case, which involves allegations of twisted religious beliefs and conspiracy. Optimism score: 20</p>

          <p>The United States has finalized tariff levels on solar cells and panels imported from Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam following a trade case brought by American manufacturers. The tariffs aim to address allegations of unfairly cheap goods flooding the market, with dumping duties ranging from 6.1% to 271.28% and countervailing duties between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country. The case was initiated by companies seeking to protect their investments in US solar manufacturing, arguing that Chinese firms with factories in Southeast Asia were undercutting American goods.

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions in federal funding. Harvard claims the administration is attempting to control its academic programs and punish the university for protecting its constitutional rights. The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration failed to follow required processes before cutting off funds, which Harvard says will impede critical scientific and medical research. Harvard is challenging the Trump administration's demands to change policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for viewpoint diversity. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on trade between China and the US, are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs. The 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is putting pressure on profit margins, leading to decreased revenue and difficulties with product inspections at the border. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which allowed duty-free entry for shipments valued at $800 or less, further exacerbates the situation. Many dropshippers are shifting their focus to the European market in response to these challenges. Optimism score: 35</p>
