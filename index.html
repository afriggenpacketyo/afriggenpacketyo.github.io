          <p>A significant heat dome is affecting over 90 million people across the U.S. Corn Belt and Southeast, with heat index values expected to reach 110-115 degrees Fahrenheit. While not record-breaking, these temperatures are 10-15 degrees above average, exacerbated by high humidity from agricultural transpiration, a phenomenon known as "corn sweat." Climate Central analysis indicates that human-caused climate change has made such extreme July heat at least three times more likely for nearly half the U.S. population. The lack of overnight cooling poses serious health risks, increasing the likelihood of heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>At the request of former President Trump, the Texas Legislature has begun a special session to redraw the state's congressional districts, aiming to increase the number of Republican-held seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. This mid-decade redistricting is highly unusual and controversial, with critics arguing it's a political maneuver to benefit Trump and could undermine the voting power of minority communities, which have driven 95% of the state's recent population growth. The move faces significant legal challenges and political risks, as spreading Republican voters too thin could backfire in a demographically changing state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following deadly floods in Central Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is urging the Trump administration to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting infrastructure, arguing it will save both lives and money. In a letter to the president, she outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading Doppler radar, replacing aging satellites, and improving supercomputing capabilities for more accurate predictions. This plea comes as the administration plans a 27% budget cut for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which could terminate research programs aimed at improving flood warnings and predicting precipitation rates, making communities more vulnerable to extreme weather events.</p>

Pellegrino survived the attack and is recovering in an Italian hospital, expressing gratitude for his life. Four suspects from Morocco and Tunisia have since been arrested in connection with the assault, which has drawn attention to the issue of violent crime and public safety on public transport in the region.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, faces sentencing after being convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights during the 2020 raid that resulted in her death. A federal jury found him guilty of using excessive force by firing shots through a covered door and window, though the bullets he fired did not strike Taylor. The Justice Department's recommendation of only one day in prison has sparked outrage from Taylor's family and civil rights advocates, who argue it undermines the verdict and fails to provide meaningful accountability for the tragic event that fueled national protests.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, a recently passed tax bill championed by Donald Trump is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts, including a reduced corporate tax rate, while also implementing cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs that are estimated to leave 10 million Americans uninsured by 2034. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the total debt increase could reach $4.1 trillion with interest, raising significant concerns about the nation's long-term fiscal health.

Harvard's legal team argued the move was an attempt to control the university's internal operations and would harm vital research, while the administration's lawyers contended the cuts were a necessary punishment.

          <p>A fragile truce has paused over a week of intense sectarian fighting in Syria's southern Sweida province between Druze militias and Sunni Muslim tribes, which left over 1,200 people dead and displaced more than 128,000. The conflict drew in both the new Syrian government and Israeli forces, who conducted airstrikes against Syrian army positions. This violence highlights the immense challenges facing President Ahmad al-Sharaa's government in unifying the country, disarming civil war-era militias, and gaining the trust of minority communities. The instability in the region threatens to derail Syria's delicate recovery after 14 years of civil war.</p>

          <p>In a new interview, Hunter Biden stated that his father, former President Joe Biden, was taking the prescription sleeping pill Ambien before his first debate against Donald Trump, which he believes contributed to the poor performance. Hunter claimed the then-81-year-old president was exhausted from travel and that the medication left him looking like a "deer in the headlights" on stage. This is the first time a close family member has publicly mentioned Ambien in relation to the debate, which was marked by stumbling answers and ultimately preceded Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race.</p>

          <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase has launched perpetual futures trading in the U.S., allowing users to trade derivatives with up to 10 times leverage. Following this development, a prominent crypto analyst identified a bullish "cup and handle" chart pattern for Coinbase's stock (COIN), which was recently added to the S&P 500. The analyst predicts that if the stock breaks out from its current resistance level, its price could potentially surge to a target range of $950 to $1,550. This optimistic forecast comes as the company continues to expand its product offerings for institutional and retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1979 disappearance of 6-year-old Etan Patz from his New York City neighborhood remains a haunting case that reshaped American parenting and law enforcement. For decades, the investigation pursued numerous leads, including a long-time suspect, Jose Ramos, but the case remained cold. A major breakthrough occurred in 2012 when a tip led police to Pedro Hernandez, a former convenience store worker who confessed to the crime. This article recounts the twisting, decades-long search for answers, the impact on the Patz family, and the complex legal battles that ultimately led to a conviction, though one that is now being challenged on appeal.</p>

          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans offer alternatives to high-interest credit cards or personal loans. Currently, the average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, with a HELOC at 8.27% and a home equity loan at 8.28%, resulting in very similar monthly payments. However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change with market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed, offering more predictable long-term costs. Borrowers should consider their risk tolerance for potential rate fluctuations when choosing between these two options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany has allowed two envoys from Afghanistan's Taliban regime to enter the country for the first time since the group seized power in 2021. The move is intended to facilitate the deportation of Afghan migrants with failed asylum claims or criminal convictions. While Germany does not formally recognize the Taliban government due to its human rights record, it maintains "technical contacts" to manage deportations. The decision has drawn sharp criticism from the United Nations, which advises against returning people to Afghanistan due to ongoing human rights violations and unstable conditions on the ground.</p>

This pivot has significantly increased Trump's personal net worth on paper, as his majority stake in TMTG is valued at nearly $2.3 billion.

          <p>The Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has released declassified documents claiming the Obama administration "manufactured and politicized intelligence" regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election. The release is part of a Trump administration initiative to re-examine the intelligence community's conclusions. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have dismissed the claims as "utter nonsense" and a politically motivated effort to amplify conspiracy theories. The newly released files do not appear to contradict the core 2017 assessment that Russia used influence campaigns, such as disinformation and hacking, to interfere in the election, rather than directly altering vote counts.</p>

This unusual move highlights the increasingly toxic nature of online fan discourse and the growing pressure on productions to protect their talent from online abuse.
