          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace successfully debuted on the Nasdaq, pricing its shares at $45, which was above the anticipated range. The Initial Public Offering raised $868 million, resulting in a company valuation of approximately $6.3 billion, reflecting strong investor interest in the space technology sector. This development comes after Firefly secured a major NASA contract and achieved a successful lunar landing earlier in the year. Despite reporting a net loss, the company's revenue has grown substantially, and it holds a backlog of projects valued at over $1.1 billion.</p>

Cornyn labeled the Democrats' actions as an irresponsible stunt that halts essential legislative work, including flood relief efforts. The new congressional map could significantly shift power in the U.S. House by adding several Republican seats. Governor Greg Abbott has also ordered state authorities to find and arrest the legislators, reinforcing the high-stakes political confrontation.</p>

          <p>Rushanara Ali, the UK's homelessness minister, is under pressure to resign following accusations of hypocrisy for significantly increasing the rent on a property she owns. Reports indicate that shortly after the previous tenants' lease ended, the property was relisted with a rent increase of £700 per month. Critics, including the Conservative Party chairman and housing advocates, have condemned the action as a conflict of interest, contrasting it with her public statements on protecting tenants. Ali's spokesperson maintains that she acted in full compliance with all legal requirements.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Nostalgia for Mid-Century Economy Drives Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 10:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that President Trump's sweeping tariff agenda is driven less by a strategic economic development plan and more by a nostalgic desire to restore the manufacturing-heavy economy of the 1950s and 60s. The article suggests that rather than fostering high-value industries, the broad tariffs on all goods aim to reverse deindustrialization, a trend linked to social changes that some conservatives lament. However, the author contends that this goal is an economic fantasy, as automation and shifts in consumer spending make a return to that era impossible without incurring immense costs and potentially harming more advanced sectors of the U.S. economy.

          <p>President Trump has announced broad tariffs on foreign goods, including a minimum of 10% on most imports and higher rates for specific countries like China. This article explains that tariffs are taxes on imported products, which typically lead to higher prices for consumers on both foreign and domestic goods. While proponents argue tariffs can protect domestic industries and generate revenue, economists warn these specific proposals are so broad and high they could backfire. The policy may increase costs for U.S. manufacturers, reduce consumer spending power, and invite retaliatory tariffs from other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

This alliance demonstrates the UAE's independent foreign policy, balancing its relationships with the U.S., China, and Russia.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force conducted a high-risk rescue operation to evacuate three people requiring medical care from the U.S. McMurdo Station in Antarctica.

Crews used night vision goggles to land a C-130J Hercules on a runway manually prepared on the ice by the station's team. U.S. officials praised the New Zealand crew's courage and professionalism, calling the nearly 20-hour operation "nothing short of heroic."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a large trade deficit that is significantly inflated by the country's gold refining industry. Although gold is currently exempt, its multi-billion dollar value in trade statistics is the primary reason for the high tariff rate, which Swiss officials argue is a misrepresentation since they only earn small processing fees. The levy threatens to make other Swiss exports, like watches and pharmaceuticals, uncompetitive in the U.S. market, potentially cutting Swiss GDP and prompting calls for continued negotiations to lower the punitive rate.

          <p>Experts and advocates are raising alarms over a new executive order from President Trump that directs local governments to crack down on homelessness, potentially criminalizing it. The order targets public camping and substance use and promotes shifting unhoused individuals into long-term institutional settings, a move critics call terrifying and harmful. The vaguely worded order could be interpreted broadly to detain people, stripping away judicial checks and balances. Critics also point out that the policy is coupled with budget cuts to affordable housing and supportive services, which addresses symptoms rather than the root causes of homelessness.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining migrants who crossed the English Channel under a new pilot deportation agreement with France. The "one in, one out" scheme, which came into effect Wednesday, allows the UK to return a migrant to France in exchange for accepting an asylum seeker who has not attempted an illegal crossing. On the first day, 155 migrants arrived in the UK, with an unspecified number being taken to immigration removal centers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the first returns could happen within weeks, affirming the government's commitment to securing the nation's borders.</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a critical factor in affordability. As of August 7, 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.75%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.99%. Refinance rates are slightly higher. The article suggests that while rates are elevated compared to recent years, there are ways for borrowers to secure better terms, such as strengthening their credit profile and shopping around with different lenders. A potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could also bring some relief to borrowers in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire in the Aude region of southern France has burned over 17,000 hectares, making it the country's largest blaze in over 75 years and described as a "catastrophe on an unprecedented scale." The fire, which started Tuesday, has resulted in one death, multiple injuries, and the evacuation of around 1,000 people. Over 2,000 firefighters are battling the flames, but efforts are hampered by drought, high temperatures, and strong winds. Prime Minister Francois Bayrou linked the disaster to global warming, as the region has seen an increase in fire frequency in recent years.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, convicted for sex trafficking for Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved to a minimum-security prison camp, sparking speculation about her potential cooperation with authorities. The transfer occurred just a week after she met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously defended Donald Trump. The timing is notable given the political turmoil surrounding the release of Epstein's investigative files. Defense attorneys suggest the move to a more favorable facility indicates she may have provided credible and helpful information to the Justice Department, possibly foreshadowing further benefits like a reduced sentence.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is reportedly set to visit China at the end of August for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking his first trip to the country in seven years. This potential visit signifies a continued thaw in relations between the two Asian powers, which had deteriorated after a deadly border clash in 2020. The diplomatic engagement comes as India's relationship with the United States faces strain over trade tensions, including recently announced tariffs. The meeting could pave the way for Modi's first face-to-face talks with President Xi Jinping in nearly a year.</p>

This initiative, a collaboration between the Getty and the city's Office of Historic Resources, aims to protect and memorialize the city's Black heritage. The Bradley home in Leimert Park is significant as they were the first Black family to move into the segregated neighborhood in 1950. Other newly designated landmarks include the California Eagle newspaper building, Jewel’s Catch One nightclub, and Stylesville Barbershop, each representing a crucial piece of L.A.'s cultural history.</p>
