          <p>A group of international food experts recently toured Higashikagawa and Miki to delve into the food culture of Kagawa Prefecture. The chefs participated in local traditions, including visits to a soy sauce brewery and a tea ceremony. The tour was organized in conjunction with a national conference for promoting food education in Tokushima. Participants praised the simple cooking methods and the rich flavor of the tea, comparing it to a cappuccino; additionally, the musical performance featured elegant sounds of wind instruments reverberating through the historic tea room.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany may need to raise taxes and increase debt to meet NATO's proposed 5% defense spending target. While Germany currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defense, reaching the new target would require substantial additional funding. Experts suggest that financing these expenses will likely involve loans, potentially leading to budgetary conflicts and funding cuts in other areas. The country's recent fiscal U-turn, which exempts certain defense expenditures from debt limits, provides short-term flexibility, but long-term sustainability remains a concern due to higher interest costs and potential conflicts with EU fiscal rules.

The timeline details the initial missing person report, the discovery of Bernstein's body in a shallow grave, and the subsequent arrest of Sam Woodward, a high school classmate. Woodward was eventually charged with murder and a hate crime enhancement, with prosecutors arguing that he killed Bernstein because he was gay. The article concludes with Woodward's conviction and sentencing to life in prison without the possibility of parole, as well as the legacy of Bernstein's parents starting a movement called "BlazeItForward" which inspires acts of kindness.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. Prices had initially surged following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but the lack of casualties led investors to believe the conflict would de-escalate. President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, which allowed for preventative measures to be taken and no lives were lost. The market sell-off indicates a belief that Trump's actions have successfully de-escalated the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has become increasingly reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar, which accounted for about 57% of China's total rare earth imports last year. Myanmar's deposits are particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are less abundant and more valuable. China's reliance on Myanmar has opened it up to supply chain risks, especially given the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. Imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year, highlighting the vulnerability of this supply chain.</p>

          <p>More than 100 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about the plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments, which aim to save £5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment cites concerns about the number of people the plans are expected to push into poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on health and jobs. The vote on the government's bill is currently due to take place on July 1.</p>

          <p>Florida is constructing a migrant detention center, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' on an air strip in the Everglades to temporarily hold migrants. The facility is intended to support mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens, with the location chosen to deter escapees due to the surrounding environment. The plan has drawn criticism from lawmakers and environmental groups, who argue that it could be environmentally devastating. The facility will cost approximately $450 million a year to operate and is expected to hold around 1,000 people.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the 2001 'Roadless Rule,' which protected 58.5 million acres of national forestland from road construction and timber harvesting. The USDA argues that the rule is outdated and overly restrictive, hindering forest management for fire risk and timber production. Environmental groups have denounced the decision, arguing that it threatens wildlife habitats, drinking water sources, and recreational opportunities. Opponents also dispute the claim that eliminating the rule will reduce fire risk.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume quick deportations of certain immigrants without advance warning, reversing a lower court injunction. The ruling allows the administration to deport immigrants to countries other than their own, even if they face potential torture or death. Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision as a gross abuse of the Court's discretion. The ruling has sparked strong reactions, with a Homeland Security official praising it as a victory for American safety and security.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential success of President Trump's strategy in the Middle East, following a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. Trump announced the ceasefire after U.S. airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities, a move that initially heightened tensions. The article suggests that Trump's gamble of inserting the U.S. into the conflict may have paid off, at least temporarily, by leading to a de-escalation of the situation. The agreement could mark a significant step back from the brink of a wider conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers have overwhelmingly congratulated President Trump, highlighting his negotiating skills. Democrats, however, appear to be withholding their congratulations, with some expressing concerns about the legality and constitutionality of Trump's actions. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stated that Trump's admission of unilaterally bringing the United States into a war without congressional approval is a grave matter.

          <p>The US Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden areas. This decision puts a pause on a ruling by a Boston-based federal judge who stated that immigrants deserved a "meaningful opportunity" to bring claims that they would face the risk of torture, persecution or even death if removed to certain countries that have agreed to take people deported from the US. The court ruling was handed down as Donald Trump claimed Israel and Iran had agreed to a “Complete and Total CEASEFIRE” and that in the future the conflict would be known as the “THE 12 DAY WAR”.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have rested their case in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs. The 55-year-old music mogul is accused of using his power to facilitate sex trafficking and conceal his crimes, and has admitted to domestic violence but pleaded not guilty to the charges. Witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, testified about alleged abuse and coercion. Legal experts say the testimony has helped prosecutors present a compelling case, but a conviction on all counts remains uncertain.</p>
