          <p>Following his victory over Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., Jake Paul posted an American flag emoji on social media, which has been interpreted as a troll against his opponent. The post came after news broke that Chavez Jr. was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for overstaying his visa. Chavez Jr. faces expedited removal due to a prior weapons conviction and an active arrest warrant in Mexico for alleged cartel involvement. Paul's win earned him an official WBA cruiserweight ranking, making him eligible for a championship fight.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photos of China's J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the advanced aircraft will be publicly unveiled at an upcoming military parade. The images reveal modified engine air intakes, known as diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI), which are optimized for the new, more powerful WS-15 engines. These design changes are expected to enhance the fighter's stealth capabilities and aerodynamic performance. The parade is set to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, an event where China often showcases its latest military hardware.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he was "very disappointed" after a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, indicating that no progress was made toward ending the war in Ukraine. The call occurred shortly after the White House announced a halt on some weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision attributed to concerns over dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. Trump described the conversation as lengthy, also touching upon Iran, but expressed his unhappiness with the ongoing conflict. The Kremlin confirmed the call, and Trump is scheduled to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy next.</p>

          <p>A significant power outage struck the Czech Republic, leaving large areas of the country, including the capital Prague, without electricity. The national grid operator, CEPS, confirmed the widespread failure, which was later attributed to a fallen power line. The blackout caused substantial disruption, halting train services in five of the nation's fourteen districts. Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the event as an "extraordinary and unpleasant" situation, though the operator reported that power was restored to most affected areas shortly after the incident.</p>

          <p>This historical essay argues that the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, was instrumental in building the foundations of American national identity during the Revolutionary War. Before the war, the colonies lacked unity, viewing each other as competitors. The shared experience of military service, suffering, and sacrifice fostered a common bond among soldiers from different states, creating traditions like celebrating Washington's birthday and adopting a unifying flag. After the war, veterans continued this nation-building project, advocating for a strong central government to preserve the republic they fought to establish.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the enduring relevance of Virginia Woolf's 1928 work, "A Room of One's Own," from the perspective of a working-class Latina writer who initially dismissed it as exclusionary. The author describes overcoming her initial prejudice to find deep resonance in Woolf's arguments about the necessity of financial independence and personal space for women's creative expression. The article connects Woolf's ideas to modern-day issues like the gender pay gap and the undervaluing of women's stories, while also acknowledging the limitations of Woolf's upper-class perspective and suggesting the added modern constraint of time for women.</p>

          <p>A recently passed federal spending bill, championed by President Trump, includes over $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, raising alarms about the future of healthcare for millions of low-income and rural Americans. Experts warn these cuts could force states, particularly those with "trigger laws" like North Carolina, to end their Medicaid expansion programs. This would result in a significant loss of health insurance coverage, potentially leading to the closure of rural hospitals that are already financially strained. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 17 million people could lose their health insurance by 2034 due to the bill's provisions.</p>

          <p>A new, first-of-its-kind study reveals that sewage sludge and wastewater treatment plants are major sources of PFAS, or "forever chemical," contamination in U.S. rivers. Researchers tested water upstream and downstream from 32 sites across the country, finding significantly higher PFAS levels downstream in 95% of cases. The practice of spreading sludge, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, as agricultural fertilizer is identified as a key pathway for re-polluting water systems and potentially the food supply.

This cultural shift, driven by streaming services and playlists for every activity, has created an environment where machine-made music can thrive because it is designed to be inoffensive and atmospheric.

          <p>In the early 1990s, The Walt Disney Company, under CEO Michael Eisner, planned an ambitious and controversial theme park in Virginia called "Disney's America." The park aimed to portray U.S. history, including its most painful aspects like slavery and the Civil War, with one executive stating they wanted to make visitors "feel what it was like to be a slave." The proposal ignited a culture war, drawing fierce opposition from historians, preservationists, and environmentalists concerned about historical accuracy and the park's proximity to the Manassas battlefield. After intense public backlash and political debate, Disney ultimately abandoned the project in 1994.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, was subjected to an intense and record-breaking overnight aerial assault by Russia, involving a reported 550 drones and 11 missiles. The attack, which injured 23 people, damaged infrastructure and buildings across the city and came just hours after a call between President Trump and President Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the strike as cynical and demonstrative of Russia's lack of intent to end the war. The Kremlin stated its military operation will continue until its objectives are met, spurning Trump's calls for a truce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade pact with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. This move is seen as a direct effort to combat the practice of Chinese manufacturers rerouting goods through Vietnam to evade hefty U.S. tariffs. However, economists and analysts question the feasibility of enforcing the transshipment levy, as it will be difficult to define and track the origin of components. The deal signals the U.S. administration's strategy of using trade negotiations with third countries to pressure China. (not investment advice)</p>

The man was detected near the Military Demarcation Line, prompting a 20-hour surveillance and guidance operation to safely secure him. The mission was complex due to dense vegetation and landmine risks in the area. This type of defection across the land border is relatively rare, as most North Koreans escape through China.

While official attendance averaged a solid 35,000 per game, stadiums were on average only 51% full, with many empty seats visible. Weekday and evening kick-off times correlated with lower turnouts. Furthermore, many games were played in hazardous heat, with an average heat index of 85°F (30°C) and some venues experiencing oppressive humidity. On the field, South American teams from CONMEBOL showed strong performances, challenging European dominance.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed dozens of 300,000-year-old wooden artifacts at the Gantangqing site in southwest China, providing the first strong evidence of a sophisticated wood-based tool culture in ancient East Asia. Published in the journal Science, the discovery helps fill a significant gap in the archaeological record, as wood decomposes easily and rarely survives. The finding challenges previous understandings of early human technological development in the region, which was thought to be dominated by stone tools. This world-class discovery suggests that a distinct "Wood Age" may have existed alongside the Stone Age in this part of the world.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Trump administration is engaging in systematic extortion, citing the recent $16 million payment by Paramount to settle a lawsuit from President Trump as a prime example. The author contends the lawsuit against CBS was frivolous and that Paramount paid to ensure its pending merger receives approval from the Trump-appointed FCC. The piece describes this as part of a pattern of shakedowns against corporations and media companies, where legal and regulatory threats are used to extract payments. The author concludes that these actions amount to governing by "mafia methods," undermining the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright orange glow and a loud bang reported by dozens of residents in the Scottish Highlands. Security cameras captured the event as the object streaked across the sky. UKMON has calculated a potential impact zone and is appealing to hillwalkers to look for the meteorites, though they acknowledge the search will be difficult in the vast, mountainous terrain.</p>
