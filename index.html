            <p>China has increased tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% in response to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products, impacting a wide range of U.S. exports including oilseeds, grains, and oil and gas. This action is part of an escalating trade war between the two countries, with Trump also raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%. The tariffs could significantly affect U.S. producers by making their goods more expensive in China, potentially reducing exports and impacting American jobs, especially in agriculture. The trade dispute highlights the complex economic relationship between the U.S. and China and the potential for significant economic disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Talks aimed at saving steel production in Scunthorpe are deadlocked over who will pay for the raw materials needed to keep the blast furnaces going. British Steel's Chinese owner Jingye say the furnaces are "no longer financially sustainable" and they are unwilling to purchase new raw materials. The government has not ruled out nationalising British Steel, which employs 2,700 people, saying all options remain on the table. One of Scunthorpe's blast furnaces is set to be temporarily shut down next week, in order to buy more time before the raw materials needed to keep the steelworks going run out.</p>

            <p>China is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84% in response to President Trump's import duties on Chinese goods. China's announcement signals Beijing's refusal to back down in the global trade war. In an April 9 statement, China called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a "mistake upon a mistake." Separately, the European Union announced its own retaliatory measures against the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press reporters and photographers from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other controlled spaces. The ruling comes after the AP sued to regain access after it was curtailed for not adopting Trump's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. The judge stated that the White House's actions were "contrary to the First Amendment" of the U.S. Constitution. The ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation.</p>

            <p>A new study has found a potential link between certain clusters of additives in ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study identified two clusters of additives commonly found in creamy dairy desserts, sugary drinks, and artificially sweetened beverages that were associated with a modest increase in diabetes risk. Researchers are calling for more research and new policies to regulate the marketing of ultra-processed foods, especially to children. The study highlights the need for consumers to be aware of the potential health risks associated with ultra-processed foods and to make informed dietary choices.</p>
