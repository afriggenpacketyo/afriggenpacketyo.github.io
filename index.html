          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 12:19:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study has found that genetic factors may play a greater role in depression for women, potentially explaining why they are diagnosed nearly twice as often as men. Researchers identified approximately 13,000 genetic variations linked to depression, with about 6,000 being unique to women. These female-specific genes also showed a stronger overlap with metabolic traits, which could account for symptoms like weight and energy changes. The findings highlight the importance of considering sex in health research and could lead to more tailored treatments for depression in women.</p>

          <p>The trial of Maja T., a German national accused of attacking suspected right-wing extremists in Budapest, is proceeding despite a German court's ruling that raised doubts about humane detention conditions in Hungary. Legal experts and Maja T.'s family fear a politicized trial, especially after Prime Minister Viktor Orban labeled the anti-fascist movement a terrorist organization. The case is contrasted with that of Ilaria Salis, an Italian MEP accused in the same incident, whose parliamentary immunity was upheld, highlighting broader concerns about the rule of law and political influence within Hungary's justice system.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, Senator Chris Murphy expressed relief over the Gaza ceasefire and hostage release but heavily criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for delaying the deal for political reasons. Shifting to domestic issues, Murphy blamed Republicans for the ongoing government shutdown, accusing them of boycotting negotiations to protect tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of rising healthcare premiums for American families. He argued that the shutdown is an emergency that Democrats must address to prevent financial disaster for middle-class citizens.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has responded defiantly to President Trump's threat of 100% tariffs, stating that while it does not want a trade war, it is not afraid of one. The ministry defended its new export controls on rare earth minerals as legitimate and accused the U.S. of employing a "double standard" by abusing its own export control measures for national security reasons. This escalation in rhetoric follows a series of high-level trade negotiations and has shaken U.S. stock markets, casting uncertainty over a potential meeting between the two nations' leaders.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance sharply criticized Democrats for the ongoing government shutdown, labeling their negotiation posture as "hostage-taking" over a healthcare policy dispute. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Vance asserted that the White House will not negotiate until Democrats agree to reopen the government, placing the blame squarely on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and what he termed "far-left Democrats." The stalemate continues into its twelfth day, with both parties trading blame and no clear path to a resolution in sight.</p>

An army unit known as CAPSAT, which was instrumental in Rajoelina's own rise to power in 2009, has claimed control of the military command. The unrest began with youth-led demonstrations against utility cuts but has grown into a wider movement against corruption and the high cost of living. The situation remains tense as protesters have gathered in the capital's main square, supported by the defecting army unit.</p>

While agents have legal authority to operate within 100 miles of any U.S. border, their expanded role is seen as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation plan, leading to worries about potential constitutional violations and a lack of accountability.</p>

          <p>Brooke Cooper, 33, has been named the general manager of the Worcester Red Sox, making her the first woman to hold that position in the history of the Boston Red Sox franchise.

          <p>Stephanie Rogers, a microbiologist with the FDA for 16 years, is one of hundreds of thousands of federal workers facing financial uncertainty due to the government shutdown. To prepare, she moved in with her mother, scheduled medical appointments early, and made a withdrawal from her retirement fund, which will have tax consequences. The current shutdown feels different and more stressful than previous ones due to threats of denied backpay and mass firings. Rogers expresses deep anxiety about her family's future, highlighting the personal toll the political stalemate is taking on government employees.</p>

          <p>During a rare press conference in Delhi attended by female journalists, the Taliban's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, was questioned about his government's ban on education and work for Afghan girls and women. Muttaqi claimed the ban is not a religious prohibition but has been "postponed" by order of the supreme leader, a statement journalists were not allowed to challenge. This event followed an earlier press conference from which women were excluded, an act Muttaqi dismissed as a "technical issue." Afghanistan remains the only country where the government has systematically stripped women of their basic rights.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues Bari Weiss's Appointment at CBS News is the Result of a 50-Year Conservative Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 09:00:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that the appointment of conservative commentator Bari Weiss to a leadership role at CBS News is not a sudden development but the culmination of a five-decade strategy to reshape American media. The author traces this plan back to the 1971 Powell Memo, which urged corporations to actively influence media coverage to be more pro-business and less critical of power structures. The piece argues that subsequent media deregulation, corporate consolidation, and pressure on newsrooms have paved the way for figures like Weiss to gain control, ultimately aiming to transform journalism from an adversary of power into its champion.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that President Trump is considering all his options, including potentially invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow for the domestic deployment of the U.S. military for law enforcement. In a "Meet the Press" interview, Vance said the president has not yet felt it necessary but pointed to what he described as attacks on law enforcement as a key problem. The comments come as the administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to cities like Chicago and Portland have been blocked by courts, raising alarm among critics about federal overreach.</p>
