        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers of the Notting Hill Carnival are warning that the event's future is at risk without "urgent funding" from the government. A leaked letter from Carnival chair Ian Comfort to Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy requests financial support to address "critical public safety concerns" identified in a review of the festival. The review, commissioned by the organizers and funded by the Greater London Authority and local councils, highlighted the need for increased investment in stewarding and crowd management to allow police to focus on crime prevention and public protection. Failure to secure immediate funding could compromise public safety and jeopardize the carnival's future, according to Comfort. </p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly planning to release a folding iPhone as early as next year, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The device is expected to feature a display manufactured by Samsung Display, which is preparing to produce millions of foldable panels for Apple. While other components, such as the hinge, are still being finalized, Kuo anticipates that the folding iPhone will be priced as a premium product. Apple's iPhone remains a significant revenue source for the company, and the company is continuously exploring new avenues to attract customers and encourage upgrades to more expensive devices.</p>

          <p>Karen Read has been found not guilty of second-degree murder but guilty of drunk driving in the death of John O'Keefe. The retrial took place in the same courtroom with the same judge, but with a different atmosphere due to the mishandling of the case by law enforcement in the initial investigation. Special prosecutor Hank Brennan had the advantage of knowing the defense's arguments in advance, but had to overcome the shadow of the fired state trooper Michael Proctor, whose conduct was heavily criticized. The defense focused on inconsistencies in witness testimonies and suggested an alternative suspect from the close-knit Canton community.</p>

          <p>Generative AI is becoming increasingly prevalent in various online services, but its inherent flaws are creating a less reliable web experience. Despite advancements, generative AI tools continue to produce subtle errors, such as incorrect dates and fabricated information, which are now appearing in search results and social media feeds. The deployment of AI-powered chatbots as fixes to the old web's failings is exacerbating existing problems while introducing new malfunctions. The article argues that Silicon Valley's push to rewire the web and other sectors with AI is magnifying the impact of these flaws, resulting in a less dependable internet.</p>

          <p>A regulation mandating two-person crews on freight trains, defended by the Department of Transportation based on "common sense" rather than data, exemplifies a concerning trend of emotion-based regulation. This approach allows agencies to bypass the need for evidence-based policymaking and cost-benefit analyses, potentially hindering innovation and increasing costs. The author argues that safety regulations should be grounded in real evidence rather than intuition, as emotion-based rules can lead to unintended consequences and stifle economic growth. The case raises concerns about federal rulemaking abandoning core principles and shifting control to bureaucrats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has implemented new guidelines for VA hospitals that eliminate explicit prohibitions against discriminating against patients based on their political beliefs or marital status. These changes, influenced by an executive order from Donald Trump, raise concerns about potential discrimination against veterans, particularly women and LGBTQ+ individuals. Medical experts have criticized the move, arguing that it could allow healthcare professionals to decline care based on personal characteristics not protected by federal law. The VA maintains that all eligible veterans will continue to receive care, but the changes have sparked controversy and fears of political influence in healthcare decisions.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent support for Israel's escalating attacks on Iran suggests a potential shift away from his long-held anti-war stance. Throughout his political career, Trump has presented himself as a peace candidate, promising to end U.S. involvement in overseas conflicts. However, his current rhetoric and actions indicate a possible betrayal of his anti-war mandate, raising concerns about the U.S. becoming entangled in another Middle Eastern conflict. The article argues that involving the country in a new war would undermine Trump's domestic agenda and disregard the American public's desire for peace.</p>

Classic navy walls are also highly sought after in bedrooms, while dark gray is preferred for living rooms.

The Fed's economic projections point to continued stagflationary pressures, with participants forecasting GDP growth of 1.4% and inflation hitting 3% in 2025.

Warning signs include making only minimum payments, borrowing from one card to pay another, and facing calls or lawsuits from debt collectors. Bankruptcy can offer powerful protections, but it also carries long-term consequences, so it's essential to explore alternatives like debt settlement, debt management plans, or debt consolidation loans.

          <p>Nike is pushing back the launch of its activewear line with Kim Kardashian's Skims brand due to production delays. The launch, originally scheduled for the spring, will now occur later this year. The delays are reportedly internal and unrelated to supplier or shipping issues. Both Nike and Skims remain committed to the collaboration and want to ensure the products are properly produced.</p>

          <h2>Time to Pay Off Credit Card Debt With and Without Help</h2>

          <p>Paying off credit card debt can take varying amounts of time, depending on the strategy used and whether one tackles it alone or seeks assistance. Making minimum payments on an $8,000 balance with a 22% APR could take over 30 years and cost nearly $40,000 in interest. Debt consolidation loans, balance transfers, debt management plans, and debt settlement are options that can expedite the process and reduce interest payments. Bankruptcy can offer a quick way to eliminate debt but carries long-term consequences.</p>
