          <p>Heat health alerts have been issued across most of England as the nation prepares for a second major heatwave, with temperatures predicted to climb into the 30s over the weekend and potentially hit 34C on Monday. An amber alert, affecting regions including London and the south-east, warns that the heat could impact the entire population and various health services. This intense weather coincides with major events like the Glastonbury Festival and the start of Wimbledon, raising concerns about public health and safety. The event is consistent with scientific models showing that climate change is making heatwaves more frequent and intense.</p>

          <p>A Haaretz newspaper report, quoting anonymous Israeli soldiers, has alleged that commanders ordered troops to fire on unarmed Palestinian civilians approaching food distribution sites in Gaza. The report claims this has created a "killing field," a charge that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Defense Minister vehemently denied, calling it a "blood libel." Gaza's Health Ministry reports over 500 deaths near aid sites in the past month. Aid organizations like Doctors Without Borders have condemned the current aid distribution system as a "slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid" and called for its immediate dismantlement.</p>

          <p>In a historic reversal of its post-World War II military posture, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending to build what it intends to be Europe's strongest armed force. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and war on the continent, the German government will raise its defense budget to 3.5% of GDP, a move requiring a constitutional change to its 'debt brake.' This significant policy shift is being financed by a special fund of over $100 billion, signaling a profound change in the nation's strategic and cultural approach to military power.</p>

          <p>Despite Kentucky being one of Donald Trump's strongest states, it has become a surprising center of Republican resistance to the president, led by figures like Senator Mitch McConnell, Senator Rand Paul, and Representative Thomas Massie. These influential lawmakers have opposed Trump on major issues including war powers, tariffs, and deficit spending, drawing the ire of the president and his staunchest supporters. This dynamic has created a rift within the state's GOP, where many voters feel unrepresented by their own leaders. The conflict is expected to come to a head in the primary challenge being mounted against Massie.</p>

Novo Nordisk terminated its agreement, accusing Hims & Hers of deceptive marketing and unsafely promoting compounded, or knockoff, versions of its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy. Hims & Hers retorted that Novo Nordisk was engaging in anti-competitive practices to control the market.

          <p>This theater review critiques Jake Brasch's new play, "The Reservoir," currently at the Geffen Playhouse, for its reliance on familiar tropes of family dysfunction and addiction. The story follows Josh, a theater student in recovery, whose journey is framed by the comedic and eccentric interjections of his four grandparents. While the play aims for uniqueness by integrating the grandparents into the staging, the reviewer finds the dialogue and characters fall into predictable sitcom-like patterns and shtick. Despite some strong performances, the production is described as visually monotonous and emotionally shallow, failing to delve deeply into its harrowing subject matter.</p>

          <p>In a significant local political rebuke, voters in traditionally conservative Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries from a MAGA-aligned city council. The measures reversed a council decision to create a parent review board for children's books and barred the privatization of the library system. This victory for the 'Protect HB' coalition is presented as a case study in how a nonpartisan, grassroots movement can successfully push back against political overreach, even in a conservative stronghold, by focusing on shared community values and mobilizing a diverse group of concerned citizens.</p>

The case haunted his defense attorney, Johnnie Cochran, who believed in his innocence and fought for decades to overturn the conviction. It was later revealed that the prosecution's star witness was a secret FBI informant and that authorities had hidden evidence that could have exonerated Pratt. His conviction was finally overturned in 1997, exposing a deep-seated story of official corruption and the government's efforts to neutralize political dissidents.</p>

          <p>California's legal challenge against President Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles is centered on the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, a law with origins in the turbulent Reconstruction era. The statute generally forbids the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, and a federal judge has now ordered the government to provide evidence about the troops' actions to see if they violate it. This legal battle revives a law with a complex and ignoble history, originally used to end federal protection for Black voters in the South, and raises critical questions about the limits of presidential power.</p>

The piece asserts that progress for queer people has never come from a monolithic group of heteronormative men, and that this diversity is what makes the movement worthy of pride.</p>

The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring comes as their loan agreement was set to expire. The Wakayama zoo, which has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors. This move is part of China's broader "panda diplomacy," with Japan's last two pandas at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo also scheduled for return.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden vehicle rammed into a military convoy in Pakistan's North Waziristan district, killing at least 16 soldiers and injuring 29 others, including civilians. The blast was powerful enough to cause the roofs of two nearby houses to collapse. A suicide bomber wing affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack. The incident is part of a significant increase in violence in the Pakistani regions bordering Afghanistan since the Taliban's return to power in Kabul in 2021.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the Iran-Israel conflict, arguing that it was a rare moment of perceived authenticity from a world leader. The author suggests that while swearing doesn't equate to honesty, the public's distrust of polished, scripted political speech makes such unvarnished moments resonate. The article posits that in an era of spin, a well-placed, genuine curse can cut through the noise and convey a level of frustration that sanitized diplomatic language cannot, potentially making politicians seem more human and relatable to the public.</p>

          <p>This year's Fourth of July celebrations may be impacted by President Trump's trade policies, as tariffs on Chinese goods are expected to cause price hikes and potential shortages of fireworks. The U.S. relies on China for nearly all of its consumer and professional pyrotechnics, which are now subject to steep import taxes that were not in place during Trump's first term. Fireworks importers are facing significant price volatility and are encouraging consumers to shop early, with concerns that the tariffs could dampen the nation's upcoming 250th birthday celebrations in 2026.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani continued his remarkable season, hitting his National League-leading 29th home run in a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Ohtani's powerful performance included a leadoff homer and a crucial game-tying RBI triple in the fifth inning, after which he scored the winning run. This effort helped extend the Dodgers' winning streak to five games. The two-way phenom's strong night at the plate came just before he was scheduled to take the mound for his next pitching start against the same team.</p>

          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway, has been officially charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm after a ten-month police investigation. Authorities have indicated that the case involves a "double-digit" number of alleged victims. Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title or perform public duties, has previously admitted to acts of violence while under the influence of drugs and alcohol but, through his lawyer, denies wrongdoing in most of the current cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse.</p>
