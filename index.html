          <p>A massive explosion at the Shahid Rajaee commercial port in Bandar Abbas, Iran, resulted in at least 18 fatalities and 800 injuries, causing widespread damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, triggered a large fire that spread across multiple containers, leading to the closure of schools and offices in the region. Initial reports suggest the fire originated in a hazmat and chemical materials storage depot, although some sources speculate it may have involved solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles. Iranian authorities are investigating the exact cause of the incident, which has heightened security concerns in the area. Optimism score is 10, due to the large loss of life and the unknown geopolitical consequences.</p>

          <p>Chris Eubank Jr. emerged victorious against Conor Benn after a grueling 12-round fight at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, marking the culmination of a rivalry fueled by their fathers' historic feud and a recent doping scandal involving Benn.

          <p>A letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie, a survivor of the Titanic disaster, sold for a record-breaking £300,000 at auction. Written just five days before the ship sank, the letter contains a "prophetic" statement in which Gracie mentions awaiting his "journey's end" before judging the ship. The letter provides a poignant glimpse into the final days before the tragedy and offers a unique historical artifact from one of the most well-known maritime disasters. The anonymous buyer acquired the letter at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire. Optimism score is 50, due to the historical significance of the letter and its survival despite the disaster.</p>
