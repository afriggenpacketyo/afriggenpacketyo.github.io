          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has stated her intention to challenge the Labour Party in Westminster if their policies negatively impact Wales. In a speech, Morgan emphasized that she would not remain silent if the UK government makes decisions that harm Welsh communities. She specifically called for a reevaluation of winter fuel cuts, criticized plans to reduce disability benefits, and demanded that Wales benefit more from wind power revenues through the Crown Estate. This comes after the Chancellor introduced changes to personal independence payments and cuts to health-related universal credit during the Spring Statement.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the company announced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year. The high-end German retailer reported a 2% drop in revenue, adjusted for currency, totaling 999 million euros, which surpassed analysts' forecasts. Despite weaker sales in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to uncertain consumer sentiment, Hugo Boss maintained its forecast for full-year sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros, while closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and tariff discussions.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted that restricting winter fuel payments negatively impacted Labour's support in recent local elections. Streeting told the BBC that many voters expressed unhappiness with the move, which was a topic of discussion during campaigning. The government's decision to restrict the payments to those who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, aiming to save Â£1.4 billion, affected approximately 9 million pensioners. While the policy is not being formally reviewed, conversations are ongoing regarding addressing public concerns about the issue.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, Germany's conservative leader, unexpectedly failed to secure the required majority in parliament to become chancellor. Merz needed 316 votes but only received 310, a setback occurring two and a half months after the federal elections. Although his coalition with the center-left holds enough seats, 18 MPs who were expected to support him dissented. The Bundestag will have 14 days to elect Merz or another candidate, with no limit to the number of votes, and this failure is seen as a humiliation.</p>

          <p>A report reveals that a week into Donald Trump's second term, the U.S. military issued an order to halt 11 flights carrying artillery shells and weaponry to Ukraine, causing confusion among top national security officials. The verbal order originated from the office of then Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, without the knowledge of President Trump or other key officials. The cancelations, which cost TRANSCOM $2.2 million, were swiftly reversed. The incident highlights a haphazard policy-making process and unclear command structure within the Trump administration, contributing to internal disagreements on foreign policy at the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>The acquisition of Deliveroo by DoorDash for Â£2.9 billion underscores the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets and the increasing trend of companies shunning the London Stock Exchange for US listings. DoorDash's higher valuation and greater access to capital enabled the takeover, while Deliveroo's share value declined since its IPO. This situation reflects a broader problem where UK companies face lower valuations and less investor appetite compared to their US counterparts, driven by factors such as financial regulation and pension fund investment strategies. While the UK government is attempting reforms to make listing more attractive, the DoorDash swoop highlights the financial firepower available to companies listed in the US.</p>

The Home Office plans, which were initially reported in The Times, aim to make it more difficult for individuals from countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka to come to the UK for work and study. Ministers believe there is a specific issue with those who legally enter the UK on work or study visas and then file for asylum.

It asserts that Trump's behavior is consistent with a desire to wield power without limits and urges Republican leaders to forcefully reject any notion of him serving beyond his current term, emphasizing that the 22nd Amendment clearly prohibits it.</p>

Harris' recent public appearance, her first in five months, has sparked renewed discussion, but Peek contends that Harris offers no significant change from the perceived failures of the Biden administration. With no visible leadership and a platform largely based on opposition to Donald Trump, the Democratic Party faces a message and leadership vacuum.

However, spending per capita showed signs of stagnation, indicating a potential consumption downgrade.

Critics argue that FGA's proposals are a way to cut off aid to those who need it, while the group sees a greater opportunity for change under the Trump administration and a Kennedy-led health department. FGA's strategy involves passing legislation state by state, increasing pressure on the federal government to approve waivers for SNAP restrictions.</p>

          <p>South Korea's government investigation into human rights violations in past international adoptions has stalled, prompting criticism from adoptees and advocates who blame politicization and a lack of understanding within the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The investigation, initiated in 2022, found that adoption agencies falsified or obscured documents in numerous cases, facilitated by the government. However, commissioners are divided on whether adoptees need clear evidence of intentional falsification to be recognized as victims, leading to the suspension of the remaining cases. Adoptees express frustration that the commission is not adequately addressing the widespread document falsification and helping them trace their roots.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID deadline has finally arrived after 20 years, marked by resistance from states citing cost, privacy concerns, and the burden of providing extra documentation. The 2005 REAL ID Act aimed to establish federal standards for state-issued IDs to prevent counterfeiting and ensure information verification. However, the implementation faced numerous delays and resulted in various versions of REAL ID across states. While millions have yet to apply for REAL ID-compliant licenses, the deadline impacts air travelers, particularly those without legal status in the U.S., as state-issued licenses that do not meet federal standards will no longer be accepted at airports.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expanding the use of the military in immigration enforcement, raising questions about the legal limits imposed by the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has designated a 170-mile stretch of federal land along the southern border as a military installation, allowing federal military personnel to temporarily detain and search individuals considered trespassing. Experts express concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the level of force troops are authorized to use and the blurring lines between military and law enforcement roles. The situation is further complicated by Trump's framing of the border situation as an "invasion."</p>

          <p>Critics are warning that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is being politicized under Attorney General Pam Bondi, despite her vows to end its purported weaponization. Bondi, like President Trump, claims the DOJ was previously politicized to target Trump and conservatives. However, critics argue that Bondi is now using the department to pursue enemies of the president and do favors for his friends. The leadership team, composed of Trump's former personal defense attorneys, has fired prosecutors involved in Capitol riot cases and dropped cases against the president's political allies, leading to concerns about political interference in legal decisions.</p>

Carney, who leads the Liberal Party, won Canada's recent election amid concerns about Trump's rhetoric and trade policies. Trump has repeatedly suggested making Canada the "51st state," citing trade deficits as justification. Carney has criticized Trump's stance, accusing him of attempting to break Canada. The meeting is seen as an opportunity to reset the relationship between the two countries.</p>

With the de minimis rule closed for shipments from China, Temu and Shein face duties as high as 120%. In preparation, Temu and Shein have been accelerating localization strategies for the U.S., and have been onboarding American sellers onto their apps to protect them from tariffs. Analysts suggest that despite higher prices, Temu and Shein will remain price-competitive due to agile supply chains and existing low prices.</p>

Critics argue that the tariffs could disrupt globalized production processes, harm consumers, and ultimately damage the industry they are intended to help.
