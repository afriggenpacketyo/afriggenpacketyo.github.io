          <p>Apple has removed applications from its App Store that allowed users to anonymously report sightings of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This decision followed pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi and amidst controversy surrounding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement. The company stated its App Store is for safe discovery, citing law enforcement concerns about safety risks to ICE agents. Critics of the apps argued they endangered officers, while the developer maintained they were for immigrant protection.</p>

          <p>Several former aides and allies of Rudy Giuliani have publicly endorsed Andrew Cuomo for New York City mayor, rather than the Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Figures like Joe Lhota, Giuliani's former deputy mayor, and Anthony Carbonetti, a former chief of staff, cited Cuomo's proven management and expressed concerns about a "socialist" mayor. They believe Sliwa has no viable path to victory and risks splitting the vote. This move highlights internal GOP divisions and a pragmatic shift towards a more experienced candidate in a competitive race.</p>

          <p>A car-ramming and stabbing attack at a synagogue in Manchester, England, on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, resulted in two deaths and three serious injuries. Police are treating the incident as a terror attack and identified the suspect, Jihad Al-Shamie, 35, a British citizen of Syrian descent, who was shot dead at the scene. Worshippers and security staff demonstrated bravery, preventing the attacker from entering the building. The community is in shock, with national leaders condemning the horrific act.</p>

          <p>Opie, a corgi shepherd mix, vanished from his Northern California home during a storm in July and was miraculously found two months later in Illinois, over 2,000 miles away. The cross-country journey remains a mystery, though his owner suspects he was taken by someone. A microchip allowed animal services in Illinois to identify and contact Opie's owner, who promptly traveled to reunite with her beloved pet. This heartwarming story underscores the importance of microchipping pets and keeping their registration current.</p>

He condemned the "vile individual" responsible for the attack on Yom Kippur, expressing condolences to victims and thanking first responders. Starmer promised a more visible police presence and highlighted the need to combat rising hatred against Jews.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin warning of escalating, pre-planned violent attacks against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and facilities by "domestic violent extremists." The memo cites incidents like a Dallas ICE facility shooting and an attack on the Prairieland Detention Center, noting an evolution in tactics from property damage to targeted violence. The Trump administration attributes this surge to rising immigration enforcement and has vowed to crack down on threats, deploying additional personnel and investigating "domestic terrorism."</p>

          <p>A rapid attribution study warns that climate change significantly exacerbated the damage caused by Super Typhoon Ragasa, particularly in South China. Researchers estimate that the likelihood of an event like Ragasa was 49% higher compared to pre-industrial times, and approximately 36% of the resulting damage can be attributed to climate change. The study indicates that global warming, primarily from fossil fuel burning, boosted the typhoon's winds by 7% and rainfall by 12% at landfall.

Local authorities face mounting debt from these rising costs, prompting calls for debt forgiveness and legislative changes.

          <p>Shares of USA Rare Earth surged after CEO Barbara Humpton confirmed the company is in "close communication" with the White House regarding its rare earth operations. This follows recent Trump administration equity stakes in other critical mineral companies like Lithium Americas and MP Materials, aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on China. USA Rare Earth is developing a mine in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma, supporting the administration's goal of building out a domestic rare earth supply chain. Humpton views these collaborations as essential for the industry's growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a generic version of mifepristone, a key medication used in abortions, manufactured by Evita Solutions. This decision has infuriated anti-abortion advocates, who have been pressuring the federal government to restrict access to the drug since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Critics, including Senator Josh Hawley and Students for Life of America, expressed loss of confidence in the FDA, citing a flawed, non-peer-reviewed paper claiming serious complications. Abortion rights supporters, however, celebrated the approval as a victory for evidence-based medicine and expanded access.</p>

On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats continued to blame each other for the impasse, which has furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal workers.

          <p>Rangers manager Russell Martin once again blamed a "mentality problem" for his team's 2-1 Europa League defeat, extending his winless start to six games. Despite tactical efforts, Martin's post-match assessment echoed previous statements, highlighting slow starts and shoddy defending. The team's poor performance, with only five wins in 16 games, has intensified pressure on the head coach and fueled fan protests.

Hegseth's reliance on a personal entourage instead of experienced staff has transformed the department into a mechanism for implementing executive orders, rather than a creative problem-solving body.

          <p>A Goldman Sachs study reveals that a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are living paycheck-to-paycheck, making retirement savings increasingly unattainable. Approximately 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X report no spare savings after basic expenses, a figure projected to exceed half by 2033 due to rising costs for housing and healthcare. The report highlights that simply advising people to "save more" ignores these financial realities, as essential expenses consume a larger share of income.
