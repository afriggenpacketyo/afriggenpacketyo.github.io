          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people, mostly Vietnamese families, capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay, resulting in at least 34 deaths. Rescue efforts have been hampered by heavy rain, though 11 survivors have been pulled from the water, including a 10-year-old boy found in an air pocket. The Vietnamese government has expressed condolences and promised a thorough investigation into the cause of the tragic accident. This incident highlights the dangers of sudden weather changes in the popular tourist destination, which was struck by hailstones and a thunderstorm.</p>

          <p>A fundraiser has gathered more than £20,000 to support families affected by a school coach crash in Somerset that killed a 10-year-old boy. The coach, carrying about 70 people from Minehead Middle School, overturned on its way back from a zoo trip, leaving six children and three adults hospitalized. The local community has been devastated, with the fund intended to provide urgent financial and psychological support for those impacted. The road where the single-vehicle collision occurred remains closed as authorities conduct a complex investigation into the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to witnesses and hospital officials in Gaza, Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to get food, killing 32 people near distribution hubs run by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Israeli military stated it fired "warning shots" after suspects approached its forces, while the GHF claimed the incidents occurred far from its sites before they opened. This event adds to the hundreds of reported deaths near aid points, exacerbating the severe humanitarian crisis as the region faces the threat of famine and widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>Protests across five UK cities against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist group have resulted in at least 96 arrests. In London, 55 people were arrested for displaying placards in support of the group, which is now a criminal offense under the Terrorism Act. The ban followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. The demonstrations, organized ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban, highlight the ongoing tensions and legal battles surrounding pro-Palestine activism in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Over 100 days since their implementation, President Trump's tariffs have generated significant tax revenue but have had a mixed economic impact. While the administration claims the levies have spurred investment pledges from major companies to reshore manufacturing, economists note these commitments have long timelines and could be reversed. The tariffs have contributed to price increases in some consumer goods categories, raising inflation concerns. Despite initial fears, the broader economy has remained resilient, but uncertainty persists as the administration continues to adjust its tariff strategies and faces legal challenges.

          <p>Kayem Foods Inc. has issued a recall for more than 24,000 pounds of its ready-to-eat al fresco chicken sausage products due to potential contamination with pieces of white plastic. The recall was initiated after the company received three consumer complaints, though no injuries have been reported. The affected products are the "SWEET APPLE with Vermont made syrup" variety, produced on June 28, 2025, and distributed nationwide. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service advises consumers to either discard the products or return them to the place of purchase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are weighing the potential consequences if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that would likely trigger an unprecedented legal battle. The central question is whether Trump can establish the legal threshold of "cause" for removal, with speculation that criticism over a Fed building expansion is a pretext. Firing Powell could destabilize financial markets, harden the Fed's stance on interest rates, and ultimately harm the economy by undermining the central bank's independence. The situation creates significant uncertainty, regardless of whether the president follows through with the threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway argues that the worst career advice, often given by the wealthy, is to "follow your passion." Instead, he advises people to identify what they are good at, find where that skill can be profitable, and be resilient in the face of rejection. Galloway's own journey from a modest upbringing to becoming a self-made millionaire involved pivoting away from his passions when they weren't viable and embracing opportunities in marketing and entrepreneurship. The article suggests that practical self-assessment and a growth mindset are more crucial for success than blindly pursuing a passion.</p>

This trend coincides with a rise in tanning's popularity in pop culture, despite well-established risks of skin cancer. Dermatologists express concern over this defiance of scientific consensus, which frames tanning not just as a beauty choice but as a rejection of the mainstream health establishment.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm, and will lay off nearly a quarter of its workforce. The administration states the move will save nearly $750 million and shift scientific efforts to program-specific offices. Critics, including union leaders and congressional Democrats, argue that dismantling the ORD will devastate public health and environmental protection by removing the scientific foundation for the agency's work. The layoffs follow a recent Supreme Court ruling that cleared a path for the administration to downsize the federal workforce.</p>

The alerts for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday bring a continued threat of flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption. The recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the risk of localized flooding.

          <p>A month after U.S. airstrikes targeted three of Iran's key nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, the full extent of the damage remains unclear. The operation used powerful "bunker buster" bombs on the heavily fortified sites, where Iran has been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported no increase in regional radiation, experts note the potential danger of toxic gas leaks from damaged equipment. The strikes heighten concerns over the security of Iran's nuclear program and the fate of its existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium.</p>

          <p>Congress's recent approval of President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in federal spending is being viewed as a significant test case for future government appropriations. The move, which passed the Senate with a simple majority, bypassed the traditional bipartisan process that requires 60 votes for budget bills. Analysts suggest this signals a potential shift towards a more partisan budgeting process, which could dramatically alter how the federal government has been funded for years. The cuts targeted various areas, including foreign aid and public broadcasting, reflecting the administration's fiscal priorities.</p>
