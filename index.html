          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that it targeted "dozens" of military sites in Iran, including an inactive nuclear reactor near Arak, following an evacuation order. According to the IDF, the strike aimed to prevent the reactor's future use in nuclear weapons production by hitting the structure sealing it, a crucial component for plutonium production. Additionally, a "nuclear weapons development" site in Natanz, allegedly containing specialized equipment for advancing nuclear weapons development, was also targeted. This action follows escalating tensions between Israel and Iran over the latter's nuclear program, with Israel claiming the program poses an "imminent" and "existential" threat. The current events are part of a series of exchanges between the two countries after air strikes by Tel Aviv, which are said to be aimed at preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.</p>

Foreign Secretary David Lammy is currently in Washington to discuss the matter with his US counterpart, Marco Rubio. Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi has confirmed talks with UK, France, and Germany regarding their nuclear program, insisting on a commitment to diplomacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ruled that the state must pay a total of 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers, Deniz, a Kurdish man, and Heydar Safari Diman, an Iranian national, citing that their repeated detentions by the immigration agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental health. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants and Japan's immigration law, constituting unjust physical restraint. The plaintiffs had sought 30 million yen in damages, questioning the immigration law's allowance of detention without a review process. Masako Suzuki, the plaintiffs' lawyer, highlighted the ruling's significance in acknowledging the violation of international human rights.</p>

          <p>The U.S. faces increasing threats from adversaries using new technologies like drones and AI, potentially targeting critical infrastructure and leadership. China has compromised U.S. telecommunications systems and accessed vast quantities of data on Americans. A potential U.S.-China war over Taiwan could lead to destructive cyberattacks on U.S. infrastructure. Terrorist groups could also leverage new technologies to launch attacks using drones equipped with automatic weapons or lethal pathogens, posing significant risks to homeland security.</p>

          <p>As Mattel and OpenAI partner to bring AI to toys, there are concerns about the potential impact on children. A decade ago, Mattel released Hello Barbie, an internet-connected doll that listened to kids and used AI to respond, but it was later discontinued due to security vulnerabilities. Experts suggest that children often prefer imagining on their own terms and that AI can be a powerful educational tool when focused on specific problems. Alternatives like Toniebox and Nex Playground offer tech-centric toys that encourage creativity and movement without compromising data privacy.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not be held simultaneously in July. This decision comes as opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda said he would not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet. Concerns over higher U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East were cited as reasons to avoid a political vacuum. The House of Councillors election is expected to proceed as planned in July.</p>
