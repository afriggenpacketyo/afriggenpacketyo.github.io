          <p>Eyewitnesses recounted the chaotic scene where a car drove into a crowd celebrating Liverpool FC's Premier League victory, injuring dozens. A BBC reporter described the car speeding through the dense crowd, narrowly missing his family, before being chased by people trying to stop it. The ambulance acted as a barrier, slowing the car down. Police arrested a 53-year-old man believed to be the driver, and at least 27 people were hospitalized after the incident, which authorities do not believe was terror-related. The event occurred near the parade route on Water Street.</p>

          <p>Following a car ramming incident at a Liverpool FC parade, police swiftly released details about the driver, identifying him as a 53-year-old white British man. This quick disclosure was a calculated move to prevent the spread of misinformation, particularly after previous incidents where false reports fueled social unrest. In a prior case involving a stabbing in Southport, erroneous claims about the assailant's identity led to riots. Authorities are still investigating the motive behind the incident, which injured nearly 50 people, but they are treating it as an isolated event and not as terrorism.</p>

The defense system, intended to counter aerial threats, is seen by North Korea as a threat to its nuclear arsenal, potentially forcing them to develop alternative countermeasures. China has also expressed concerns about the system's offensive implications, viewing it as a pursuit of absolute security by the U.S. at the expense of global stability.</p>

          <p>Despite US President Donald Trump's remarks suggesting the United States is not focused on manufacturing sneakers and T-shirts, Chinese garment manufacturers remain cautious. Recent volatility in US tariff policies has led them to doubt any long-term stability. Businesses in China and Vietnam, major clothing export hubs, are still navigating uncertainty amid a 90-day tariff pause and ongoing negotiations with Washington. While Trump's comments indicate a focus on high-tech sectors, exporters are prioritizing diversification to mitigate risks from potential future tariff hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump has paused a 24% reciprocal tariff on Japanese goods until July, but the automotive sector is already feeling the impact of a 25% US tariff on automobiles and car parts.

          <p>Chinese scientists have challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be passed on through generations without DNA changes. A study published in *Cell* showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on cold tolerance for five generations through DNA methylation changes. This research revives the theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who proposed that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The findings suggest that epigenetics play a role in evolution, requiring a reconciliation with core Darwinian principles. The team showed that rice varieties from China's frosty northeast exhibited these stable, non-genetic adaptations.</p>
