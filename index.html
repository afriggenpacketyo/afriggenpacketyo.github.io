          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing travel bans on individuals from 12 countries and partial restrictions on those from seven others, citing national security concerns. The White House justified the action by pointing to inadequate screening and vetting capabilities in the affected nations. The full ban applies to countries such as Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while the partial ban affects nations like Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, and Venezuela. This action is a revival of Trump's earlier travel ban policies, which faced legal challenges and revisions during his first term. Optimism in this event is low, given the potential disruption and negative impact on individuals from the affected countries.</p>

          <p>Authorities are searching for Travis Decker, a Washington state father, who is suspected of killing his three daughters after they were reported missing. The girls, aged 5, 8, and 9, were found dead, with preliminary reports suggesting asphyxiation and zip-tied wrists. The mother reported the children missing after Decker failed to return them following a visit, raising concerns due to his history of mental health issues. The search involves multiple agencies, including the FBI and Border Patrol, with a reward offered for information leading to Decker's arrest. The lack of an initial Amber Alert due to the absence of suspected abduction highlights the complexities of such cases. The tragedy has devastated the community, prompting counseling services at the girls' school. This is a deeply tragic situation, and the sentiment expressed in the article reflects this somber reality.</p>

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, claiming the school is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students unless the administration deems their entry in the national interest and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of current students. This action escalates a long-standing feud between the Trump administration and Harvard, with the administration accusing the school of failing to report disciplinary records and having ties to researchers based in China. Harvard has responded by asserting the order violates its First Amendment rights and vowing to protect its international students. The move follows previous attempts by the administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, impacting a significant portion of its student body.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents, alleging a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The memo directs the Attorney General and the president's counsel to probe the use of the autopen and whether Biden's aides conspired to deceive the public about his mental state. Trump's order questions the legality and validity of numerous executive actions if Biden's advisers secretly used the mechanical signature pen. The investigation should determine which executive actions involved the autopen and who directed its use. The optimism score reflects the controversial and politically charged nature of this investigation.</p>

This development occurred amid other political news, including concerns over the potential impact of the "Big Beautiful Bill" on healthcare and reactions to Ukrainian attacks on warplanes.

          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their stadium. The event was bittersweet for the 740 graduating seniors, as they were unable to celebrate at their beloved Stadium by the Sea. The January fire destroyed homes of students, faculty, and board members, forcing the school to relocate classes to a former Sears building. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal offered words of encouragement, acknowledging the students' resilience in the face of adversity. The Hollywood Bowl was gifted to the school by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, with logistical support from school board member Nick Melvoin.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, focusing on 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, highlights the development of feathers that generate thrust and lift as a critical step in bird evolution. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences believe this development allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. While many dinosaurs had feathers, most lacked the ability to fly like modern birds.</p>

          <p>A New York prosecutor argues that Luigi Mangione, charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, committed an act of terrorism. The prosecutor supports the terror charge by highlighting the fear and panic induced among healthcare executives following the shooting. The filing reveals that 40 UHC executives sought bodyguards, and one even dyed her hair and relocated due to safety concerns. Mangione's writings indicated that he targeted the insurance industry, viewing Thompson as a symbol of "deadly greed-fueled cartel." This murder prompted a broader campaign of threats against UHC employees and other health insurance workers.</p>

Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Columbia's leadership acted with deliberate indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students following the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

The study found that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in infants halved the risk of hospitalization due to lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. This is a promising discovery that could lead to new therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>Sable Offshore Corp.'s efforts to restart offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara have been delayed due to a temporary restraining order granted by a judge siding with environmental groups. The order halts restart efforts on the onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015. Sable is now targeting August 1, 2025, for first sales due to this delay. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without conducting environmental review or public input. The ruling follows another legal setback where Sable was restricted from further work in the coastal region until its dispute with the California Coastal Commission is resolved.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Colorado has temporarily blocked the deportation of the wife and children of Mohamed Soliman, who is charged in the Boulder attack. The order prevents federal immigration officials from removing the family from the country or the state. Judge Gordon Gallagher stated that deportation without due process could cause irreparable harm. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had announced that Soliman's wife and children were being processed for removal proceedings. The family, who are Egyptian nationals, had been living in Colorado Springs.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed the review but did not specify the timeline or scope. Concerns about the drug's safety have been fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims the pill harms women. Experts like Dr. Céline Gounder have questioned the report's methodology and conclusions. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge to mifepristone's availability in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging that top aides masked his predecessor’s cognitive decline. The investigation will build on a Republican-led campaign to discredit the former president and overturn some of his executive actions. GOP lawmakers sought testimony from five of Biden’s top aides and advisers about his “mental and physical faculties”. Trump took aim at Biden’s use of an autopen to sign executive actions, questioning who ran the United States while Biden was in office. Democrats have called the investigations a distraction from issues with current administration.</p>

The defense claims Read is a victim of a police conspiracy, while the prosecution alleges she intentionally backed into O’Keefe. A mistrial was declared in the first trial due to a hung jury.</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there, has been flown back to the US following a judge's order. Judge Brian Murphy had ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return after it was revealed that the claim he wasn't afraid of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information. OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after experiencing homophobic violence in Guatemala. Another federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a prison in El Salvador a chance to challenge their deportations.</p>
