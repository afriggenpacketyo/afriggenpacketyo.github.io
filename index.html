        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves reports that the UK economy is 'beginning to turn a corner' after experiencing a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' forecasts. This growth was primarily fueled by increased consumer spending and business investments. While Reeves acknowledges the ongoing cost of living crisis for many families, she remains optimistic about the economy's trajectory, noting that the UK is poised to be the fastest-growing economy in the G7 during this period. However, some economists caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to upcoming US import tariffs and increased employer taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ashley Pardo, a Texas mother, faces charges for allegedly purchasing ammunition and tactical gear for her son, who authorities believe was planning a 'mass targeted violence' event at a San Antonio middle school. The investigation began when school staff discovered a map labeled 'suicide route' drawn by the son, who expressed fascination with past mass shooters. Further investigation revealed the son researched the Christchurch mosque attacks and subsequently attempted suicide. Pardo reportedly supported her son's violent expressions, and the grandmother found a homemade explosive device in the son's bedroom addressed to Brenton Tarrant, the Christchurch shooter.

          <p>While overall inflation has cooled down, certain everyday items like coffee and beef continue to experience rapid price increases. Coffee prices have soared nearly 10% year-over-year due to droughts in major coffee-producing regions like Vietnam and Brazil, impacting global supply. Beef prices are also up due to a supply shortage stemming from drought conditions in 2022, which led to ranchers selling off more cattle than usual. Other items experiencing price hikes include car repairs, driven by the increasing complexity of modern vehicles, and men's and women's outerwear, potentially influenced by shifting consumer tastes and specialty brands.

          <p>The New York Times analyzes winning Eurovision entries since 2000, identifying key ingredients for success. These include singing about personal liberation, using English lyrics, alluding to folk music, and creating an over-the-top stage performance with fire or pyrotechnics. The article advises against dramatic key changes and novelty acts, noting that while some folk elements can add flavor, pure folk songs don't win. The analysis highlights past winners like Conchita Wurst, Ruslana, and Lordi to illustrate these strategies, emphasizing the blend of musical and visual spectacle needed to capture the Eurovision crown.</p>

The conversation explores the risks of misaligned AI goals, the potential for economic disruption, and the philosophical implications of creating machines that may surpass human intelligence.

          <p>Despite AC Milan's loss in the Coppa Italia, Christian Pulisic is having a career-best season, prompting the question of whether any American soccer player has had a better year in Europe. With 17 goals and 10 assists across all competitions, Pulisic is thriving in a leading role, showcasing his skills and scoring against rivals like Inter Milan. While other American players are also performing well, Pulisic's impact and prominence with a top European club makes his season a standout achievement.</p>

          <p>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to reinstate Pete Rose and 'Shoeless' Joe Jackson for Hall of Fame eligibility has ignited controversy, with some linking it to White House pressure. Despite acknowledging their talent, the article underscores Rose's cardinal sin of betting on his own team and lying about it, contrasting this with baseball's embrace of legalized gambling through sponsorships. It questions the message sent by reinstating figures who violated the game's integrity, particularly as gambling becomes increasingly intertwined with the sport.</p>

          <p>As the Supreme Court reviews President Trump's push to end birthright citizenship, a new NPR/Ipsos poll reveals that most Americans oppose the idea, with 53% against it and only 28% in favor. The poll indicates stable public attitudes toward Trump's immigration policies, with nuanced views on due process for immigrants and a slight softening in support for mass deportation. While some support deporting alleged gang members, the poll highlights deep divisions on the balance between security and individual rights.</p>

          <p>Public broadcasting officials are lobbying Congress to preserve federal funding amid attacks from the Trump administration, which has labeled NPR and PBS programming as 'radical propaganda'. The lobbying effort follows a multipronged attack from the Trump administration on the finances and independence of public media, with a particular focus on PBS and NPR, the predominant national public television and radio networks, respectively. Money from the federal government accounts for fully half the annual budgets of some local public television and radio stations. In response, some states are rethinking their funding of public media, while others are offering additional support.</p>

          <p>The Strand Magazine has published rare and previously unseen short stories by literary icons Ian Fleming and Graham Greene. Fleming's story, 'The Shameful Dream,' features a newspaper editor and a Bond-villain-esque boss, while Greene's ghost story, 'Reading at Night,' explores a man's vacation turning eerie. The magazine is celebrating its 75th issue, and managing editor Andrew Gulli notes that these works show a different side of both authors, venturing outside their typical genres.</p>

          <p>Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the coast of Oregon, is expected to erupt this year, potentially creating a hotspot for marine life. The volcano's impending eruption will heat seawater to over 700 degrees Fahrenheit and release minerals through hydrothermal vents, creating a chemical energy-based ecosystem. While the eruption is not expected to impact humans due to its depth and distance from shore, it will likely trigger small earthquakes. The site is closely monitored by the Ocean Observatories Initiative, making it a key location for studying underwater volcano forecasting.</p>

          <p>A Texas senator aims to clarify the state's abortion ban with a new bill that would provide clearer guidelines for when doctors can perform the procedure to protect the mother's life. This effort comes as Texas experiences a significant increase in maternal deaths since the near-total abortion ban was enacted in 2021. The proposed bill specifies that abortions can be performed when a woman's life is at risk, even if not 'imminent,' and would provide training for physicians. While some medical groups endorse the bill, others argue it doesn't adequately address the complexities of medical judgment and may not significantly improve outcomes for pregnant women.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the Trump administration's challenge to birthright citizenship, guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, focusing primarily on the use of nationwide injunctions. The administration argues that federal judges overstepped their authority by issuing universal injunctions against the policy, which aims to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. Legal experts and advocates are divided on whether nationwide injunctions are necessary to prevent manipulation of the legal system or if they unduly limit the executive branch's ability to implement policies.</p>

          <p>Paramilitary fighters in Sudan have initiated a new phase in the country's civil war by launching unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan, a key city and humanitarian hub. These attacks, which have disrupted power and water supplies, demonstrate the RSF's ability to project power despite recent territorial losses. The escalating drone warfare highlights the role of foreign actors in the conflict, with accusations of the UAE supplying the RSF and Iran supporting the SAF. The increasing use of drones by both sides is reshaping the conflict, with the RSF demonstrating an ability to strike strategic targets previously considered out of reach.</p>

          <p>A UK political opinion poll tracker reveals that the Labour party's lead has diminished since their landslide victory last summer, with the Reform party gaining ground. Reform even held the lead in voting intention for the whole of February. The data, compiled from various pollsters, indicates shifts in support across different demographics and regions, with Reform gaining traction among younger voters. Support for the Conservatives remains robust with pensioners, but Farageâ€™s grip is tightening in this age group as well. The analysis also tracks Prime Minister Starmer's approval ratings and explores potential seat projections for Reform in future elections.</p>
