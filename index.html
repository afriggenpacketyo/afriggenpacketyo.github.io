            <p>New tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could significantly increase the cost of baby necessities like car seats, strollers, and cribs, many of which are manufactured overseas. Experts warn that these price hikes will disproportionately affect working-class and poor families, forcing them to make difficult choices about basic necessities. While the administration maintains that the tariffs are in the best interest of the American people, critics argue that they contradict the stated goal of encouraging higher birth rates and could negatively impact children's quality of life. The tariffs could cost an average household $3,800 per year, putting additional financial strain on new parents.</p>

            <p>President Trump has imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and other countries, leading to retaliatory measures and economic uncertainty. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of the product's value, and are paid by companies bringing the goods into the country. The aim is to encourage US consumers to buy American-made goods, but economists expect tariffs to push up prices for consumers. The announcements have caused volatility in global stock markets, affecting pensions, jobs, and interest rates, with the UK also facing potential economic impacts.</p>

The fixed rates below 4% are available to borrowers with a 60% loan-to-value and an £899 fee.

            <h2>Potential Economic Impact of Trump's Tariffs on US Consumers</h2>

            <p>Despite a partial rollback, Trump's tariffs are expected to raise prices for US consumers on a wide range of imported goods. The timing and extent of price increases are uncertain, but economists predict that businesses will either pass on costs to consumers or adjust their product offerings. Industries like textiles, cars, and consumer electronics are likely to be hit hardest, potentially impacting the labor market. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that unemployment could rise by 0.5% by the end of 2025, resulting in a loss of 600,000 jobs.</p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele's crackdown on gangs in El Salvador has dramatically reduced violence but has come at the cost of due process and human rights. The "state of exception" has led to mass arrests, with many innocent people imprisoned and reports of abuse. While Bukele remains popular, critics argue that security without justice is a Faustian bargain. The situation raises concerns about the erosion of democratic principles and the dangers of strongman leadership.</p>

            <p>Despite Trump's 90-day pause on some tariffs, economic uncertainty continues to plague US businesses. The rapid changes to trade policy have created a climate of instability, impacting business owners, investors, and consumers. Even with the pause, tariffs remain high, potentially leading to higher costs and unemployment. This has left business owners questioning the risk of investing in the US market, as the American economy seems subject to the whims of a president with a questionable understanding of economics.</p>
