            <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, reducing the rate of appreciation of its policy band for the Singapore dollar. This decision comes as Singapore's GDP growth for the first quarter of 2025 was lower than expected, at 3.8%. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has also downgraded its GDP forecast for the year to 0%-2%, citing the potential impact of U.S. tariffs. MAS lowered headline and core inflation forecasts for 2025 to 0.5%-1.5% (not investment advice).</p>

Trump stated that these products are subject to existing fentanyl tariffs and will be moved to a different tariff bucket, promising a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector and electronics supply chain. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that new duties would target smartphones, computers, and other electronics products, alongside sectoral tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, aiming to bring production back to the United States.</p>

            <p>An investing expert suggests using a bond ladder strategy to navigate the current volatile bond market. This strategy involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, providing regular income in the form of principal and interest. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers a similar approach in an ETF format, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds and distributing monthly income through 2035. While the net asset value may fluctuate, the strategy aims to provide immunization from liabilities and protect buying power, offering peace of mind in a tough time (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A landmark antitrust trial against Meta has begun, with the FTC alleging that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition and create a monopoly. If the FTC wins, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could be forced to sell off both platforms. Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg are expected to testify. The case was filed during Trump's first administration and is at risk of becoming politicized during his second term, as Zuckerberg has lobbied Trump to drop the case.</p>

            <p>The Department of Justice is defending its decision to deport Kilmer Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, arguing that federal courts do not have the authority to direct the executive branch to conduct foreign relations. The DOJ claims that the requests by Abrego Garcia's attorneys would involve interactions with a foreign sovereign and potential violations of that sovereignty. This case highlights the ongoing debate over immigration policy and the limits of judicial power in foreign affairs.</p>

            <p>A report by MPs has found that some police forces were unprepared for the level of violence that broke out in riots following the murder of three children in Southport. The report acknowledges that officers worked tirelessly, but the lack of proactive action left them exposed. The report also found no evidence to support claims of "two-tier policing". Misinformation regarding the identity of the suspect spread quickly online following the attack, and forces and the Home Office said it was a "significant factor" in the spread of disorder.</p>
