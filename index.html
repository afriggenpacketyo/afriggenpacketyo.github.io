          <p>A food website compiled a list of the 15 best gas station chains for food based on online reviews, challenging the stereotype of poor-quality roadside dining. The list features chains like Wisconsin-based Kwik Trip, praised for its in-house baked goods, and Texas-based Buc-ee's, renowned for its extensive brisket and snack offerings. Many highlighted chains are family-owned and offer unique regional specialties, from Royal Farms' fried chicken on the East Coast to Allsup's deep-fried burritos in the Southwest, showcasing a surprising culinary diversity at these travel stops.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: U.S. Trade Strategy with Southeast Asia Shifts to Transactional Model</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:30:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that the United States' recent trade policy toward Southeast Asia has shifted from a partnership to a rent-seeking model. This new approach reportedly focuses on monetizing access to the American market by imposing higher tariffs and mandatory purchases on ASEAN member nations. The author contends this transactional strategy undermines the region's competitiveness and sovereignty by treating nations like Vietnam and Indonesia as sources of revenue rather than strategic partners. This could transform them into "fee for access" economies, damaging long-term, mutually beneficial relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Report Indicates China's Influence in Southeast Asia Grows as Western Aid Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Lowy Institute indicates that China's influence in Southeast Asia is expanding, largely due to its role as the region's primary infrastructure financier. This growth coincides with significant cuts in foreign aid budgets from the United States and the European Union. The report suggests that as traditional Western donors pull back, the center of development finance is shifting eastward toward Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul. China is leveraging this opportunity to enhance its regional sway through projects like high-speed rail, positioning itself as a dominant partner.</p>

          <p>A fragile calm has settled over the Syrian city of Suweida following a week of violent clashes involving Druze fighters, Bedouin gunmen, and government forces, which resulted in over 1,000 deaths. The fighting, sparked by the abduction of a Druze merchant, displaced at least 128,000 people and has led to a severe humanitarian crisis, with hospitals overwhelmed and lacking basic medical supplies. Although a ceasefire was declared and government forces have closed roads to contain tensions, local Druze fighters reportedly remain in control of the city while Bedouin tribes have withdrawn.</p>

          <p>The Euro 2025 women's football tournament has seen an unusually low penalty conversion rate of just 58.5%, sparking analysis into the potential causes. Experts and players suggest a combination of factors, including increased pressure from the sport's growing popularity and media spotlight, which can negatively impact performance. Additionally, improved data analysis and scouting mean goalkeepers are better prepared, often knowing a taker's preferred style. The overall professionalization and physical development of female goalkeepers has also made them more capable of defending the goal, contributing to the trend of more missed and saved penalties.</p>

          <p>Following a court ruling that found it subject to Georgia's open records laws, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of documents related to the controversial 'Cop City' training center. The records reveal that the foundation actively lobbied city officials to prevent a public referendum on the project, arguing it would derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This ruling sets a significant precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide, which have often operated without public scrutiny. Activists plan to use the decision to seek further records, aiming to prevent such foundations from acting as a "black box."</p>

          <p>Critics and scientists argue that the Trump administration is setting back environmental progress by decades through a concerted push to expand fossil fuels while cutting green energy initiatives. The administration has cited a self-declared national energy emergency to justify gutting tax credits for wind and solar, reviving the coal industry, and promoting oil and gas drilling. These actions coincide with proposals to shutter key climate research labs and systematic efforts to remove mentions of climate change from government websites. Scholars contend these policies disregard scientific evidence, serve fossil-fuel industry allies, and pose long-term dangers to public health and the environment.</p>

          <p>An analysis argues that a Trump administration executive order on "Restoring Gold Standard Science" is designed to undermine regulatory action by manufacturing doubt about scientific evidence. The policy gives political appointees, rather than career scientists, the power to define scientific integrity and decide which evidence is credible, echoing tactics used by the tobacco industry. This allows officials to cast doubt on inconvenient findings, demand unattainable levels of certainty, and reshape science to fit policy goals. Critics warn this approach will weaken public health and environmental protections by creating a scientific record designed to delay or block regulations.</p>

Vibrio bacteria, which cause vibriosis, thrive in warmer, low-salinity waters like those found in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Black Sea, where sea surface temperatures are rising. While infections are rare, they can be severe, especially for individuals with weakened immune systems, and are typically contracted by eating raw shellfish or swimming with open wounds.

          <p>Comic book author Grant Morrison highlights the socialist origins of Superman in response to recent conservative criticism of the character's depiction as an immigrant. Created in the 1930s by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the earliest versions of Superman were portrayed as a "Champion of the Oppressed" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums to demand better housing for the poor. Morrison explains that the character's interpretation has evolved over the decades, reflecting the societal values of the time, from a patriotic figure during WWII to a family man in the 1950s. This history suggests that the character has always been a political and social metaphor.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that to effectively counter Donald Trump, pro-democracy forces must learn from his political methods. The author suggests that Trump's success stems from his ability to tell a simple, repetitive story, appeal to national pride, and build a movement outside of conventional political structures. To combat this, opponents should adopt a similarly determined and undaunted approach, create their own clear and compelling message, and focus on building a grassroots movement. Instead of merely preserving the current system, the pro-democracy movement should offer its own vision for constitutional reform to make government more responsive to ordinary people.</p>

While polls show a majority of Americans desire more political options, the current system funnels political activity into the two dominant parties. Drutman advocates for proportional representation with multi-member districts as a potential solution, which would allow smaller parties to gain seats and make every vote more meaningful.</p>

          <p>Following the unexpected retirement of veteran Mike Williams, Los Angeles Chargers receiver Quentin Johnston is confident he can step up and fill the void. After a difficult rookie season, Johnston showed significant improvement last year, and now with Williams' departure, he has an even greater opportunity to become a key target for quarterback Justin Herbert. The Chargers' receiving corps is in a state of transition, with standout Ladd McConkey leading the group and promising rookies like Tre' Harris expected to contribute. Johnston states his confidence is at an all-time high, ready to prove he has what it takes.</p>

          <p>An epidemic of pitching injuries, particularly elbow ligament tears requiring Tommy John surgery, is affecting baseball players from youth leagues to the major leagues. Experts like Texas Rangers team physician Dr. Keith Meister attribute the problem to an industry-wide obsession with maximizing pitch velocity and spin rate at all costs. While MLB studies confirm this link, development labs argue they teach responsible training methods. However, data shows a dramatic increase in these surgeries among teenage athletes, raising concerns that the quest for high-speed fastballs is causing long-term harm and pushing young bodies beyond their limits.</p>

          <p>The garment industry in Lesotho, once known as the "Denim Capital of Africa," is facing collapse after the U.S. imposed steep tariffs, leading to factory closures and mass unemployment. The tariffs have created widespread desperation in the impoverished nation, where tens of thousands of workers, many of whom are single mothers, relied on jobs producing apparel for major American brands. The U.S. administration cited a trade imbalance as the reason for the tariffs, but Lesotho's government argues the imbalance was a sign of a successful U.S. trade policy designed to support African nations.

          <p>A new study by Common Sense Media reveals that nearly three-quarters of U.S. teenagers have used conversational AI companions for social activities like flirting, seeking advice, or casual chatting. While 52% use these tools regularly, the vast majority still prioritize and find more satisfaction in human friendships. However, the study raises concerns, noting that a third of teens have discussed serious matters with AI instead of people and have sometimes felt uncomfortable with an AI's response. Researchers worry about the potential impact on adolescent social development and the data privacy risks, as these platforms are designed to collect personal information.</p>

          <p>Following a 27-19 first Test loss to the British and Irish Lions, the Australian Wallabies are banking on "desperation" to keep the series alive, but analysts question if that will be sufficient. While the Wallabies are expected to play with heightened intensity in the next match, their performance in Brisbane revealed a team still in development and struggling against the Lions' physicality and creativity. The Lions' victory was built on early dominance, and despite a period of sloppy play that allowed Australia to score late, the gap in quality was apparent. The return of key players for Australia may not be enough to overcome the Lions' superior form.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030, calling it a "water revolution." Acknowledging that the water sector is "broken" and its regulator is failing, the government plans tougher measures for water company bosses, including potential prison sentences for non-compliance. This marks the first time a clear target has been set for reducing pollution spills, following public outrage over the state of rivers and coastlines. The plan will also include a ban on wet wipes containing plastic, as part of a broader effort to reform the industry.</p>
