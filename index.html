          <p>Clashes at a protest outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, UK, led to three arrests and minor injuries to two police officers. The protest followed a Court of Appeal decision overturning an injunction, which allows 138 asylum seekers to remain at the hotel. The local community is deeply divided over the issue, which has seen heightened tensions since an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault, contributing to 28 protest-related arrests to date.</p>

          <p>Mass protests have broken out across Indonesia following the death of a 21-year-old ride-sharing driver who was struck by a police vehicle during anti-government demonstrations. The unrest, fueled by frustrations over cost-of-living issues, has resulted in violent clashes with police, with reports of three deaths after a regional parliament building was set on fire.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that many of the extensive tariffs imposed by President Trump exceed his authority under federal emergency economic laws. While the ruling does not immediately block the tariffs, it represents a significant legal challenge to his trade strategy, which has applied duties to goods from numerous countries. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited power to levy tariffs, calling it a core congressional power. The Trump administration has vowed to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Florida has scheduled the execution of Victor Tony Jones, 64, for the 1990 fatal stabbing of a married couple during a robbery. This would be the state's 13th scheduled execution of the year, extending a record number of inmates put to death in a single year since 1976. The state has executed more people this year than any other, contributing to a national increase in executions compared to the previous year. Jones's legal team is expected to file appeals with both the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts.</p>

          <p>Charles Borges, the Chief Data Officer for the Social Security Administration, has resigned days after filing a whistleblower complaint alleging that employees from the Department of Government Efficiency uploaded the entire country's Social Security data to a "vulnerable cloud environment." Borges claims he faced retaliation and a hostile work environment after reporting his concerns internally, leading to his "constructive discharge." The SSA has refuted the claim, stating the data was "walled off from the internet" and that there is no evidence of a compromise.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Yale University have identified a more than 31km earthen wall being constructed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) around the besieged city of el-Fasher in Sudan. The analysis suggests the barrier is designed to trap civilians and create a "kill box" as the RSF intensifies its offensive against the army's last major stronghold in Darfur. Humanitarian access has been cut off for months, and civilians face constant bombardment and shortages of food and medicine, with reports of the RSF deliberately targeting civilian areas and hospitals.</p>

          <p>China's equity markets have reached a 10-year high, signaling a potential sustained rally as both overseas and domestic investors return to the nation's US$20 trillion stock market. Asset managers are turning positive, citing investors' rotation out of low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's focus on technological innovation as key drivers. This renewed interest follows years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus, suggesting a potential catch-up with other global markets that are trading near historic highs.

          <p>Hundreds of wildfires on UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) land have been sparked by live-fire military training exercises since 2023, according to figures obtained by the BBC. Firefighting efforts are often complicated by the presence of unexploded ordnance, some dating back to World War II, making it too dangerous for crews to access the areas. While the MoD states it has a robust policy to manage fire risk, some local residents are calling for a ban on live-fire training during the driest months due to health and environmental concerns from the smoke.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced the cancellation of $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding that had already been approved by Congress. President Trump utilized a little-known procedure called a "pocket rescission" to bypass lawmakers and withhold funds from 15 international programs near the end of the fiscal year. The move has drawn criticism from both Democrats, who warn it increases the likelihood of a government shutdown, and some Republicans, who argue the action is illegal and undermines congressional authority.

          <p>Warning signs about gymnastics coach Sean Gardner, recently arrested on federal child sexual exploitation charges, were reportedly ignored for years by authorities, including renowned coach Liang "Chow" Qiao. Gardner's former boss claims she reported his "grooming" behavior to USA Gymnastics as early as 2018, four years before he was banned from the sport. Despite gymnasts and parents raising concerns about inappropriate touching at his subsequent job at Chow's academy, Gardner was promoted, and the U.S. Center for SafeSport later sanctioned Qiao for failing to report the allegations.</p>

          <p>A performance by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at the BBC Proms in London was interrupted when pro-Palestinian protesters stood up in the gallery with signs and shouted slogans. The group, Jewish Artists for Palestine, claimed responsibility, stating they were protesting what they called "Zionist funding, censorship and complicity" in cultural institutions over the war in Gaza. The concert was paused for over 10 minutes while security removed the demonstrators before the orchestra restarted its performance, an incident that was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3.</p>

          <p>China is restructuring its national laboratory system to create more focused, mission-oriented research institutions aimed at advancing its strategic goals in the global "tech war." Under the new model, labs, including newly revamped facilities in Hong Kong, are receiving clear mandates, centralized funding, and are directly accountable to Beijing's agenda for scientific supremacy. This marks a shift from the previous system of loosely defined research, streamlining efforts to support national development through targeted innovation and technological breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>Budget carrier Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than twelve months, citing persistent "adverse market conditions." The airline, which only emerged from its previous restructuring in March, stated it needs to do more work to reposition itself for the future amid weak demand for domestic leisure travel. Spirit intends to continue normal operations during the process, honoring tickets and loyalty points, but has already announced plans to furlough hundreds of pilots to align with reduced flight volumes.</p>

          <p>At the urging of President Trump, Missouri's Republican Governor Mike Kehoe has called a special legislative session to redraw the state's congressional districts. The proposed new map is designed to give Republicans a partisan advantage by targeting the Kansas City-area district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This move makes Missouri the third state to pursue a mid-decade redistricting effort, following similar partisan maneuvers in Texas and California, as both parties battle for control of the U.S. House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a new congressional map into law, a key part of a Republican strategy to solidify control of the U.S. House by creating five new GOP-leaning districts. The mid-decade redistricting plan is a high-stakes gamble that relies on cementing the party's recent electoral gains among Hispanic voters, as four of the new districts are Hispanic-majority. The move has triggered a national redistricting battle, with Democrats in other states countering with their own plans, while polls suggest some Latino voters may be shifting away from the GOP.</p>

          <p>Malcolm Kenyatta, a Democratic state representative from Pennsylvania, has embarked on a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The protest aims to draw attention to a funding crisis at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which has led to service cuts affecting thousands of residents. Kenyatta blames Republican inaction in the state legislature for the $213 million operating deficit, arguing that bipartisan funding proposals have been ignored while working people suffer the consequences of the reduced transit services.</p>

His lawyers decry the pre-dawn raid on his home as an act of intimidation intended to punish him for speaking out about the incident, which they describe as an attempted murder by federal agents.</p>

The protests, some of which have turned violent, highlight the growing tension between the economic benefits of tourism and the social cost to long-term residents who are being priced out of their neighborhoods.</p>
