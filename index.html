          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report reveals a strong fiscal first quarter, marked by a 69% sales increase driven by its data center division, which is benefiting from the demand for GPUs in AI software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, a $50 billion market, as restrictions on its H20 chip have already cost the company billions in sales. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's Blackwell business is thriving, and cloud providers remain crucial customers, accounting for half of the data center revenue. Nvidia is also focusing on AI inference, anticipating a surge in demand as AI models require more computing power for reasoning, positioning its Blackwell chips to capitalize on this trend. Optimism score is based on the company's growth and adaptation to market challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to "aggressively revoke visas" for many Chinese students, citing national security concerns and accusing them of allowing antisemitism on campus. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a formal notice to Harvard University, giving the school 30 days to respond to identified compliance issues that may result in the withdrawal of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. This action follows a federal hearing regarding Harvard's ability to enroll international students, and the letter is viewed as an effort to provide legal justification for the purported revocation of the school's ability to enroll international students. The notice indicates that the Department of Homeland Security identified "national security concerns" related to international students.</p>

          <p>Tourists discovered skeletal remains on Jeremy Cay, part of Edisto Island in South Carolina, leading to an investigation by local officials. The remains are believed to originate from a "long forgotten burial site" associated with Edingsville Beach, a 19th-century settlement destroyed by weather and erosion. The recovered remains, including a skull and separated bones, have been transported to the Medical University of South Carolina for forensic analysis and identification, with the Colleton County Sheriff's Office collaborating with other agencies to determine their origin. Similar discoveries have occurred on the island previously, with artifacts from the settlement's heyday also washing ashore, offering insights into the area's history.</p>

          <p>A landfill closure in Los Angeles County, driven by a combination of state, federal, and county regulations, has increased the cost and complexity of trash removal for local citizens. The closure, triggered by a chemical reaction, has forced the county to pay for transporting trash to a landfill further away. This situation exemplifies how government policies, often based on politicians' goals rather than helping people, can negatively impact residents. California's high income taxes, cost of living, and environmental bureaucracy contribute to the state's over-regulated environment, leading to residents and businesses fleeing to more business-friendly states.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's announcement of "aggressively" revoking visas for Chinese students, many applicants expressed helplessness and frustration. Despite successfully applying for visas, students worried about the possibility of revocation and questioned their future in the United States. This action follows a pause on new interviews for student visas, creating uncertainty among Chinese students and their families. While Chinese officials criticized the move as discriminatory, China's limited leverage in international student exchanges means retaliation is unlikely, potentially leading students to seek education in other countries. The article reflects the complicated feelings of Chinese students who are drawn to American education but are wary of the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Beijing has criticized the United States' decision to target Chinese students as "discriminatory," warning that it will further damage America's global image. The State Department's measures, including a freeze on new visa interviews and visa revocations for students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields, have been condemned by Chinese officials. They argue that the decision harms the lawful rights of Chinese students, disrupts exchanges between the two countries, and exposes the hypocrisy of American claims of freedom and openness. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning stated that the move is a politicized and discriminatory practice.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority by imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is exploring alternative legal means to enact tariffs. Goldman Sachs economists suggest that while the ruling is a setback, the White House has tools such as Section 122 of U.S. trade law, Section 301 investigations, and Section 338 of the Trade Act of 1930 at its disposal. These options could allow the administration to reimpose tariffs, although some would require congressional action or investigations. The Trump administration has swiftly appealed the ruling, indicating its determination to maintain its tariff policies.</p>

The renovation will include repairing the leaky garage roof and building a new amphitheater to replace the costly temporary stage used for outdoor concerts. The project, with $218 million already raised, seeks to rectify past urban renewal approaches that walled off the park from the community. The redesign, led by Walter Hood and Weiss/Manfredi, includes tiered gardens, a lawn, and a pool, responding to community desires and improving accessibility to the arts complex.</p>

The forum, which begins on Friday, typically provides a platform for China's defense minister to counter Washington's narrative and engage directly with other defense chiefs. The decision is seen as potentially linked to ongoing US-China tariff war talks and a reduced interest in the "Western-centric" security dialogue, according to observers.

The author argues that just as the dollar's dominance has allowed the US to live beyond its means, the dominance of elite universities has compensated for the country's mediocre K-12 education system. By attacking these universities and making the US hostile to foreign talent, Trump is jeopardizing the country's ability to attract the best minds from around the world, which is crucial for maintaining its leadership in science and technology.

          <p>Following a U.S. court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs, trade experts and America's trading partners reacted with caution rather than celebration. While international stock markets rose, the move was seen as only a fragile chance at reprieve, with economists pointing out that Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs. The court's decision does not roll back sector-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, leaving the United States and its trading partners in a state of uncertainty. Despite the ruling, the possibility of continued trade tensions remains high, and countries are preparing for the worst while hoping for the best.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged as trading opened on Thursday after a panel of federal judges blocked President Donald Trump from imposing some tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw increases, reflecting investor optimism. The ruling invalidated levies on dozens of countries, including a 10% tariff imposed on goods from nearly all countries. However, the Trump administration appealed the ruling, leaving the ultimate fate of the tariffs unclear, though sector-specific tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum remain unaffected.</p>

The move to bar international students and cut federal contracts is seen as an attempt to punish Harvard for not complying with the administration's demands. The administration's actions are illegal and were immediately stayed by a federal judge, but the action threatens to harm students and higher learning by creating an environment of hostility and uncertainty. The article suggests that the administration's actions could be the beginning of a broader attempt to apply "America First" protectionist principles to higher education, destroying global cooperation.</p>

Musk's "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE) dismantled some agencies, fired thousands of federal employees, and canceled contracts, but its goal of cutting $1 trillion in spending never materialized. The effort to run the federal government like a Silicon Valley startup faltered when Trump's Cabinet revolted against Musk's dictates. Despite sharing Trump's agenda of reducing the federal workforce and strengthening presidential control, Musk's role as the "decider" proved unsustainable, leading to his departure.</p>
