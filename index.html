          <p>A major Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in the deaths of at least 23 people, including four children, and left dozens wounded. The bombardment destroyed a residential building and caused damage to the nearby European Union delegation office and British Council, sparking outrage from European leaders. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a deliberate escalation, while the EU prepares a new package of sanctions against Russia in response to the aggression.</p>

          <p>A new Texas law, SB 17, is set to restrict individuals and companies from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying or renting property, a measure officials defend on national security grounds. Opponents, including community activists and Democratic Representative Gene Wu, argue the law is discriminatory, anti-immigrant, and reminiscent of historical exclusion acts. The legislation has already prompted a lawsuit and is causing concern among Chinese companies and residents, who fear it will lead to unfair scrutiny and economic harm.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has proposed a new model for the College Football Playoff that would pay players directly for their participation and advancement. Sanders argues this would create equality, as every player would earn the same amount, similar to how the NFL distributes playoff bonuses. This idea comes amid ongoing debates with coaching legend Nick Saban about the need for more structure in the new era of name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals in college sports.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, the relationship between China and Japan is characterized by a complex mix of historical resentment and strong contemporary ties. While a new film about the 1937 Nanking massacre has become a box office hit in China, reigniting memories of wartime atrocities, Chinese tourism to Japan is simultaneously booming. This "love-hate" dynamic reflects the deep historical wounds that coexist with significant economic interdependence and cultural affinity between the two East Asian powers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Planning Major Immigration Enforcement Operations in Chicago</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to launch large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially starting as soon as September 5, according to DHS sources. The tactics are expected to mirror those used in Los Angeles, which involved armored vehicles and tactical gear and led to significant protests. The planned operations are reportedly separate from President Trump's recent push to deploy the National Guard to the city to address crime, a move local and state officials have strongly opposed.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has secured a spot in the Conference League league phase after a 1-0 aggregate victory over Fredrikstad in their play-off match. A goalless draw in the second leg was enough to see the club through, achieving what manager Oliver Glasner called their second major goal of the season after winning the Community Shield. This marks Crystal Palace's first-ever European campaign, and despite being demoted from the Europa League due to ownership rules, there is optimism the team could be a contender.</p>

          <p>Asylum seekers housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, report being "in the dark" about their future as a court-ordered eviction deadline of September 12 approaches.

The situation has been intensified by numerous anti-immigration protests, leaving residents like one Somalian man feeling fearful and uncertain about where they will be sent next.</p>

In his ruling, Judge George Daniels stated that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles of Saudi officials in assisting the hijackers, and that the kingdom had not offered sufficient evidence to counter these claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive order signed by President Trump is suspending the "de minimis" rule, which for nearly 90 years allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. without import duties. The change means all shipments will now be subject to an import tax, ending the exemption that recently applied to goods valued under $800. This policy shift will significantly impact online retailers like Temu and Shein that ship cheap goods from abroad, and it is expected to lead to higher prices for American consumers.

          <p>The recent leadership upheaval at the CDC, including the firing of its director and multiple resignations of top scientists, is rooted in a fundamental conflict over vaccine policy and public health science. The turmoil is driven by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, who has overhauled key advisory panels and altered immunization guidelines. Departing officials have cited concerns that political agendas are overriding scientific reality and that the agency's independence is being compromised, potentially eroding public trust and weakening the nation's ability to respond to health threats.</p>
