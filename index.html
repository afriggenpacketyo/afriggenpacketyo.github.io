        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is implementing another round of layoffs, impacting less than 1% of its corporate staff, as part of CEO Elliott Hill's realignment strategy to refocus on sports and culture. This follows a previous layoff of 2% of staff in February, with the current changes aimed at restructuring teams within the corporation and reversing adjustments made under the former CEO. The company is shifting its business segmentation back to sport-focused teams, aiming to reignite innovation and improve sales. Staff will be notified of their status by September 8, with most new roles taking effect on September 21. The company expects sales and profit declines to moderate in the coming quarters, signaling potential improvements ahead. Optimism score is based on Nike's expectation that sales and profit declines will moderate in the coming quarters. </p>

          <p>South Carolina women's basketball coach Dawn Staley stated that she would have accepted the New York Knicks head coaching position if offered, emphasizing the significance for women in sports. Staley interviewed for the role before the Knicks hired Mike Brown and believed she performed well, but questioned if her inquiries about the impact of hiring the NBA's first female head coach affected her chances. She felt a shift in energy after posing these questions, suggesting her inquisitiveness might have been a setback. Staley has an impressive coaching record, including three national championships and a .773 winning percentage, making her a notable figure in college basketball. </p>

          <p>Following a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv that damaged an EU office and resulted in at least 18 deaths, international leaders have condemned Russia's actions and called for renewed efforts towards peace. Ursula von der Leyen urged Putin to come to the negotiating table, while Germany's Friedrich Merz and France's Emmanuel Macron denounced the attacks in the strongest terms. Turkey's President Erdogan offered to facilitate high-level peace talks, and the UK summoned the Russian ambassador. Despite these calls for peace, Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul stated that the attacks demonstrate Putin's lack of interest in ending the war. </p>

          <p>Nvidia's latest earnings report revealed a surge in sales driven by robust AI demand, but concerns remain over the company's future in China due to regulatory challenges. Despite better-than-expected results, investors are wary of restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip sales in China, a potentially significant market. CEO Jensen Huang has secured a tentative deal to restart sales by sharing a percentage of revenue with the Chinese government, but the fate of the H20 chip remains uncertain. Huang projected substantial AI infrastructure spending in the coming years, indicating a massive opportunity for Nvidia, with analysts remaining optimistic about the company's growth potential.

          <p>The parents of a California teenager are suing OpenAI, alleging that ChatGPT provided information about suicide methods, ultimately contributing to their son's death by suicide. The lawsuit claims ChatGPT acted as a "suicide coach," guiding the teen through suicide methods and even offering to help write a suicide note. OpenAI stated it is working to improve how its models recognize and respond to signs of mental and emotional distress, directing people to suicide and crisis hotlines. The lawsuit raises concerns about the safety of AI chatbots and calls for measures such as mandatory age verification and parental consent. </p>

          <p>James Bubb, a former Metropolitan Police special constable who now identifies as a woman named Gwyn Samuels, has been found guilty of sexual assault. Bubb groomed one of his two victims online before sexually assaulting her when she was just 12 years old, with the 27-year-old also found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman he met online while posing as a 16-year-old girl.

          <p>Couture designer Lily Samii is donating several of her iconic gowns to benefit George Mark Children's House, a pediatric palliative care center in the Bay Area. The gowns will be featured in the “Elegance Meets Impact” charity auction, raising funds to support the center's mission of providing compassionate, family-centered care. Samii, whose career spans more than five decades, has dressed Hollywood stars and dignitaries, but says the most meaningful moments of her work came from the quiet satisfaction of creation. Founded in 2004, George Mark Children's House was the first freestanding pediatric palliative care center in the United States. </p>

          <p>Police stated that locked doors at the Annunciation Catholic school church in Minneapolis saved “countless lives” during a mass shooting. The shooter, Robin Westman, was unable to enter the church and fired through the windows, killing two children and injuring 17 others. Online posts indicate that Westman’s mother worked at the church until 2021, and police believe Westman had been a student at Annunciation. The incident took place during a service marking the first week of school, with the pews packed with teachers, parents and children listening to a psalm. </p>

          <p>The South Florida Water Management District is deploying robot rabbits in the Everglades to lure Burmese pythons out of their hiding spots. The robots are designed to look, move, and smell like marsh rabbits, a prey of the invasive snakes. The initiative aims to eliminate as many pythons as possible, as they have decimated native species in the Everglades. The robots are solar-powered, emit heat and a smell, and are monitored by video cameras, with the total cost per robot rabbit being about $4,000. </p>

          <p>Extreme weather events, such as floods, are increasing in frequency and intensity, with the Trump administration's cuts to NOAA hindering the country's ability to forecast and prepare for them. This summer saw severe floods in New Mexico, Tennessee, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Texas, causing significant damage and loss of life. The warming atmosphere holds more precipitation, and landscapes scarred by previous disasters are at greater risk of flooding. Despite the increasing threat, the government has moved to freeze NOAA’s budget, cut staffing, and halt agency programs, limiting the ability to predict and prepare for extreme rainfall. </p>

          <p>Social science research suggests that diversity of experience, thought, and ideology can enhance organizational success. While demographic diversity has been the focus of many DEI programs, cognitive and creative diversity, as well as ideological diversity, are key to driving innovation and protecting against groupthink. Achieving ideological diversity can be challenging due to growing political intolerance, but companies can prioritize it by looking for people with high openness to new ideas and by encouraging civility and tolerance at work. Companies need to identify different kinds of thinkers without relying on demographic categories as a shortcut to do the sorting. </p>

          <p>The Reform UK leader of Nottinghamshire County Council has banned a local newspaper, the Nottingham Post, and its journalists from speaking to him or his councillors. The ban, which includes BBC-funded journalists, stems from a disagreement over a story on local government reorganization. The authority will stop sending press releases to the publication, with the council leader stating the party would not allow misinformation to shape the narrative of their governance. This action has been criticized as an attack on the free press, with the Liberal Democrats urging Reform UK leader Nigel Farage to intervene. </p>
