          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass stated that over 100 individuals were arrested during late-night protests in downtown LA, following peaceful demonstrations against federal immigration sweeps earlier in the day. Bass attributed the violence and vandalism to "fringe groups" rather than supporters of immigrants' rights. Those arrested will be evaluated, including checks for active warrants, to determine the appropriate course of action. The mayor emphasized that the earlier protests were focused on fighting for immigrant rights and calling for an end to the raids, while the late-night incidents were separate and more violent. Optimism is tempered by the arrests and violence. (not investment advice)</p>

The prime minister's spokesman described the events as "very concerning," emphasizing that there is no justification for attacks on police officers. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is investigating the incident, examining video footage to identify those responsible, and increasing police presence in the town to support and reassure affected communities.</p>

          <p>A study by the European Travel Commission (ETC) indicates that U.S. tourists are reducing their summer travel to Europe, with only 33% planning a visit compared to 40% last year, largely due to high travel costs and political concerns. However, interest in European summer trips has surged among Chinese travelers, with 72% planning such a holiday, a 10% increase from the previous year, driven by growing disposable incomes and favorable travel policies. Over half of Chinese travelers now include shopping as part of their European travel plans, though they are also tightening their belts, with most looking to spend between 100 and 200 euros per day.</p>

          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, leaders of the women's wellness company OneTaste Inc., which promoted "orgasmic meditation," have been convicted on federal forced labor charges. Prosecutors argued that Daedone and Cherwitz ran a scheme that coerced employees into performing traumatic and demeaning tasks with little to no pay, using economic, sexual, and psychological abuse. Witnesses testified they were forced into sexual acts they found uncomfortable, with the defendants claiming these acts were necessary for "freedom" and "enlightenment." The defense argued that the witnesses chose to participate and could leave at any time, but the jury found Daedone and Cherwitz guilty.</p>

Mao Yu, an associate director of the Communist Party’s publicity department, emphasized the need to encourage more good international films to enter the Chinese market.

This adjustment involves a leaner military force and reduced US military presence overseas, including in Africa, aligning with a broader strategic pivot. While Africa is strategically important for its growing population and vast natural resources, a diminished US presence could create a power vacuum, potentially emboldening militant networks. As a result, African countries may need to seek new allies, with China and Russia already increasing their involvement on the continent.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied that the government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, arguing instead that it was made possible by an improved economy. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of £35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. Starmer stated that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and trade deals with the US, India, and the EU allowed the government to increase the eligibility threshold. Critics argue that the change will create new complexity in the tax system and that the government has already spent savings from the original cut.</p>

          <p>A Greek hiker died after falling into a 2,600-foot ravine in the Fraktou forest in northern Greece, following an encounter with a bear. According to a fellow hiker, the bear attacked, and after pepper spray was used, the bear knocked the victim into the ravine. Wildlife experts suggest the bear was likely acting defensively, not aggressively. The hiker was part of an effort to identify a more accessible route to a Greek warplane wreckage he had previously discovered.</p>

The judge ruled that the federal government cannot force recipients to halt programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or acknowledge the existence of transgender people in order to receive grant funding. The order will remain in effect during the legal case, with the judge stating that the funding provisions reflect an effort to censor constitutionally protected speech.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned President Donald Trump as "deranged" following the deployment of thousands more troops to Los Angeles amid protests against immigration raids. Approximately 700 US Marines have been sent to the area, and the number of National Guard troops has doubled to 4,000. Newsom said the move was fulfilling "the deranged fantasy of a dictatorial president" and that the state is suing the president for sending in troops without the governor's permission. Protests have spread to other US cities, with demonstrators taking to the streets after reports of ICE raids in Latino areas.</p>

The article critiques the “abundance agenda,” which blames bureaucratic red tape for delays in government programs, using rural broadband as an example. It contrasts the complicated Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program with the simpler Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), highlighting the failures of RDOF due to inaccurate mapping and lack of due diligence. The piece advocates for a mixed approach, including public options and regulations, similar to the New Deal era's rural electrification efforts.</p>
