          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst faced criticism at a town hall regarding potential Medicaid cuts under President Trump's legislative agenda. Constituents voiced concerns about the impact on vulnerable individuals, with one shouting that "people are going to die," to which Ernst responded, "Well, we all are going to die." Ernst defended the bill, asserting it would protect those eligible for Medicaid while removing ineligible recipients with access to other benefits. She also defended the work of the Department of Government Efficiency and stated that the bill would strengthen Medicaid by removing those who have options for other forms of health care off of the program, which elicited boos from the crowd.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk concluded his tenure as a "special government employee" leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), receiving praise from President Trump for his cost-cutting efforts. While Musk fell short of his initial $1 trillion savings promise, the White House claims DOGE saved $170 billion, though analyses suggest potential costs due to lost productivity. Musk defended DOGE's work, expressing confidence in achieving the $1 trillion goal eventually and reaffirmed his commitment to advising the president. He also publicly dissented from Trump's spending bill, citing concerns about the increasing budget deficit, stating his belief that a bill can be either big or beautiful, but not both.</p>
