        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Industries Corp. experienced a significant stock decline after the Toyota Group revealed a 4.7 trillion yen ($33 billion) deal to privatize the company. The offer includes a tender offer of $26 billion for Toyota Industries shares at 16,300 yen apiece, which is lower than the previous day's price. This move is part of a broader trend in Japan where firms are facing pressure to unwind cross-shareholding ties, and the investment from Akio Toyoda is seen as symbolic to enhance group unity. Despite the special committee requesting a higher offer price, the offeror rebuffed, leading some analysts to view the deal as unattractive. Optimism that this deal will benefit Toyota overall is tempered by concerns about the offer's fairness to Toyota Industries shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

Senior police chiefs have also cautioned that they will face difficult choices about which crimes to investigate if their budgets are cut.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to reduced public spending, weaker consumer demand, and decreased exports, impacted by extreme weather events.

          <p>Japan is looking to emulate the success of women's football in Europe, where some clubs draw larger crowds than men's games. The WE League in Japan, launched in 2021, aims to empower women but still relies heavily on subsidies. The UEFA Women's Champions League has seen record-breaking attendance, highlighting the growing popularity of women's football. Barcelona's women's team has become a successful model, generating substantial revenue through sponsorships and ticket sales, and Japan is trying to learn from these successes to stabilize its own league.</p>

He stated that the rising insurance premiums and high local taxes to already steep mortgage rates, housing affordability takes a major hit.
