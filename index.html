          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 06:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office is reportedly dealing with internal conflicts and a leak investigation, which insiders believe led to the dismissal of three senior aides. The investigation focuses on the disclosure of a classified document outlining military options for reclaiming the Panama Canal. Accusations and counter-accusations are flying, with some aides suggesting they were ousted due to their criticisms of Hegseth's chief of staff. The situation has narrowed Hegseth's inner circle and raised questions about his management abilities within the Pentagon.</p>

          <p>The annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner is facing a somber atmosphere this year, with critics suggesting it resembles a 'wake' for legacy media struggling to respond to Donald Trump. Comedian Amber Ruffin's invitation was revoked to avoid political division, and Trump himself is expected to boycott the event. The dinner, traditionally a mix of humor and politics, is now seen as a reflection of the media's challenges in the face of Trump's attacks and the rise of right-wing media. Concerns about declining relevance and failing strategies to combat Trump's narrative dominate the discourse.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a rapid increase in cocaine use, now exceeding heroin as the nation's primary illicit drug, as indicated by recent police data and expert analysis. Contributing factors include a saturated North American market and the Taliban's prohibition of opium cultivation in Afghanistan. The ease of access and affordability of cocaine, often facilitated through discreet messenger services, has further fueled the surge. Health officials are raising concerns about the significant risks associated with cocaine use, including potential heart attacks, strokes, and long-term psychological effects.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States have commenced negotiations in Oman to address Tehran's advancing nuclear program, with uranium enrichment serving as a focal point of discussion. The primary objective of these talks is to establish limitations on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the U.S. easing certain economic sanctions. While President Trump has expressed a preference for reaching a deal, he has also cautioned that military action remains a possibility if an agreement cannot be reached. These negotiations represent a continuation of efforts to address concerns surrounding Iran's nuclear ambitions following the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contrasts President Trump's deportation policies with his pardons for individuals convicted of crimes, particularly those involved in the January 6th Capitol attack. It highlights the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador without a criminal conviction, while individuals convicted of violent crimes during the Capitol riot were pardoned. The author argues that this disparity demonstrates a disregard for due process and constitutional rights, as Trump is freeing convicted criminals and deporting those who have not been convicted of any crime.</p>

          <p>Despite the visible impacts of climate change in Canada, including melting Arctic ice and record wildfires, the issue has faded from the forefront of the current election. Recent polling indicates that climate change is not among the top concerns for voters.
