        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has narrowly passed a bill to rescind $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The legislation, which faced delays due to debates over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, now heads to the president for his signature. The bill cuts approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs like USAID and $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The vote passed largely along party lines, with only two Republicans joining Democrats in opposition.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator has accused U.S. trading firm Jane Street of market manipulation, bringing the distinction between legal arbitrage and illegal market distortion into focus. The regulator alleges the firm used large stock trades to influence India's Nifty 50 index for profit in the options market. Experts note the key difference lies in intent, or "mens rea," and whether a firm is creating a price discrepancy rather than merely exploiting an existing one. Jane Street has disputed the allegations, claiming its activities were standard index arbitrage trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of the late Martin Hemmings has publicly accused Raynor Winn, author of the bestselling memoir "The Salt Path," of stealing approximately £64,000 from their business in the early 2000s. The allegations challenge the narrative in Winn's book about how she and her husband became homeless. The Hemmings family claims trusting Winn was their "biggest mistake" and that the financial loss nearly bankrupted them. Winn has acknowledged making "mistakes" in her past and stated the matter was settled privately on a non-admissions basis.</p>

          <p>Syrian government forces have largely withdrawn from the southern province of Sweida after days of intense clashes with Druze militias that killed nearly 600 people. A ceasefire, mediated by the U.S., Turkey, and Arab nations, was established to halt the violence, which had also drawn in Israeli airstrikes in defense of the Druze community. Under the truce, local Druze factions will manage internal security, though reports of retaliatory attacks and displacement of Sunni Bedouin communities have emerged. The conflict highlights ongoing sectarian tensions and the fragile state of Syria's post-war transition.</p>

          <p>The Wall Street Journal has reported that Donald Trump sent a lewd birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which was part of a collection compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell. The letter allegedly featured a mock dialogue inside the outline of a naked woman and a suggestive closing message. President Trump has vehemently denied the report, calling it a "fake story" and threatening to sue the newspaper and its owner, Rupert Murdoch. This development adds another layer to the ongoing controversy surrounding the president's handling of the Epstein case files.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved a plan to rescind $9 billion in federal funds, a move that completely eliminates the $1.1 billion budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This cut ends all federal support for NPR, PBS, and their local member stations across the country. NPR's CEO described the decision as an "irreversible loss" that will dismantle civic institutions and harm communities, particularly in rural and underserved areas that rely on public radio for news and emergency alerts.

          <p>In a late-night session, Congress passed a $9 billion spending cuts bill, sending it to the president just before a critical deadline. The measure, which slashes funding for USAID and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was a key objective for the White House and House Republican leadership.

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and abandoning the childhood notion that adulthood is a destination with clear answers. Instead, the piece suggests that life is a continuous process of becoming, where most people are improvising as they go. Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend to his own adulthood, the author explores themes of change, regret, and identity, particularly through the lens of being an immigrant in France. The essay concludes that while answers are scarce, the goal is to build a meaningful life from experiences.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of taking off and landing vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) transitions to horizontal flight after launch, combining the speed of a fixed-wing drone with the deployment flexibility of a quadcopter. During its debut drill in Sichuan province, the drone demonstrated advanced autonomous capabilities, including target allocation and threat avoidance. Its design resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, highlighting advancements in China's unmanned military technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence for the first time to create on-screen visual effects in one of its original shows, the Argentine sci-fi series "The Eternauts." Co-CEO Ted Sarandos stated that AI produced a scene of a collapsing building, enabling a high-quality effect that would have been too costly with traditional methods. He framed the technology as a tool to enhance creativity, not just reduce costs. The move comes after the entertainment industry has expressed significant concerns about AI replacing human jobs, a key issue in the 2023 Hollywood strikes.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after noting mild swelling in his lower legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described CVI as a common and benign vein condition, stating that tests found no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The announcement addresses public speculation fueled by images showing the president with swollen legs and a bruised hand, the latter of which was attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. A letter from the presidential physician affirmed Trump remains in excellent health.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general, calls the administration's action "arbitrary and capricious" and politically motivated. Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that jeopardizes jobs. The administration cited significant budget shortfalls and missed deadlines as the reason for pulling the funds from the ambitious project intended to connect Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>

          <p>A former senior intelligence officer from the Defense Intelligence Agency has described China's alleged experiments to create biologically enhanced soldiers as a "disturbing" reality. Speaking to NewsNation, Nicholas Eftimiades commented on claims that China is exploring gene-editing and other methods to create physically and mentally superior individuals for combat. He noted that while little is known about the program's progress, the fact that it operates under the People's Liberation Army is a major concern.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the reasons behind President Trump's recurring criticism of its chair, Jerome Powell. The Fed operates as an independent central bank with a dual mandate to maintain low unemployment and stable prices, primarily by setting interest rates. Trump's frustration stems from the Fed's decision to keep rates relatively high to combat inflation, a move he believes stifles economic growth. While the legality of firing a Fed chair is untested, the president's public pressure on the institution's independent monetary policy is highly unusual. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other locations in Sacramento, an action seemingly intended to challenge California's sanctuary state policies. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, stating there is "no such thing as a sanctuary state." The operation led to 11 arrests and drew immediate condemnation from Governor Gavin Newsom's office, which accused the agency of illegal racial profiling. The enforcement action occurred in a region covered by a federal injunction limiting the agency's ability to make arrests without reasonable suspicion.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, now permitting Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. The agency stated that Juul's scientific studies demonstrate its products can be a less harmful alternative for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision is a significant milestone for the company, which was widely blamed for fueling the teen vaping crisis and has since paid billions in legal settlements. Anti-tobacco advocates heavily criticized the move, arguing the product that caused the crisis should not be authorized.</p>

          <p>An analytical article argues that President Trump's announcement of a deal with Coca-Cola to use cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup is a political gesture with negligible public health benefits. While Mexican Coke, made with cane sugar, has a cult following for its taste, the piece notes that metabolically, the two sweeteners are nearly identical. The author suggests the move is an easy political win for Trump, aligning with the "Make America healthy again" movement but distracting from the real health issue of high sugar consumption from sodas in general, regardless of the sugar's source.</p>
