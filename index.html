          <p>China's market regulator, SAMR, has launched a preliminary anti-monopoly probe into Nvidia, alleging violations of the country's anti-monopoly law. The investigation is linked to Nvidia's 2020 acquisition of Mellanox, which was initially approved with conditions. The specific nature of the alleged breaches has not been detailed, but the ongoing scrutiny could complicate U.S.-China trade discussions. This development follows other recent Chinese probes into the semiconductor sector, highlighting escalating tech tensions between Beijing and Washington.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump is set for an unprecedented second state visit to the UK, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The visit will include traditional ceremonies like a carriage procession, military parade, and a formal dinner. This event is seen by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as historic, aiming to strengthen ties despite previous protocol breaches by Trump and other U.S. leaders. Beyond the pageantry, the visit is expected to address the global agenda and cement Trump's relationship with the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Defense Intelligence claims its special forces destroyed a Russian Buk-M3 surface-to-air missile system in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region. This significant defensive asset, valued at $40-50 million, was reportedly struck near Oleksandrivka, though the claim remains unverified. Concurrently, Romania reported an airspace breach by a Russian drone, prompting NATO to bolster its eastern front. Russia's ambassador to Romania dismissed these allegations as a deliberate provocation by Kyiv, denying responsibility for the intrusion.</p>

          <p>North Korea has formally stated that its status as a nuclear weapons state is "irreversible," rejecting international efforts to halt its weapons production. This declaration coincides with the launch of 'Freedom Edge 25,' joint military exercises by the United States, South Korea, and Japan off Jeju Island. North Korea's officials accused the U.S. of nuclear threat escalation and hypocrisy regarding non-proliferation. The International Atomic Energy Agency has previously condemned North Korea's nuclear programs as clear violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has launched a year-long anti-dumping investigation into general-purpose interface and gate driver chips from the U.S., specifically those built on 40nm and above process nodes. These 'legacy chips' are crucial for cost-sensitive applications like smart home appliances and industrial motor drives. The probe was initiated following concerns from the Jiangsu Provincial Semiconductor Industry Association about a significant decline in prices for U.S.-origin products throughout 2024. Major U.S. chipmakers like Texas Instruments and Broadcom are expected to be affected by this investigation.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is facing increasing pressure within the Labour party following his decision to sack U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson.

The incident, combined with previous high-profile resignations, has intensified discontent, with some suggesting Starmer's position could be jeopardized if May's elections yield poor results for Labour.</p>

          <p>China's economic slowdown intensified in August, with retail sales and industrial output missing analysts' expectations, reflecting persistent weak domestic demand. Retail sales grew 3.4% year-on-year, down from July, while industrial output growth slowed to 5.2%, its weakest in a year. Fixed-asset investment also saw a sharp slowdown, particularly in real estate, which contracted 12.9% in the first eight months. The urban unemployment rate slightly increased, attributed to the graduation season. The statistics bureau acknowledged external uncertainties and domestic challenges, indicating a need for continued macro-policy support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea announced an investigation into potential human rights violations during a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean workers were detained for a week, prompting South Korea to express "strong regret" to the U.S. and demand protection of its citizens' rights. President Lee Jae-myung warned that such incidents could deter foreign investment into the U.S., while former President Donald Trump stated foreign workers are welcome and he doesn't want to 'frighten off' investors. The raid has delayed the plant's opening by at least two months.</p>

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has voiced strong criticism, asserting that the club has 'got worse' under manager Ruben Amorim. Despite Amorim's appointment ten months ago and significant investment in new signings, United suffered a dismal 3-0 derby defeat to Manchester City, with many fans leaving early. Rooney highlighted a lack of progression and clear patterns of play, noting the team's lowest league position since 1989-90 last season. He specifically questioned Amorim's rigid 3-4-3 system, arguing that the midfield is consistently overrun and overpowered.</p>

          <p>The UK and US governments have unveiled a series of transatlantic deals aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of modular nuclear reactors in Britain. This landmark partnership, expected to be formalized during President Donald Trump's visit, includes plans for up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool by X-Energy and Centrica, potentially creating 2,500 jobs. The agreement will fast-track safety checks, halving licensing times, and aims to attract billions in private investment. Other projects include nuclear-powered data centers and micro modular reactors, all contributing to energy security and reducing reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028.</p>

Gulf leaders convened to show solidarity with Qatar, while India, China, and Russia met in Tianjin, signaling potential new blocs. This article argues that Trump's unreliability is pushing allies to seek alternative means of shoring up their sovereignty, as the understanding that underpins existing security and economic pacts is being broken.
