          <p>According to a New York Times opinion columnist, the Democratic Party's issues extend beyond its leaders, stemming from a failure to adapt to a shifting historical era marked by distrust in social systems. The columnist suggests that voters feel the social systems of society are rigged, corrupted, and malevolent. He argues that Republicans have been more successful in adjusting to this change, as Trump's message resonates with those who feel alienated by elites. The columnist implies that the Democratic Party needs a fundamental shift in worldview, not just new leaders or messages, to address these challenges. The columnist claims that Trump has taken the atmosphere of alienation and magnified it, which has created a revolutionary government.</p>

This limitation would affect about a third of children, undermining the intended benefits of the tax credit increase.
