          <p>Consumer prices in May increased by 2.4% compared to the previous year, with a slight monthly increase of 0.1%, according to the Labor Department. Falling gasoline prices helped offset rising costs in rent and groceries, but Trump's tariffs may have contributed to rising prices in some goods like appliances and toys. Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that the tariffs could reverse progress made on inflation over the past two years, potentially making the Fed cautious about additional interest rate cuts. The central bank is expected to hold interest rates steady at their next meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

Weakness in energy and services prices helped offset some increases, and key items expected to show tariff-related increases, such as vehicle and apparel prices, posted declines.

          <p>President Trump announced that a U.S. trade deal with China is complete, pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, following trade talks in London that yielded a "framework deal." The agreement would see China maintain its current 10% tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports. Under the agreement, China will supply full magnets and necessary rare earths, and the U.S. will provide what was agreed to, including allowing Chinese students to attend U.S. colleges and universities. While the announcement was thin on details, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the framework deal puts meat on the bones of an agreement reached last month in Geneva to ease bilateral retaliatory tariffs.

          <p>The UK's Spending Review outlines spending from 2026 onwards, affecting jobs, free school meals, local services, transport, and energy bills. The defence sector and the NHS are set to receive significant government funding, while other areas may face cuts. All children in England whose parents receive universal credit will be able to claim free school meals from September 2026. The £3 bus fare cap will continue until at least March 2027, and there will be more help for pensioners in winter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in May rose 2.4% on an annual basis, as economists watch for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting consumer prices. The CPI was forecast to rise 2.5% last month, an increase from April's 2.3% rate. While inflation remains lower than its post-pandemic peak, it is still higher than the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%. Wall Street expects the Fed to hold off on cutting rates until later this year, closely monitoring when Trump's tariffs will show up in inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The author discusses the growing gap between the tech culture of the Bay Area and the policy concerns in Washington, DC, regarding AI. The author criticizes the budget reconciliation bill for not taking AI seriously, particularly its moratorium on state-level AI regulation and cuts to clean energy subsidies. The author argues that the bill's work requirements for programs like Medicaid and food stamps are ill-suited for a world where AI could automate a significant share of human labor. The author suggests that these policies could exacerbate the negative effects of AI-driven job displacement.</p>
