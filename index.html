          <h2>Psychological Discomfort with Compliments Explained in New Comic</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new comic from NPR's Life Kit explores the science behind why many people feel awkward or uncomfortable when receiving compliments. The piece features insights from social psychologist Erica Boothby and behavioral scientist Xuan Zhao, who explain that one's reaction to praise reveals much about their self-perception. Accepting compliments graciously is not only beneficial for oneself but also positively affects the person offering the praise. The comic aims to help readers understand and better navigate these common social interactions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>International leaders are increasingly using praise and flattery as a key diplomatic tool when engaging with President Donald Trump during his second term, a notable shift from the more skeptical approach of his first. The article details instances involving leaders from the UK, Israel, and the European Union who have offered grand compliments and gestures, such as Nobel Prize nominations, to foster positive relations and achieve their policy objectives. Experts suggest this strategy acknowledges that appealing directly to Trump is the most effective way to secure favorable outcomes, such as increased NATO spending and trade deals.</p>

          <p>Japan's meteorological agency has confirmed that the country experienced its hottest July since record-keeping began in 1898, with average temperatures nearly three degrees Celsius above normal. This record-breaking heat follows an unusually early end to the rainy season and has led to warnings of continued "severe heat" for August. The extreme weather, linked to climate change, is also having tangible effects on the environment, such as causing Japan's iconic cherry trees to bloom irregularly.</p>

          <p>Germany has recorded its highest-ever number of domestic violence victims, with nearly 257,000 cases registered in 2024, according to figures from the Federal Criminal Police Office.

          <p>China has tightened its import regulations for durians from Vietnam after detecting unsafe levels of the metal cadmium and other compounds in recent shipments. The new measures require enhanced pre-export safety checks and mandate that all shipments be tested upon arrival, with any non-compliant fruit being returned or destroyed. These stricter rules have already led to a significant, 45% year-on-year decrease in the value of fresh durian imports from Vietnam in the first half of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues EU Must Reject 'Humiliating' Trade Deal with the United States</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian argues that the European Union's recent trade deal with the Trump administration is a "humiliation" that must be rejected. The authors contend that the agreement is a one-sided capitulation that damages Europe's international credibility, hurts its exporters, and goes against its strategic investment interests. They call on EU governments and the European Parliament to reverse course and renegotiate, asserting that the current deal unilaterally trades away long-term European principles.

          <p>A Miami jury has found Tesla liable for a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system, ordering the company to pay $243 million to the family of a woman who was killed and her injured boyfriend. The court determined that Tesla was negligent because its Autopilot technology failed and the company did not restrict its use to controlled-access highways as intended. This verdict marks the first time Tesla has been ordered to pay damages after a trial over its Autopilot feature; the company plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>Two men accused of running an illegal cannabis extraction operation in Los Angeles County have been charged with five counts of murder.

          <p>HBO has announced that "And Just Like That...," the reboot of the popular series "Sex and the City," will conclude after its third season. Showrunner Michael Patrick King stated that it felt like a "wonderful place to stop" as he was writing the finale. The revival followed the original characters navigating life and love in their 50s but faced progressively declining viewership and criticism for its attempts to diversify the cast and for apparent plot holes during its run.</p>
