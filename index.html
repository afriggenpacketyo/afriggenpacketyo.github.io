        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The town of Clarksdale, Mississippi, is experiencing a resurgence in attention thanks to the success of Ryan Coogler's film *Sinners*, which earned over $300 million globally. Clarksdale, known as the starting place for blues legends like Sam Cooke and Muddy Waters, has faced economic struggles similar to other small towns in the US South. Coogler held six free screenings in Clarksdale after a local campaign led by Tyler Yarbrough, allowing residents to see their town represented with careful detail in the 1932-set film. The movie is expected to significantly boost tourism and provide economic benefits, as visitors seek to experience the history and culture depicted in the film, bringing much needed revenue to the local economy. The movie serves as a means for the town's residents to grasp the history that lives on the streets of Clarksdale, preserving the rich cultural heritage for generations to come.</p>

          <p>Mexican-American singer √Ångela Aguilar is using her platform to advocate for immigrant rights, defying industry norms that discourage discussing politics and religion. During Billboard Women in Music, Aguilar delivered a powerful speech in favor of immigrants and performed alongside Harmony Project, a choir of immigrant children. She expressed concern over the current situation for immigrants in the United States, emphasizing the importance of speaking out against injustice. Aguilar also suggested visiting the National Day Laborer Organizing Network (NDLON) website for information on immigrant rights and how to handle potential detentions, suggesting that she might eventually incorporate social issues into her music, citing La Santa Cecilia's song 'El Hielo (ICE)' as inspiration. Aguilar's commitment extends beyond words, she actively works to raise awareness and provide resources for immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The White House is urging Iran to accept a proposed nuclear deal following an IAEA report indicating a rapid increase in Iran's stockpile of near weapons-grade enriched uranium. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that it is in Iran's "best interest to accept" the proposal, emphasizing President Trump's stance that Iran must never obtain a nuclear bomb. The IAEA's report revealed that Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% had increased significantly, raising concerns about potential weaponization. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but U.S. intelligence agencies suggest the country is positioning itself to produce a nuclear device if it chooses, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the IAEA report "grave."</p>

          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned of an "imminent" threat from China to Taiwan, urging Asian countries to increase defense spending and collaborate with the US to deter war. Speaking at the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, Hegseth accused China of seeking to become a "hegemonic power" and preparing to use military force to alter the balance of power in Asia, and referred to a 2027 deadline that President Xi Jinping has allegedly given for China's military to be capable of invading Taiwan. China responded by accusing the US of being the "biggest troublemaker" for regional peace, while Hegseth emphasized that the US does not seek conflict with China but will ensure China cannot dominate its allies. To prevent war, the US aims to forge a strong deterrent with allies, urging them to increase defense spending and become partners rather than dependents on the US.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This initiative, part of the government's strategic defense review, aims to create an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up. The factories are expected to support the production of over 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, creating approximately 1,800 new jobs across the country, strengthening the armed forces and boosting British jobs. The investment comes in response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions, increasing production of artillery shells, next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) and long-range Storm Shadow cruise missiles.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is taking aggressive actions against Harvard University, including threatening to redirect research funding and instructing federal agencies to find alternative vendors, citing concerns about antisemitism and a lack of conservative viewpoints. These measures have sparked concern across American higher education, with some viewing it as an attempt to erode traditional pillars of support for the Democratic Party and reshape universities in a more conservative image. While Harvard has resisted these demands, other universities have accommodated the administration's pressure, raising questions about the long-term impact on academic independence and the diversity of thought on college campuses. The actions highlight a broader debate about the role of universities in shaping American society and the extent to which they should be subject to political influence.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for key sectors like the NHS, defense, and education. With spending having been "front-loaded" earlier in the parliamentary term, the IFS suggests that future spending increases will slow down, requiring difficult decisions. The level of funding allocated to the NHS will significantly impact other "unprotected" departments, potentially leading to real-terms cuts. The IFS also notes that increased defense spending could further strain resources, as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to balance fiscal responsibility with competing priorities.</p>

          <h2>Disposable Vape Ban Begins in the UK: Will It Curb Teen Vaping?</h2>

          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes has come into force across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment by targeting a key driver in the rise of youth vaping. Shops and supermarkets are prohibited from stocking disposable vapes, though rechargeable and refillable devices remain available. Retailers violating the ban face fines, with the goal of reducing the appeal of vaping among young people, as vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking but has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known. While experts predict the ban will have a significant impact, they also emphasize the need for further regulation to fully address youth vaping.</p>

          <p>Following a 5-0 defeat to PSG in the Champions League final, Inter Milan faces the prospect of a rebuild, focusing on younger players with potential assets. The team's average age was notably higher than PSG's, highlighting the need for fresh energy and talent. Inzaghi, Inter's coach, acknowledged the team was tired and lacked freshness compared to PSG, who had wrapped up their league season earlier. While Inzaghi's future with the club is uncertain, the team will have to find new clubs for some of their players if they do decide a refresh is in order.</p>

          <p>The US has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal amid growing concerns over Iran's uranium enrichment activities, confirmed by the White House. The proposal follows an IAEA report indicating that Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a level close to weapons-grade. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged receiving "elements of a US deal" from his Omani counterpart, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized that it is in Tehran's "best interest to accept" the deal. The US proposal "will be appropriately responded to in line with the principles, national interests and rights of the people of Iran", according to Araghchi.</p>

          <p>A scientist based in Singapore warns that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be hacked due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers, which could be exploited by eavesdroppers. The researcher, Alexander Miller, analyzed data and found time delays between the lasers on the quantum transmitter, indicating insecure distribution of quantum keys. While quantum communication is theoretically unhackable, Miller's findings suggest that flaws in experimental implementation can create vulnerabilities, and realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to various types of side-channel attacks that rely on flaws in experimental implementation. This raises concerns about the security of China's expanding quantum communication network.</p>
