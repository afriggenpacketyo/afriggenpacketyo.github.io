          <p>China's Cyberspace Administration has summoned US chipmaker Nvidia to address potential security vulnerabilities in its H20 chips. The regulator is concerned about alleged "back door safety" issues that could allow for unauthorized tracking and remote control of the hardware. Nvidia has been asked to provide a formal explanation and relevant evidence to clarify the matter and assuage the government's security concerns. This inquiry highlights the ongoing technological tensions and scrutiny faced by US tech firms operating in China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed 25% tariffs and an unspecified penalty on Indian imports, but New Delhi is not rushing to secure a trade agreement. India is primarily protecting its agricultural sector, a significant voting bloc, from increased US market access, a stance it has maintained in other trade negotiations. Economists note that because US exports are a small part of India's economy, it has leverage to resist demands. India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, diversifying its trade partnerships to navigate global economic pressures on its own terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, which fell by more than half compared to the previous year, missing analyst expectations. The primary cause was a staggering 93.8% plunge in profits from its crucial chip business, attributed to inventory adjustments and China-related export restrictions. Despite the poor results, the company expressed optimism for a second-half recovery, citing growing momentum in AI and robotics. The mobile division, however, saw improved sales driven by its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals the extensive scale of illegal tobacco and vape sales across Britain, controlled by organized crime gangs. In Newport, South Wales, 19 shops on a single street were shut down in nine months for selling illicit goods, with locals reporting intimidation and open drug dealing. Trading Standards officers describe an "endless battle," as criminals often use "stash cars" for stock and quickly reopen closed shops or move to new locations. The report highlights the limited powers available to local councils to combat the problem, which also involves forced labor.</p>

The deal reportedly includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into the U.S., but officials from both nations appear to have different understandings of the terms. While the White House claims 90% of the profits from this investment will go to Americans, South Korean officials suggest the funds are for reinvestment and to help their companies expand.

The bill faced opposition from some Democrats who were concerned that a related provision, criminalizing loitering to purchase sex, could be used to profile minorities.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. A source close to Harris indicated that while she considered the role, her heart wasn't in it, and this choice keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion at the Horizon Biofuels plant in Fremont, Nebraska, has resulted in the deaths of three people: an adult male employee and two young girls. The children were reportedly at the facility waiting for the employee, Dylan Danielson, to go to a doctor's appointment. The blast, which occurred on Tuesday, tore through the plant, causing a fire that smoldered for nearly a day and hindered rescue efforts. The focus of the operation shifted from rescue to recovery as officials worked to locate the three missing individuals, whose bodies were later recovered from the wreckage.</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and its traditional allies over the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Canada, France, and the UK have all announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the Trump administration has boycotted and condemned. This divergence follows the administration's decision to discard previous principles for a post-war Gaza, leaving a strategic vacuum. European nations, spurred by the humanitarian crisis, are now pushing for a revived two-state solution and increased aid, even without the support of their American counterparts.</p>

          <p>One of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, an 8.8 magnitude temblor off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, triggered tsunami waves across the Pacific. While the waves caused flooding in Russia and prompted evacuations in Hawaii, Japan, and along the US West Coast, the threat of major damage has largely passed for the United States. Tsunami warnings were downgraded to advisories, which were later lifted in most areas. However, several South American countries issued new warnings as the series of powerful waves continued to travel across the ocean, highlighting the quake's far-reaching impact.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a "full and complete trade deal" with South Korea, setting a 15% tariff on its imports just before a critical deadline. This rate is lower than the 25% levy that was previously threatened. The agreement also includes a $350 billion investment from Seoul into the US, with a significant portion dedicated to revitalizing the American shipbuilding industry. For its part, South Korea successfully protected its sensitive rice and beef markets from further US imports. The deal places South Korea on a similar footing to Japan, which recently secured a comparable tariff rate.</p>

          <p>Following a recent executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles has restricted the construction of duplexes on single-family lots in Pacific Palisades. The move comes after residents of the fire-ravaged community raised concerns that building more dense housing under the state's SB 9 law would worsen evacuation risks in future wildfires. The order creates a temporary pause on such projects in designated high-fire-hazard zones. While officials have blocked SB 9 duplexes, they have simultaneously worked to streamline permits for Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), which have been more popular among rebuilding homeowners.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to the UK government for the expansion of Heathrow Airport. The Arora Group's plan, named Heathrow West, features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and disruptive need to divert the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would be cheaper, less risky, and could be fully operational by 2035, challenging the airport's own expansion plans. This marks the first time a rival bid has been formally considered for the long-debated project, introducing new competition into the process.</p>

While options trading revenue was robust, cryptocurrency and equities trading came in slightly below forecasts.
