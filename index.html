          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a threatened tariff hike by the Trump administration. The deal establishes a 15% tariff rate on many EU imports, a reduction from the proposed 30%, and includes provisions for tariff-free trade on select items like aircraft and some generic drugs. The EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years, although some details, such as tariffs on European wine, are still being negotiated. The legality of the tariffs remains under judicial review, with a case pending in an appeals court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a sailboat in Biscayne Bay, near Miami Beach, has resulted in the deaths of two children. The sailboat, carrying five children and a counselor from a summer sailing program, sank after the impact, throwing all occupants into the water. A 7-year-old and a 13-year-old girl were killed, while two other girls, aged 8 and 11, remain in critical condition. The U.S. Coast Guard has launched an investigation into the incident and established a safety zone around the submerged wreckage.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort casino in Reno, Nevada, has left three people dead and three others injured. The incident began when a suspect opened fire in the valet area, killing one person and injuring four others before a casino security guard intervened. The gunman then proceeded through the parking lot, fatally shooting a sixth victim before being engaged and wounded by responding police officers. Authorities have stated there is no known connection between the suspect, who is in critical condition, and the victims.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced daily 10-hour "tactical pauses" in fighting in parts of the Gaza Strip to allow for the distribution of humanitarian aid. This measure aims to create secure land routes for the UN and other agencies to address the severe hunger crisis affecting the Palestinian population. The pauses will occur in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah, and Muwasi, while military operations continue in other areas. While the move was welcomed by aid organizations as a necessary step, they reiterated that a comprehensive ceasefire is required to reach all civilians in need.</p>

The lawmakers were attempting to inspect the facility amid reports of inhumane conditions, and Van Hollen has been a vocal critic of the administration's immigration raids.

          <p>This article analyzes how President Trump's reliance on television news shapes his understanding of global events, using his recent comments on starvation in Gaza as a key example. Despite having access to extensive intelligence, Trump appeared to form his opinion that the hunger is real based on media images, stating "you can’t fake that." This tendency makes him susceptible to media narratives and manipulation, as his policy reactions often align with shifts in public opinion driven by TV coverage. The analysis argues this approach is particularly dangerous in an era of misinformation and deepfakes, potentially leading to erratic policy decisions.</p>

This is part of a broader initiative to train 700 Haitian police and soldiers abroad, who will then support a U.N.-backed, Kenyan-led security mission. With only about 10,000 officers for a population of nearly 12 million, Haiti's security forces are severely undermanned as gangs control up to 90% of the capital.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from real estate brokerage Redfin estimates that the Palisades wildfire in January caused approximately $51.7 billion in damage to residential properties within Los Angeles city limits. The analysis focused on about 11,000 parcels, mostly single-family homes, many of which were completely destroyed in the 23,000-acre blaze. The fire devastated the affluent Pacific Palisades neighborhood, where the average home value was $3.7 million prior to the disaster. This estimate does not include commercial properties or public infrastructure, suggesting the total economic loss from the fires is even higher.</p>

          <p>The Israeli government is standing by a military official who claimed images of starving Palestinians in Gaza are "fake" and distributed by Hamas. This position creates a rift with President Trump, who stated on Monday that he believes the images depict "real starvation" and that "you can't fake that." The dispute comes amid increasing international pressure on Israel over the dire humanitarian crisis, with two Israeli human rights groups recently labeling the situation a genocide. An Israeli official reiterated the government's stance that aid distribution is being hampered by the UN, not by Israeli restrictions.</p>

The court ruled that the Foreign Office must "think again" about its refusal to help the family of six, who are living in a tent and are at "constant risk of injury or death." The family, who has a British relative, was granted permission to come to the UK in January but has been unable to leave Gaza to complete the necessary biometric checks. The government's policy typically limits such assistance to exceptional cases, but the judge found this situation to be legally exceptional.</p>
