        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year, balancing potential inflation pressures with recession worries. Bostic expressed concerns about rising inflation expectations following a consumer sentiment survey highlighting fears of tariffs driving prices higher. While not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bostic emphasized his worry about the inflation side of the Fed's dual mandate, noting that troublesome movements in expectations could complicate the Fed's job. He also acknowledged that even reduced tariffs are economically significant, impacting the central bank's considerations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets experienced turbulence as stocks fell, the dollar weakened, and bond yields rose after a credit rating downgrade highlighted concerns about President Trump's policies and economic health. Moody's downgrade cited the tax cut legislation and worries about fiscal deficits and growing debt costs. This has raised concerns about the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, potentially leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic noted that the downgrade would have implications for the cost of capital. Investors also pushed up the price of gold, a traditional safe-haven asset during times of market stress.</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw the political center narrowly fend off challenges from hard-right nationalist forces.

Poland's election saw liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski secure a spot in a runoff against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, though hard-right candidates garnered significant support.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on auto parts are causing job losses in Windsor, Ontario, the heart of Canada's auto-parts manufacturing industry. Many small parts makers are struggling with the financial burden of the 25 percent tariffs on imported autos and parts. The tariffs have led to layoffs and uncertainty, particularly for smaller businesses without the resources to absorb the impact. While automakers are unlikely to move assembly plants, there is growing concern that tariffs will devastate parts makers, threatening the livelihoods of thousands of workers and the economic stability of the region.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is betting that the public is ready to move on from Brexit as the UK and EU reach a new deal on post-Brexit relations. Starmer's goal is to make the agreement seem as insignificant and uncontroversial as possible. The view within the government is that there is no public desire to reopen the major questions of Brexit, such as membership of the single market and customs union. Pragmatism, however, is in the eye of the beholder, with Conservatives criticizing the deal as a "surrender" and Reform UK making similar arguments.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. According to a statement from his office, Biden was diagnosed with "prostate cancer, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone." The statement noted that while this is a "more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management." Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

          <p>Health officials are renewing calls for vigilance against bird flu, but experts are puzzled by the absence of new human cases in recent months. Questions arise whether government cuts have weakened the search for cases, if immigrant farm workers are hesitant to seek testing due to deportation concerns, or if it's a natural decline in infections. Despite the CDC's assessment of low risk to the general public, experts warn that each new infection increases the potential for the virus to mutate into a more severe form.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns. CDs allow you to lock in today's high rates for the term, and they generally come with FDIC or NCUA insurance. The current national average CD rates vary by term, with 1-year CDs yielding around 2.00% APY. To get a good CD rate, consider looking at online banks, which often offer more competitive rates, and consider short-term CDs, which may have higher interest rates than longer terms.

          <p>Navigating the housing market can be challenging due to high mortgage rates and limited inventory. However, securing a good rate is still possible, especially with a strong credit score. As of May 19, 2025, average mortgage rates are 6.03% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.84% for a 30-year mortgage. Taylor Jessee, CFP, suggests that if the Fed stops raising rates, mortgage rates may also stabilize. To improve your chances of qualifying for a great rate, strengthen your credit profile, shop around for different lenders, and compare loan terms and fees. (not investment advice)</p>
