          <p>General Motors outperformed Wall Street's first-quarter estimates but is reassessing its 2025 financial guidance due to potential cost increases and uncertainties surrounding Donald Trump's auto tariffs. GM is suspending additional stock buybacks and calling its previous guidance unreliable until further clarity is achieved regarding economic and regulatory environments. The company expects the tariffs to have a significant impact and is evaluating actions to mitigate additional costs, with potential investment shifts in U.S. manufacturing. Despite strong first-quarter results, including a net income of $2.78 billion, GM cited foreign exchange impacts and increased labor and warranty expenses as factors affecting profit margins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neil Gorsuch, a Supreme Court Justice, may become an unexpected check on a potential second Trump presidency due to his long-held belief in limiting executive power. Gorsuch, along with other conservative justices, has previously supported rulings that curtailed the power of federal agencies during the Biden administration, establishing precedents like the 'major questions doctrine'. This doctrine allows the Court to block executive actions deemed too ambitious, potentially hindering Trump's ability to enact policies such as tariffs. While the court has shown deference to Trump in the past, the presence of established legal principles and a growing opposition from Republican legal elites could lead to the Court striking down Trump's tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Space Agency's Biomass satellite, nicknamed 'space brolly,' has been successfully launched to assess the amount of carbon stored in the world's forests. Equipped with a unique radar that can penetrate clouds and forest canopies, the satellite will 'weigh' forests to determine the quantity of carbon stored within trees. This information will enable scientists to create more accurate climate change models and monitor deforestation rates, offering a consistent view of forests regardless of cloud cover. The satellite's radar technology uses a long wavelength, allowing it to see deeper into forests and analyze woody material, which serves as a proxy for stored carbon dioxide.</p>

          <p>The ACLU, representing early childhood organizations, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop the dismantling of Head Start, alleging that the actions require congressional approval. The suit claims that directives to strip the program of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts are unconstitutionally vague and violate teachers' free speech. The lawsuit comes after federal judges blocked similar anti-DEI guidance in K-12 public schools. Head Start, which serves low-income families, has faced multiple disruptions, including funding delays and office closures, since Trump took office.</p>

          <p>A cyber attack has disrupted operations at Marks & Spencer (M&S), leading to empty food shelves in some stores and pausing online orders. The retailer confirmed limited availability in some stores, and is working to restore normal operations within a few days, but full recovery may take until the end of the week. The attack has also impacted M&S's supply of products to Ocado, and customers are unable to place online orders, potentially denting profits during a busy retailing period.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre was unseated as the parliamentary representative of his Ottawa district in a surprising upset, potentially jeopardizing his leadership of the party. Poilievre, who had been representing Carleton since 2004, lost the seat to Liberal candidate Bruce Fanjoy. Poilievre had embraced rhetoric similar to Trump's, railing against 'radical woke ideology' and pledging to defund Canada's national broadcaster.</p>

          <p>Despite polling showing disapproval of Trump's handling of the economy and tariffs, his 2024 voters express continued confidence in his economic leadership. While some acknowledge concerns about prices and stock market volatility, they overwhelmingly stand by their vote for Trump. Many believe his policies will strengthen the economy in the long term, although some acknowledge the potential for a short-term recession.</p>
