          <p>Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as the first-ever vice president of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), a move seen as designating a successor. Al-Sheikh, a veteran leader of Abbas' Fatah movement, is now considered the frontrunner to succeed the 89-year-old president. This decision comes amidst pressure from Western and Arab allies to reform the Palestinian Authority (PA) and address doubts over Palestinian leadership, although the appointment is unlikely to improve Fatah's image among Palestinians who view the party as corrupt and out of touch.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US President Donald Trump met at the Vatican ahead of Pope Francis's funeral. The White House described the 15-minute meeting in St Peter's Basilica as "very productive" and Zelensky later called it "very symbolic" with the "potential to become historic".
