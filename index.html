The live-streamed meeting has featured tense exchanges between the panel members and outside medical experts over the process and interpretation of safety data. These deliberations are crucial as they inform the CDC's official guidance on vaccination protocols for the public. The panel is also set to review recommendations for other vaccines, including those for Hepatitis B, during the session.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led measure to temporarily fund the government until November 21 has failed to advance in the Senate after narrowly passing the House, leaving no clear path to avert a shutdown before the October 1 deadline. The legislative stalemate occurred as Senate Democrats opposed the bill, citing a lack of negotiation on their priorities, while Republican leadership showed little interest in compromising. With both chambers now in recess, pressure is mounting to find a bipartisan solution to keep federal agencies operational.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he was not pressured by President Donald Trump on how to vote regarding interest rates during the recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than was ultimately approved, confirmed he had a brief congratulatory call with the president but did not discuss his policy decision. This comes amid heightened scrutiny over the central bank's independence, as Trump has been openly critical of the Fed's policies and has sought to influence its decisions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the filing for containing excessive political rhetoric and superfluous allegations rather than focusing on the legal claims. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, allowing Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professionally structured complaint that adheres to standard legal formats and is limited to 40 pages.</p>

          <p>Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, described by President Trump as a "warrior for Free Speech," has taken an aggressive regulatory stance against media outlets critical of the administration. Carr has initiated investigations into major broadcast networks and publicly supported Trump's lawsuits against them, actions that critics view as an intimidation tactic to stifle independent reporting. This approach has culminated in pressure that led to ABC suspending host Jimmy Kimmel, raising significant concerns among former FCC officials and free speech advocates about government overreach.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping "made progress" during a phone call aimed at finalizing a deal regarding the ownership of TikTok. Following the discussion, Trump stated he agreed to visit China early next year and that the two leaders would also meet at the upcoming APEC Summit. While a framework for an agreement was reached earlier in the week, it remains unclear if the deal was fully completed during the call. The U.S. has been pressuring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A powerful storm system has battered Southern California, triggering significant mudslides in San Bernardino County and leading to a desperate search for a missing two-year-old boy. The child, Xavier Padilla, was swept away by floodwaters in Barstow while in a car with his father. The storm buried roads, trapping numerous drivers, and caused debris flows in areas previously affected by wildfire burn scars. Emergency crews are working to clear roads and locate the missing child as the region braces for potential further tropical weather.</p>

          <p>The resolution of TikTok's ownership in the U.S. may depend on a licensing agreement for its highly effective and secretive recommendation algorithm. While the Chinese government has previously opposed the sale of this technology, a potential deal could allow a new U.S. entity to use it under specific terms, addressing national security concerns while allowing parent company ByteDance to retain some intellectual property rights. This arrangement aims to resolve the dispute that led to a U.S. law requiring ByteDance to divest or face a ban, which President Trump has delayed enforcing.</p>

          <p>A group of prominent Hollywood actors and filmmakers, including Javier Bardem and Joaquin Phoenix, have pledged to boycott Israel's state-funded film industry in protest of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The pledge, organized by Film Workers for Palestine, targets Israeli film institutions and production companies, drawing inspiration from past boycotts against apartheid South Africa. The action has drawn criticism from some Israeli film industry leaders, who argue it is counterproductive and harms filmmakers who are often critical of their own government.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. For a $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term, the average monthly payment has dropped to approximately $608, down from about $640 last September. Since HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust automatically to changes in the broader rate environment, allowing borrowers to benefit from monetary easing without needing to refinance.

The judge noted the seriousness of the offense but also considered mitigating factors, including his immediate guilty plea and non-aggressive behavior.

However, this downward trend is contingent on inflation continuing to ease.
