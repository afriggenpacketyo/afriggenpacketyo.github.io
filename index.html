          <p>House Democrats are formally requesting Jeffrey Epstein's 2003 "birthday book" from his estate, which is reported to contain a letter from Donald Trump. The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related files. This request comes as Trump is suing The Wall Street Journal for reporting on the letter and as his administration faces pressure to declassify more documents related to the disgraced financier. The House Oversight Committee is also pursuing a deposition with Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

          <p>The community of La Crosse, Wisconsin, is in shock following the death of 22-year-old graduate student Eliotte Heinz, whose body was found in the Mississippi River after she went missing. While authorities do not suspect foul play, her death has reignited long-standing concerns about safety in the college town, particularly for students walking home late at night from downtown bars near the river. Friends and residents describe Heinz as a kind and happy person, and her tragic death has prompted calls for increased vigilance and safety measures. This incident adds to a history of accidental drownings in the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former NBC Cable President Tom Rogers, previously a self-described "raging bull" on Netflix, has expressed growing concerns about the streaming giant's future. He points to declining viewing time per subscriber and increasing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube as significant headwinds. Rogers also suggests that while AI can help Netflix with targeted ads and cost-cutting, it could also empower independent creators on YouTube, further blurring the line between amateur and professional content. Despite a positive recent earnings report, he believes these engagement trends are a worrisome sign for the company's long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's ambitious promises of driverless cars and an expanding robotaxi service, Tesla investors are showing increasing concern over the company's immediate financial performance. The electric vehicle maker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales for the second quarter, facing challenges from lower-cost competitors and political backlash. Musk's futuristic vision, which once bolstered the stock, failed to prevent a significant share drop following the earnings report. Analysts note that while long-term projects like robotaxis are interesting, the company needs to address its current profitability and growth issues first.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why Donald Trump has been unable to effectively counter the controversy surrounding his connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" argue the issue resonates deeply with his base, which is typically animated by distrust of powerful elites operating in secret. By appearing to defend powerful figures and withhold information, Trump is acting contrary to the anti-establishment narrative that he has cultivated. This contradiction is a key reason the story has gained so much traction and why the president is finding it difficult to shake the political fallout from the case.</p>

          <p>A recent US study has discovered the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as "forever chemicals," in a significant portion of reusable period products. Researchers found that nearly a third of tested period underwear, menstrual cups, and reusable pads contained these toxic chemicals, which are linked to cancer, immune system issues, and fertility problems. The article explains that PFAS can be absorbed through the skin and also contaminate the environment when the products are disposed of. Since some brands produce these items without PFAS, the study suggests consumer awareness and demand can drive manufacturers to eliminate these unnecessary and harmful substances.</p>

          <p>Following a directive from Donald Trump, the Justice Department is seeking to unseal grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, but legal experts are skeptical it will reveal a complete picture. This article explains that while the transcripts could contain victim testimony, they are only a small part of the overall investigation. Veteran attorneys argue that more significant information likely exists in unreleased FBI interview summaries and internal memos. The push to release these specific files is seen as a damage control effort by the White House amid growing public pressure and speculation about the extent of Trump's relationship with Epstein.</p>

          <p>More employers are offering student loan reimbursement benefits, a trend accelerated by new provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that make such contributions permanently tax-free for employees.

This development provides more certainty for companies that were hesitant to adopt the benefit, which was previously a temporary provision.

The author argues that in a year of cultural malaise, the album's downtempo, R&B-influenced, and sonically muffled production provides a soothing and reflective sound that resonates more than upbeat party anthems. The music, influenced by indie producers, is described as serene and sad yet intricate, capturing a collective mood of burnout and a desire for stability over passion. This contrasts with last year's hedonistic hits, suggesting a broader cultural shift toward more reserved and melancholic pop music.</p>

He distinguishes this from investment properties, such as rental apartments, which produce positive cash flow. While homeownership can build equity through appreciation, Cardone emphasizes that true real estate assets should provide immediate passive income, making a primary home a financial drain.

Poor weather scores, influenced by natural disasters like hurricanes, significantly impacted the rankings of Gulf Coast states. The analysis emphasizes that personal preferences, such as proximity to family, should ultimately guide retirement decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores whether the renewed scandal surrounding Donald Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein could cause lasting political damage. The author notes that Trump's usual distraction tactics are failing, as new details about their association continue to emerge, fueling outrage even among his base. The article outlines several potential outcomes: the story could fizzle out, the administration could broker a deal with Ghislaine Maxwell for a controlled release of information, or the fallout could significantly harm Republicans in upcoming elections. Ultimately, it argues that the case is about more than just Trump, highlighting the systemic failures that allowed Epstein's abuse to continue for years.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the media and public's intense focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case is distracting from more critical, long-term issues. The author identifies four under-covered stories with far greater global consequences: America's accelerating national debt crisis, a resurgent global hunger crisis reversing decades of progress, the transformative challenge of global population decline, and the degradation of U.S. military readiness in the face of new geopolitical threats. The article contends that while the Epstein story is a scandal, these complex and wonky issues deserve more of our finite attention as they will fundamentally shape the future.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the latest move by Hong Kong authorities to offer cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists living in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the bounties another example of transnational repression and affirmed the UK's commitment to protecting the rights and safety of all individuals on its soil. The 19 targeted activists are accused of violating Beijing's national security law. This is the latest in a series of such reward offers, which have been denounced by Western governments as interference and an attempt to silence dissent abroad.</p>

The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where the KMT and its allies hold a majority. Supporters of the recall were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation and passing of controversial reforms seen as favoring China. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance to its agenda.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's extensive use of tariffs and recent trade agreements are facing significant legal challenges that could dismantle his trade policy.

A lower court has already ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision is currently paused. Experts believe the cases are destined for the Supreme Court and that a loss for the administration would invalidate nearly all of its recent trade developments. (not investment advice)</p>

The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as reasons for the takeover, has overseen a worsening of these conditions, according to analysts. The regime has cracked down on civil society and the media, leading to job losses and constricting the space for NGOs, while human rights abuses have continued. By aligning with military-led Mali and Burkina Faso and withdrawing from the regional bloc ECOWAS, Niger's leaders have deepened their isolation and signaled an intention to remain in power for the long term.</p>

This trend has serious implications, as research suggests a correlation between loneliness in youth and a susceptibility to authoritarian thinking and political extremism.
