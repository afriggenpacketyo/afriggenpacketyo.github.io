          <p>Severe flash flooding in central Texas has led to what officials are calling a catastrophic event, with at least 24 people confirmed dead. The Guadalupe River rose an astonishing 26 feet in under an hour, catching communities by surprise. A major search and rescue operation is underway for approximately 23 to 25 children still missing from a Christian summer camp that was directly in the flood's path. Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency, mobilizing extensive state resources to aid in the response and recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused the Smithsonian Institution of using federal funds to push "one-sided, divisive political narratives" that undermine American values. A White House official specifically criticized the National Museum of American History’s "Entertainment Nation" exhibit, citing panels that link Mickey Mouse to minstrelsy and The Lone Ranger to colonialism. The administration has initiated a comprehensive content audit of all Smithsonian museums to ensure exhibits align with what it considers a more patriotic and accurate representation of U.S. history.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their most lopsided loss in the history of Dodger Stadium, falling 18-1 to the Houston Astros on Independence Day. The Astros' offense was relentless, led by standout performances from Jose Altuve and Christian Walker, who combined for three home runs and nine RBIs. The Dodgers' pitching staff struggled immensely, with one reliever giving up ten runs in the sixth inning alone, sealing the historic and painful defeat in front of a sold-out home crowd.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced that it submitted a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar. The framework, previously endorsed by Israel, reportedly includes a two-month truce. While President Trump expressed optimism about a potential deal, Hamas officials stated they are still seeking firm guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a permanent end to the war as part of any final agreement.</p>

          <p>The administration of Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te is navigating a complex historical issue regarding the commemoration of World War II. Critics argue that the government is attempting to celebrate the Republic of China's (ROC) victory over Japan while simultaneously downplaying the ROC's historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This approach is seen as part of a broader political strategy by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to emphasize a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from mainland China.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that Donald Trump's leadership style shares striking similarities with that of African dictators from the Cold War era. The author draws parallels between Trump's actions—such as loyalty demands, patronage, intimidation of the press, and the use of military force against domestic protesters—and the tactics of autocrats like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The piece argues that this authoritarian model, once supported by the U.S. abroad, is now manifesting within American politics itself.</p>
