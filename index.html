          <p>Nissan will cut another 11,000 jobs globally and shut seven factories due to weak sales in China and the US. The cutbacks bring the total layoffs announced in the past year to about 20,000, or 15% of its workforce. The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen, with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the firm. A proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi collapsed in February.</p>

          <p>President Trump's changing tariffs have caused uncertainty for consumers, but a U.S. agreement with China would reduce tariffs on Chinese goods. Shoppers should look for sales events like Memorial Day and Amazon Prime Day. Check the origin of products, as goods traded under the USMCA are exempt from tariffs. Shoppers should purchase domestic products when possible and consider whether an item is worth purchasing, especially if price hikes are coming. Shoppers shouldn't panic shop, but should move up timelines for planned purchases.</p>

          <p>The University of Greater Manchester has suspended its vice chancellor, Professor George Holmes, along with two senior academic staff, following “serious allegations”. The suspensions are a precautionary measure and do not imply any assumption of guilt. Police are also investigating “allegations of financial irregularities at the university” following a review of allegations published in The Mill and a subsequent PwC report commissioned by the university's Fraud Response Panel.</p>

After the robbers fled, she was left gagged and bound. The ordeal shattered her sense of safety, leading her to drastically upgrade her private security.</p>

          <h2>Estimating Monthly Payments from a $1 Million Annuity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 11:33:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $1 million annuity can provide monthly payments ranging from around $5,800 to more than $10,600, depending on factors like age, gender, and the type of annuity. The older you are when you begin collecting annuity payments, the higher your monthly income will be, due to a shorter expected payout period. Other important considerations include the annuity type, contract structure (lifetime-only vs. joint-life), and whether the annuity offers inflation protection. (not investment advice)</p>
