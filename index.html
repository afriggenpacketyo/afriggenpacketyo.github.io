          <p>Apple's AI initiatives, known as Apple Intelligence, have faced criticism in their first year, prompting investors to call for significant improvements. Despite advantages like a large installed base and custom chips, Apple has struggled to keep pace with AI advancements made by rivals like OpenAI and Google. Challenges include underwhelming initial features, factually incorrect summaries, and delays in key improvements to Siri, leading to class-action lawsuits. Apple may need to acquire a company like Anthropic or Perplexity to accelerate its AI development and compete effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to reduce bureaucratic control are rooted in anti-managerialism, a political idea that views a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats as having usurped democracy. This movement seeks to roll back bureaucratic control in government, universities, and corporations. Although facing resistance, understanding this anti-managerialism is crucial to understanding the Trump administration's efforts to transform America's institutional landscape. The initiative to end the "tyranny of the bureaucracy" will continue even after Elon Musk stepped down from the Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

          <p>Bath secured a home semi-final after resting all of their first-choice players against Saracens a week ago, the same day Bristol's play-off fate was confirmed. Bristol stuck first through MacGinty's penalty and as they have all season looked threatening whenever they quickly moved the ball. Dun ran in next to the posts for a breathtaking try that began five metres out of Bath's try-line after the hosts kicked the ball deep into Bristol territory. Kalaveti Ravouvou won the foot race with Muir, collected the ball and made 40 metres solo, skipping through one tackle and bouncing off another.</p>
