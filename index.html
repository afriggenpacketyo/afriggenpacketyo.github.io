          <p>The House and Senate are scheduled to receive classified briefings regarding the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, following President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire agreement which he claims has already been violated by both parties. These briefings aim to provide lawmakers with answers and evidence from the administration, specifically addressing the rationale behind Trump's statement of an imminent threat and the subsequent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Some members of Congress argue that the military action was unconstitutional, leading to bipartisan resolutions that could challenge Trump's authority. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie is reconsidering his War Powers Resolution, depending on the ceasefire's stability, while Trump has expressed dissatisfaction with both Israel and Iran for allegedly violating the ceasefire. </p>

Auburn Tigers men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl suggested that Trump should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the deal. Trump addressed the conflict, expressing dissatisfaction with both Israel and Iran for their actions, before heading to a NATO summit.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the central bank's dedication to controlling inflation, indicating that policymakers are likely to maintain the current stance until there is greater clarity on the impact of tariffs on prices.

He emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the effects of President Trump's tariffs, stating that policy changes continue to evolve.

          <p>This article discusses how much a $400,000 annuity might pay monthly if purchased at age 70, considering factors like gender, life expectancy, interest rates, and the type of annuity chosen. It explains that men typically receive higher monthly payments than women due to differences in life expectancy. The article also distinguishes between single life and joint life annuities, noting that joint life annuities provide continued payments to a surviving spouse but at a lower monthly rate. It advises maximizing income by opting for a single-life annuity, locking in rates when they are favorable, and avoiding optional riders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed his stance that the central bank should maintain steady interest rates, citing potential inflation risks stemming from U.S. tariffs.

Over 120 Labour MPs have opposed the government's plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments, aiming to save Â£5 billion annually by 2030. Starmer defended the reforms by asserting that the current welfare system is unsustainable and traps people on benefits, necessitating changes to ensure its long-term viability.

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte affirmed that the U.S. and President Donald Trump are fully committed to the alliance, aiming to reassure allies amidst concerns that Washington might withdraw support due to uneven defense spending. Rutte acknowledged that this commitment comes with the expectation that European and Canadian members will increase their defense spending. NATO members have agreed to raise defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. Rutte urged European allies to focus on defense investment plans and support for Ukraine, rather than worrying about the U.S.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security, while legal groups representing the migrants expressed concern over the removal of due process protections.

Hyde suggests that politicians and analysts should stop trying to find hidden messages in Trump's behavior and instead recognize his self-centered motivations.
