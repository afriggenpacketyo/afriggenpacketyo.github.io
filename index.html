          <p>A report of an active shooter at Villanova University's law school prompted a large-scale police response and a campus-wide lockdown. University President Rev. Peter Donohue later confirmed the incident was a "cruel hoax," stating that no shooter, injuries, or firearms were found on campus. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro condemned the act of "swatting," which is illegal, and has directed state police to investigate alongside the FBI to hold the perpetrators accountable. The incident caused significant fear and disruption for the university community.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the New York appellate court's unanimous decision to throw out Judge Arthur Engoron's nearly half-billion-dollar fine against Donald Trump validates criticisms of the original trial. The author contends that the judge's penalty lacked legal and factual basis, as there were no financial victims, and was motivated by a political agenda driven by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The article characterizes the initial ruling as an unconstitutional and excessive punishment aimed at derailing Trump's political and business career.</p>

          <p>California's legislature has passed a measure authorizing a special election in November for a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts, potentially creating five new Democratic-leaning seats. This move, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, is a direct response to a Republican-led redistricting effort in Texas aimed at benefiting Donald Trump's party. While Democrats frame it as a necessary countermeasure to "fight fire with fire" and protect democracy, Republicans have criticized the "Gavinmander" as an expensive and hypocritical power grab that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 9-5, earning a split in their four-game series at Coors Field. The offense started strong with a two-run homer from Freddie Freeman in the first inning and continued to score in each of the first five innings, building an insurmountable lead. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw secured his eighth win, allowing three runs over 5.2 innings before the bullpen closed out the game. The victory allows the Dodgers to maintain their division lead as they head into a crucial series against the second-place San Diego Padres.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-billion-dollar financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump in his civil fraud case, deeming it excessive and likely unconstitutional. While the court upheld the underlying finding that Trump is liable for fraud, it concluded the massive fine was not justified by the harm caused in the commercial transactions. The ruling keeps non-monetary penalties, such as a ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, in place. The New York Attorney General's office plans to appeal the decision regarding the fine to the state's highest court.</p>

          <p>Florida's Department of Transportation has painted over a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that served as a memorial to the 49 victims of the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting. Orlando's mayor condemned the removal as a "cruel political act," while state officials defended it as enforcing a policy against using state roads for political messages. The action is part of a broader push by the state agency to remove such crosswalks, citing a memo prohibiting pavement art with "social, political or ideological messages." Critics view the move as another anti-LGBTQ action by Governor Ron DeSantis's administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with canceling National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and gender identity. The ruling lifts a lower court's order that had required the NIH to restore funding for over 1,700 grants nationwide, which the administration claims do not align with its policy objectives. While the legal challenge from sixteen states and various research groups will continue, the decision allows the administration to halt payments for now, a move opponents warn will cause irreversible harm to public health research.</p>

The post positioned Steak 'n Shake as a brand that takes pride in its history and "American values." This move taps into a broader conservative backlash against the rebranding, which some customers have labeled as "woke."</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old man in Leicestershire, UK, was arrested in a dawn raid on suspicion of supporting a proscribed organization after sharing posts backing Palestine Action on his Facebook page. The man, who claims he has never been a member of the direct-action group, was handcuffed and had his phone seized by police. This arrest highlights the controversial nature of the UK's decision to ban Palestine Action, which makes showing support for the group a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

It notes that Kennedy has pursued his agenda through both regulatory changes and informal "handshake agreements" with food companies to remove synthetic dyes and high-fructose corn syrup. His actions have also weakened vaccination systems, particularly concerning COVID-19 vaccines for children, leading to clashes with pediatricians.

The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is publicly launched. This allows the investor to postpone paying taxes on the embedded profits until they sell the ETF shares. While the strategy can be highly effective, it has strict diversification requirements and can limit an investor's future flexibility, as their capital is then tied up in that specific ETF.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock price plunged over 7% on Thursday, wiping out nearly $100 million in market value, following the public release of a new, modernized logo. The redesign removes the familiar image of "Uncle Herschel," an overall-clad man leaning on a barrel, in favor of a simpler wordmark. The change, part of a broader effort to update the chain's image, has sparked backlash from conservative commentators and some marketing experts who feel the company is abandoning its core brand identity. The negative market reaction suggests investors may be questioning the strategic direction under the company's new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the political implications of the Texas legislature advancing a mid-decade redistricting plan designed to create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats. The move, urged by Donald Trump, is an unusually aggressive partisan maneuver ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, where control of the U.S. House is expected to be tightly contested. The plan has prompted a retaliatory threat from California, which may redraw its own maps to favor Democrats. This escalating battle over gerrymandering highlights how control of the House, and thus the fate of Trump's second-term agenda, could be decided by these state-level actions.</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst, known for her roles in independent and critically acclaimed films, recently stated her interest in joining a major blockbuster sequel like "A Minecraft Movie" to make "a pile of cash." In an interview, Dunst, whose last film was the successful but moderately budgeted "Civil War," contrasted its earnings with the massive profits of studio tentpoles. The comment reflects a pragmatic view of the film industry, where even established actors may seek lucrative roles in major franchises. Dunst also confirmed she has several other projects lined up with directors like Sofia Coppola and Ruben Östlund.</p>

          <p>Recent market activity suggests a shift in how investors view the impact of potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts on different stock sectors. Traditionally, lower rates boost high-growth tech stocks by increasing the present value of their future earnings. However, a recent rotation saw investors selling these secular growth names and buying more cyclical, value-oriented stocks like Home Depot, which stand to benefit more directly from lower rates through immediate upward earnings revisions. This article argues that Wall Street is now more focused on near-term earnings potential catalyzed by a dovish Fed rather than on abstract valuation models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Public records reveal that protests targeting hotels housing federal immigration agents in Los Angeles this summer prompted U.S. military officials to create a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." Activists staged "No sleep for ICE" rallies outside several hotels to pressure them into evicting ICE and CBP agents who were in the city for an immigration crackdown. An email from the U.S. Marines shows that law enforcement agencies were tracking the "harassment" and sharing intelligence to find accommodations where personnel would not be confronted. The documents suggest the community-led protest strategy was effective in disrupting the administration's immigration enforcement operations.</p>
