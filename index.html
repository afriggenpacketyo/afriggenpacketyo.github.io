          <h2>Trump Administration to Intensify Immigration Enforcement in Sanctuary Cities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its immigration enforcement by targeting sanctuary cities, which it labels as havens for criminals. Following a shooting involving an undocumented person in New York, the president's border czar, Tom Homan, has pledged to "flood the zone" with ICE agents in these municipalities. This strategy aims to overcome the lack of local cooperation by conducting arrests in community settings and worksites, a move that critics argue will instill fear and is politically motivated.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will now use military bases in Indiana and New Jersey to detain immigrants, following approval from the Defense Department. This expansion, which also includes increasing detention capacity at Guantanamo Bay, is part of the Trump administration's broader push to arrest more undocumented individuals. While the Pentagon states military readiness will not be affected, Democratic lawmakers have condemned the move as an inappropriate use of military resources for political purposes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declassified and released 230,000 pages of government records related to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The files, which had been sealed since 1977, include FBI surveillance documents from J. Edgar Hoover's invasive campaign against the civil rights leader. While some family members praised the move for transparency, others expressed concern, urging the public to view the documents in their historical context and condemning any misuse to undermine Dr. King's legacy.</p>

          <p>A dangerous heat dome is currently impacting more than 90 million people across the U.S. Mississippi Valley and Southeast, with heat index values expected to reach 110 to 115 degrees. This extreme weather event is intensified by high humidity, partly due to "corn sweat" from crops in the Corn Belt. According to climate analysis, human-caused climate change has made such severe heat waves significantly more likely, posing a major health risk due to the combination of high day and nighttime temperatures.</p>

          <p>Following deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting systems, arguing it would save both money and lives. Her recommendations include upgrading Doppler radar, improving satellites, and investing in supercomputing to enhance prediction accuracy. The appeal comes as the administration plans significant budget cuts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is responsible for weather and climate monitoring.</p>

          <p>This article from NPR examines the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, portraying him as a key figure in a potential new phase of President Trump's efforts to reshape the federal judiciary. During his first term, Trump heavily relied on the Federalist Society to select conservative, originalist judges for federal appointments. The piece suggests that Bove's controversial nomination indicates a continuation and possible evolution of this strategy to install influential conservative voices onto the nation's courts.</p>
