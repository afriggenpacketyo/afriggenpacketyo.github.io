          <p>Zhigang Peng's election as the next president-elect of the Seismological Society of America marks a significant milestone, making him the first Chinese-American to hold the position in the society's history. This reflects a gradual but increasing trend of China-born scientists gaining leadership roles in US academic societies, despite historically being underrepresented. Shan-Lu Liu of Ohio State University will also become the first Chinese-American to lead the American Society for Virology. These appointments highlight the growing recognition of Chinese scientists' contributions to research and education in the United States.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts detective, Brian Fanion, was convicted of murdering his wife, Amy, after investigators discovered incriminating online searches on his work computer, including "gsr testing" and "household poisons."

Despite the defense arguing that the searches were related to household safety and an upcoming niece's visit, the prosecution successfully argued that they pointed to premeditation.

The case raises questions about the balance between protecting citizens' rights and allowing law enforcement to perform their duties effectively, and various groups across the ideological spectrum have urged the court to overturn the lower court ruling.</p>
