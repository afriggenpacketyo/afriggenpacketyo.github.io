          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant increase of over 4% due to escalating tensions between the United States and Iran, with President Trump expressing skepticism about reaching a nuclear deal. Brent crude futures rose to $69.77 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude reached $68.15. The U.S. is also preparing a partial evacuation of its embassy in Iraq due to heightened security risks, and the UK Maritime Trade Operations warned of potential military escalation in the region. Trump stated that he is less confident about a deal with Iran and warned that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon, while Iran's defense minister asserted that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of their military. </p>

          <p>In his sexual assault retrial, Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley but not guilty of criminal sexual assault against Kaja Sokola, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on the charge of third-degree sexual assault involving Jessica Mann. The jury's deliberations were reportedly tense, with jurors sending notes to the judge about infighting. Weinstein himself addressed the court, claiming he was not receiving a fair trial, while his defense attorney expressed disgust with the proceedings. The trial included accusations from Haley, Mann, and Sokola, all of whom testified about alleged sexual assaults by Weinstein. </p>

A leisure center in Larne was also attacked, and police are reviewing footage of the incidents for prosecutions, with Police Scotland sending additional officers to assist.

A typical homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage home expenses, which can be even higher in states like Hawaii and California. Experts recommend factoring in ongoing homeownership costs and obtaining thorough home inspections to avoid financial strain and potential debt.

          <p>President Trump's proposed spending bill, which has passed the House, is facing challenges in the Senate due to Republican divisions over tax cuts, immigration enforcement, and the national debt. The bill is projected to increase the deficit by trillions of dollars and could lead to millions losing health insurance coverage. The bill's tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, while some provisions could negatively impact immigrant communities and their families abroad. Critics, including Elon Musk, have called for lawmakers to rework the legislation, while House Speaker Mike Johnson defends the bill. </p>

          <p>The EPA announced it will seek to revoke a key rule that limits carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants, finalized in April 2024 by the Biden administration. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated the Trump administration aims to protect the environment while growing the economy, arguing the Biden-era rules would "suffocate" the economy. The agency also plans to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, which restricts pollutants emitted by coal and natural gas-fired power plants. Critics argue the rollbacks could be dangerous, with environmental groups preparing to sue the EPA. </p>

          <p>Despite Americans paying trillions in rent annually, few receive credit score boosts because most landlords don't report payments to credit bureaus. This lack of reporting leads to "credit invisibility" for over 50 million Americans, limiting their access to loans and other financial opportunities. Minorities and immigrants are disproportionately affected by this inequity. Companies like Esusu are working to change this by partnering with rental companies and providing direct reporting services for renters, helping to establish credit scores and unlock financial opportunities.

Mayor Karen Bass blamed President Trump's immigration policies for provoking the unrest, stating that the raids caused fear and panic among residents.
