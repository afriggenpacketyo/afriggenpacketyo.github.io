          <p>Several senators are advocating for the advancement of a stringent Russia sanctions bill, with Senator Lindsey Graham indicating potential Senate action this week following discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The proposed legislation aims to impose significant tariffs on countries purchasing energy products from Moscow, with Graham emphasizing the need to hold China and India accountable for supporting Russia's war efforts through oil purchases. Trump has not endorsed the bill but Zelenskyy has expressed a desire for the sanctions and a ceasefire. The bill, known as the "Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025," has bipartisan support and seeks to isolate Russia economically. Optimism surrounding the bill's potential to deter Russian aggression is tempered by the need for White House coordination and international cooperation. </p>

          <p>Six Nobel laureate economists have warned that a budget bill passed by the House and supported by President Trump would weaken safety-net programs while significantly increasing the federal debt. They argue the bill's cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, combined with tax cuts favoring higher-income households, would exacerbate income inequality. The economists also state that the bill would add over $3 trillion to the national debt, potentially leading to higher inflation and interest rates. The Senate is expected to consider the bill, facing opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans, including Rand Paul, who says the "math doesn't really add up." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The top US commander in the Indo-Pacific has characterized the People's Liberation Army's operations around Taiwan as "rehearsals" rather than mere exercises, indicating growing concern over Beijing's intentions. Admiral Samuel Paparo stated that China is on a "dangerous course," and that its actions are not just routine drills. Tensions between Taiwan and mainland China have risen since William Lai Ching-te took office, with Beijing viewing him as a "destroyer of peace." Paparo also noted a growing "transactional symbiosis among an axis of autocracies," citing technology transfers and coordinated military activities. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released details of its plan to reduce the U.S. Department of Education, proposing a 15% funding cut for fiscal year 2026 and changes to K-12 and higher education programs. The budget summary reiterates Trump's commitment to returning education to the states, though it requests $66.7 billion for the department, indicating a gradual wind-down process. While Title I funding remains unchanged, the budget recommends consolidating and cutting funding for various K-12 programs, and proposes changes to federal Pell Grants and the Federal Work-Study program. Critics argue these cuts will harm students pursuing postsecondary education. </p>
