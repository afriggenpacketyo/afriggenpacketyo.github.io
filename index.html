        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar briefly fell below 140 yen for the first time since last September after President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. The yen was also bolstered by speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness when finance ministers meet. Trump's remarks raised concerns about the central bank's independence, accelerating the dollar's decline. Tokyo stocks ended mixed, while gold prices hit an all-time high in yen terms as investors sought safe-haven assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to phase out the remaining eight artificial food dyes from America's food supply within two years.

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU, claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement unlawfully terminated student records, potentially leading to deportation. The judge granted a temporary restraining order, requiring the administration to notify the court of compliance and prohibiting the use of plaintiffs' identities outside the lawsuit. The students in question had faced minor charges, which were later dropped, or no charges at all.</p>

          <p>A survey of over 500 political scientists reveals that a significant majority believe the United States is shifting away from liberal democracy towards authoritarianism. The survey, conducted by Bright Line Watch, shows a decline in the rating of American democracy following President Trump's election. Scholars point to Trump's expansion of executive power, attacks on the media, and appointments of loyalists to key positions as evidence of this trend. While some disagree, many see parallels with countries like Hungary and Turkey, where leaders have eroded checks and balances after coming to power democratically.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center have reported progress in using stem cells to treat advanced Parkinson's disease.

After 18 months, the cells had successfully integrated with no serious side effects, and patients experienced noticeable improvements, particularly those receiving a higher dose. The FDA has granted approval for a phase 3 clinical trial with a larger patient group, which will begin in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case regarding whether public schools should accommodate religious objections to curriculum materials, specifically regarding LGBTQ+ content in storybooks. Parents in Montgomery County, MD, argue that exposure to these materials conflicts with their religious beliefs and seek opt-out options for their children. The school board contends that accommodating opt-out requests is logistically difficult and disruptive, especially when LGBTQ+ themes can arise unexpectedly. The court's decision could impact the balance between local school board authority and religious freedom.</p>

          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft to address issues of parity and player agency. Proposals include flipping the draft order to reward teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a lottery system, waiving the eligibility rule to allow players to enter the draft earlier, and introducing a salary pool to give players more control over their destination. These ideas aim to balance the league's interest in parity with the players' desire for agency and a better environment to start their careers.</p>
