          <p>Dozens of political prisoners recently released by Belarus as part of a U.S.-brokered deal were forcibly deported to Lithuania, according to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. The agreement involved Minsk freeing 52 prisoners in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions on the national airline. While some former prisoners expressed gratitude for their freedom, others, particularly those nearing the end of their sentences, stated they would have preferred to remain in their home country. The opposition is now urging Western governments to pressure Belarus to allow these individuals the right to stay.</p>

          <p>The Missouri state legislature has passed a new congressional redistricting plan, which is expected to be signed into law by the governor. The redrawn map could create an additional Republican-leaning House seat by splitting the Kansas City area, making the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver more conservative. This move, praised by President Trump, is part of a broader mid-decade redistricting effort by several states ahead of the midterm elections. Opponents immediately filed a legal challenge, arguing the new map is an unconstitutional gerrymander that violates state requirements for compact districts.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge hit his 362nd career home run, moving him past Joe DiMaggio into fourth place on the team's all-time leaderboard. The historic milestone occurred during a game against the Boston Red Sox. This achievement came just one day after Judge hit two home runs in a game attended by President Donald Trump, who had visited the Yankees' clubhouse beforehand.

          <h2>Study Links Stalking and Restraining Orders to Higher Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 20:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that women who have experienced stalking or obtained a restraining order face a significantly higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Researchers analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses for two decades, concluding the risk was 41% higher for those who experienced stalking and 70% higher for those who obtained restraining orders. The findings suggest that the chronic stress associated with these traumatic experiences directly impacts heart health, independent of other factors like diet and exercise, prompting calls to include such questions in future cardiac screenings.</p>

          <p>Three Austrian nuns in their 80s have escaped from a care home and returned to their former convent, Kloster Goldenstein, after being moved against their will. With the help of former students and a locksmith, Sister Bernadette, Sister Regina, and Sister Rita regained access to the home where they had spent most of their lives. The nuns stated they were unhappy in the care home and were exercising their right to live in the convent. Church authorities have called the move "incomprehensible," citing the nuns' health, but the trio has received an outpouring of support from their community.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, artificial intelligence tools, including X's chatbot Grok, rapidly spread false information across social media. A CBS News analysis found that Grok incorrectly identified the suspect multiple times before an official announcement and generated altered images of the person of interest. Other AI tools also produced inaccurate information, with one describing the shooting as a "hypothetical scenario." Experts warn that people tend to perceive AI as less biased than human sources, which makes the proliferation of AI-generated misinformation particularly dangerous during breaking news events.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk's efforts to engage younger voters played a significant role in Donald Trump's 2024 election victory, according to political analysis. By targeting youth on social media and college campuses, Kirk's Turning Point USA organization helped Trump improve his performance with voters under 30, a demographic typically dominated by Democrats. Exit polling shows Trump performed better with this group than any Republican presidential candidate since 2004, particularly with young men. Experts credit Kirk with not only organizing this key demographic but also persuading the broader Republican party to invest in this outreach strategy.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that seven million households in the UK are failing to claim a total of £24 billion in available benefits and government support. The analysis by Policy in Practice identifies awareness, complexity of the application process, and social stigma as the primary barriers preventing people from accessing financial help. This unclaimed support includes national benefits like universal credit and local aid such as free school meals and council tax support. Experts argue that simplifying the system is crucial, as many people are unaware of their eligibility or run out of energy navigating multiple complex forms.</p>

Such tragedies are common in the country, where river transport is essential but vessels are often old, poorly maintained, and dangerously overloaded.

          <p>A new report from House Republicans identifies approximately 50 joint academic programs between U.S. and Chinese universities as "high-risk" and calls for them to be terminated. The report targets partnerships with institutions allegedly linked to China's military or defense sectors, escalating a campaign to curb academic collaborations over national security concerns. Programs at prominent universities like New York University, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Minnesota were named. The move reflects growing political pressure to scrutinize and potentially sever educational ties between the two countries.</p>

His phenomenal performance propelled England to a total of 304-2, their highest ever in the format, and helped level the series.

          <p>The new sequel, “Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,” reunites the iconic mock-rock band 40 years after the original film but struggles to justify its existence. While seeing the clueless trio of Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls together again provides some nostalgic smiles, the film largely coasts on the legacy of its predecessor. The review notes that the sequel's concept, which features music legends like Paul McCartney and Elton John revering the band, removes the outsider tension that made the first movie's comedy so effective. Ultimately, it feels more like a collection of outtakes than a fresh satirical take.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to end humanitarian parole protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The decision lifts a lower court's stay, allowing the administration to terminate the Biden-era policies that had provided a two-year legal pathway and work authorization for these individuals. While the ruling is a victory for the administration's efforts to dismantle previous immigration policies, migrant advocates expressed deep disappointment, warning of the irreparable harm faced by people who may be forced to return to dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing company of systematically discriminating against passengers with disabilities. The suit alleges that Uber drivers have frequently refused service to individuals with service animals, illegally charged cleaning fees for animal shedding, and denied accommodations for mobility devices. According to the Justice Department, these actions have caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. Uber responded that it prohibits such discrimination and takes action against drivers who violate its accessibility policies, but it disagrees with the lawsuit's allegations.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and permit denser, taller residential buildings near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, allows for buildings up to nine stories high adjacent to major transit stops, including in some single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue the legislation is a necessary step to address the state's severe housing shortage and affordability crisis. However, critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend that it is a state overreach that strips local communities of their planning authority.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores the immediate labeling of Charlie Kirk as a Christian martyr by many on the right following his assassination. The author contrasts Kirk's public rhetoric, which often dismissed empathy and promoted divisive views, with the post-WWII evangelical movement's focus on compassion and cultural engagement. The piece argues that Kirk's brand of right-wing politics and religion represents a departure from these earlier values. It suggests that the willingness to call him a martyr reflects a belief in a future America defined by white, Christian male authority, raising questions about the evolving meaning of evangelicalism today.</p>
