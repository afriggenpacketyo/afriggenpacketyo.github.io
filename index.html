          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues Four Global Issues Surpass Media's Focus on Epstein Case</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the media's intense focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case has overshadowed more critical, long-term global issues. The author highlights four specific areas deserving greater attention: the escalating U.S. national debt, a resurgent global hunger crisis, the worldwide population slowdown and its economic consequences, and the degradation of America's military readiness in the face of new geopolitical challenges. The piece serves as a call to re-evaluate news priorities toward systemic problems rather than sensational scandals.</p>

          <p>Overnight aerial assaults between Russia and Ukraine resulted in multiple fatalities and injuries on both sides. Ukrainian officials reported deadly rocket and drone attacks in the Dnipro and Sumy regions, with significant damage to infrastructure in Kharkiv. Concurrently, Russian authorities stated that Ukrainian drone strikes targeted several regions, including Rostov, where two people were killed. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed to have intercepted dozens of Ukrainian drones across a wide area, halting flights at several airports.</p>

          <p>At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Gaza overnight, with many shot while awaiting aid trucks near the Zikim crossing, according to hospital officials. The violence occurs as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas have stalled, and the United Nations warns of a growing famine risk in the region. Israel faces mounting international pressure to address the humanitarian crisis, while aid organizations struggle to provide assistance due to military restrictions and a lack of supplies. This incident follows a similar deadly event at the same crossing days earlier.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice that challenged the legality of sanctuary city policies in Chicago and Illinois. The judge, a Biden appointee, ruled that the local ordinances lawfully limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The ruling is a setback for the administration's efforts to compel local jurisdictions to assist with federal immigration crackdowns. Chicago's mayor praised the decision, stating it affirms the city's right to focus on local public safety.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams' recent joke about returning to competition for health insurance benefits has highlighted the complex relationship between employment and healthcare in the U.S. The article uses her situation to explain concepts like COBRA, which allows individuals to keep their employer-based plan after a job ends but at a much higher personal cost. It also discusses how the Affordable Care Act has changed options for those with pre-existing conditions or in non-traditional jobs. Williams' experience serves as a relatable, high-profile example of the challenges many Americans face when navigating health insurance outside of a conventional job.</p>

This is the latest in a series of bounties issued by Hong Kong authorities targeting activists abroad under a national security law imposed by Beijing.

The recall campaigns were initiated by civic groups who accused the opposition of obstructing key legislation and passing laws that favor Beijing.

The junta, which cited insecurity and Western influence to justify its takeover, has forced many NGOs to cease operations, leading to significant job losses in a country already struggling with high youth unemployment. Rights groups report a severe crackdown on media, civil society, and political opposition, with dozens of officials from the ousted government arbitrarily detained.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant rise in loneliness, particularly among its youth, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and social media. Sociologists have identified a concerning link between loneliness in young people and a higher susceptibility to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. Studies show that lonely individuals often feel rejected and can develop resentment, making them more vulnerable to conspiracy theories. The problem is not confined to urban areas, as those in rural regions with fewer opportunities for social interaction also face a higher risk of isolation.</p>

The child was then transported to a nearby medical center but was pronounced dead. The park has closed the wave pool out of respect and is conducting an internal review while cooperating with authorities.</p>

          <p>This financial article analyzes the Pentagon's new policy to fast-track the production of inexpensive, first-person-view (FPV) drones for the U.S. Army. It argues that established drone manufacturers like AeroVironment and Kratos Defense may be poorly positioned to win these contracts, as their flagship products are significantly more expensive than the low-cost, expendable models the military now seeks. The piece suggests that the competition for these large-scale contracts remains wide open, and investors should be cautious about assuming legacy players will be the primary beneficiaries.

          <p>Writing from the perspective of an American comedian living in Scotland, this opinion piece reflects on the unwelcoming feeling surrounding Donald Trump's visit to the country. The author notes Trump's desperate desire to be embraced as Scottish, contrasting it with the genuine love for Scotland felt by many American immigrants. The article invokes the memory of the late Scottish comedian Janey Godley, whose famously defiant and profane protest sign during a previous Trump visit perfectly captured the local sentiment. The author concludes that Trump will never truly be Scottish because he fails to understand the culture of humor and rebellion he represents.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Columbia University's recent deal with the Trump administration marks a dangerous turning point for American higher education. To restore federal research funding, Columbia agreed to pay a $200 million fine and allow a Trump-approved monitor to oversee admissions and the Middle Eastern studies department. The author describes the deal as an 'extortion scheme' that sacrifices academic independence and constitutional rights in the face of political pressure. The article warns that this capitulation sets a precedent for the administration to use similar tactics against other institutions, stifling dissent and academic freedom.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to pay for their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if handled carefully. Using a credit card for large wedding purchases can help couples earn significant rewards points or sign-up bonuses, which can then be used for a honeymoon. However, this approach is only advisable if the couple has the savings to pay off the balance immediately to avoid high-interest debt. Experts caution against going into debt for a short-term event and recommend considering wedding insurance for broader protection against unforeseen issues.</p>

          <p>CBS's decision to end 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert' has sparked a debate on whether it signals the beginning of the end for traditional late-night television. The article analyzes the financial pressures facing the format, including declining ad revenue, shifting viewer habits toward streaming, and high production costs. While the cancellation's timing raised suspicions due to Colbert's criticism of a Paramount settlement with Donald Trump, the network cited purely financial reasons.

The violence, largely between Christian farming communities and predominantly Muslim Fulani herders, is fueled by climate change, population growth, and a breakdown of traditional conflict resolution.

          <p>Many high-earning Americans, sometimes called 'HENRYs' (high earners, not rich yet), report not feeling wealthy despite having six-figure incomes. Experts point to rising costs, significant debt, and 'lifestyle creep' as primary reasons for this sentiment, with one survey finding that 62% of those earning over $300,000 have credit card debt. Psychologists explain that accumulating wealth requires saving rather than spending, creating a paradox where individuals don't feel rich even as their net worth grows. This phenomenon is reflected in surveys where the amount of money people say they need to feel wealthy increases with their actual income.</p>
