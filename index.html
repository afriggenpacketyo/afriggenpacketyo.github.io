          <p>Ukrainian officials have announced the arrest of a suspect in the assassination of Andriy Parubiy, a pro-Western politician and former speaker of parliament. The suspect, disguised as a courier, allegedly shot Parubiy eight times in the city of Lviv. Kyiv has stated there is a "Russian trace" in the carefully planned killing, linking it to a pattern of assassinations since Russia's 2022 invasion. Parubiy was a key figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements and a vocal supporter of Ukrainian independence and language.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has confirmed that an aircraft carrying President Ursula von der Leyen experienced significant GPS signal disruption while approaching Bulgaria, an incident suspected to be caused by Russian interference. While the plane landed safely, the event is being viewed as part of Russia's pattern of hostile actions and intimidation. In response, the EU has committed to bolstering its defense capabilities and satellite systems to counter such threats. This incident highlights the increasing prevalence of GPS jamming near Russian territory since 2022.</p>

          <p>The UK division of Levi's has identified "rising anti-Americanism" resulting from Trump administration tariffs and policies as a key business risk. In its annual accounts, the company warned that this sentiment could lead British consumers to favor national or European brands over iconic American ones like Levi's. This marks a rare instance of a major U.S. brand openly linking potential sales declines to the political climate created by the current administration. The concern is listed alongside other market pressures, such as inflation and competition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail has permanently eliminated higher-priced peak-time tickets, a move that has significantly reduced fares on routes like Glasgow to Edinburgh and sparked discussion about whether the rest of the UK could follow. The decision reflects post-pandemic travel patterns, with rail operators noting more available capacity during traditional rush hours. While passengers welcome cheaper travel, experts are divided, warning that without an increase in passenger volume, the policy could lead to overcrowded trains on popular routes or necessitate overall price hikes to cover lost revenue.</p>

          <p>A recent trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under strain after President Trump threatened new tariffs in response to Europe's digital services taxes and technology regulations. The administration argues that EU rules, such as the Digital Services Act, unfairly target American tech giants like Google and Meta. EU officials, caught off guard by the threat, defend their right to regulate their digital markets and have indicated that these regulations are not negotiable. The dispute jeopardizes a prior agreement and raises the risk of a renewed trade conflict.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, who represented the Somerton and Frome constituency until his resignation in June 2023, has died suddenly in London at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating the death as unexpected but not suspicious. Warburton was suspended by the Conservative Party in 2022 over allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied, and later resigned after admitting to cocaine use. A by-election triggered by his departure was won by the Liberal Democrats before the constituency was abolished due to boundary changes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners. The court found it unlikely that Congress intended to grant a president unlimited authority to set taxes, which is constitutionally its own power. However, the 7-4 decision gives the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court before the tariffs are struck down. The ruling represents a significant legal challenge to a cornerstone of the president's economic policy.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old boy who survived last week's mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school has a bullet fragment lodged in his neck, dangerously close to his carotid artery. The boy, Weston Halsne, initially thought he had been hit with gunpowder after his friend, Victor Greenawalt, shielded him from the gunfire. Doctors, who described his survival as a "miracle," plan to surgically remove the fragment, and he is expected to make a full recovery. The story highlights the bravery of the children during the attack and the severe physical and emotional trauma inflicted upon the survivors.</p>

          <p>Ethan Pritchard, a freshman linebacker for the Florida State Seminoles, is in critical but stable condition after being shot on Sunday evening. The incident occurred in Havana, Florida, while Pritchard was inside a vehicle visiting family. According to the Gadsden County Sheriff's Office, he was transported to a local hospital for treatment in the intensive care unit. While no arrests have been made, reports suggest the shooting may have been a case of mistaken identity, where someone opened fire on the car he was driving.</p>

          <p>An 85-year-old man from Vienna has died after being trampled by a herd of cows while hiking with his wife and dog in the Austrian Alps. The incident occurred near a mountain hut in Ramsau am Dachstein, where a herd of nine cows, including calves, charged the couple. Both were severely injured and airlifted to a hospital, but the man succumbed to his injuries before surgery. Fatal cow attacks are rare in Austria, but authorities have previously issued a "code of conduct" for hikers, advising them to manage their dogs carefully around livestock.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have activated the "snapback" provision of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear deal, a move that could reinstate all previously lifted UN sanctions on Iran within 30 days. The European powers are demanding Iran resume full cooperation with IAEA inspections and provide information about its stockpile of 60% enriched uranium. Iran has stated it will not alter its position, and some hardline politicians are calling for a withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty in response.

In an interview, the president argued that banning Chinese students would be "insulting" to China and that they bring significant money into the U.S. economy, benefiting universities. The move marks a reversal from a previously harder line on the issue and has drawn backlash from allies who view the students as potential security risks or as taking university spots from Americans.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious plan for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, the vision faces substantial challenges, including a large informal economy, a rural population with limited digital literacy, and a cultural preference for cash transactions. Cybersecurity experts also warn that the plan is dangerous, citing major cyberattacks on government systems in recent years that demonstrate the country's vulnerability. Critics argue that without massive investments in security and financial education, the goal remains unrealistic.</p>

According to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, these protection rackets operate like a shadow economy, with infrastructure projects worth millions being halted due to their demands. Victims, often non-South African entrepreneurs, are frequently too fearful to cooperate with police.
