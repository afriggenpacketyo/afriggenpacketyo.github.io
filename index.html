          <p>The father of Fletcher Merkel, an 8-year-old boy killed in the Annunciation Catholic Church shooting, released a heartfelt statement describing the immense loss his family is enduring. He remembered his son as a wonderful boy who loved his family, fishing, and sports, while also expressing hope for the recovery of the wounded and the mental healing of all affected children. The father thanked the heroic individuals inside the church whose actions prevented further tragedy and asked for empathy, not sympathy, as the community grieves. He urged people to remember his son for the person he was, not for the violent act that ended his life.</p>

Smyth was previously suspended by the Labour party after being charged with possessing indecent images of children and is awaiting a court appearance. The parliament's chief executive informed members of the decision to deactivate his pass due to the ongoing criminal investigation. In an email to staff, the chief executive acknowledged the distressing nature of the charges and reminded colleagues of available confidential support services, as the institution prepares to return from recess.</p>

          <p>Two years before the deadly shooting at Annunciation Catholic School, Minnesota Catholic leaders sent a letter to Governor Tim Walz highlighting an "urgent and critical need" for enhanced security at nonpublic schools. The 2023 letter, from the Minnesota Catholic Conference and a private school advocacy group, warned that their schools were under attack and being excluded from state safety grant programs. Despite these and earlier pleas for inclusion in security funding, the requests were not granted. The issue has gained renewed attention after the recent attack where a shooter killed two children and injured seventeen others during a school Mass.</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. saw its stock fall after reporting fiscal second-quarter sales that slightly missed Wall Street expectations and increasing its forecast for the negative financial impact of tariffs. The company's comparable sales rose by 1%, which was weaker than analysts anticipated, with the Athleta brand's 9% decline in comparable sales dragging down the overall performance. While the Gap, Banana Republic, and Old Navy brands all showed positive growth, the company's full-year operating margin is now expected to be lower due to tariff costs. Gap is working to mitigate these costs through supply chain adjustments and targeted price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to launch large-scale immigration enforcement operations in Chicago, potentially starting as soon as next week, according to senior DHS officials. The tactics are expected to mirror those used in Los Angeles, which involved armored vehicles and tactical gear, sparking protests. This development is separate from President Trump's recent push to deploy the National Guard to the city to address crime, an idea Illinois and Chicago officials have strongly opposed.

          <p>Four senior officials who recently resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a rally with supporters, calling for politics to be removed from public health. The officials, including former chief medical officer Debra Houry, cited political interference and the spread of misinformation under the Trump administration as the reasons for their departure. Their resignations were a direct protest following the firing of newly confirmed CDC chief Susan Monarez. At the event across from the CDC's Atlanta campus, the former leaders emphasized the need for science to guide public health decisions and vowed to be advocates for the agency's dedicated staff.</p>

          <p>A major leadership crisis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has erupted, centered on concerns over political interference in vaccine policy and public health science. The turmoil includes the firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the resignation of four other top health officials, who cited the "weaponizing of public health." These events follow a series of overhauls by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, which have included firing scientific advisers and altering immunization guidelines. Health experts warn that this upheaval could erode public trust and weaken the nation's ability to respond to disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Amid rising levels of employee burnout, a lifestyle expert suggests practical ways for workers to reduce stress and improve their work-life balance. According to Maisha Wynn, author of "The Wynning Way," employees should structure their day around their energy levels, tackling demanding tasks in the morning and simpler activities later on. She also recommends building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key strategy for avoiding burnout is setting boundaries and learning to say "no" when necessary, prioritizing self-care to maintain overall well-being and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has scheduled a Friday hearing on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her. Cook's legal challenge calls the move an unprecedented and illegal effort to subvert the independence of the central bank. The Trump administration cited allegations of mortgage fraud as the "cause" for removal, a claim Cook's attorney calls a "nakedly pretextual" excuse that does not meet the legal standard. The lawsuit, which also names Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a defendant, asks the court to declare the firing order unlawful and affirm Cook's position on the board.</p>

The piece critiques the notion of "independent" agencies as being in tension with the separation of powers and suggests that Supreme Court precedent is moving toward restoring presidential removal power. It concludes that the allegations of mortgage fraud against Cook constitute a legitimate "cause" for removal, and that such actions are necessary to ensure the president can control the government.</p>

The judge found that the plaintiffs provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles played by individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve are concerning, the more significant threat to its independence is the nation's growing public debt. The author explains the concept of "fiscal dominance," where a central bank's monetary policy becomes subordinate to the government's need to finance its debt, forcing it to keep interest rates low. As U.S. debt and interest payments rise, the pressure on the Fed to accommodate fiscal policy will intensify regardless of who is president.

The company raised its full-year revenue outlook and announced plans to double its AI server shipments next fiscal year, but a weaker-than-expected storage business performance contributed to the soft near-term profit guidance.

          <p>With seniors facing financial pressures from inflation and concerns over Social Security, gaps in Medicare coverage for medical expenses can be a significant burden. This article outlines several financial strategies for older adults to cover out-of-pocket costs like copays and deductibles. Options include purchasing Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to pay for these leftover expenses. Other potential solutions are leveraging home equity through a reverse mortgage, a product available only to homeowners 62 and older, or securing a future income stream by purchasing an annuity to ensure consistent monthly payments.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart. The deal, which could be a club record fee, is seen as a significant move that might influence the future of current striker Alexander Isak, who has been a target for Liverpool. Woltemade is said to be traveling to Tyneside for a medical after a breakout year where he scored 17 goals for Stuttgart and was the top scorer at the Under-21 Euros. The acquisition of a new top-tier striker was one of the conditions Newcastle had set for potentially considering offers for Isak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues for legal reforms to prevent individuals who have been subjected to emergency psychiatric holds from purchasing firearms. The author points out that under federal law and in many states, these temporary, involuntary commitments do not trigger a loss of gun rights, unlike judicial commitments. The article cites the case of a recent Manhattan shooter who had been placed on two such holds in Nevada but was still able to legally buy a gun. The author advocates for states to adopt temporary, reviewable firearm prohibitions for these individuals and for Congress to close loopholes related to concealed-carry permits.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis police stated that locked church doors likely saved "countless lives" during the mass shooting at Annunciation Catholic School, as they prevented the shooter from entering the building. The attacker, 23-year-old Robin Westman, instead fired through the windows, killing two children and injuring 17 others during a morning Mass. Investigators have found that Westman had a "deranged fascination" with other mass shooters and had planned the attack in detail, creating diagrams of the church's interior.

          <p>South Carolina officials have filed an emergency request with the U.S. Supreme Court to allow full enforcement of a state policy restricting transgender students from using restrooms that align with their gender identity. The policy ties a portion of state education funding to school districts' compliance with the rule. A federal appeals court recently blocked the state from enforcing the policy against a specific transgender high school student who had filed a lawsuit. State officials argue that the policy reflects the will of the legislature and is necessary to protect student privacy, asking the high court to intervene while the case proceeds.</p>

The goal is to reignite innovation, which some critics felt had lagged as the company shifted focus to lifestyle products.
