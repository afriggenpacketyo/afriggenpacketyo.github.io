          <p>Television presenter Gregg Wallace is facing new claims from 50 additional people, which he denies, following an initial investigation into misconduct allegations. A senior barrister has publicly warned Wallace against dismissing the women's claims as fabricated, suggesting it could hinder any potential career comeback. The head of the broadcast union Bectu also criticized the presenter for potentially "gaslighting" those who have come forward with legitimate complaints. These developments add to an ongoing inquiry by MasterChef's production company, which has already resulted in Wallace being dismissed from the show.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire that reached the edge of Marseille, France, has injured at least 110 people, including firefighters and police officers, and forced the evacuation of 400 residents. The city's mayor stated the blaze is diminishing but not yet fully controlled, with around 800 firefighters battling the flames. The fire, which authorities believe was sparked by a car fire on a motorway, spread rapidly due to strong winds and dry conditions. The incident caused significant disruptions, including the temporary closure of Marseille Provence airport, one of the busiest in France.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has denied a report claiming it provided air defense systems to Iran. The report, from the Middle East Eye, cited an Arab official who alleged that the military equipment was sent after Iran and Israel reached a truce last month, with payment made in oil shipments. In response, China's embassy in Israel stated that the country never exports weapons to nations engaged in active warfare and maintains strict controls on dual-use items. The embassy emphasized China's firm opposition to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.</p>

          <p>This article examines Donald Trump's policy to revoke birthright citizenship for children of non-citizen immigrants, drawing comparisons to historical actions, including those in Nazi Germany. While Germany historically based citizenship on ancestry, the Nazis later revoked citizenship from Jewish, Roma, and Black people. The article notes that birthright citizenship is a hallmark of the Americas, enshrined in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment to grant rights to formerly enslaved people. Critics, such as Democratic congressman Jamie Raskin, label citizenship stripping as a hallmark of authoritarianism, while supporters point out that unrestricted birthright citizenship is uncommon among industrialized nations.</p>

By highlighting inconsistencies in their testimonies and challenging their recollections of alleged events, the defense successfully created doubt.

          <p>China has successfully completed a 1,856-kilometer (1,153-mile) green belt aimed at containing three major deserts in the Inner Mongolia region. The project, part of a larger "green great wall" initiative, connects the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. Engineers used a method of creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands, which are then planted with drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul. This ecological barrier is designed to prevent further desertification and strengthen the region's environmental defenses against encroaching sands, marking a significant milestone in China's environmental efforts.</p>

          <p>This article explores a significant shift in Donald Trump's policy towards Ukraine, questioning the reasons behind his sudden approval of sending defensive weapons to the country. After previously rejecting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's requests for such support, Trump announced the move during a cabinet meeting where he also criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin. This U-turn has prompted speculation about the state of Trump's relationship with Putin and the strategic motivations for the policy change. The development adds another layer of complexity to the ongoing geopolitical landscape surrounding the war in Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to move forward with its plan to significantly reduce the federal workforce. The court lifted a lower court's injunction that had temporarily blocked the job cuts, which are being carried out by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This ruling means that federal employees can be dismissed while legal challenges against the policy continue in lower courts. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was the only member to publicly dissent, warning that the executive action could lead to mass terminations and the dismantling of government services.</p>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced prominent opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi to 14 years in prison as part of a mass trial involving 21 individuals. Ghannouchi, the 84-year-old leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, was tried on charges including inciting violence and attempting to overthrow the government. Other defendants, many of whom have fled the country, received sentences of up to 35 years. This verdict is part of a broader crackdown on opposition by President Kais Saied, which critics argue is undermining the democratic progress made since the 2011 Arab Spring.</p>

          <p>State inspectors in Texas approved the emergency disaster plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a catastrophic flood killed more than two dozen people, most of whom were children. Records show the camp met state regulations for disaster procedures, but the specifics of the plan and the camp's preparedness are now under intense scrutiny. Despite flood watches being issued by the National Weather Service more than 12 hours before the disaster, the camp did not relocate its 650 campers and staff. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, overwhelming the camp in the early morning hours.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has secured guilty pleas from two individuals accused of illegally selling a rifle to Ryan Routh, the man charged with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Tina Brown Cooper pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking, and Ronnie Jay Oxendine pleaded guilty to possessing an unregistered firearm. Prosecutors allege that Cooper acted as a middleman for Oxendine in selling an SKS rifle to Routh for $350 in cash, knowing that Routh was a convicted felon prohibited from owning firearms. Routh was later found with an SKS-style rifle outside Trump's golf club.</p>

          <h2>Historical Data Shows Deadly Texas Flood Was a Known and Repeated Risk</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hydrologists and historical records indicate that the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River in Texas was a foreseeable event. The region, known as "Flash Flood Alley," has experienced major, deadly floods more than a dozen times in the last century, with the river reaching similar or even higher levels in past events. Experts note that the area's steep terrain and rocky ground cause it to react very quickly to heavy rainfall, leaving little time for warnings. Despite this known risk, increased population density and the overnight timing of the storm contributed to the recent tragedy's devastating outcome.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has drawn criticism for his response to a question about accountability for the deadly flood in Kerr County. During a press conference, when a reporter asked if there would be an investigation into "who is to blame," Abbott dismissed the phrasing as the "word choice of losers." He then compared the situation to football, a comment that has been perceived as insensitive in the wake of a tragedy that has left over 100 people confirmed dead and more than 160 missing. The governor's remarks have shifted some focus to the political handling of the disaster's aftermath.</p>

          <p>Kerr County, Texas, authorities discussed implementing a modern flood warning system at least 20 times in official meetings since 2016 but failed to take action before last week's deadly flood. Meeting minutes reveal that commissioners were aware their county, a high-risk flood zone, lacked the advanced systems of neighboring areas. The plan repeatedly stalled due to a failure to secure grant funding and opposition from some officials who deemed it extravagant. The county relied instead on an informal "river calling" phone tree, which proved insufficient to warn camps and residents of the rapidly rising Guadalupe River.</p>
