          <p>A multi-million pound drug empire in South Wales was dismantled following a police investigation sparked by incriminating WhatsApp messages found on another gang leader's phone, which led authorities to Robert Andrews Jr. Despite presenting as a hard-working father, Andrews Jr. was the mastermind behind extensive cocaine and heroin distribution, conducting large-scale deals, sometimes exchanging over £100,000 in supermarket bags at a secluded woodland location known as "the clearing." Covert surveillance captured these brazen transactions, and his recovered mobile phone provided detailed logs of his illicit network. Andrews Jr. was sentenced to 14 years and eight months, with other key figures also receiving significant prison terms, highlighting the successful disruption of a major organized crime group.</p>

          <h2>Study Links Cannabis Use to Reduced Female Fertility and IVF Success</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the CReATe Fertility Centre in Toronto suggests that cannabis use, particularly its active ingredient THC, negatively impacts female fertility and the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Researchers found that THC disrupts the development and genetic stability of egg cells, leading to a significantly lower rate of euploid (genetically healthy) embryos in THC-positive patients. This article explains that while the study found eggs mature slightly faster, the overall probability of a successful pregnancy is reduced, with observed errors in cell division and defective egg cell structures. Experts note limitations, including a lack of data on consumption habits and patient age, calling for further research.</p>

          <p>China has issued multiple travel advisories since April, warning its citizens about public security risks and crimes targeting Chinese individuals in the Philippines, which analysts believe could significantly slow two-way trade, investment, and higher education exchanges. The latest notice from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs described an "unstable" security situation, while the Ministry of Education also issued warnings for Chinese students. This article highlights that while average Chinese visitors for legal purposes rarely face issues, the rapid succession of these advisories suggests a potential strategic move by Beijing. The warnings are expected to impact economic links between the two nations, adding a layer of caution for Chinese citizens considering travel or business in the archipelago.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford made history by defeating Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas, becoming the first male fighter in the modern era to hold undisputed titles in three different weight divisions. Jumping up two weight classes, the unbeaten 37-year-old delivered a masterclass performance, showcasing exceptional skill, defense, power, and timing against the 35-year-old Alvarez in front of a fiercely pro-Alvarez crowd. Despite the judges' closer-than-expected scores, the verdict capped off a defining performance that solidified Crawford's status as boxing's pound-for-pound star. This article highlights his unprecedented achievement, though Crawford himself hinted at potential retirement after his 42nd consecutive professional win.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, Germany continues to grapple with the lingering legacy of the racist Nuremberg Laws, which systematically disenfranchised and persecuted Jewish Germans and other groups. This article highlights how the fundamental value of equality for all citizens, enshrined in Germany's Basic Law, is being challenged by contemporary far-right rhetoric, particularly from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Historians draw direct comparisons between the Nazi-era distinctions of citizenship and the AfD's concept of "real Germans" versus "passport Germans." Racial discrimination based on ancestry remains a problem, underscoring the ongoing struggle to overcome prejudice and ensure true equality for all residents, including immigrants.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the complex and highly publicized Amanda Knox case, detailing the 2007 murder of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy. It chronicles Knox's arrest alongside her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, and the subsequent media frenzy, intense interrogations, and evolving police theories, which initially included a "kinky sex" motive. The investigation saw the initial suspect, Patrick Lumumba, released due to an alibi, and the eventual conviction of Rudy Guede, whose DNA was found at the scene. The article highlights criticisms of the Italian police's methods, including a questioned confession from Knox and disputed forensic evidence, as well as the long legal battles that ultimately led to Knox and Sollecito's convictions being overturned.</p>

          <p>A growing trend among teenagers involves intense bodybuilding, often inspired by social media, where they engage in "cut and bulk" cycles to achieve a muscular physique. This article explains that this process involves alternating periods of high-calorie intake to gain muscle and fat, followed by reduced calories to shed fat for definition. While some teenagers like 14-year-old George Holland find it beneficial for mental health and discipline, sports nutritionists warn of potential harms. Concerns include impacts on hormone health, growth, development, and the risk of eating disorders like muscle dysmorphia, especially given the prevalence of unverified advice found on platforms like TikTok.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is facing a critical legal challenge that could declare its 38th party congress "absolutely null and void," potentially stripping its reform-minded leadership of legitimacy. This article details how the trial, initiated by the party's traditional nationalist wing, alleges illegal election processes and delegate vote-buying, plunging the party into internal chaos. Political observers suggest President Erdogan may be attempting to weaken the CHP, which has seen increased popularity and resistance to repression, by fostering internal divisions. The outcome, expected soon, could either allow the current leadership to continue or see the former chairman or a temporary administrator take control, significantly impacting Turkey's political landscape.</p>

Initially, suspicion fell on his new widow, Jennifer Hagel, but the focus shifted to a group of young men last seen with Smith, whose accounts and alibis were questioned. The article highlights compelling evidence, including a large bloodstain on a lifeboat canopy, blood in Smith's cabin, and a provocative video made by the men after his disappearance. Despite strong suspicions of foul play, including a possible robbery attempt and a struggle, the FBI ultimately closed the case due to insufficient evidence, leaving the family still seeking justice.</p>

The author highlights significant roster differences, with the Eagles boasting a stronger, more diverse offensive cast compared to the Chiefs, who heavily rely on Patrick Mahomes. Key Chiefs' receivers are injured or suspended, and their run game has been ineffective, forcing Mahomes to risk his health with frequent scrambles.

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, President of the United Nations General Assembly, has suggested the potential deployment of UN peacekeeping forces, known as Blue Helmets, to Ukraine to secure a ceasefire and post-war peace. This article reports that such a mission would depend on the support of a majority of UN member states and, crucially, on Russia's approval within the UN Security Council, where it holds veto power. While ceasefire talks between Ukraine and Russia remain stalled, with Russia linking negotiations to Ukraine's NATO ambitions, Baerbock emphasizes the increasing necessity of UN peace missions globally. The proposal offers a potential pathway to lasting peace, despite significant political hurdles.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's heavy reliance on imported energy, particularly from nations like Qatar, presents a critical vulnerability that could paralyze the island within days if a conflict erupts with Beijing. This article highlights a report from the Foundation for Defence of Democracies (FDD), which warns that Taiwan's limited energy storage capacity creates a strategic liability. The report suggests that China could exploit this weakness through "cyber-enabled economic warfare, selective maritime quarantines and diplomatic pressure on Taiwan’s energy providers." This reliance not only risks grid reliability but also undermines societal resilience and economic continuity, posing a dangerous possibility for Taiwan's security in the face of potential aggression.</p>

He suggested 50% to 100% tariffs on China, to be withdrawn once the war ends, claiming China has a "strong control" over Russia.
