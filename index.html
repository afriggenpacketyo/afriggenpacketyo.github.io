        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education unanimously declared the "separate but equal" doctrine unconstitutional in public education, overturning the precedent set by Plessy v. Ferguson. This pivotal ruling culminated decades of strategic legal battles led by the NAACP and its brilliant attorney, Thurgood Marshall, who argued that segregation aimed to maintain a state of subjugation. While the decision did not immediately eradicate all forms of racial segregation across society, particularly in housing and schools, it undeniably served as a monumental catalyst for the civil rights movement. The article emphasizes its crucial role in pushing the United States closer to its founding ideals of equality and justice for all citizens, with Marshall later becoming the first African American Supreme Court Justice.</p>

McLaren's Oscar Piastri, despite an error-strewn weekend and a first-lap crash, managed to retain a relatively comfortable championship lead. George Russell delivered an excellent race, moving from fifth to second, while Carlos Sainz secured a commendable third place, earning Williams their first podium since 2021.

          <p>The Seabed 2030 project, a joint initiative by the United Nations and the Nippon Foundation, aims to comprehensively map the entire ocean floor by the end of this decade, with only about 20% currently surveyed. This ambitious undertaking promises significant scientific discoveries, including unknown mountains and canyons, and could offer crucial insights into climate change and past human societies. However, the article highlights substantial challenges, such as geopolitical fragmentation, waning political motivation, and immense costs. Critics also voice concerns that more complete mapping could accelerate the exploitation of deep-sea resources, underscoring the critical need for robust international conservation and governance.</p>

          <p>The UK, Australia, and Canada have formally recognized a Palestinian state, with France and other nations expected to follow suit, despite strong opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the US. This recognition is primarily symbolic, serving as a powerful moral and political statement rather than immediately altering the complex realities on the ground. Palestine, while enjoying considerable international recognition and diplomatic presence, still lacks internationally agreed-upon boundaries, a defined capital, or an independent army due to the ongoing dispute with Israel. The article details how supporters view this move as a vital step towards a two-state solution, while opponents criticize it as rewarding terrorism.</p>

          <p>St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City has unveiled a remarkable new mural by artist Adam Cvijanovic, titled "What's So Funny About Peace, Love and Understanding," marking the first major addition in 75 years. The artwork powerfully celebrates the continuous pilgrimage of God's people, depicting historical and present-day immigrants arriving in New York. Cardinal Timothy Dolan enthusiastically embraced the theme, drawing parallels to the Holy Family as refugees and openly criticizing contemporary anti-immigrant rhetoric.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critically examines how authoritarian regimes, from historical Nazi Germany to contemporary Trumpism, strategically leverage women's roles in the home to propagate state ideology and maintain social stability. It draws stark parallels between fascist pronatalist policies and modern conservative movements that promote traditional gender roles, often discouraging women's workforce participation. The online "womanosphere" is identified as a current, influential vehicle for disseminating these values, frequently framing regressive policies as appealing lifestyle aesthetics. The analysis suggests that while these movements offer a veneer of domestic bliss, they ultimately undermine women's autonomy and rights by politicizing family life and demanding conformity.</p>

This article argues that American pressure has catalyzed Chinese innovation, pushing it towards greater self-sufficiency in critical fields like artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

While Warren Buffett acknowledged BYD as an "extraordinary company," he indicated a desire to find alternative investments.

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is projected to strengthen into a hurricane and is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday. As of Sunday morning, Gabrielle was situated southeast of Bermuda, moving north-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. No watches or warnings were in effect for land areas, as the storm is largely anticipated to remain over open waters. However, swells generated by Gabrielle are forecast to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the East Coast from North Carolina northward to Atlantic Canada, urging coastal caution.</p>

          <p>Premium travel rewards credit cards are experiencing significant increases in their annual fees, with some now exceeding $500 per year, prompting financial experts to advise consumers to carefully reassess their value. Issuers like American Express, Chase, and Citi have either raised fees or altered perks, such as airport lounge access. This article emphasizes that such high annual fees are only worthwhile if cardholders fully utilize the benefits and rigorously avoid carrying a monthly balance, as interest rates on these cards can be substantial. Consumers should thoroughly evaluate their travel habits and consider whether co-branded or general travel cards best suit their financial and lifestyle needs. (not investment advice)</p>

This article highlights the growing tension between developers, who promote "authentic Brooklyn energy," and community members who fear displacement and the loss of local heritage.
