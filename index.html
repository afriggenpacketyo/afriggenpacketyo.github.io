          <p>Dongchoon Circus, South Korea's last circus and oldest, commemorates its 100th anniversary. Founded in 1925, Dongchoon flourished during the 1960s, entertaining audiences with animal acts and diverse performances. However, the advent of television, the internet, and animal rights concerns led to the decline of circuses in South Korea, leaving Dongchoon as the sole survivor. Headed by Park Sae-hwan, the circus now features only acrobatic performances with a troupe of Chinese acrobats, and is performing at a big top in Ansan, drawing hundreds of spectators on weekdays and up to 2,000 on weekends, contributing to local tourism.</p>

Other headlines include the UK potentially delaying NATO spending targets and concerns about welfare reforms. The Financial Times reports a US national security warning regarding Chinese technology in North Sea wind farms, while the Daily Express highlights Dame Esther Rantzen's daughter advocating for assisted dying.</p>

          <p>Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was cited for driving 101 mph in a 60 mph zone in suburban Cleveland. The incident occurred just past midnight on Tuesday, and Sanders could face a $250 fine to waive the misdemeanor case.

          <p>President Donald Trump questioned the immigration status of workers installing new flagpoles at the White House. During a press conference, Trump, appearing to jest, asked the construction workers if there were any "illegal immigrants" among them. He followed up by saying, "If there were, we'll find out," and joked about their lives being destroyed by the press conference. The remarks came after the installation of two 88-foot-tall flagpoles, which Trump described as a gift to the White House, amidst his administration's efforts to oversee mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel's objective in its actions against Iran is to eliminate its nuclear program, not to pursue regime change. Speaking to CNBC, Herzog accused Iran of "cheating" and "rushing to the bomb," while noting a change in regime could bring peace to the region. He emphasized the need to be tough to remove imminent threats, asserting that the strikes have impacted Iran's nuclear program. Herzog also mentioned ongoing back-channel talks and dialogue with world leaders to de-escalate the situation, contrasting China's stance which condemns Israel's violation of Iran's sovereignty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty liabilities amid rising tariffs. This legal practice involves altering a product's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements into their products to qualify for lower duties, while others remove these elements when tariffs change. Companies such as Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs; Columbia adds zippered pockets to shirts, and Converse adds fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles.</p>

Hashimoto believes that while the acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, trade levies alone will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary, having concluded a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, pledging to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain the headquarters in Pittsburgh.</p>

          <p>Israel's military issued a warning on social media, urging people to evacuate the area around Iran's Arak heavy water reactor. This action comes amidst Israel's ongoing airstrikes on Iran, which have targeted various nuclear sites and military areas. The Arak reactor, located 250 kilometers southwest of Tehran, is significant because heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors and produces plutonium, which can be used in nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has been urging Israel not to strike Iranian nuclear sites, but restrictions imposed by Iran have limited the IAEA's knowledge about Iran's heavy water production.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty in her murder trial, sparking cheers from supporters who gathered outside the Massachusetts court. The case, which involved the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, gained significant attention due to a fervent TikTok following and multiple documentaries. Supporters, often wearing pink, saw the case as a result of a flawed criminal justice system and related to Ms. Read's circumstances. The first trial collapsed in July 2024 due to a hung jury, and Ms. Read maintained she was framed by the police for murder.</p>

          <p>The Social Security retirement trust fund may be depleted in 2033, according to an annual report by the Social Security Board of Trustees. At that time, 77% of those benefits will be payable.

The Disability Insurance fund is expected to pay full benefits through at least 2099. The report also considers the effects of the Social Security Fairness Act, which enhanced benefits for certain public pensioners, potentially moving the depletion date closer.

The complaint details a sprawling plot involving TikTok messages and jail calls, implicating prisoners and gang members. The motive for the alleged murder plot is unclear, but prosecutors say it played out over TikTok messages and recorded jail calls, drawing in prisoners from Kern County, jail inmates in downtown Los Angeles and gang members in Paramount, the southeast Los Angeles County city that both Quintero and Abrego call home.
