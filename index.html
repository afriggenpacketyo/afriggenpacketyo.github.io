          <p>Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has entered into a $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of advanced semiconductors. The deal, which runs until 2033, is centered on producing Tesla's next-generation AI chips at a new Samsung facility in Texas. Musk highlighted the strategic importance of this partnership, stating he will personally oversee efforts to maximize manufacturing efficiency and suggesting the deal's value could ultimately exceed the initial figure. This partnership is crucial for Tesla's future AI development, while Samsung aims to bolster its position in the competitive foundry market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former sanitation worker at the Dharmasthala temple in Karnataka, India, has alleged that temple officials covered up hundreds of murders and sexual assaults over nearly two decades. In a police complaint, the man claimed he was forced to dispose of numerous bodies, many of whom were women and underage girls showing signs of violence. Following these revelations and pressure from activists, the state government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the claims. The case has prompted families of missing persons to demand their cases be reopened, while the temple administration has stated its support for a transparent investigation.</p>

          <p>Shi Yongxin, the abbot of the world-famous Shaolin Temple, is under criminal investigation in China for multiple serious allegations, including embezzlement and improper relationships. Known as the "CEO monk" for commercializing the 1,500-year-old institution, he has been stripped of his ordination certificate by China's Buddhist association. The association stated his actions have severely damaged the reputation of the Buddhist community. This is not the first time Shi has faced such scrutiny, having been cleared of similar charges in 2015, but the current probe has become a major topic of discussion in China.</p>

The brutal stabbing, which occurred just days after the conflict began, sent shockwaves through the local Palestinian American community and renewed fears of anti-Muslim violence.

In return, the EU has committed to significant investments in U.S. energy and arms.

The model forecasts a more than 46% drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent years, as the 15% tariff framework encourages countries to rewire trade relationships away from America. While the U.S. may see an increase in its own exports, countries like China, Canada, and Mexico are predicted to see a sharp decline in their exports to the U.S. market.

          <p>A sharp division has emerged within the House Republican conference over a push to force a vote on releasing federal files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized a bipartisan discharge petition, co-sponsored by Rep. Thomas Massie, as "reckless" for not adequately protecting victims' identities. Massie fired back, calling the Speaker's reasoning a "straw man argument" and warning that failing to hold a vote could become a political liability for the GOP in the midterms. The internal conflict highlights the intense pressure from the party's base to release the documents and expose anyone involved in Epstein's crimes.</p>

          <p>Tyler Boebert, the 20-year-old son of U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, has received a misdemeanor citation for child abuse related to an incident involving his own young son. The citation for "criminal negligence" reportedly stems from a "miscommunication on monitoring" the child, who got out of the house but was not injured. In a statement, the congresswoman said her son has been doing a great job getting his life on track and that she would continue to support him. This follows previous legal issues for Tyler, who last year pleaded guilty to a felony charge related to property thefts.</p>
