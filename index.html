          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on whether Oklahoma can fund a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, with taxpayer dollars. The case hinges on whether charter schools are considered "public" entities and if the First Amendment allows religious organizations to receive state funding. The school argues that denying funding is religious discrimination, while Oklahoma contends that charter schools must be nonsectarian. A ruling in favor of the school could have significant implications for charter school programs nationwide.</p>

          <p>Kanye West, now known as Ye, has released his previously exclusive album "Donda 2" to streaming services, after initially making it available only on his proprietary Stem player. The album, recorded before West's descent into openly neo-Nazi rhetoric, includes collaborations with artists like Future and Jack Harlow. The release comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding West's actions and statements, including selling swastika-branded merchandise and making disturbing claims about his personal life. New details have also emerged regarding the troubled Donda Academy.</p>

          <p>European carmakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Stellantis, and Volkswagen, are expressing pessimism about the future due to the chaos and uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. The tariffs have disrupted supply chains and customer demand, leading Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis to suspend their financial forecasts for 2025. While Trump announced changes to the tariffs to provide "a little flexibility," the industry argues that more clarity is needed to assess the exact impact and implement necessary measures.</p>
