          <p>President Trump has announced new tariffs of 30% on both the European Union and Mexico, citing the U.S. trade deficit and the cross-border fentanyl trade as the respective justifications. The policy was revealed through posts on his social media platform, signaling a significant and abrupt move in the administration's protectionist trade strategy. This development creates new uncertainty for international trade relations and markets, with potential impacts on a wide range of consumer goods and industries.</p>

          <p>Two men have appeared in court following a police chase in Sunderland that ended when a stolen BMW crashed into a care home. The incident led to the deaths of two elderly female residents the following day, and their deaths are currently under investigation to determine if the crash was a contributing factor. One of the suspects is also charged with causing serious injury to another resident, while the police's involvement in the pursuit has triggered a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.</p>

          <p>New research published in a medical journal suggests a link between the painkiller gabapentin and a higher risk of developing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The observational study found that patients prescribed the drug for chronic lower back pain, particularly those between 35 and 64, faced a significantly increased risk within 10 years. While the study cannot establish direct causation, the findings support the need for closer monitoring of patients for potential cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, was rescued after being lost for eleven nights in the remote Western Australian outback. She survived by drinking from puddles and taking shelter in a cave after her van became stuck in dense bushland, forcing her to walk 24km in a disoriented state. Police, who described her survival as "sheer luck," said she was found suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and extensive insect bites before being airlifted to a hospital.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece strongly criticizes the new immigrant detention camp in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a performative and cruel political stunt. The author argues that behind its cinematic branding lies a real concentration camp with inhumane conditions, including poor sanitation, inadequate food, and exposure to extreme weather. The article contends that these conditions are designed to inflict suffering and will inevitably lead to the deaths of detainees held on civil violations.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, former high-level officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are warning that the agency is dangerously under-resourced. They claim a mass exodus of staff, plunging morale, and grant cuts under the Trump administration have eroded FEMA's capacity to respond effectively. The former insiders express serious concern that the agency is ill-equipped to handle the current hurricane season, especially if multiple major disasters were to strike simultaneously.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report into last month's Air India crash in Ahmedabad, which killed 260 people on the plane and on the ground, has found that fuel to the engines was cut off just seconds after takeoff.

Recovered cockpit recordings reveal the pilots' confusion in their final moments, but families are still seeking clarity on whether the tragedy was avoidable.</p>

Recent graduates with degrees in fields like art history and philosophy have shown lower unemployment rates than those in finance and economics.
