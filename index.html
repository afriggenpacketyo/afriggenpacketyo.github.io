          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is facing trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government following his 2022 election loss. The charges include plotting a coup and forming a criminal organization, in a case viewed by many as a critical test for Brazil's democratic institutions. The trial is unprecedented in the nation's history, as no former leader has been successfully prosecuted for such crimes. The proceedings are drawing international attention, partly due to vocal support for Bolsonaro from former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski has been elected as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales in a decisive victory. A member of the London Assembly, Polanski campaigned on a platform of "eco-populism" and has pledged to make the party's approach more radical and bold. In his victory speech, he positioned the Green Party as a "green left" alternative to the Labour Party, vowing to hold the government accountable on issues ranging from social welfare to foreign policy. His election signals a significant change in direction for the party.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has engaged in European football's largest-ever summer spending spree, investing £415 million to strengthen their squad after winning the previous Premier League title. Key acquisitions include Florian Wirtz for a potential £116 million and Alexander Isak for £125 million, shattering transfer records. This unprecedented financial outlay has solidified their position as strong favorites to win the league again. The massive investment places significant pressure on head coach Arne Slot to secure a major trophy, such as the Premier League or Champions League.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose significantly as a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal, a power reserved for Congress. This decision raises the possibility that the government may have to refund billions in collected tariff revenue, which could strain the U.S. fiscal situation and necessitate increased Treasury issuance. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield surpassed 4.28%, while the 30-year yield approached 4.98%.

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared the mpox surge a global health emergency, the virus has spread to 26 African nations, a significant increase from the previous year. Despite pledges of over $1 billion, critics argue the global response has been dangerously inadequate, particularly concerning vaccine distribution, with many promised doses failing to reach the continent. While recent data suggests a decline in cases in some key countries, experts warn that the virus is becoming entrenched in the human population, and limited data collection hampers effective containment efforts, raising concerns about future pandemic preparedness.</p>

The authors contrast the current administration's response with the university's celebrated history of campus activism, such as the anti-apartheid protests of the 1980s.

While Donnarumma is renowned for his shot-stopping abilities and big-game experience, he is not known for the same level of skill with his feet as Ederson, whose distribution was central to City's playing style.

          <p>An opinion piece draws parallels between the Soviet Union's manipulation of data and the Trump administration's recent actions toward U.S. statistical agencies. The author argues that by firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner over "disappointing" job numbers and challenging official crime data, the administration is fostering a belief that all official data is fake. This erosion of public trust in statistics is dangerous for democracy, as it eliminates shared reference points for debate and makes it easier for authoritarian narratives to take hold. The piece calls for resistance to this trend to preserve transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has returned from its August recess with a pressing deadline to fund the government by September 30 and avert a shutdown. Lawmakers face a deeply partisan environment with disagreements over spending levels, making a short-term funding measure likely. In addition to the budget, the agenda includes contentious issues such as potential changes to Senate nomination rules to fast-track President Trump's appointees, a push for a new crime bill, and continued demands for the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. These overlapping priorities promise a chaotic and confrontational legislative session.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spending on political advertising for the 2025-2026 midterm election cycle is projected to hit a record $10.8 billion, a 20% increase from the 2022 midterms, according to AdImpact. This surge is driven by a highly competitive political landscape, with control of both the House and Senate at stake. A significant portion of the growth is expected in connected TV (CTV) and streaming services, which are forecast to attract $2.5 billion in spending. Broadcast television will still command the largest share, while key battleground states like California, Michigan, and Georgia are expected to see the highest levels of ad expenditure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies indicate that a growing percentage of young men are single, and many report being less satisfied with their lives compared to single women. This phenomenon is linked to rigid masculine norms that discourage emotional expression and vulnerability, leading men to rely solely on a romantic partner for emotional support. This lack of broader social and emotional skills can make it difficult for men to form both platonic and romantic relationships. The article suggests that moving toward a more flexible model of masculinity, one that embraces vulnerability and diverse emotional connections, could help address this growing issue of male loneliness.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the growing American ownership of English Premier League clubs—now 11 out of 20—marks the end of America's traditional sporting isolationism. The author reflects on a time when soccer was viewed with suspicion in the U.S., contrasting it with the present day where the Premier League is widely followed and American kids grow up playing the sport. This cultural shift is attributed to factors like Title IX, immigration, and global marketing, which have integrated the world's most popular sport into the American mainstream, connecting the U.S. to the rest of the world in a new way.</p>

          <p>As Oasis's reunion tour sparks a wave of Britpop nostalgia, the band Suede, widely credited with igniting the movement in the early 1990s, is releasing its 10th studio album. In a recent interview, frontman Brett Anderson and bassist Mat Osman discussed their role as genre originators and their subsequent dissociation from Britpop as it became more jingoistic and commercially simplified. The band maintains an "anti-nostalgia" stance, continuing to evolve their sound rather than resting on past successes. Their enduring career contrasts with the legacy of bands like Oasis, who came to define Britpop for a global audience.</p>

          <p>At age 37, future Hall of Fame pitcher Clayton Kershaw is experiencing a remarkable career revival, which he and the team's training staff attribute to a significant evolution in his training regimen. After years of being hampered by back injuries, Kershaw adopted a new, more holistic approach focused on the mobility and stability of his core and pelvic area, which the staff nicknamed "the bowl." This shift away from a rigid, heavy-lifting routine to one incorporating mobility drills and core stabilization has allowed him to feel healthier and pitch more effectively, posting a 9-2 record this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a significant barrier to on-time college graduation is the inability of students to enroll in required courses for their majors when they need them. A study found that colleges manage to provide necessary courses at the right time in only about 15% of cases, forcing students to spend more time and money to complete their degrees. The problem is expected to worsen due to budget cuts and layoffs, such as those seen in the California State University system, where hundreds of course sections have been eliminated. This scheduling failure can lead students to change majors or drop out entirely.</p>

While motivated by frustration with the city's cleanliness, the group has become an antidote to loneliness for its members, fostering deep friendships and a sense of civic purpose.
