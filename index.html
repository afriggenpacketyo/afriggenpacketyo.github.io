          <p>During a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gifted "inoperable plastic 3D-printed replica pistols" to local officials, including the Police Commissioner and spy agency bosses. New Zealand authorities subsequently determined that these replicas could be modified to become operable, rendering them illegal under the country's strict firearms laws, which were strengthened after a 2019 mass shooting. All gifted items were promptly destroyed in compliance with local regulations. The U.S. embassy acknowledged the incident, stating that the gift was well-intentioned, while the FBI has not issued a public comment on the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has implemented a ban on "buy one, get one free" and other multi-buy promotions for unhealthy food and drinks in supermarkets and online retailers. This long-anticipated measure, previously delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, aims to tackle the nation's rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Public health experts welcome the move as a vital first step, noting that such promotions encourage overspending and impulsive purchases of less healthy items. Early studies suggest that restrictions on unhealthy product placement have already led to a reduction in sales, indicating the potential for this new ban to further improve public health outcomes.</p>

          <p>China's military perceives the United States' expanded joint cyber and AI-integrated exercises with Japan and South Korea as a significant risk to regional security. A Chinese military commentary article asserted that these drills extend beyond traditional cooperation, evolving into strategic tools used by external powers to destabilize the region. Beijing contends that "exaggerated regional threats" concerning China and North Korea are being employed to justify the increasing frequency, geographic scope, and operational domains of these military exercises. This highlights escalating tensions and differing interpretations of security postures in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant infrastructure milestone, with its total subsea pipeline network now surpassing 10,000 kilometers, marking a substantial boost to its offshore energy capabilities. This expansion is crucial for the nation's energy security needs, with a particular concentration in Bohai Bay, one of China's largest offshore oil production bases. The government plans to extend the network to over 13,000 kilometers by 2030. Importantly, these modern pipelines are designed with the flexibility to transport green fuels like hydrogen and shale gas, supporting China's broader energy transition and diversification efforts towards cleaner energy sources.</p>

European leaders are now convening to discuss new defense measures, including the controversial concept of a "drone wall" along Europe's eastern border to intercept unauthorized drones. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte supports this initiative, although concerns persist about the bloc's slow progress in enhancing its deterrence capabilities against evolving threats.</p>

          <p>Mark Rutte's inaugural year as NATO Secretary General has been widely praised by foreign-policy experts for his adept navigation of complex international relations. Assuming leadership amidst concerns about a re-elected Donald Trump's commitment to NATO, Rutte successfully lobbied European allies to increase defense spending, securing Trump's engagement with the alliance. Experts credit Rutte with maintaining NATO's cohesion and re-establishing its credibility, despite occasional communication missteps and the need to "ingratiate" himself with the US president. His leadership has provided crucial time for Europe to enhance its military capabilities, though new external pressures like drone incursions pose ongoing tests.</p>

          <p>A powerful magnitude-6.9 earthquake has devastated a central Philippine province, resulting in at least 69 fatalities and trapping an unknown number of residents in collapsed buildings. The city of Bogo in Cebu province is among the hardest hit, with rescue efforts severely hampered by intermittent rain and damaged infrastructure, indicating a likely rise in the death toll. The shallow undersea quake, which briefly triggered a tsunami warning, struck a region already reeling from a recent tropical storm. This tragic event underscores the Philippines' extreme vulnerability to natural disasters, being situated on the Pacific "Ring of Fire."</p>

While AstraZeneca affirmed its commitment to its UK listing and headquarters, the trend underscores frustrations with the UK's drug-pricing regime and market regulations.

          <p>The US government shutdown directly impacts active-duty military personnel and deployed National Guard members, who are required to continue serving without immediate pay until a funding agreement is reached. Essential civilian employees within the Defense Department also face working without compensation, while other civilians are furloughed. Although legislation to ensure military pay during shutdowns was introduced, it did not pass in time. To mitigate the financial strain, major financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA are preparing to offer special loans to affected service members, continuing a tradition of support during such federal impasses.</p>

          <p>While private lenders are expected to continue processing conventional mortgages during the US government shutdown, applicants for government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, and USDA could encounter delays. The FHA and VA will largely continue guaranteeing loans, but furloughs may slow processing times, while the USDA will halt new direct and guaranteed home loans entirely. Additionally, securing federally required flood insurance via FEMA could be problematic, impacting homebuyers in flood zones and potentially delaying closings.

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing skilled blue-collar careers, such as electricians and plumbers, driven by the escalating costs of higher education and concerns about artificial intelligence displacing white-collar jobs. Surveys indicate that Gen Z prioritizes professions that are difficult to automate, viewing trades as more secure than fields like software development or accounting. This shift challenges the long-held societal emphasis on college degrees, as vocational paths offer independence, strong earning potential, and resilience against automation.

          <p>The current US government shutdown is the 15th instance of federal funding lapsing since 1980, a recurring political phenomenon driven by partisan budget disagreements. Historically, these shutdowns have varied in length, with the longest being 35 days in 2018-2019, which resulted in an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses. The article traces the evolution of shutdowns, noting that Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti's legal opinions in the early 1980s fundamentally altered government operations during funding gaps, mandating agency closures and widespread furloughs. This historical context underscores the deep-seated nature of these political impasses and their significant societal costs.</p>

          <p>A US government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass annual appropriations bills, forcing federal agencies to cease non-essential functions under the Antideficiency Act. While essential personnel, such as active military and air traffic controllers, continue working without pay, many other federal employees are furloughed, though they are legally guaranteed retroactive back pay. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare remain operational due to permanent funding, but related customer service functions may be impacted. This article highlights that the current shutdown could be unique, with the administration potentially implementing mass layoffs in discretionary programs, aiming to permanently reduce the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>During a US government shutdown, members of Congress and the President continue to draw their salaries, as their compensation is constitutionally protected and funded by permanent appropriations. This stands in stark contrast to hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who face delayed paychecks or potential permanent layoffs, even those deemed essential. While congressional staffers also experience delayed pay, most offices endeavor to keep nearly all staff working. This disparity in financial security during federal funding lapses often draws public criticism and highlights the unequal impact of political impasses on government personnel.</p>

          <p>The US federal government has shut down due to an intractable deadlock between Republicans and Democrats over federal funding, primarily triggered by Democrats' insistence on including health insurance subsidies in any spending bill. Republicans argued that healthcare issues should be negotiated separately, leading to the expiration of spending authority. This article elucidates the constitutional framework for government funding and the political dynamics that resulted in the impasse. The current situation is particularly notable for the administration's consideration of mass layoffs in discretionary programs, potentially making the effects more pronounced than previous shutdowns, which have historically cost billions.</p>
