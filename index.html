          <p>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora has raised concerns about the adoption of agentic artificial intelligence browsers within corporate environments. In an interview, Arora stated that without robust security controls focused on credentials and enterprise safety, these autonomous AI agents are unlikely to be permitted in businesses within the next two years. He acknowledged the consumer appeal of AI agents for tasks like booking travel but emphasized the significant security risks they pose to enterprises, where credential theft is a primary cause of data breaches. Arora's comments highlight the growing tension between rapid AI innovation and the stringent security requirements of the corporate world.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which delves into her raw and turbulent relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book portrays Mary Roy as a formidable and complex figure—a feminist icon, educator, and crusader who was also deeply mercurial. Instead of a hagiography, the memoir offers a candid account of a mother-daughter bond described as a tense but respectful dynamic between two powerful personalities. Roy reflects on how this challenging upbringing, while often bruising, ultimately shaped her into the writer she is today, making her mother her most enthralling subject.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race has intensified as Democrat Zohran Mamdani challenged President Trump to a debate, bypassing independent candidate Andrew Cuomo. This move came after Cuomo called for a series of debates with Mamdani and urged incumbent Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out, aiming for a two-person race. The campaigns for both Adams and Sliwa have firmly stated they will not exit the election. This complex political maneuvering occurs amid reports that the White House is exploring ways to encourage Adams and Sliwa to withdraw, setting the stage for a high-stakes showdown between the remaining candidates.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced a contentious Senate hearing, defending recent leadership changes at the CDC and his controversial views on vaccines. He denied claims by the ousted CDC director that she was fired for not rubber-stamping his vaccine policies, leading to heated exchanges with senators from both parties. Lawmakers pressed Kennedy for clarity on confusing new COVID-19 vaccine access rules, which have varied by state and pharmacy.

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was based on financial strategy and "mathematics." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the substantial draft picks received in the trade, combined with the salary cap space freed up, would allow the Cowboys to afford approximately five top-tier players for the cost of one. He emphasized that the move was not personal but a strategic opportunity to distribute talent and mitigate risks associated with player injuries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu, and the police commissioner over its sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit alleges that Boston is violating federal law by refusing to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement agencies. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the city's policies undermine law enforcement and protect undocumented immigrants from legal consequences. This legal action targets the Boston Trust Act, which limits the city's role in enforcing federal immigration laws, and is part of a broader federal effort to challenge sanctuary policies in cities across the country.</p>

The legislative defeat highlights Milei's weak position in Congress, where his party holds less than 15% of the seats.

This request follows lower court rulings that blocked President Trump's attempt to fire her, citing federal laws that protect commissioners at independent regulatory agencies from being dismissed without cause. The Justice Department argues that the modern FTC wields more substantial power than it did when a 1935 precedent was set, and therefore its members should serve at the president's will.

          <p>An 18-year-old woman was killed and seven other people were injured during a mass stabbing at the Hollow Water First Nation, a remote Indigenous community in Manitoba, Canada. The suspect, identified as the victim's 26-year-old brother, also died after crashing a stolen vehicle into an RCMP police car while fleeing the scene. The female officer involved in the collision was critically injured but is expected to recover. The motive for the attack is still under investigation, but police have stated that the victims were all known to each other, leaving the small community deeply shaken by the senseless violence.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy is ending his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of the Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. While the official announcement stated he "stepped down," reports suggest the decision was made by the club's ownership, who believe a change in leadership is needed to achieve greater success on the field. During his time, Levy oversaw the development of a new world-class stadium and training center, transforming the club into a financially profitable entity. However, he also faced persistent criticism from fans over a perceived lack of on-pitch success, with the club winning only two major trophies during his long reign.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a lower court's order to close the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The facility, built by the DeSantis administration to support federal deportation efforts, can now continue its operations while a legal challenge from environmental groups proceeds. A district judge had previously ordered the center to be wound down due to environmental concerns and harsh conditions for detainees. However, the appellate panel ruled 2-1 that the state and federal governments were likely to succeed in their appeal, stating that halting its operation was not in the public interest.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent Senate testimony suggests a significant shift from the more reassuring tone he adopted during his confirmation hearings. In a combative performance, the Health and Human Services Secretary aggressively defended anti-vaccine talking points and clashed with senators from both parties, causing alarm even among some Republicans who had supported his confirmation. This contrasts with his earlier promises not to limit vaccine access. The article suggests that Kennedy, enabled by President Trump, now feels emboldened to challenge the scientific consensus on vaccination, signaling a more confrontational and politically charged approach to his role.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order based on "true multilateralism" is resonating with developing nations, particularly in the Muslim world. As U.S. global primacy wanes, Beijing's vision offers an alternative to a system that many in the Global South feel has been shaped by narrow Western self-interest. This appeal is heightened by disillusionment with existing institutions like the IMF and World Bank. While China's proposal promises greater inclusivity, the article notes that states in the Middle East and beyond are cautiously recalibrating their alliances, weighing the opportunities against the potential risks.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have seen a steady, albeit slow, decline throughout 2025, offering a glimmer of hope for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped by more than half a percentage point since January, representing significant potential savings over the life of a loan. While rates are not as low as their record lows from a few years ago, the downward trend is encouraging. With the Federal Reserve expected to issue further rate cuts, there is potential for mortgage rates to fall even more, though the decline is likely to be gradual. (not investment advice)</p>
