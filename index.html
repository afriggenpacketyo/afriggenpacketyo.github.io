          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new $29 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, consisting of 96 million shares of restricted stock. This decision follows a Delaware court's ruling that revoked his previous $56 billion package from 2018, a case which Musk has appealed. Analysts suggest the new compensation plan is designed to secure Musk's leadership until at least 2030, providing stability as the company pivots towards becoming an AI-first enterprise. The grant is conditional; if the original 2018 package is reinstated by the courts, this new award will be forfeited.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council has stated it will not legally penalize a former legislative official, Hung Hsiu-chu, for attending a military parade in Beijing. While the council expressed deep regret, stating the action defied public expectations, it confirmed her previous role falls outside legislation restricting retired officials from attending such events. Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh emphasized that political parties must bear their own responsibility to society for such decisions.

          <p>Tesla is seeking shareholder approval for a new, large-scale compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, potentially valued at nearly $1 trillion if all milestones are met. The plan consists of 12 tranches of shares tied to ambitious market capitalization and operational goals, such as reaching an $8.5 trillion market cap and delivering 20 million vehicles. This proposal also aims to increase Musk's voting power, a demand he has publicly made. The move comes after a Delaware court rescinded his 2018 pay package, a case that is currently under appeal by Musk.</p>

The conversation occurred despite the fact that the landmark antitrust case was initially brought by the Department of Justice during Trump's first term.

          <p>This opinion article critiques the selective advocacy for free speech by Donald Trump and Nigel Farage, arguing they champion it for themselves while undermining it for others. The article highlights Trump's administration directing the Smithsonian to align exhibits with his historical views and his attacks on the press as contradictory to free speech principles. It also points to a local council run by Farage's Reform party in the UK banning councillors from speaking to local press, a move Farage was slow to address.

          <p>The once-strong relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appears to be deteriorating, signaling broader tensions between the two nations. The article suggests that punishing U.S. tariffs on Indian goods and Trump's diplomatic overtures to India's rival, Pakistan, have caused the rift. The dynamic shifted significantly after Trump claimed credit for brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, an assertion Modi disputes, which was followed by Pakistan nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. This breakdown in the personal rapport between the two populist leaders could impact strategic U.S.-India ties.</p>

The article argues that a constant hum of chatter from attendees uninterested in the matches detracts from the viewing experience by muffling the sounds of the game. This environment is attributed to the tournament's successful efforts to attract a wider audience through luxury offerings like celebrity sightings, expensive cocktails, and sponsored attractions. While this strategy has boosted the event's popularity, it has alienated some traditional tennis enthusiasts.</p>

The research, part of an Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament, showed that actual AI performance on several benchmarks surpassed the predictions of both groups, though experts were slightly closer. For example, an AI achieved a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad years ahead of schedule. The results suggest that predicting AI's trajectory is exceptionally difficult, with no single group proving reliably accurate, though aggregating all forecasts produced better results.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that 26 countries have formally committed to providing post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, which would include an international force on land, sea, and in the air. The announcement was made after a summit in Paris aimed at securing support for Kyiv's long-term security. Macron clarified that these 'reassurance force' troops would not be deployed on the frontline but would aim to prevent future aggression once the current conflict ends. This coalition of nations seeks to establish a robust framework to ensure Ukraine's stability and sovereignty after the war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expected to issue an executive order to rebrand the U.S. Department of Defense as the 'Department of War.' According to the White House, the order will designate the new name as a 'secondary title,' a method intended to bypass the need for congressional approval to formally rename a federal agency. The directive will instruct the executive branch to use the 'Department of War' name in all communications and allow top officials to use corresponding titles like 'Secretary of War.' President Trump has suggested that congressional approval is a mere formality for this symbolic change.</p>

          <p>A report from the Chinese Academy of Sciences suggests that China's dominance in gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor technology is creating a significant strategic advantage over the United States in military hardware. China's export controls on critical materials like gallium, framed as national security measures, are effectively acting as a 'silent sanction' on the U.S. defense industry. This has allowed China to deploy advanced phased array radar systems at a scale the U.S. cannot currently match. The report highlights how this technological lead is reshaping the global arms race and creating a generational gap in military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is adopting military tactics typically used against terrorist groups to combat Latin American drug cartels, exemplified by a recent deadly strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. This follows the designation of groups like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations and a directive authorizing the Pentagon to use military force against them. Administration officials have accused Venezuela's government of controlling the gang and have not ruled out the possibility of seeking regime change. This new, more aggressive approach marks a significant militarization of U.S. drug policy and its relationship with Latin America.</p>

          <p>Researchers now believe that solar flares, powerful eruptions from the sun's surface, can reach temperatures as high as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit, over six times hotter than previously estimated. A new report explains that past measurements focused on the temperature of electrons, assuming ions would be the same. However, recent simulations and calculations indicate that ions within the flares heat up to a much greater extent than electrons. This revised understanding could help scientists better predict the behavior of these dangerous eruptions, improving protection for satellites and astronauts in space.</p>

Stones has been a consistent starter for his club this season, and his absence will require Tuchel to consider other centre-back options like Marc Guehi and Dan Burn for the crucial matches.
