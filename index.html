          <p>A suicide bomber attacked a Greek Orthodox church in Dweil'a, Syria, killing at least 20 people and wounding 52. The attacker, identified by the Syrian Interior Ministry as an extremist from the Islamic State group, opened fire on worshippers before detonating an explosive vest. Witnesses described scenes of chaos and devastation, with some reporting that children were among the casualties. The attack, which is the first of its kind in Syria in years, has been condemned by the Syrian Information Minister, who called it a terrorist act that goes against civic values, with the state pledging to combat criminal organizations and protect society.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed caution regarding the recent U.S. attacks against Iran's nuclear facilities. Himes stated that it was too early to determine the success of the strikes, calling them a "massive gamble" by President Trump, while drawing parallels to past U.S. military actions in the Middle East. He highlighted the potential for unforeseen costs and consequences, referencing the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and voiced concern over the strikes being undertaken without congressional approval, emphasizing Congress's constitutional authority to declare war. Himes urged restraint in celebrating the attacks, emphasizing the need for a measured assessment of the situation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to intervene and prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for global oil supplies. Rubio emphasized China's dependence on the strait for its oil imports, highlighting the potential economic consequences of a closure. This appeal comes after Iran's foreign minister warned of potential actions to defend its sovereignty following U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites. Blocking the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt the flow of 20 million barrels of crude oil per day, potentially causing oil prices to surge, although the U.S. Fifth Fleet is stationed in Bahrain to protect maritime trade in the region (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is "not at war with Iran" but rather with its nuclear weapons program, as the Iranian regime considers a response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear installations. While President Trump claimed the targeted facilities were "completely and totally obliterated," Vance indicated that the U.S. has "substantially delayed" Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon. Satellite images and reports from Iranian officials suggest varying degrees of damage to the Fordo enrichment plant, and nuclear non-proliferation analysts are divided on whether the strikes will lead to negotiations or further uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley between England and India. Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a lead of 96 runs at the close of play. Earlier, Brook's innings, which included some audacious shots, helped England reach 465, narrowly trailing India's first innings score. The match is finely balanced, with both teams vying for an advantage as the Test progresses.</p>

          <p>Satellite images of Iranian nuclear facilities suggest that President Trump's claim of "totally obliterating" these sites may be inaccurate. New images of Natanz reveal a new crater, but lack conclusive evidence of breaching the underground facility, and images of Fordow show a support building remains undamaged. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors are still assessing the damage, and analysts suggest that military action may incentivize Iran to move its program underground. The IAEA is calling for a cessation of hostilities to address the situation, as the strikes have complicated the task of tracking uranium and ensuring Iran doesn't build a weapon.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from both parties have responded to President Trump's announcement that the U.S. launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities with mixed reactions. Republicans like Sens. Graham and Cruz generally supported the action, while Democrats like Rep. Jeffries criticized the lack of congressional consultation. Some lawmakers, such as Rep. Massie, argued the strikes were unconstitutional, while others, like Sen. Fetterman, fully supported the action. The strikes have further escalated the conflict between Iran and Israel, prompting debates over presidential war powers and the potential for broader conflict in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets largely closed higher on Sunday, demonstrating resilience following the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Tel Aviv stocks reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's involvement would help resolve the conflict with Tehran. While Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decline, Qatar and Bahrain saw gains, and Egypt's EGX30 showed significant growth. Analysts suggest the Gulf's diplomatic stance and calls for peaceful resolution have shielded it from major market impacts, with the removal of the Iranian threat potentially viewed positively by international investors (not investment advice).</p>

President Trump confirmed the attacks, emphasizing the destruction of facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, and the Pentagon detailed the operation involving B-2 Spirit bombers. While the attacks likely caused significant damage, some analysts believe enriched uranium may have been removed prior to the strikes, and the IAEA has warned of potential radiation leaks.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is navigating a delicate diplomatic situation following the US airstrikes in Iran, as the UK seeks to maintain a strong relationship with the US while avoiding direct military involvement. Despite Starmer's calls for de-escalation, the US proceeded with the strikes, and the UK was not asked to participate in the operation. The UK government has acknowledged being given advanced warning of the US action, but it remains unclear why the UK was not invited to join, potentially due to legal debates within the government. The situation could lead to further difficult decisions for the prime minister in the coming weeks.</p>

By explaining decisions, giving children agency, validating their emotions, and inviting problem-solving, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels more natural.
