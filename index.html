        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's surpassed Wall Street's earnings projections for the quarter, driven by increased demand for home improvement projects. The retailer announced the acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of interior building products, for $8.8 billion, aiming to attract more business from home professionals. Lowe's has revised its full-year outlook to reflect this acquisition and the earlier acquisition of Artisan Design Group, expecting total sales of $84.5 billion to $85.5 billion. CEO Marvin Ellison stated that these acquisitions will strengthen the company's solutions for growing professional customers, and the company saw solid performance in both do-it-yourself and professional segments of its business. This score reflects the positive financial news and strategic growth moves by the company.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin is moving up the Atlantic Ocean, posing a threat to the East Coast with life-threatening surf and rip currents. While the hurricane is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., North Carolina's Outer Banks are under tropical storm warnings and are warned of possible coastal flooding, leading to evacuation orders. The storm is projected to pass between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda, then south of Atlantic Canada, with dangerous conditions expected to last throughout the week. Coastal areas from South Florida to New England are taking precautions due to the risk of rip currents, and officials are urging people to heed local warnings. The storm is not projected to hit the U.S. directly. The optimism score is based on the fact that no casualties have been reported and the storm is not expected to hit the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Due to safety concerns, Maccabi Tel-Aviv and Dynamo Kiev are playing their Europa League qualifier in Serbia, as UEFA deems Israel and Ukraine unsafe for continental competition. Serbia's stable diplomatic relations with Israel, neutrality in conflicts, and adequate sporting infrastructure make it a suitable compromise location. Serbia's historical antipathy towards sporting sanctions, stemming from Yugoslavia's ban in the 1990s, also contributes to this arrangement. While UEFA President Alexander Ceferin acknowledges the legitimacy of questioning Israel's participation, he generally opposes banning athletes, reflecting a complex balance between politics and sports. The score reflects the complexities of international relations and the ongoing conflicts that impact sporting events.</p>

          <p>Despite exceeding Wall Street's expectations for sales and earnings, Target shares fell 10% after announcing the appointment of Michael Fiddelke as the new CEO, succeeding Brian Cornell. The company's sales and store traffic have declined, and the retailer reaffirmed its full-year forecast, expecting a low single-digit percentage decline in sales. Fiddelke outlined three priorities: reestablishing Target's reputation for stylish items, improving customer experience, and leveraging technology for efficiency. Digital sales showed positive growth, and the company is focusing on regaining ground in key merchandise categories like home goods, with the score reflecting the mixed performance and future strategic direction.</p>

          <p>KSDP, a public radio station in Sand Point, Alaska, faces potential closure due to rescinded federal funding for public broadcasting, impacting its ability to provide essential services to the remote Aleutian Islands. The station serves as a crucial community anchor, delivering local news, emergency alerts, and coverage of local events, especially in the absence of a local newspaper. KSDP relies heavily on federal funding, receiving 70% of its operating budget from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and cuts will disproportionately affect rural communities. The loss of funding threatens essential local journalism and community services in a region with limited alternatives.

          <p>UK inflation rose to 3.8% in July, primarily driven by increases in air fares and food prices, reaching the highest level since January 2024 and exceeding the Bank of England's 2% target.

          <p>President Trump's efforts to extend federal control over Washington, D.C., face legal challenges and questions about their duration. While the Home Rule Act allows temporary use of D.C. police for federal purposes, it requires congressional authorization for extensions beyond 30 days. The federal government's oversight of local police is being challenged in court, and questions remain about the timeline for withdrawing National Guard troops. The deployment of National Guard troops from other states raises concerns about their role and duration. The score reflects the legal and political challenges surrounding Trump's actions in D.C.</p>

          <p>TJX Cos., the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods, reported earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, raising its full-year guidance. The company expects to offset higher costs from tariffs, with customer transactions up at every division. TJX now anticipates full-year fiscal 2026 earnings will increase, and the retailer also raised its comparable sales expectations. Analysts suggest that off-price retailers like T.J. Maxx are better positioned to sidestep major tariff costs due to their purchasing of excess merchandise. The score reflects the company's strong financial performance and ability to navigate tariff pressures.</p>

          <p>Walmart has recalled frozen, raw shrimp sold in 13 states due to potential radioactive contamination. The US Food and Drug Administration requested the recall after detecting Cesium-137 in shipping containers and a sample of breaded shrimp imported from Indonesia. The products could pose a “potential health concern” for people exposed to low levels of Cesium-137 over time. The FDA is investigating reports of Cesium-137 contamination in shipping containers and products processed by BMS Foods of Indonesia. The score reflects concerns about food safety and potential health risks, but also Walmart's prompt response to the issue.</p>

          <p>Microplastics are increasingly being found in our bodies and food supply, raising concerns about their impact on human health. Petrochemicals, the building blocks of plastic, are produced from oil and gas, making the fossil fuel industry vulnerable to pushback on plastic use. Scientific research on microplastics has spiked, with studies finding microplastics in human brains and the muscle tissue of fish. Industry giants are investing heavily into chemical production as oil demand declines from electrification.
