          <p>Reddit is suing AI startup Anthropic for allegedly breaching their contract and engaging in unfair business practices. The lawsuit claims Anthropic trained its AI models using Reddit user data without consent, violating Reddit's user agreement. Reddit asserts that Anthropic disregarded its rules and commercialized user-generated content without providing anything in return to Reddit or its users, unlike companies such as OpenAI and Google, which have formal partnerships with Reddit. Reddit seeks damages for the unauthorized use of its platform and data. The social media company believes that other AI companies understand and respect Reddit's data usage rules, which is why it has partnerships with OpenAI and Google, the former of which has a CEO who used to be a major shareholder in Reddit. Optimism surrounding this article is based on the fact that legal boundaries are being set for the AI industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with Senate Finance Committee Republicans at the White House to garner support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a legislative package advancing his agenda. The Finance Committee is crucial as it handles the bill's tax policy aspects, including extending the 2017 tax cuts. The House-passed bill includes increased military and border security spending, alongside cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump aims to sway senators with concerns about the bill, as its passage in the Senate requires near-unanimous GOP support amidst criticism from figures like Elon Musk.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that President Trump's proposed tax bill would add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

The bill is expected to undergo further revisions in the Senate, where it is already facing resistance from deficit hawks. Republican senators, including Ron Johnson, and figures like Elon Musk have publicly criticized the bill, expressing concerns about its impact on the national debt.

The author criticizes the international press for readily accepting Hamas's claims and accuses the UN of complicity in perpetuating suffering in Gaza. The author advocates for a new model of humanitarian aid based on transparency, accountability, and realism, contrasting it with what they claim is the current system's failures and corruption.

          <p>This article discusses the potential for HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) interest rates to fluctuate following the Federal Reserve's June meeting. While a rate cut in June is deemed unlikely, comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell could influence HELOC rates. If Powell indicates imminent rate reductions, lenders might preemptively lower HELOC rates. The article also notes that home equity loan rates are currently slightly higher than HELOC rates, but offer the stability of a fixed interest rate. The article offers advice on how to keep home equity borrowing costs low, highlighting the importance of shopping for the best rates and terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50% has taken effect, potentially increasing costs for a wide range of consumer products. Experts predict that the tariffs could lead to higher prices for cars, sports equipment, canned goods, household appliances, and homes. While the move has been praised by some domestic steelmakers, economists warn that it will ultimately burden consumers and businesses. The article outlines the potential economic consequences of the increased tariffs. The tone of this article is neutral and does not express any sentiment.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to mandate that American medical schools include nutrition courses in their curriculum or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy believes that aspiring physicians should be taught how to prevent and treat illnesses with food, rather than solely relying on drugs.

This proposal follows similar actions from the Trump administration to withhold funding from institutions that do not align with its policies.
