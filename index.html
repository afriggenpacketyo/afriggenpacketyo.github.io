          <p>Gunmen attacked a mosque in Nigeria's Katsina state during morning prayers, resulting in the deaths of at least 13 people, with some reports suggesting a higher toll. Local authorities believe the assault was a retaliatory action after townspeople had previously ambushed and killed members of the armed group. These gangs, known locally as bandits, have long terrorized rural areas in northwestern and central Nigeria, engaging in raids, kidnappings for ransom, and looting. The violence, which originated from land and water disputes, has escalated into organized crime fueled by the limited presence of state institutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has significantly broadened its 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum to encompass more than 400 additional product categories, which took effect this week. The expanded list now includes a wide range of goods such as machinery, fire extinguishers, construction materials, and various components that contain or are made from these metals. The Commerce Department stated the move aims to close loopholes for circumvention and support the domestic steel and aluminum industries. Critics note the official list uses complex customs codes, making it difficult for the public to fully grasp the extensive impact on imports.</p>

Surveys indicate that shoppers are concerned about rising prices, leading them to seek deals and stretch their budgets further. Companies like TJX Companies, Costco, and Amazon, known for their pricing flexibility and value propositions, are expected to attract more customers. These retailers employ various strategies, such as negotiating with suppliers and leveraging private-label brands, to mitigate the impact of tariffs and protect their profit margins.

          <p>Stocks tied to the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn as investors shifted away from technology and other high-risk assets. Major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood saw their shares fall by over 5%, while firms in adjacent sectors, such as crypto treasury and financial services, also recorded substantial losses. The sell-off coincided with a drop in the prices of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. This market movement is often linked to trends in the broader tech sector, with investors now awaiting signals from the Federal Reserve's upcoming economic symposium for future policy direction.

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software company Palantir fell more than 9% on Tuesday, marking the fifth consecutive day of declines and a significant pullback from its recent all-time highs. The stock has lost over 15% of its value during this period, following a surge earlier in the month driven by a strong earnings report. Despite the recent slump, Palantir remains a top performer in the S&P 500 for 2025, having more than doubled in value due to AI enthusiasm and major government contracts. However, this rapid ascent has resulted in an exceptionally high forward price-to-earnings ratio compared to other major tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Chinese national residing illegally in the U.S. has been sentenced to eight years in federal prison for conspiring to smuggle weapons, ammunition, and sensitive technology to North Korea. Shenghua Wen pleaded guilty to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and acting as an illegal agent for a foreign government. According to the Department of Justice, Wen admitted to receiving approximately $2 million from North Korean officials to procure the contraband. He concealed the items in shipping containers falsely labeled as consumer goods and successfully exported at least two shipments from California.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has maintained a largely neutral and hands-off stance regarding the increasing number of federal immigration raids targeting day laborers who gather near its stores. Despite being at the center of the issue, the company has not publicly addressed the raids, stating only that it is not involved and must comply with federal regulations. Advocates for day laborers argue that the company has a moral obligation to defend these workers, who are both customers and service providers for the store's clientele. The raids have created a climate of fear, affecting not only the laborers but also some customers and employees.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a public university president's ban on drag shows violates the First Amendment, but the decision came more than two years after the initial lawsuit was filed. The case originated when the president of West Texas A&M University canceled a student group's planned drag event, a decision upheld by controversial federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk. While the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately reached the correct legal conclusion, its delay in resolving the case meant that students were unconstitutionally denied their free speech rights for a significant period, with many graduating before the issue was settled.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While annuities have gained popularity for providing stable, lifelong income, they come with significant drawbacks that potential investors should consider carefully. Common disadvantages include high fees, such as management and administrative costs, which can erode returns over time. Most annuities also feature long surrender periods with substantial penalties for early withdrawals, limiting financial flexibility for unexpected expenses. Furthermore, the complexity of annuity contracts can be difficult for consumers to navigate, and the fixed payments from some annuities may lose purchasing power over time due to inflation.

The Trump administration has already increased tariffs on India and threatened further secondary tariffs on Russia's trading partners. According to reports, Apple is boosting production at five factories in India in preparation for its new iPhone 17 models, continuing its strategy of diversifying its supply chain away from China. Apple's significant investments in U.S. manufacturing are expected to shield the company from potential India-related tariffs.</p>

The report found that 63% of the 238 cars evaluated surpassed the EU's benchmark, with many being large, German-manufactured luxury vehicles. The environmental group criticized the federal government for its slow transition to more sustainable transportation, noting that even many plug-in hybrid models in the fleet have high emissions. The study praised the Green party for having the cleanest fleet while singling out Bavaria's state premier for having the least efficient vehicle.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has announced the deployment of 4.5 million militia members across the country in response to what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. This move follows the Trump administration's increase of the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million on drug trafficking charges and the launch of U.S. anti-drug operations in the Caribbean. Maduro condemned the U.S. actions and called for the formation of additional peasant and worker militias to defend Venezuela's territory and sovereignty. The U.S. does not recognize Maduro's presidency and has imposed significant sanctions on his administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning that some lots of Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp sold at Walmart may be at risk of radioactive contamination. The shrimp, imported from an Indonesian company, could be contaminated with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. Although no products sold in the U.S. have tested positive yet, the warning was prompted by the detection of the isotope in a separate shipment from the same supplier that did not enter U.S. commerce. The FDA has advised consumers not to eat the specified lots and has recommended that Walmart issue a recall.</p>
