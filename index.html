          <p>Yoweri Museveni, 81, is preparing for another presidential campaign, extending his decades-long rule in Uganda. His tenure, which began in 1986, is marked by credited stability and economic growth, particularly in agriculture and oil prospects. However, critics point to democratic backsliding, human rights violations, and significant corruption, with concerns about electoral integrity and suppression of opposition figures like Bobi Wine. The upcoming election will test public sentiment regarding the nation's political future.</p>

          <p>Scientists are advancing phytomining, a process where hyperaccumulating plants, like yellow mustard, absorb high concentrations of metals such as nickel from the soil. This method, initially used for soil decontamination, is now on the verge of becoming a business model, particularly for nickel extraction crucial for EV batteries. Phytomining offers a climate-friendly alternative to conventional mining, capturing carbon and cleaning barren land, though it faces challenges in matching the scale and cost-efficiency of traditional operations. It holds significant potential for smaller communities to generate profit and environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's announcement of a $100 billion investment in OpenAI, aimed at building and deploying Nvidia AI systems requiring substantial GPU power, triggered a rally in global semiconductor stocks. Companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix saw significant share increases due to their ties to Nvidia's supply chain. While some European chip equipment firms experienced mixed results, analysts view the deal as a strong indicator of continued growth and investor confidence in the broader AI sector. This development underscores the expansive economic impact of major AI collaborations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen labeled the drone incident at Copenhagen Airport, which disrupted operations, as the "most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date." Multiple large drones were spotted, forcing a temporary shutdown and flight diversions. Police described the perpetrator as a "capable operator" demonstrating significant skill. The incident aligns with a recent trend of drone and hacking attacks on European airports, raising heightened security concerns in Northern Europe amidst increased Russian activity in NATO airspace.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed that its factory production will remain suspended until at least October 1st, following a cyber attack in late August that crippled its IT networks. The prolonged shutdown is costing JLR an estimated £50 million per week and is causing severe anxiety among its supply chain partners, particularly smaller businesses. Government ministers are meeting with JLR and suppliers to discuss support, as fears grow that some could face bankruptcy. The incident highlights the significant economic vulnerabilities posed by sophisticated cyber threats to large-scale manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle intensified into a Category 4 major hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm is currently tracking further into the Atlantic, east of Bermuda, and is not expected to make landfall. However, the National Hurricane Center warns that Gabrielle will generate life-threatening swells and rip current conditions along the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. This development occurs during what was predicted to be an unusually busy season, though activity has been quieter than anticipated until recently.</p>

          <p>With a potential US government shutdown eight days away, the Trump administration has not publicly shared its contingency plans for federal agency operations, a departure from past practice. This lack of transparency creates uncertainty for federal workers and local economies, as these plans typically detail which functions continue and which are furloughed. Democrats and policy experts are demanding the immediate release of these plans to ensure compliance with the Antideficiency Act and maintain critical national security functions. The situation underscores ongoing tensions over federal funding and the administration's approach to appropriations.</p>

          <p>Yu Faxin, a distinguished professor at Zhejiang University and a leading Chinese scientist developing chips for weapon systems, has been detained by an anti-graft watchdog. Yu, known for his expertise in microwave and millimeter-wave radio frequency technology and semiconductor materials, is the actual controller and chairman of Great Microwave Technology. While the company stated it would operate normally, the detention of such a high-profile figure in a sensitive technology sector underscores ongoing anti-corruption efforts and potential implications for China's strategic tech development.

          <p>England's National Health Service (NHS) is implementing "Jess's Rule," urging General Practitioners to "think again" if a patient presents with worsening or undiagnosed symptoms after three appointments. Named after Jessica Brady, who died from advanced cancer at 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed, the initiative aims to prevent avoidable deaths by promoting earlier referrals and second opinions. Health Secretary Wes Streeting calls her death a "preventable tragedy." The rule seeks to standardize best practice, especially for younger patients and those from ethnic minority backgrounds who often face diagnostic delays.</p>

          <p>Voters in Guinea have overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in a referendum, with over 90% in favor according to provisional results. This controversial outcome could allow military leader General Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in 2021, to run for president and extend presidential terms to seven years. The "yes" campaign dominated amidst a crackdown on the opposition, which largely boycotted the vote. The UN Human Rights Office expressed concerns about the referendum's inclusiveness and transparency, as Guinea joins other West African nations where military leaders have delayed civilian rule and strengthened ties with Russia.</p>
