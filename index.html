          <h2>Equality Watchdog Releases Interim Guidance on Single-Sex Spaces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-26 12:13:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has issued interim guidance clarifying how organizations should interpret the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' and 'sex' in the 2010 Equality Act as biological. The guidance addresses the use of single-sex spaces, stating that transgender women (biological men) can be excluded from women-only facilities like hospitals and restaurants, while also emphasizing the need to provide alternative facilities for trans individuals. In schools, the EHRC advises against allowing pupils who identify as trans girls to use girls' facilities and vice versa. A two-week consultation is planned to gather feedback before the EHRC submits an updated code of practice to the government by the end of June.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A special tribunal has been established to prosecute Russia's aggression in Ukraine, but its operational effectiveness is hindered by several factors. While the tribunal can investigate Russian leadership, including President Putin, he cannot be prosecuted while in office due to head of state immunity. The Council of Europe lacks the UN Security Council's power to waive immunity for high-ranking officials. Despite these limitations, investigations into Russian officials are underway, focusing on those responsible for planning and implementing the military aggression since 2014, and Ukrainian observers emphasize the importance of including events prior to the full-scale invasion.</p>

          <p>A large explosion at the Shahid Rajaee port, a key commercial hub in Iran, has resulted in multiple fatalities and hundreds of injuries. The explosion, suspected to be a chemical blast, occurred after a fire broke out in a storage area containing flammable materials, possibly solid fuel for ballistic missiles. The incident took place as Iranian and US officials were engaged in nuclear program talks in Oman, but Iranian officials state the explosion was unrelated to the country's oil industry. An investigation has been launched to determine the exact cause of the blast, which caused widespread damage to nearby buildings and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is urging Americans to dispose of their unused prescription medications properly, rather than flushing them down the toilet. Kennedy warns that flushing medications can introduce harmful substances into the water system, potentially affecting drinking water quality. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) provides free, anonymous drop-off sites for medication disposal, and emphasizes the importance of preventing medication misuse and opioid addiction. While some medications, like certain opioids, are considered safe to flush according to the FDA, others should be disposed of through designated take-back programs or other safe methods.</p>

          <p>Recent polls reveal a decline in Americans' faith in President Trump, including among some Republicans, across key issues. A majority of respondents described Trump's second term as 'scary,' with low ratings on his handling of the economy and immigration policies. Only a quarter of Americans believe Trump is focused on the right priorities, and his approval rating is historically low for a leader at this stage of a term. These negative reviews coincide with the upcoming 100-day mark of Trump's second term, marked by market volatility and increased deportations.</p>

Moffett also anticipates potential resistance and supply chain challenges in India. Furthermore, he predicts a negative impact on iPhone sales in China due to backlash over U.S. tariffs and competition from local brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies and actions in his second term appear to align with the interests of Russian President Vladimir Putin, from pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to potentially easing sanctions. Trump's vision for peace in Ukraine seemingly favors Russia, allowing them to retain seized regions while preventing Ukraine from joining NATO. Additionally, Trump's actions on other fronts, including strained relationships with traditional allies and changes within the U.S. government, also serve Moscow's objectives, whether intentional or not.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that a young man found buried in a presumed 'gladiator graveyard' in York, England, died from a lion bite. The findings provide direct evidence that Roman culture, including gladiatorial combat, extended far beyond the Colosseum. Analysis of the man's remains showed markings likely made by a lion, supporting the theory that the skeletons in the cemetery were gladiators, not soldiers or slaves. This discovery sheds light on the Roman Empire's wide-reaching influence across Britain.</p>

          <p>Geoffrey Hinton, known as the "Godfather of AI," expresses growing concerns about the rapid development of artificial intelligence, estimating a 10% to 20% risk that AI will eventually take control from humans. While acknowledging AI's potential benefits in education, medicine, and climate change solutions, Hinton criticizes major companies for prioritizing profits over safety. He suggests AI companies should allocate significantly more resources to safety research and is particularly disappointed with Google for reversing its stance on military AI applications. Hinton stresses that people haven't fully grasped the implications of what's coming.</p>
