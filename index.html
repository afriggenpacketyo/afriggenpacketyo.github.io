          <p>Rachael De Foe, a 31-year-old from Singapore, successfully transitioned from a traditional nine-to-five public relations job to a "fractional" work model, more than tripling her annual income to approximately $220,000. After experiencing burnout in agency life, she founded her own company, Redefy, and now serves as the part-time head of communications for multiple businesses simultaneously. This arrangement provides her greater autonomy and fulfillment, allowing her to escape the high-pressure cycle of constantly needing to scale her team and client base.</p>

          <p>Recent observations of China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) suggest it is being prepared for significant roles in modern warfare, including potential deployment from naval vessels. The drone was seen with folding hinges on its wings, a key feature for aircraft carrier or amphibious assault ship operations. This development, combined with imagery of the drone's profile on the emblem of a new "drone carrier," indicates the GJ-11 could become the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone, enhancing the People's Liberation Army's capabilities.</p>

The stability in China's rates, which was widely expected, comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve recently lowered its own rates, with investors now weighing the differing monetary policies of the world's two largest economies.

The foundation is built early through modeling behaviors like talking openly about emotions, showing empathy in daily life, and validating a child's feelings. Other key practices include treating mistakes as learning opportunities, allowing children space to resolve their own conflicts, and listening more than lecturing, all of which foster emotional safety and authentic connection.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the illness. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice with a heritable immunity to the Lyme bacteria, which would break the infection cycle when ticks feed on them. Led by an MIT geneticist, the team is working closely with the community on Nantucket, an island with a high incidence of the disease, to ensure public buy-in before any potential release of the engineered animals.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by prioritizing open debate and the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded in response to what its creators see as a culture of self-censorship and a lack of intellectual diversity on other campuses, UATX offers a curriculum based in Western civilization and free tuition for its initial cohorts. The startup university aims to foster an environment where differing views are welcomed, not just tolerated, to combat political polarization in academia.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their final regular-season home game 3-1 to the San Francisco Giants after a late-inning bullpen collapse. Starting pitcher Emmet Sheehan delivered an excellent performance, holding the Giants to just one hit over seven scoreless innings while striking out ten. However, reliever Blake Treinen gave up three runs in the eighth inning, spoiling the effort and preventing the Dodgers from lowering their magic number to clinch the division title in front of a record-setting home crowd that pushed season attendance over four million.</p>

          <p>Sir Nick Clegg, the former UK Deputy Prime Minister, has described the relationship between Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump as "getting a bit embarrassing." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg called the "endless knee-bending" to the unpredictable U.S. president "slightly cringey" and urged the prime minister to "speak up" for British values. He argued that the UK government's attempts to court Trump, particularly on trade, stem from a miscalculation that Britain does not have to choose between the U.S. and the EU.</p>
