            <p>The Trump administration confirmed that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador, is being held in a Salvadoran prison. Despite a U.S. Supreme Court order to facilitate his return, the State Department's filing did not detail the steps being taken to bring him back to the United States. Abrego Garcia was deported after being accused of MS-13 ties, which his lawyers deny, and is currently confined in the CECOT mega-prison. The case has become a focal point in the immigration debate, highlighting the administration's policies and the complexities of international legal obligations.</p>

            <p>Harvard professors are suing the Trump administration over its review of federal funding for the university following pro-Palestine protests, alleging it is discriminatory and undermines free speech.

            <p>A group of former OpenAI employees has filed a brief supporting Elon Musk's lawsuit against the company, expressing concerns about its transition to a for-profit entity. The ex-staffers argue that converting to a for-profit company would violate OpenAI's original mission and breach the trust of stakeholders. OpenAI is facing hurdles in its restructuring efforts, largely due to Musk's opposition. The company has defended its hybrid structure, emphasizing that its nonprofit mission remains unchanged.</p>

            <p>President Trump's fluctuating tariff policies have created uncertainty among consumers, leading to both panic buying and paralysis. Some consumers are stocking up on goods in anticipation of price increases, while others are unsure how to respond. The tariffs, including those on imports from China, are expected to raise prices on items such as clothing, electronics, and toys. Economists predict that the tariff turmoil could lead to a weaker economy and higher unemployment.</p>

            <p>According to his former White House chef, Andre Rush, President Donald Trump had specific and unchanging eating habits that made him the most difficult president to cook for. Rush said Trump preferred burgers, fast food, and well-done steak, and consumed a lot of Diet Coke. He also stated that the president was averse to trying new foods, making it challenging to serve him nutrient-dense meals. Rush often had to "manipulate" Trump's favorite dishes to include healthier options. </p>
