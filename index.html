          <h2>Trump Floats 80% Tariff on China Amid Trade Discussions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 07:50:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump suggested an 80% tariff on Chinese goods via social media ahead of trade talks in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to meet with Chinese counterparts, but the proposed tariff marks a substantial decrease from the existing 145% tariff on numerous Chinese products. Despite the reduction, it remains significantly higher than the 10% baseline in the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement. China remains a critical challenge in Trump's efforts to reshape the global trading landscape, as tensions have led to tariffs exceeding 100% on goods from both countries.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is under scrutiny for its decision to withhold bonus payments from laid-off employees. These bonuses were earned based on the employees' high performance in the previous year, prior to their termination. The department had initially delayed the bonus payments, and now plans to only distribute them to active employees as of June 2 or later, effectively excluding those who were laid off or took buyouts. This decision has sparked outrage, with some employees expressing their disappointment and frustration, especially since most laid-off workers are still on paid leave until their official separation date. HHS claims that it is honoring all awards that it is obligated to pay, including to separated employees, and that 'Everyone will get the deal they made with the Trump Administration.</p>

          <p>A mother's public outcry for justice after her 7-year-old daughter was allegedly sexually assaulted has ignited a nationwide movement in South Africa, challenging the culture of shame and silence surrounding sexual violence. Thandekile Mtshizana's videos describing her daughter's account of the incident at Bergview College went viral, drawing millions of views and prompting protests in the town of Matatiele. While police investigation results were inconclusive, the case has highlighted the alarming statistics of sexual assault in South Africa, where an average of 118 sexual assaults are reported daily. Activists are calling for systemic change and urging the government to declare sexual violence a national disaster to allocate resources and improve collaboration between agencies.</p>

          <p>Two individuals were arrested in Worcester, Massachusetts, after a large crowd attempted to prevent ICE agents from taking a woman into custody. The incident occurred on Eureka Street, where approximately 25 people surrounded the agents' vehicle.

A girl holding a baby allegedly stood in front of the car and later kicked it, leading to her arrest on multiple charges including child endangerment. Another woman was arrested for allegedly pushing officers and throwing liquid on them. The mayor expressed his dismay over the separation of a family and noted that the city was not notified by ICE about the detainment.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress and the White House are preparing a budget that includes tax cuts and increased military spending, leading to significant increases in the national debt. The proposed budget aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security payments, which would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. To offset these cuts, Republicans are targeting smaller discretionary programs like education, health, and housing, and are relying on savings from eliminating waste and defunding the "woke, Marxist agenda." The austerity measures are sparking concern among some Republicans, as the budget is expected to negatively impact crucial long-term investments in energy, scientific research, and medical advances.</p>

          <p>Large institutional investors have significantly increased their holdings of Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), with some enlarging their positions by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to SEC filings. These investments have sparked questions about whether big businesses are seeking to curry favor with Donald Trump. Charles Schwab Investment Management, founded by a Trump associate, was among those increasing their stake. Critics argue that the investments do not align with the company's financial performance, which reported losses of over $400 million in 2024. Foreign billionaires with Trumpist sympathies have also invested in the stock.</p>

          <p>Organized criminal groups are increasingly targeting the U.S. supply chain, leading to a surge in cargo theft. These groups are exploiting technology to steal truckloads of valuable products, with incidents ranging from hitting trucks on the road to breaking into warehouses. Strategic theft, a more sophisticated form, involves deceiving shippers, brokers, or carriers to divert cargo or payments. Experts estimate losses to be close to $1 billion or more a year. Companies are responding by investing in technology and specialized personnel to combat the issue. Some retailers are also strategically placing inventory to mitigate the impact of potential thefts.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has cautioned against pleasure flights near the uninhabited Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. This warning follows a recent airspace intrusion by a Chinese helicopter in the same vicinity.

The government has conveyed to the operator of the small aircraft that it should ensure safety and avoid unexpected consequences.

          <p>The recent market fluctuations following President Trump's trade announcements underscore the futility of trying to time the stock market. The S&P 500 experienced a post-election rally, a subsequent decline due to tariff concerns, and a partial recovery after Trump eased some levies. This volatility highlights the difficulty of accurately predicting market movements based on political events. While some investors attempted to hedge against tariff risks or buy during market dips, the overall lesson is that long-term investment strategies are more reliable than trying to time short-term market swings.</p>

Pessimism about the next two years is prevalent, with 64% expecting increased competition and 58% expressing concerns about future profitability.

          <p>The Israeli government has announced plans to expand its military operations in Gaza, despite 19 months of ongoing conflict. This decision involves taking and retaining a significant portion of the Gaza Strip, calling up tens of thousands of reservists, and potentially endangering the lives of remaining Israeli hostages. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that the goal is to achieve "full, absolute victory" over Hamas, but critics argue that this escalation will lead to deeper darkness, both militarily and morally.

Trump stated that the U.S. calls for an unconditional 30-day cease-fire and that further sanctions would be imposed if the cease-fire is not respected.

The primary barrier remains the lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power, according to the industry.

If Trump’s attacks on the Fed continue, it might only deepen the struggle of Americans who were already grappling with an affordability crisis. Attacks on central bank independence, on the other hand, can lead to what former Fed chair Ben Bernanke described in a 2010 speech as “undesirable boom-bust cycles that ultimately lead to both a less stable economy and higher inflation.</p>
