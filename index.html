          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility resulted in the deaths of three deputies, marking the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. The deputies, identified as veteran members of the Arson Explosives Detail, were reportedly attempting to render safe a grenade that had been recovered the previous day. Sheriff Robert Luna stated that the investigation is ongoing, with federal agencies like the ATF and FBI assisting local law enforcement. The incident has prompted an outpouring of condolences from local and state officials, who have assured the public there is no ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>Jemima Goldsmith, ex-wife of former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, has accused the government of preventing their sons from visiting their incarcerated father. This follows a warning from a government adviser that the sons would be "dealt with accordingly" if they break the law by participating in planned nationwide protests for Khan's release. Khan's PTI party is organizing the rallies, asserting his sons simply wish to advocate for their father's freedom and have no political ambitions. However, some political analysts in Pakistan are skeptical about the impact the sons could have, suggesting their involvement might be symbolic.</p>

          <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has summoned major e-commerce companies, including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com, over concerns about an escalating delivery price war. The regulator urged the firms to engage in rational competition and foster a healthier market ecosystem for all stakeholders, from consumers to delivery riders. The meeting emphasized adherence to e-commerce and anti-unfair competition laws. In a separate session, the SAMR also addressed food safety issues within the live-streaming e-commerce sector, noting problems with excessive additives and pesticide residues in some products sold online.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced visa revocations for Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, citing a "political witch hunt" against former President Jair Bolsonaro. The action follows court orders placing Bolsonaro under electronic monitoring and restricting his movement over allegations he plotted to overturn the 2023 election. The move escalates tensions, as President Trump had previously threatened Brazil with a 50% tariff to pressure officials into dropping the case. Bolsonaro has denied any wrongdoing, calling the judge a "dictator" and the court orders an act of "cowardice."</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced plans to deploy a new force to halt deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities in the southern Suweida province, which has reportedly killed nearly 600 people. The move comes amid accusations that government troops previously sent to the area committed extrajudicial killings of Druze civilians. Following an Israeli military strike in Syria, the U.S. ambassador to Turkey announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Syria, though neither country has publicly confirmed it. The UN has called for an end to the bloodshed, citing credible reports of widespread human rights violations by multiple armed groups.</p>

          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe demographic crisis as its national birth rate has fallen for 16 consecutive years, reaching a record low of 1.18 babies per woman. Small towns like Fregona in northern Italy are experiencing sharp population declines, leading to the closure of local businesses and schools. Despite government initiatives like a "Baby Bonus" and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient due to the high cost of living and a lack of affordable childcare. Some private companies have created their own solutions, such as subsidized creches, but experts argue that massive systemic changes are necessary to address the long-term economic strain.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in a 2-0 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, signaling progress after a season plagued by injuries and inconsistency. Glasnow pitched six innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, showcasing increased fastball velocity and effective use of his curveball and sinker. Despite his solid outing, the Dodgers' offense was shut out by Brewers' pitcher Quinn Priester. The team remains hopeful that Glasnow, a key $136.5 million acquisition, can maintain this form and provide much-needed stability to the starting rotation for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>A new study from China indicates that chemotherapy, while effective at treating primary tumors, may inadvertently awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially speeding up the spread of cancer to other organs. The research offers a possible explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience metastasis in areas like the lungs even after successful initial treatment. The scientific team also discovered that combining chemotherapy with specific drugs could inhibit this process in mice. Based on these promising findings, a clinical trial involving breast cancer patients is now underway to test this new therapeutic approach.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have proposed a new "X-railgun" design that could significantly increase the power of electromagnetic weapons. The concept involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single unit, which could nearly double the firing force compared to the navy's existing model. This innovation aims to overcome a key limitation of current railgun technology, where excessive electrical current limits projectile weight. The new design could potentially fire a 30kg shell at Mach 7, making it a much more formidable weapon for military applications than what is currently possible.</p>

          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian daredevil famous for his record-breaking 2012 parachute jump from the stratosphere, has died at the age of 56 in a paragliding accident. The incident occurred in Porto Sant'Elpidio, Italy, where he was on vacation; witnesses saw his paraglider spin out of control before crashing. Baumgartner became a global icon when he ascended 24 miles in a capsule and jumped, becoming the first human to break the sound barrier in freefall. Throughout his career, sponsored by Red Bull, he was also an accomplished BASE jumper and helicopter pilot, known for pushing the limits of extreme flight.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current ceasefire proposal reportedly includes the return of these ten hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as the director of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency visited Washington to discuss potential plans for relocating Palestinians from Gaza to other countries as part of a broader regional strategy.</p>

During his service, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a carousel in a peaceful mountain meadow to cope with the trauma of combat. After struggling with PTSD for years, he began building the "Carousel of Happiness" in 1986, hand-carving its animals over 26 years. Now a nonprofit, the carousel has brought joy to over a million visitors and has become a source of profound healing for Harrison himself.</p>

The bipartisan bill, which creates consumer protections and allows banks and credit unions to issue their own dollar-backed digital currencies, is being hailed by the administration as a revolutionary step for financial technology. At the White House signing ceremony, attended by crypto industry leaders, Trump praised the legislation for strengthening the U.S. dollar and bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.

The warning comes as the market for digital currencies surges, fueled in part by the Trump administration's supportive stance.

This unprecedented public accusation from a serving officer has shaken the government but earned Mkhwanazi widespread public support, with many seeing him as a rare, incorruptible figure fighting against deep-seated crime.

The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if the visitor complies with all visa conditions, such as not working illegally and not overstaying.

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his White House physician. The doctor described the condition as "benign and common" in people over 70 and confirmed that tests showed no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, have difficulty sending blood back to the heart, causing it to pool. While it can cause aching and swelling, it is often managed with lifestyle changes, and the physician declared the president to be in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>A Nashville judge has ordered Tennessee prison officials to deactivate an inmate's implanted heart device just before his scheduled lethal injection. The ruling addresses concerns from attorneys for death-row inmate Byron Black, who argued his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) could repeatedly shock him during the execution, causing extreme pain. The order requires a certified technician to be on hand to disable the device moments before the execution drug is administered. The state had argued the device was unlikely to be triggered and that the judge lacked authority, making an appeal of the ruling almost certain.</p>
