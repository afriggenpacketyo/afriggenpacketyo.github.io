          <p>Data obtained from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) indicates that the Trump administration's deportation efforts have primarily targeted undocumented immigrants without violent criminal records. Of the convicted criminals deported, less than 1% had homicide convictions, with most infractions being for traffic or immigration offenses. This contrasts with the administration's public messaging, which has focused on removing the "worst of the worst" offenders and those with ties to criminal organizations.</p>

She was a lead prosecutor in several high-profile cases, including those against Sean "Diddy" Combs and Ghislaine Maxwell. Sources indicate she was dismissed pursuant to the president's powers under the Constitution, raising concerns about political motivations given her father's contentious history with President Trump.</p>

          <p>Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard has withdrawn its $47 billion takeover bid for Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings, causing a halt in the company's stock trading. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Analysts suggest that the deal's failure was likely influenced by Japanese protectionism and the perception of Seven & i as a company vital to national security.</p>

          <p>Japanese exports fell in June, marking the second consecutive monthly decline and missing economists' expectations, largely due to decreased shipments to the U.S. and China. The downturn is exacerbated by the prospect of a 25% U.S. "reciprocal tariff" set to take effect in August, with no trade deal in sight. These factors, particularly the slump in auto exports, increase the risk of Japan's export-reliant economy entering a technical recession. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The southern African kingdom of Lesotho has declared a two-year state of disaster. This drastic measure was taken in response to threats from the United States to impose some of the highest tariffs in the world on the nation. The potential economic fallout of these tariffs is viewed as a catastrophic threat to the small, mountainous country's stability and overall economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Coca-Cola agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its drinks sold in the United States, a move he personally advocated for. While the company has not explicitly confirmed the change, it acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and hinted at new offerings. The potential switch has been praised by some health advocates but criticized by the corn industry, which warns of job losses and increased sugar imports.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in Britain has now reached £1,076 per child, according to new figures from the charity Coram. Prices have risen due to high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run options, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% since last year. The rising expense places a significant financial burden on working families who rely on this care during the school break.</p>

          <p>Thousands of UK leaseholders are planning a class-action lawsuit against the freeholders of their apartment blocks, alleging they were charged inflated service fees due to secret commissions. The legal action claims that freeholders received undisclosed payments from insurance companies for arranging building policies, which were then passed on to flat owners. Lawyers believe each owner could be entitled to up to £2,000 in compensation for these allegedly unlawful charges.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market disruption and economic instability if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Such a move would likely trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields, creating a "mess" for the economy. The legality of firing a Fed chair is also highly questionable, with experts predicting the issue would ultimately be decided by the courts, leading to prolonged uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Times opinion column strongly opposes the nomination of Emil Bove, a former personal lawyer to Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a federal appeals court. The article argues Bove is disqualified due to his record of alleged power abuse, disregard for the law, and fealty to the president over the Constitution. Citing a whistleblower's claims and his role in purging Justice Department staff, the column urges the Senate to reject the nomination to protect judicial integrity.</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic explores how President Trump's recent reversal on releasing the "Epstein files" is causing a rift with his most ardent supporters. Having built his political identity on being an outsider who tells truths others won't, his current insistence that the Epstein story is a "hoax" creates a direct conflict with his base's expectations. The article argues this issue, unlike policy shifts, cuts to the core of his anti-establishment appeal and reveals the challenge of governing while running against the government.</p>
