            <p>President Trump's administration is currently managing several key issues, including immigration, international relations, and trade. The Supreme Court has allowed the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members to proceed under the Alien Enemies Act, provided due process is followed. Trump also revealed ongoing direct talks with Iran during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, hinting at potential high-level discussions. Additionally, the administration is grappling with the economic fallout from tariffs imposed on numerous trading partners, which have caused significant market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has announced a 90-day pause on new tariffs, with a few exceptions, following investor panic, bond market instability, and Republican criticism. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that over 75 countries have contacted the U.S. to negotiate trade solutions, suggesting the pause is a strategic move. While Trump aides claim this was the plan all along, the decision followed days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced. The administration aims to use this pause to engage in negotiations with individual countries to address trade barriers and currency manipulation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has postponed a House vote on President Trump's tax agenda due to a potential Republican rebellion over the Senate's version of the plan. Fiscal conservatives are concerned that the Senate's proposal includes significantly fewer spending cuts than the House's original version. Trump has urged Republicans to consolidate efforts into "one big, beautiful bill" encompassing border security, defense, energy, and taxes. The delay highlights divisions within the Republican party regarding fiscal policy and the approach to Trump's agenda, as the tax cuts are set to expire at the end of the year.

            <p>Milwaukee is home to Ascent, the world's tallest timber-concrete hybrid building, showcasing the potential of mass timber as a sustainable construction material. Developers highlight that building costs are comparable to traditional structures, while offering advantages such as a lighter carbon footprint and faster construction times. Mass timber is pre-fabricated, strong, and cheaper to produce than steel and concrete, making it an environmentally friendly alternative. The Ascent's design also underwent rigorous fire resistance testing to ensure safety, paving the way for future mass timber projects across the country.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. lauded the U.S. measles response as a model for the world, citing lower case numbers compared to Europe, despite a current outbreak in Texas. Experts caution against directly comparing the U.S. to the entire WHO European region due to disparities in healthcare access and vaccination coverage. While the U.S. has over 600 cases this year, primarily linked to the Texas outbreak, some experts believe the actual case count may be higher than reported. Low vaccination rates and varying healthcare systems contribute to the differences in measles outbreaks between the U.S. and European countries.</p>

The pause was implemented to allow countries to negotiate trade solutions with the U.S., and Trump indicated that he made the decision after observing market reactions. (not investment advice)</p>

A survey indicates that the majority of schools already restrict phone use during the school day. Dame Rachel emphasized that children are accumulating significant screen time at home, and parents require more support in managing their children's online habits. She supports head teachers who choose to ban phones but believes it should be their decision based on their understanding of what's best for their students.</p>

The irony is evident as even the pen used to sign the tariff orders may have been made in China, highlighting the U.S.'s reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The tariffs primarily affect American consumers, who face higher prices for essential items, while China maintains its dominance in sectors like stationery and religious books. This dependence underscores the challenges in decoupling the U.S. economy from Chinese manufacturing.</p>

            <p>President Trump paused his global trade war after facing pressure from anxious Republicans and a volatile bond market. Despite initial claims that the tariffs were part of a grand plan, Trump admitted that he was responding to concerns about the economy. The decision was framed by aides as a strategic move to isolate China, but it followed days of market turmoil and criticism. The reversal highlights the influence of economic realities and Republican opposition on Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Taylor, who wrote anonymously about his experience in the Trump administration, is accused of leaking classified information.

These actions are seen as an escalation of Trump's efforts to target his critics and could have implications for civil liberties. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer shared four lessons learned from the recent market volatility surrounding President Trump's tariffs. These lessons include avoiding panic selling, recognizing the risks of greed, understanding Trump's affinity for drama, and avoiding betting against strong companies. Cramer emphasized that investors should stay the course, as market gains often come from a few key days each year. He also noted that while investors can't expect stability under Trump, they should assume he will adjust policies if they harm the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts contend that the shift from manufacturing to financial and tech sectors has benefited American consumers. Uncertainty and instability surrounding the tariffs may discourage firms from investing in US factories, while higher labor costs could make products more expensive for consumers.
