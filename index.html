        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected another attempt by Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated men formerly known as the Central Park Five dismissed. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which Trump's legal team invoked, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit stems from statements Trump made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he allegedly falsely claimed the men had killed someone and confessed to the crime. The five men were wrongfully convicted for a 1989 sexual assault and have since been exonerated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is permanently discontinuing the data feed from its Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), a critical tool for hurricane forecasting. Meteorologists warn this loss is significant because the SSMIS uses microwaves to see through clouds and analyze a storm's internal structure, which is not possible with standard infrared satellites, especially overnight. The decision has sparked alarm among weather experts, who fear it could degrade forecast accuracy and public safety during hurricane season by potentially missing rapid storm intensifications. The U.S. Space Force states the satellites are functional but the data processing, handled by the Navy, is being changed.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of a major spending and tax package, a key legislative priority for President Trump's second term. The bill aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase border security and defense spending, and is offset by cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Key changes from the House version include different timelines for Medicaid provider tax reductions, a higher state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, and a larger increase to the debt ceiling. The Senate parliamentarian has also influenced the bill's contents, striking down some provisions to ensure compliance with the reconciliation process. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that reforming the country's "broken" benefits system is a moral necessity, following a U-turn on welfare cuts forced by a backbench Labour revolt. Speaking at a party conference, Starmer asserted that while the safety net for vulnerable people will be protected, the system should not trap those who are able to work. The government has already conceded on some of its stricter proposals for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and will now raise the health-related component of Universal Credit with inflation for existing recipients. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs are still pushing for more changes.</p>

Molineaux structured his weeks to include 13 runs, sometimes completing multiple half-marathons in one day.

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a Maryland couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on the 10th anniversary of its nationwide legalization. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, their advocacy helped pave the way for Maryland to legalize marriage equality in 2012, two years before the Supreme Court's landmark decision. The couple, now married for over a decade, expressed joy in the progress made but also voiced concern over recent efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights.

The students designed the printer with open hardware, allowing BISM's blind and low-vision employees to operate it easily.

          <p>The Senate's version of President Trump's major tax and spending bill contains significant changes that stand to benefit various groups, from taxpayers to specific industries. The legislation codifies several of Trump's priorities, including permanent extensions of his 2017 tax cuts and new temporary breaks for tip and overtime income, which analyses suggest skew toward upper-income families. A controversial "revenge tax" provision targeting foreign investment was scrapped, a relief to Wall Street. The bill also raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, a key issue for lawmakers in high-tax states. (not investment advice)</p>

While lacking a single blockbuster ruling like in previous years, the court delivered significant 6-3 victories for Republican states on issues like transgender medical treatments and Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. The court also reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the Trump administration.

          <p>Researchers studying skeletons from the ancient city of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey have found evidence suggesting it may have been a matriarchal society over 9,000 years ago. By analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons buried under homes, scientists discovered that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring remained connected to their maternal homes. The findings, which also noted more grave goods were buried with females, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>The financial future of Social Security has grown more precarious, according to the latest Trustees Report, which now projects a 23% benefit cut in 2033 if Congress does not intervene. This is a steeper reduction than the 21% cut forecast last year, signaling an accelerating deficit for the program's trust fund. Factors contributing to the worsening outlook include growing income inequality, slower growth in the working population, and the recent passage of the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for some retirees.

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. She sustained minor lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. While the woman did not see what bit her, experts who analyzed photos of the wounds believe they are consistent with a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, and officials will maintain enhanced patrols to monitor the waters for the remainder of the summer.</p>

          <p>Rafael Mariano Grossi, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has described the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities from recent U.S. strikes as "very serious." In an interview, Grossi confirmed that key sites for uranium enrichment and treatment were hit to an "important degree," but noted that some capabilities remain. He stressed the urgent need for diplomacy and for IAEA inspectors to regain access to ascertain what nuclear material and equipment remains, as it is unclear what may have been moved or destroyed. Grossi emphasized that a long-lasting solution can only be diplomatic, not military.</p>

Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump expressed hope for a ceasefire agreement in the coming week, and Qatari mediators are intensifying efforts following a recent truce between Israel and Iran.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, conflicting descriptions from the Trump administration have created uncertainty about the extent of the damage. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary initially claimed the sites were "obliterated," subsequent intelligence reports and comments from other officials presented a more nuanced picture. A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggested the setback to Iran's program might only be a few months. As the week progressed, officials appeared to shift focus from facility destruction to the achievement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel as the primary goal of the mission.</p>

Despite the risk of heavy fines and potential prison sentences for organizers, marchers filled the city center, supported by the Budapest mayor and numerous European officials.

          <p>Jurgen Klopp, former Liverpool manager and current head of global soccer for Red Bull, has strongly criticized the expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, calling it "the worst idea ever implemented in football." Citing "serious fears" over player welfare, Klopp argued that the congested fixture calendar, which includes multiple major international tournaments in consecutive years, does not allow for adequate physical or mental recovery for players. His comments echo concerns from the global players' union Fifpro and several active players who have warned about the unsustainable workload and increased risk of injury.</p>

          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Bangkok to demand the resignation of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra due to her handling of an escalating border dispute with Cambodia. The demonstrations, organized by a nationalist group, followed a recent border skirmish and the leak of a phone call between Shinawatra and Cambodia's former prime minister. In the call, Shinawatra was accused of being overly deferential. The long-standing dispute centers on the historic Preah Vihear temple, which an international court ruled belongs to Cambodia, a decision that remains a sensitive issue in Thailand.</p>
