          <p>A Yosemite National Park ranger and wildlife biologist, Shannon "SJ" Joslin, reports being fired after hanging a transgender pride flag from El Capitan. Joslin states the act was done off-duty as a private citizen to celebrate their identity and that the flag was only displayed for two hours. The National Park Service cited a failure "to demonstrate acceptable conduct" and is pursuing administrative action, referencing updated park regulations that require permits for banners in wilderness areas. Joslin contends the termination violates their First Amendment rights and is seeking to have their career reinstated.</p>

Over 2,000 troops from states including Ohio, West Virginia, and Tennessee are expected to join the effort, which was initiated after President Trump announced the activation of the D.C. National Guard and a plan to federalize the local police. The White House stated the troops will protect federal assets and deter crime, though the move has been legally challenged by Washington officials.</p>

          <p>Disturbing new details have emerged in the search for Travis Decker, a father accused of murdering his three young daughters in Washington. DNA analysis confirmed Decker's genetic material was found on the plastic bags and cable ties used in the killings, solidifying his role as the sole suspect. The children, aged 5, 8, and 9, were found deceased in early June, with the cause of death determined to be suffocation. A $20,000 reward remains for information leading to the arrest of Decker, who is considered armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>Boxer Julio César Chávez Jr., son of the legendary Mexican fighter, has been deported from the United States and is now in Mexican custody. His deportation follows a U.S. immigration arrest for making fraudulent statements on his permanent residency application. In Mexico, the 39-year-old athlete faces serious charges, including organized crime affiliation and arms trafficking, adding to a career already troubled by substance abuse and legal issues. U.S. authorities had previously labeled him an affiliate of the Sinaloa cartel, a detail that has long cast a shadow over his career.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of the 80th anniversary of its victory over Japan in World War II is about historical reflection, not inciting hatred. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the Japanese invasion is a necessary act of truth-telling and is separate from perceptions of modern Japan. Drawing from personal experience growing up with Japanese pop culture like manga and anime, the writer suggests it is possible to condemn past aggression while embracing contemporary Japanese culture and people. The piece distinguishes between education about historical atrocities and the systematic cultivation of hostility.</p>

Guerrero-Cruz, a Chilean national, is accused of overstaying his visa by more than two years. His supporters describe him as a devoted student and family member, and his mother has raised concerns about the poor conditions at the Adelanto detention center where he is being held.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison for illegally exporting firearms and military equipment to North Korea. The Justice Department stated that Wen, who remained in the U.S. illegally after his student visa expired, was directed by North Korean officials to procure the goods. He purchased weapons in Texas and shipped them from California, disguising at least one shipment as a refrigerator. In return for his smuggling efforts, Wen received approximately $2 million in payments from Pyongyang, according to U.S. authorities.</p>

          <p>Actor Callum Kerr, known for his roles in 'Hollyoaks' and 'Virgin River,' has publicly requested that friends of his late mother, Dawn Searle, not attend the funeral of his stepfather, Andrew Searle. French authorities discovered the couple's bodies in February, concluding it was a murder-suicide where Andrew Searle killed his wife before taking his own life. In a statement, Kerr and his sister said it would be "inappropriate" for their mother's memory to be associated with a service honoring the man believed to be responsible for her death.

          <p>A High Court judgment has created significant practical and political challenges for the UK government by granting a temporary injunction to prevent asylum seekers from being housed at a hotel in Epping. The ruling forces the Home Office to find alternative accommodations within a month and raises concerns that it could set a precedent for other councils to take similar legal action. This decision could impact the government's ability to house the 32,000 asylum seekers currently in hotels across the UK. The situation has intensified political pressure on ministers to accelerate their plans to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers.</p>

Prosecutors allege Foltz rented out the botnet to customers who targeted victims in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network and major tech companies. Foltz faces a charge of aiding and abetting computer intrusions, which carries a potential sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>A recent White House summit on the Ukraine war, involving President Trump and European leaders, highlighted a key division in diplomatic approaches. While the meeting presented a unified front, this analysis suggests Trump is focused on the sequence of meetings as the path to peace, prioritizing the process itself. In contrast, European leaders and Ukrainian President Zelensky are more concerned with the substantive details of a potential deal, such as security guarantees and the terms of a ceasefire.

          <p>Major food chains like McDonald's, Dunkin', and Starbucks are increasingly focusing on new and customized beverage offerings to drive sales, particularly among younger consumers. The number of drink options at top chains has risen over 9% in the past year, with a strong emphasis on cold beverages, specialty coffees, and energy drinks. This trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where beverages are becoming the primary reason for a visit rather than just an add-on to a meal. Companies are launching products like cereal-flavored lattes and protein-infused cold foams to capture this growing and profitable market segment.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has tempered expectations for an imminent summit between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, despite President Trump's calls for the two leaders to meet. After recent summits in Alaska and Washington, Trump acknowledged that Putin may not be interested in a deal to end the war. A Russian official stated that any meeting would need to be prepared gradually and should not be "for the sake of a meeting." Meanwhile, European leaders and Zelensky have expressed openness to direct talks, hoping to persuade Trump to adopt a tougher stance on Moscow if Putin remains unwilling to negotiate.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak has publicly stated that his relationship with the club cannot continue, claiming that promises made to him have been broken. This comes after the club rejected a £110 million bid for him from Liverpool. In a social media post, Isak asserted that the club had long known his position and that trust has been lost, making a transfer "in the best interests of everyone." The Swedish international's statement intensifies the standoff over his future as the summer transfer window nears its close, putting pressure on both Newcastle and potential buyers.</p>

This new guidance also includes screening for anti-Semitic ideologies. The move is part of a broader administration effort to deny or revoke visas for individuals deemed to be acting against U.S. foreign policy interests, which has previously targeted student activists critical of Israel.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence chip for China, tentatively named the B30A, which is said to be more powerful than its current offerings for that market.

The Trump administration had previously halted advanced chip sales over national security concerns. Nvidia confirmed it is evaluating various products to remain competitive within government-allowed limits, emphasizing that its offerings are for commercial use. (not investment advice)</p>
