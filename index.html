          <h2>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook Files Lawsuit to Prevent Presidential Removal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 09:32:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook has initiated a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking to prevent her removal from the board, a move her attorney describes as an "unprecedented and illegal attempt." President Trump announced Cook's dismissal citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, a decision that followed his persistent criticism of the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. The legal challenge centers on the Federal Reserve Act, which stipulates that a president can only remove a governor "for cause," and Cook has not faced any criminal charges. This landmark case is poised to escalate to the Supreme Court, potentially redefining the scope of presidential power over the nation's central bank and its independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the CDC Director, maintains she is still in her position despite a White House announcement of her firing, with her legal team arguing that only President Donald Trump has the authority to remove a presidential appointee. Monarez has publicly accused Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of "weaponizing public health" by attempting to enforce unscientific directives and dismiss health experts who do not align with his agenda. This dispute stems from disagreements over vaccine policy and the agency's direction under Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic. The controversy has also led to the resignations of at least three senior CDC leaders, highlighting a significant upheaval within one of the world's leading public health bodies amidst concerns from health experts.</p>

          <p>Four-time Tour de France champion Chris Froome was airlifted to a hospital in southern France after a severe training crash, where he sustained multiple serious injuries. The 40-year-old cyclist's injuries include five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a lumbar vertebrae fracture, though his team has confirmed his condition is stable and he did not suffer any head trauma. He is scheduled to undergo back surgery on Thursday, and these injuries are expected to sideline him for the remainder of the current season. This unfortunate incident represents a major professional setback for Froome, especially as he is nearing the end of his contract with Israel-Premier Tech.</p>

Sophia, a seventh-grade student, was among 19 individuals, including 16 children, who were shot during a Mass. Her mother had rushed to her workplace at Hennepin Healthcare to aid the incoming victims, only to discover her own daughter was among those critically injured.

          <p>Authorities have identified 23-year-old Robin Westman as the suspect in the tragic Minneapolis Catholic school shooting that resulted in the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injuries to 17 others. Westman, who reportedly died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene, was armed with a rifle, shotgun, and pistol, all legally purchased recently. Investigators are scrutinizing YouTube videos and handwritten journals believed to belong to Westman, which contain disturbing content including doodles of weapons, expletives, and references to killing, suggesting extensive planning and a "deeply nihilistic outlook." The article also highlights Westman's legal name change in 2020 to reflect a female identity, prompting Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to caution against using the incident to villainize the transgender community.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter than initially estimated, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing at a 3.3% annual rate, up from the initial 3% estimate. This growth marks a rebound from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of 2025, which was primarily due to a surge in imports. The upward revision is attributed to increased business investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property, as well as stronger consumer spending.

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing changes to controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, aiming to modify the criteria for properties to qualify for lower non-domestic rates instead of higher council tax. Since 2023, properties needed to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually; the new proposal suggests an average of 182 days let over several years. While intended to support the tourism sector, critics argue the "token gesture" changes don't address the core issue of the high 182-day threshold, which has led to a significant number of properties failing to meet criteria and facing backdated council tax bills.</p>

          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes a novel theory that human language may have evolved primarily out of the urgent needs of early human child-rearing. Challenging traditional theories focused on male-dominated activities, Beekman argues that the necessity for cooperation and communication among caregivers, especially mothers, to support vulnerable offspring, drove the development of complex vocalizations into structured language. This article highlights how biological changes, such as elongated vocal cords and larger brains, created the conditions for language, and how the survival advantage of verbal expression for both children and parents fostered its development. The theory offers a fresh perspective on human evolution, emphasizing interdependence and collective care.</p>

          <p>New York City is marking its 400th anniversary this year, yet the milestone is largely going uncelebrated, with little public acknowledgment or planned events despite earlier promises from Mayor Eric Adams. Historians, like Columbia University's Kenneth Jackson, express disappointment at the lack of fanfare for such a significant historical moment. The article suggests this oversight is both "sad" and "inspiring," hinting at the city's perpetual forward momentum where past achievements are often overshadowed by present challenges and future aspirations. This piece reflects on the city's enduring spirit, even in the absence of official commemorations.</p>

Gluck's attorney criticized the lack of accountability for the specific deputy and the department's training.

          <p>An opinion article suggests that understanding China's "needs" rather than its "wants" is crucial for managing the US-China rivalry and preventing increased danger. The piece highlights China's national security hierarchy, which prioritizes people's security, political security, and economic security. It argues that China's foreign actions are often driven by risk management for regime survival, such as ensuring economic growth, food, and energy security. This perspective reinterprets Beijing's push for indigenous innovation and diversified energy sources as essential hedges against external pressures, rather than purely mercantilist ambitions.</p>
