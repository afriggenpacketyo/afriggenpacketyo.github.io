          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a U.S. strike on three Iranian nuclear sites, congressional leaders expressed mixed reactions, with Republicans largely supporting the action and Democrats questioning its constitutionality and potential for escalating conflict. Senator Lindsey Graham praised the move, while House Democrat Hakeem Jeffries criticized Trump for misleading the country and increasing the risk of war. Senator Bernie Sanders condemned the action as unconstitutional, emphasizing that only Congress has the power to declare war. The statements reflect a deep divide in Congress regarding the use of military force against Iran. Optimism is subdued given the divided government. </p>

          <p>The United States launched strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Iran and Israel, according to an announcement by President Trump. B-2 stealth bombers and Tomahawk cruise missiles were used in the attacks, targeting sites including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The U.S. notified Israel and House Speaker Mike Johnson ahead of the strikes, which Trump described as a "tremendous success." The action follows days of missile exchanges between Israel and Iran, with Israel claiming Iran was close to producing a nuclear weapon. The international community is now bracing for the potential ramifications of this increased military involvement. </p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces reported conducting strikes on a military site in southwestern Iran containing missile launchers, along with radar detection system sites used for aerial intelligence gathering. This occurred as the United States maneuvered B-2 stealth bombers in the Pacific, fueling speculation about potential U.S. action in the escalating conflict with Iran. President Trump later announced that the U.S. had attacked three sites in Iran. The combined actions signal a significant escalation of the conflict, raising concerns about regional stability. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, including Fordo, Natanz, and Esfahan, confirming that all planes are now outside of Iranian airspace. According to sources, the U.S. used the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a "bunker-buster" bomb, in the strikes, with two MOPs used per target. The U.S. has reached out to Iran diplomatically to state that these strikes are the extent of U.S. plans, and regime change is not planned, although earlier in the week Trump opposed an Israeli plan to kill Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. alerted Israel before the strikes, and Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu afterward. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's surprise strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities were likely preceded by misdirection and deception, as indicated by the timing of the announcement and movements of military assets. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt had stated that Trump would make a decision on potentially striking Iran within two weeks, while six B-2 stealth bombers were reportedly en route to Guam. Fox News' Jennifer Griffin suggested that the bomber reports were part of misleading information to suggest Trump had delayed the decision. The element of surprise was key to the operation's success. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, protecting critical research in various technology fields. </p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights from Israel, according to U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, with two flights departing from Tel Aviv to Athens carrying approximately 70 U.S. citizens. The evacuations began hours before President Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The announcement follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for American citizens evacuating from Israel. The U.S. State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there. </p>

          <p>Israel's strikes against Iran have damaged nuclear facilities, but the complete destruction of Iran's ability to produce weapons-grade uranium may require U.S. assistance, specifically the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) and the B-2 Spirit bomber. The MOP is designed to attack deeply buried facilities, such as the Fordo uranium enrichment site, which is located 300 feet beneath a mountain. The B-2 Spirit is the only aircraft in the Air Force equipped to carry the MOP due to its weight and stealth capabilities. The use of these assets remains controversial. </p>

          <p>Iran's Fordo nuclear facility has long been a focus of international concern due to its location deep within a mountain and suspicions that it has been used for clandestine efforts to develop nuclear weapons. The IAEA has declared Iran non-compliant with monitoring efforts, raising concerns about the lack of transparency at the facility. Experts believe that destroying Fordo could require the U.S.-produced GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a "bunker-buster" bomb that can only be dropped by an American B-2 bomber. The site's location and structure make it a significant challenge for any potential military action. </p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rebuke of his own intelligence chief, Tulsi Gabbard, as "shocking" and suggested that Trump is disavowing his intelligence community for political reasons. Reed stated that Trump's rejection of Gabbard's assessment that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon aligns with his intention to attack Iran. He added that if Gabbard made a false statement, there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately, not just after Israeli activity. The senator's remarks underscore concerns about the politicization of intelligence. </p>

          <p>Texas will require all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments under a new law, making it the largest state to attempt such a mandate. The bill, signed by Governor Greg Abbott, is expected to face legal challenges from critics who view it as a violation of the separation of church and state. The law requires schools to post a 16x20 inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the commandments. Supporters argue that the Ten Commandments are foundational to the U.S. judicial and educational systems, while opponents say the law infringes on religious freedom. </p>

Experts warn that these simplistic solutions fail to address the underlying causes of stress and may prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment. While mindfulness and other techniques can help regulate stress responses, sudden body changes should be checked by a medical professional to rule out any physical health problems. Addressing the cause of stress, such as relationship or financial worries, is more effective than treating the symptoms. </p>
