          <p>Mexico held its first-ever judicial elections, becoming the only nation to select judges and magistrates by popular vote, a move championed by President Claudia Sheinbaum and her predecessor to overhaul the judicial system. Supporters believe this will combat corruption and inefficiency, while critics fear it will politicize the judiciary, especially in a country struggling with crime and gang violence. Voters faced the challenge of choosing from numerous largely unknown candidates, resulting in low turnout and concerns about a lack of preparation. Some voters reported feeling pressured, while others expressed disillusionment with the existing system. The election is considered by some as a crucial counterweight against the executive branch, while others fear it will only exacerbate existing issues.</p>

          <p>Six people were injured in a targeted act of violence at Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, Colorado, during a march in support of Israeli hostages. The suspect, identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, allegedly used a makeshift flamethrower and threw Molotov cocktails while yelling "free Palestine". The FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terrorism, and Soliman, an Egyptian national whose visa expired in 2023, is now in custody. Victims ranged in age from 67 to 88, with one critically injured, and officials have denounced the attack as a hate crime, emphasizing the right to peaceably assemble and speak freely without violence.</p>

In contrast, China has maintained control over rare earth exports, defying U.S. expectations. The spokesperson stated that the U.S. is unilaterally provoking economic and trade frictions, causing instability in bilateral relations, while the U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of violating its preliminary trade agreement with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strongly denied firing on Palestinians at a Gaza humanitarian site, releasing drone footage purportedly showing armed individuals shooting civilians. These actions are in response to reports claiming Israeli forces killed dozens attempting to collect aid, which Israeli officials have dismissed as false. The IDF stated that Hamas is disrupting aid distribution efforts and spreading misinformation to undermine Israel's humanitarian work. Amid these tensions, the IDF reported firing warning shots at individuals approaching troops near an aid site, emphasizing that this incident was unrelated to the false claims against them. The situation remains tense, with Israel asserting its commitment to enabling aid distribution while combating Hamas's interference.</p>

          <p>Ukraine completed its largest long-range attack of the war, using smuggled drones to strike 40 Russian warplanes at four military bases. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 117 drones were used in the "Spider's Web" operation by the SBU security service, hitting 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers. SBU sources reported it took a year and a half to organize the strikes, which targeted airbases as far as Siberia. As the attacks occurred, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators headed to Istanbul for a second round of peace talks amid low expectations, while Ukrainian authorities reported a massive drone and missile attack on their territory.</p>

The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team, effectively creating a 90/10 split of prize money.</p>

          <p>With President Donald Trump's administration implementing a program to deport undocumented immigrants, fear is growing among both residents and U.S. citizens. Immigration lawyer Álex Gálvez warns that the administration is manipulating laws to expedite deportations. Citizens should not fear questioning upon returning from travel, but residents face scrutiny, especially if they stay outside the U.S. for over six months or have a criminal record. Gálvez advises residents planning extended trips to seek permission and those with criminal records to consult an attorney to assess deportation risks, emphasizing that only citizens have the right to re-enter the country.</p>

          <p>More than 50 people were killed and many wounded in an attack near a food aid distribution center in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and witnesses. Witnesses claim Israeli forces fired at people en route to receive food, but the Israeli military denies involvement, citing an initial inquiry. The U.S. and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) stated that it delivered aid "without incident" and dismissed reports of chaos around its sites. The incident occurred amid faltering ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas, with both sides blaming each other for the stalled mediation.</p>

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it wants to support collaboration where possible, but more clarity is needed to prevent isolated decisions on course closures. University budgets have been strained by a drop in international students and stagnant fee income, leading to financial deficits and course reductions.</p>

More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, leading to unstable living conditions and disrupted education. The charity's report calls for a notification system to ensure authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation, enabling them to maintain access to education and healthcare.

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa is facing controversy after approving a law allowing the state to expropriate privately owned land without compensation in specific cases. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, which remains largely in white hands, but has drawn criticism from the U.S. President Donald Trump and local political groups. Legal experts clarify that expropriation without compensation would occur in rare circumstances, such as when land is unused or held for speculative purposes, and that compensation would still be paid for buildings and natural resources. The move is intended to expedite land reform, but faces legal challenges and political opposition.</p>
