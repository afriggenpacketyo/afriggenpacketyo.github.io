          <p>Nottingham Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson is poised for his first senior England national team call-up for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers. The 22-year-old is expected to replace the injured Jude Bellingham in the squad, which manager Thomas Tuchel will announce shortly. Anderson's inclusion comes after a series of impressive performances for his club since transferring from Newcastle. Meanwhile, Manchester City's Jack Grealish, currently on loan at Everton, is also back on England's radar after assistant manager Anthony Barry was sent to observe his recent standout performance.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old woman in Kenai, Alaska, sustained serious injuries after being attacked by a bear during her morning jog near her home's driveway. The incident occurred early Tuesday, and a neighbor found the victim before alerting authorities. She was subsequently airlifted to a hospital in Anchorage for treatment, though specifics of her condition have not been released. Officials have searched the area for the bear using drones and foot patrols but have not yet located the animal, urging the public to remain vigilant while outdoors.</p>

          <p>Denmark has significantly lowered its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, largely due to a slowdown in its dominant pharmaceutical sector. The revision reflects weaker export expectations for Novo Nordisk, the maker of popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, which faces increased competition and inventory issues in the U.S. market. The economy ministry also cited the impact of U.S. tariffs and statistical revisions as contributing factors to the downgrade. Despite this, officials stated the Danish economy remains fundamentally strong with high employment and low inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The 40-year-old cyclist was involved in a severe training crash in France, resulting in five broken ribs, a collapsed lung, and a fractured lumbar vertebra. His team, Israel-Premier Tech, confirmed the procedures went as planned and that he is recuperating under medical care. This incident marks another significant setback for Froome, who suffered a similar near-career-ending crash in 2019, and he is now expected to miss the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>The government of Guinea-Bissau has blocked several major Portuguese public broadcasters and a news agency, sparking condemnation from international press freedom organizations. The move, which comes just three months before scheduled elections, is seen by critics as an attempt to control media coverage and stifle dissent. Journalists in the country report a growing atmosphere of fear and systematic obstruction since President Umaro Sissoco Embalo took power. Opposition figures have called the crackdown an "irresponsible act" that could create conditions for election manipulation, warning of a dangerous slide towards dictatorship.</p>

To support this strategic growth, the government will continue issuing AI vouchers to subsidize computing power for companies and will pilot consumer subsidies for AI-powered products.

The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. Until now, parents had to pay privately for the vaccination, which can cost up to £200. Health officials hope the program will protect children from rare but severe complications of the illness and reduce the economic impact caused by parents taking time off work to care for sick children.</p>

Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner had claimed the mergers would save "a significant amount of money," citing a 2020 report suggesting £2.9 billion in savings. However, the commissioning body has updated its analysis, now stating that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even cost taxpayers money.
