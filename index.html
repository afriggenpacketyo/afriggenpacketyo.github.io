          <p>A Russian missile strike on a training exercise in Ukraine's Sumy region resulted in the death of six Ukrainian soldiers and injuries to more than ten others. The Russian defense ministry released a video purportedly showing the Iskander missile attack on a training camp, claiming up to 70 casualties, however this has not been verified. The Ukrainian military stated that their offensive in the neighboring Kursk region aimed to create a buffer zone to protect Sumy, though some have criticized the military losses associated with the operation. The commander has been suspended and an official investigation has been launched into the attack.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo reveals that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department proposed tax increases to Chancellor Rachel Reeves before this year's Spring Statement. The memo suggested raising Â£3bn to Â£4bn annually through measures like increasing corporation tax on banks and extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold. While Reeves did not implement these proposals, the memo highlights ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions. The proposals reflect concerns about welfare cuts and the need for alternative funding sources, with some Labour MPs advocating for a wealth tax or relaxed borrowing rules.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to halt its bonus scheme for senior executives following criticism that it was inappropriate given the company's financial struggles and environmental performance. The proposed "retention scheme" could have paid executives up to 50% of their salaries on top of regular bonuses. The decision follows pressure from Downing Street and the environment secretary, who accused Thames Water of trying to circumvent forthcoming rules against water company bonuses. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," urging them to overcome reservations and support the comprehensive legislation. The bill encompasses tax cuts, increased military and immigration enforcement spending, and reductions in Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies. Despite initial resistance, Speaker Mike Johnson engaged in negotiations with various factions, leading to some progress. Key holdouts, like Representative Chip Roy, acknowledged improvements but noted ongoing issues. The legislation aims to deliver on Trump's agenda, including tax cuts and stricter border enforcement, viewed as crucial for his election victory and Republican control of Congress.</p>

Last year, all six Britons in the singles competition were eliminated in the first round. Despite these historical challenges, there is optimism about the current crop of British players and their ability to perform well on clay.</p>

During those robberies, Murray reportedly sprayed an employee in the face with a caustic chemical before fleeing.

          <p>Iran has stated its willingness to engage in discussions with Canada to restore diplomatic relations, which were unilaterally severed by Ottawa in 2012.

This stance is viewed as unlikely by experts and Canadian diplomats, citing concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions, support for the Syrian regime, and human rights abuses. Despite these challenges, some Iranians hope for improved relations to facilitate family visits and business opportunities, while others worry that closer ties could prolong the current theocratic regime.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has increasingly involved business leaders in his activities, both domestically and internationally, to bolster his image. Corporate executives are spending more time currying favor with the administration in hopes of regulatory relief and tariff exemptions. In return, Trump uses these executives to project a booming economy, even as growth slows. However, these efforts do not fully protect companies from Trump's anger, indicating that commitments to create U.S. jobs may be more beneficial for the president's image than for the companies' bottom lines.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has been bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to a universal antivenom. Friede has gradually built up an immunity to multiple types of venom, which has led researchers to study his blood. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions of people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers hope to synthesize a treatment from Friede's blood that could be used for multiple different kinds of venomous snake bites, offering a more effective and accessible solution.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has been met with skepticism by some in the Maga movement, who view him as a globalist. However, the new pope's choice of name signals a challenge to right-wing populism, reminiscent of Leo XIII's confrontation with the economic injustices of the Industrial Revolution. Leo XIV aims to address modern crises such as wars, climate change, and inequality, which contrasts with the insular and nationalistic Maga worldview. His approach may challenge Catholic Maga figures who have aligned their faith with Trumpian nationalism.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning without worrying about costs. The supplementary budget bill includes 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs. The initiative aims to protect residents' lives and daily living amid predictions of an extremely hot summer and declining real wages. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit from the plan, saving approximately 5,000 yen over the four months.</p>

Despite these challenges, British firms continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with the Chinese market. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is calling for a more favorable policy environment characterized by clear, fairly enforced, and consistently applied rules. Escalating tensions between China and the US are also causing many British firms to delay investments both in China and globally.</p>

          <p>Scientists are warning of a potential "mega-tsunami" that could devastate parts of America's West Coast, Alaska, and Hawaii if a strong earthquake strikes the Cascadia subduction zone. A recent study estimates a 15% chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years. Such an event could trigger waves reaching up to 1,000 feet, potentially wiping out cities like Seattle and Portland and sinking coastal land. Unlike gradual climate-driven events, this potential earthquake would happen within minutes, leaving no time for adaptation or mitigation.</p>

He emphasized that if they couldn't get chips from the American AI leader, companies would use the "second best" option. The US curbs on sales of state-of-the-art AI chips to China have forced companies there to buy semiconductors from Chinese designers like Huawei. The American action has also pushed China to aggressively invest and develop a supply chain that is not dependent on foreign manufacturers.</p>
