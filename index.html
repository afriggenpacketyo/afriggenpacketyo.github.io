          <p>Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, strongly condemned the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, for referring former American officials for prosecution on what she termed a "treasonist conspiracy." Himes asserted there is no legal basis for these claims, which stem from the intelligence community's 2016 assessment of Russian election interference, and called them a "very dangerous lie." He emphasized that bipartisan investigations, including one led by Republicans, have repeatedly validated the original assessment that Russia meddled to help Donald Trump. Himes warned that such rhetoric puts individuals at risk and undermines the integrity of the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons confirmed his agents will arrest anyone found in the U.S. illegally, including those without criminal records, as part of the administration's expanded enforcement. Lyons defended the controversial use of masks by agents, citing safety concerns, and attributed the need for community arrests to "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass countered these points, describing the operations as instilling fear and appearing like "violent kidnappings" to residents. She criticized the use of masked agents in unmarked cars and argued their presence was unnecessary and a misuse of resources.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 14:30:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that major trade deals are expected within the next two weeks, just before a hard August 1 deadline for new tariffs on key trading partners like the European Union and Canada. Lutnick asserted that President Trump's strategy of threatening tariffs has successfully brought countries to the negotiating table, forcing them to either open their markets to American goods or face significant import duties. He dismissed concerns about rising consumer prices, claiming that the policy will ultimately benefit American manufacturers and that inflation will remain stable. The Secretary also sharply criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of "torturing America" with high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

A loss of the majority in the upper house would significantly undermine the coalition's legislative power, compounding a previous loss in the more powerful lower house.

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning to spend a family holiday in the United Kingdom next month, with a rented property in the Cotswolds as the likely destination. This comes after Vance made several critical statements about the UK and Europe, including a claim that London was "not English any more" and accusing the Scottish government of suppressing free speech regarding abortion clinic "safe access zones." The trip follows a planned stay in Scotland by President Donald Trump. Vance's visit occurs as tourist traffic from the UK to the US has reportedly declined amid the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Scottish ultra-runner Anna Rutherford achieved a remarkable victory in a 100-mile race, finishing over two hours ahead of the nearest male competitor and five hours ahead of the next woman. The 43-year-old mother-of-three completed the Rat Race course from Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh Castle in 17 hours and 23 minutes. She ran the final 50 miles of the race by herself after overtaking the leader at the halfway point. Rutherford, who credited singing Dolly Parton songs to keep her spirits up, was reportedly already home in bed as the rest of the 600 competitors were still finishing the grueling event.</p>

          <p>While few companies explicitly cite artificial intelligence as the reason for job cuts, employment experts suspect AI is a significant, unstated factor behind many recent layoffs. Firms often use vague terms like "restructuring" or "optimization" to describe workforce reductions that coincide with large-scale AI adoption in roles like customer service, content, and HR. This strategic silence helps companies avoid public and employee backlash while they reshape their workforce. Experts note that while AI can automate many tasks, companies may be overestimating its capabilities, as human judgment is still often required for quality control and handling complex edge cases.</p>

          <p>The family of an 82-year-old Pennsylvania resident reports he was secretly deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after he visited an immigration office to replace his lost green card. Luis Leon, who was granted political asylum in 1987, was detained during the June appointment and his family was unable to locate him. They were later falsely told by someone claiming to be a lawyer that he had died, only to discover from a relative that he was alive but hospitalized in Guatemala, a country to which he has no ties.

The protest occurred on the closing night of the production, with video showing a brief scuffle as a stage official unsuccessfully attempted to take the flag from the performer. The Royal Ballet and Opera condemned the act as a "spontaneous and unauthorised action," stating it was inappropriate and contrary to the institution's commitment to political impartiality.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and his office have pivoted to a more aggressive and combative social media strategy, directly targeting President Trump and his allies with their own tactics. This shift includes using derisive language, such as calling a White House official a "fascist cuck," and posting memes in response to political attacks. Newsom's advisors state the change was prompted by the president's decision to deploy troops to Los Angeles for immigration sweeps, which the governor saw as a sign that cooperation was impossible. While the approach has energized some Democrats, it risks alienating voters who prefer more respectful political discourse.</p>

          <p>A sustained wave of Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia prompted the temporary closure of all major airports serving Moscow, leading to the cancellation of at least 140 flights. Russia's defense ministry reported downing over 230 drones across the country since Saturday, including 27 over the capital region. The attacks caused significant travel disruption, with Russia's aviation watchdog confirming that four Moscow airports were affected. This is the latest instance of Ukrainian drone strikes penetrating deep into Russian territory, impacting civilian infrastructure as the war continues into its fourth year.</p>

Citing decades of research and public data, the physician explains that the childhood vaccine schedule has dramatically reduced illness and death, undergoes rigorous testing, and is monitored by robust surveillance systems.

Relations between the two nations have been tense since Trump's return to office and his threats of heavy tariffs. However, recent diplomatic engagements, including a meeting between their top diplomats, suggest a mutual desire to stabilize the relationship.</p>
