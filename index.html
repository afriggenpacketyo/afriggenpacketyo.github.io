          <p>Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, Mississippi artist Samuel Ingram created a powerful memorial portrait that went viral. Despite receiving death threats and losing over 100,000 social media followers, Ingram's work gained over a million new followers and was featured at Kirk's memorial service. The artist, who felt a personal connection to Kirk, views the act as a tribute to his legacy and hopes to spread a message of goodness, with the painting set to be displayed at Turning Point USA headquarters.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have initiated new reciprocal port fees on vessels associated with each other's countries, escalating their ongoing trade dispute onto the high seas. The fees were imposed by the U.S. following an investigation that concluded China's maritime sector benefits from unfair practices, prompting a retaliatory measure from Beijing. This move is part of a broader trade war that includes threats of further tariffs and export controls, with analysts expecting significant financial impact on major shipping carriers.

          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, average wage growth in the UK slowed to 4.7% in the three months to August, while the unemployment rate edged up from 4.7% to 4.8%. Analysts interpret the data as a sign of stabilization in the UK's volatile job market, although job vacancies continued to fall for the 39th consecutive period. Despite the slowdown, wage growth remains ahead of inflation, but economists suggest the persistent high growth may delay interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation of trade tensions, China has sanctioned five U.S.-based subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean, causing the company's shares to fall over 8%. Beijing accused the subsidiaries of assisting a U.S. government investigation into China's maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding industries, which it deemed a violation of international norms. The sanctions, which prohibit Chinese entities from doing business with the targeted firms, were announced concurrently with new retaliatory port fees on U.S.-linked vessels.</p>

The failures have been attributed to an under-skilled workforce, corner-cutting by businesses, and weak oversight, prompting calls for the responsible companies to fund repairs at no cost to homeowners.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS opener showcased the advantage of their record-breaking $415 million payroll. Despite stranding 11 runners and a costly baserunning error, the Dodgers secured the victory through key performances from their highly-paid stars, including a go-ahead home run from Freddie Freeman. The article suggests that the team's ability to purchase top-tier talent provides a significant buffer against mistakes and allows them to overpower less-resourced opponents.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a masterful performance in a 2-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS, overcoming a bizarre inning-ending double play that cost his team a potential lead. Snell pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out ten batters in one of the best postseason starts in franchise history. His dominance on the mound was crucial, allowing the Dodgers to rally after a confusing play and ultimately secure the win with a late home run from Freddie Freeman.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified 85 new subglacial lakes hidden miles beneath the ice in Antarctica, increasing the number of known active lakes in some regions. These lakes, formed by geothermal heat melting the base of the glaciers, regularly fill and drain, which destabilizes the ice sheet above them. This activity can accelerate the flow of ice into the ocean, contributing to a faster rate of global sea-level rise and highlighting the cascading effects of a warming planet.</p>
