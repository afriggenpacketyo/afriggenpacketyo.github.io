          <p>Heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath are reuniting with original frontman Ozzy Osbourne for a final concert in their hometown of Birmingham. Titled "Back to the Beginning," the show will feature the band's original lineup for the first time in over 20 years, with proceeds benefiting local charities. The article recounts Osbourne's tumultuous life, from his working-class origins and rise with Black Sabbath to his struggles with addiction, his successful solo career, and recent health battles with Parkinson's disease. The farewell performance is framed as a historic, full-circle moment for the iconic "Prince of Darkness."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are closing at an alarming rate due to a severe decline in new members, forcing religious orders to sell historic properties. The number of nuns has plummeted from over 93,000 in 1960 to under 9,500 today, a trend attributed to secularization and expanded opportunities for women outside the church. This decline impacts society, as many orders have historically run schools and hospitals. While the closures are painful for many, some see it as a chance to repurpose the large, historic buildings for community use, such as housing or cultural centers.</p>

          <p>The upcoming week presents significant volatility for global markets, centered on two key events. First, the July 9 deadline for U.S.-European Union trade negotiations looms, with the possibility of new tariffs, although a full deal is considered impossible. The second major event is the OPEC International Seminar in Vienna, where oil-producing nations will discuss energy security and investment. This meeting precedes an OPEC+ gathering to decide on a potential oil output increase, adding another layer of uncertainty to crude prices and the global economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The modern CEO's role is evolving from a singular focus on winning to navigating constant turbulence with resilience and adaptability. Citing leaders like McLaren Racing's Zak Brown, the article highlights a new emphasis on learning from failure, maintaining momentum, and fostering agility in a volatile environment marked by geopolitical shocks and rapid technological change. This shift is occurring as a record number of CEOs step down, facing pressures from government intervention and the urgent need to integrate AI. The emerging leadership playbook values flexibility and quick decision-making over rigid, long-term plans to ensure organizational survival and growth.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive jailhouse interview, Robert Baker, who was convicted of murdering hairstylist Fabio Sementilli, adamantly stated that his former lover and co-defendant, Monica Sementilli, was not involved in the crime. Baker, who is serving a life sentence, claimed Monica "didn't know s***" about the plot to kill her husband. This bombshell assertion comes as Monica faces trial for conspiracy. Baker's potential testimony could be a game-changer for her defense, though prosecutors maintain that overwhelming circumstantial evidence links her to the murder conspiracy, which they allege was motivated by love and money.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in the Fabio Sementilli murder case are using evidence of a continuing jailhouse romance between Monica Sementilli and her lover Robert Baker as proof of their conspiracy. Police intercepted love letters, or "kites," and used sting operations to record the couple's interactions while in custody. In these communications, the pair allegedly used secret codes like "R or D" (Ride or Die) and referred to each other as husband and wife. Prosecutors argue this demonstrates an ongoing commitment to their secrecy pact, while the defense contends the affair is irrelevant to proving a murder plot.</p>

Key testimony came from co-conspirator Christopher Austin, who detailed how Monica allegedly directed the attack.

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered that genetic factors play a significant role in shaping "brain criticality," the crucial balance between neural excitation and inhibition. This state is believed to be optimal for the brain's information processing capabilities. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, demonstrated this genetic influence across various scales, from individual brain regions to large networks. By establishing a link between this genetically-influenced criticality and cognitive functions, the findings open new avenues for understanding brain function and potential treatments for neurological and mental disorders.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is facing a potential collapse of its humanitarian operations due to the Trump administration's plan to drastically cut or end funding to international organizations. The US, the UN's largest contributor, is reviewing its memberships, with a proposed budget seeking an 87% reduction in UN funding. This threatens key agencies like UNICEF and the World Food Programme at a time of rising global conflict and hunger. The article argues this move represents a fundamental attack on multilateralism and the rules-based international order, leaving a dangerous void that could lead to global anarchy.</p>

          <p>A High Court ruling has found that Britain's security service, MI5, provided false and misleading evidence to multiple courts regarding its handling of an abusive neo-Nazi informant. The case involves an agent, known as "X," who violently abused his partner. MI5 initially lied to conceal that it had confirmed the agent's status to a BBC journalist, and subsequent internal inquiries were deemed "deficient" by the court. Newly revealed secret documents show MI5 withheld key information and that its claims of memory loss were unbelievable, prompting the court to order a new, more robust investigation.</p>

          <p>A new travel trend is emerging in China, with young people, particularly recent university graduates, fueling a surge in the popularity of cruise ship holidays. Instead of traditional backpacking or road trips, groups of friends are opting for cruises as a unique social travel experience. The contained environment of a ship, with its communal spaces and activities, offers a way for them to bond without the logistical challenges of other group travel. This demographic shift is providing a significant boost to the cruise industry in the region, which is adapting to cater to these younger, socially-motivated travelers.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has announced the launch of a new political party, the "America Party," positioning it as a challenge to the dominant two-party system in the United States. The announcement, made on his social media platform X, follows a recent and public falling out with President Donald Trump over a massive spending bill. Musk, who is ineligible to run for president, stated the party's goal is to "give you back your freedom" from a system he claims is bankrupting the country. It remains unclear if the party has been formally registered or who its leadership will be.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a £500 million plan to roll out "Best Start" family hubs to every local authority in England by 2026. These hubs aim to provide a "lifeline" to families by offering a wide range of integrated services, from midwifery support and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs. The initiative builds on the model of Labour's previous "Sure Start" centers, many of which were closed due to funding cuts after 2010. While the government champions the plan, the opposition Conservatives have questioned how much of it is genuinely new versus a rebranding of existing services.</p>

          <p>In a 6-4 loss to the Houston Astros, Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani delivered another dominant but short pitching performance, throwing two scoreless innings on his 31st birthday. However, the team's bullpen struggled, with long reliever Justin Wrobleski giving up five runs. The Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome the deficit, hampered by missed opportunities and a key baserunning mistake by Mookie Betts in the seventh inning when he was thrown out trying to stretch a double into a triple. The loss clinched a series defeat for the Dodgers, despite positive signs for their long-term pitching health.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," revisits a pivotal journey the author took back to the Mississippi River in 1882. The trip, undertaken to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," allowed Samuel Clemens to reflect on his formative years as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its freedom. Despite his fame and new life in the East, Twain found that the pilot house still felt like his "proper place." The excerpt highlights the paradox of his life: the more worldly he became, the more he longed for his youth.</p>

          <p>Recently updated regulations for the Chinese Communist Party's internal work suggest that President Xi Jinping may be delegating more decision-making power to his deputies. The new rules aim to standardize the policy and review processes for top party organs, such as central commissions and leading groups. According to state media, these bodies are now tasked with "planning, discussing and checking on major matters." Analysts interpret this as a potential shift in Xi's leadership style, possibly to streamline governance or even as a preliminary step related to future succession planning.</p>
