          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, House Speaker Mike Johnson described the event as a potential "turning point" for the United States. Speaking on Sunday, Johnson urged political leaders from all sides to de-escalate their rhetoric, warning that inflammatory language such as calling opponents 'Nazis' can incite deranged individuals to violence. He emphasized the need to cease treating policy disagreements as existential threats and called for a return to civil discourse, reflecting on Kirk's own love for vigorous but respectful debate. The Speaker also addressed the fear among public officials and outlined efforts to enhance security for lawmakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final stage of the Vuelta a España, a major professional cycling race, was abruptly abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters breached the course in central Madrid. Demonstrators knocked down barriers and occupied the road, making it impossible for the race to proceed safely despite a deployment of over 1,000 police officers. As a result of the cancellation, Jonas Vingegaard, who was the leader heading into the final stage, was declared the overall winner of the tour. The protests were the culmination of several demonstrations against the Israel-Premier Tech team that occurred throughout the multi-stage event, causing disruptions and safety concerns for riders.</p>

          <p>In the days following the assassination of its founder, Charlie Kirk, the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA (TPUSA) has reported a significant surge in public interest. A spokesperson for the group stated that over 32,000 inquiries have been received from individuals wanting to establish new campus chapters across the country. This influx represents a massive potential expansion for the organization, which currently has approximately 900 college chapters and a total presence on 3,500 campuses. Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, has vowed that the movement her husband built will not die and will instead become stronger and bolder than ever before.</p>

          <p>British supermarket chain Sainsbury’s has officially terminated talks regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise subsidiary, Argos, to Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com. The company announced that JD.com sought to proceed only on "materially revised" terms, which were not in the best interests of Sainsbury's shareholders. Despite the collapse of the deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying retail operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year. The potential acquisition was previously seen as an opportunity for JD.com to bring its advanced technology and logistics expertise to the Argos brand.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has disclosed that the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is not cooperating with investigators. Cox stated that information from Robinson's family and friends indicates he held a "very different ideology" from his conservative family and was living with a romantic partner who is a transgender woman. While officials are still determining the motive, the governor noted that Robinson was reportedly influenced by "dark places of the internet" and held left-leaning beliefs. He also confirmed that ammunition found with the weapon used in the attack was engraved with anti-fascist and taunting messages.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Oblique Seville has won the men's 100m gold medal at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo, ending a nine-year drought for his country in the event. Seville's victory, achieved with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds, marks the first global 100m title for a Jamaican man since Usain Bolt's win in 2016. The 24-year-old, who trains with Bolt's former coach, led a Jamaican one-two finish, with Kishane Thompson taking silver. The win is seen as a significant moment for Jamaican sprinting, signaling a potential new era of dominance after years of waiting for a successor to the legendary Bolt.</p>

This victory is the latest in a series of late-game heroics, with all four of the team's wins this season being decided by goals scored in the final ten minutes or stoppage time. This trend of securing crucial points in what the article dubs "Arne Time," after manager Arne Slot, demonstrates the team's resilience and psychological edge over opponents. While the reliance on late goals suggests Liverpool has not yet reached peak performance, their ability to consistently win under pressure is an ominous sign for league rivals.</p>

          <p>“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade issued an on-air apology for comments he made suggesting the use of "involuntary lethal injection" to deal with mentally ill homeless individuals. The remarks were made during a discussion about a fatal stabbing in North Carolina allegedly committed by a homeless man with schizophrenia. After a video clip of his comments circulated online, Kilmeade apologized for what he called an "extremely callous remark." He acknowledged that not all homeless or mentally ill people are violent and that many deserve empathy and compassion, a sharp reversal from his original statement.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Melissa Jefferson-Wooden has won her first world title in the women's 100m, capping a dominant season with a spectacular performance in Tokyo. The 24-year-old clocked a time of 10.61 seconds, a new championship record that makes her the fourth-fastest woman in history. The victory solidifies a remarkable year for Jefferson-Wooden, who has significantly lowered her personal best after an injury-affected 2024 season. Jamaica's Tina Clayton took the silver medal, while 38-year-old sprinting legend Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce finished sixth in what was the final world championship race of her illustrious career.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham has described the current political climate in the United States as a "dangerous place" following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. Meacham argues that political violence historically erupts when there are existential debates about national identity and who is included in "We the people." He warned that when citizens lose the ability to engage in peaceful debate and dissent, it breaks faith with the American covenant of living in contention without resorting to violence. Meacham urged leaders to learn from history and make the case for a more perfect, respectful union to avoid further fracturing.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that Britain will not surrender its flag to those who use it for division, following a large march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson. The "Unite the Kingdom" march drew over 150,000 people and resulted in clashes with a smaller counter-protest, leaving 26 police officers injured and leading to 24 arrests. Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation on the streets will not be tolerated. The event, which also featured a video address from Elon Musk, highlighted deep societal divisions and prompted calls for leaders to address public grievances.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the recent Eaton wildfire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local businesses and rebuild their community. Founded by a resident who lost her home, the club organizes weekly gatherings at different local restaurants, many of which have seen sales plummet since the fire destroyed parts of the neighborhood. These events provide a crucial economic boost to struggling, family-owned establishments while also creating a space for displaced and grieving residents to connect and support one another. The initiative serves as a powerful example of grassroots community healing and resilience in the face of tragedy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law exempting up to $25,000 of tip income from federal taxes is criticized in this article for further entrenching America's problematic tipping culture instead of promoting living wages. The author argues that the tax benefit is temporary, expiring in 2028, and its eligibility list is illogical, including professions like 'digital content creators' while excluding others like postal workers and teachers. The piece contends that rather than creating complex tax incentives, the U.S. should follow the model of other countries by eliminating tipping altogether. This would force employers to pay fair, stable wages and reduce the burden on consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A local official in Johnson County, Iowa, has publicly refused to comply with the governor's directive to fly flags at half-staff in honor of the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the county's board of supervisors, condemned the killing but stated he would not grant county honors to a man he said dedicated his life to denigrating marginalized communities. Green contrasted this with the lack of a similar order for a slain Democratic lawmaker from Minnesota. The decision has drawn criticism from Republican Governor Kim Reynolds but has been supported by another Democratic supervisor on the board.</p>
