          <p>This news roundup highlights several significant global stories. Israeli airstrikes in Qatar, targeting Hamas leaders, have drawn condemnation from Trump and international bodies, with the Times reporting the strike was "long in the planning." Separately, new emails detail Lord Mandelson's alleged £1bn deal with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein's conviction, raising questions about his associations. The article also notes a significant rise in Britons doubting global warming's severity and features a heartwarming story of a 102-year-old war veteran visiting her fiancé's grave.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge cited the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" provision, stating it limits removals to behavior in office, not prior conduct like the alleged mortgage fraud Trump referenced. Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, denies wrongdoing, and her attorney emphasizes safeguarding the Fed's independence from political interference. The Supreme Court is expected to ultimately decide this unprecedented case, with Cook participating in the upcoming Fed meeting where interest rate cuts are anticipated.</p>

          <p>Ko Wen-je, former chairman of the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP) and a significant political figure, has been released on a record NT$70 million (US$2.3 million) bail after nearly a year in detention over alleged corruption. Finishing third in last year's presidential elections, Ko immediately criticized Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te and the judiciary, accusing them of dividing the island and eroding trust in democratic institutions. His release stirs hopes for a political comeback for the opposition, potentially creating new challenges for the ruling party amidst its own struggles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's consumer price index (CPI) fell 0.4% year-on-year in August, exceeding economists' expectations for a 0.2% contraction, while wholesale prices continued their deflationary trend. This persistent deflation underscores the need for Beijing to boost sluggish domestic demand and counter weakening export growth. While authorities attribute the CPI drop to a high base effect and lower food prices, underlying inflation remains weak despite some gains in core CPI categories like household appliances. Economists are intensifying calls for significant fiscal support to address mounting economic strains and reverse the deflationary cycle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called on the European Union to implement tariffs of up to 100% on China and India, aiming to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. This demand was made during a meeting with US and EU officials discussing increased economic pressure on Russia, as Trump struggles to broker a peace deal amidst intensifying Russian strikes on Ukraine.

          <p>For the first time, the number of obese school-aged children globally has surpassed those who are underweight, according to a new UNICEF report. Data from over 190 countries shows that since 2000, underweight rates among 5-19 year olds dropped from 13% to 9.2%, while obesity rates nearly tripled from 3% to 9.4%. Researchers attribute this trend to unhealthy food environments, where ultra-processed and fast foods are increasingly replacing nutritious options. UNICEF urges governments to implement food labeling, marketing restrictions, and bans on junk foods in schools, alongside strengthening social protection programs to improve access to healthy diets.</p>

          <p>A record 47% of U.S. businesses have redirected planned investments from China to other regions over the past year, with Southeast Asia being the top alternative, followed by the Indian subcontinent, and then the U.S. and Mexico. This shift, revealed by an American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai survey, comes amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and concerns over China's economic slowdown. Businesses report significant harm from tariffs, increasing domestic competition, and declining confidence in China's five-year business outlook. While regulatory transparency in China has improved, challenges persist, particularly for the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The document contains lurid tributes, sexual references, and crude drawings from powerful individuals, including an alleged letter from Donald Trump. The article suggests that many contributors appeared aware of Epstein's predatory lifestyle, even celebrating it, fueling long-held suspicions about the extent of his network and the complicity of powerful figures.

          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a legal challenge regarding President Trump's authority to impose broad tariffs under an emergency powers law, setting the stage for a significant ruling on his economic agenda. Lower courts have previously found Trump exceeded his authority, with a federal appeals court ruling the tariffs illegal. The Justice Department argues that upholding these rulings would disadvantage the U.S. and invite retaliatory trade policies. This case marks the first time the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of a second-term Trump policy, with arguments scheduled for early November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win a special election for a Northern Virginia congressional district, further reducing the House GOP's majority to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff for the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, campaigned on issues including President Trump's federal workforce cuts, which significantly impact his district. He also pledged to sign a discharge petition to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, an issue gaining bipartisan support. His victory underscores a dominant trend of Democrats overperforming in recent races, and it comes just weeks before a critical federal funding deadline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly criticized Israel's airstrike on Hamas targets in Qatar, stating it "does not advance Israel or America's goals" and expressing being "not thrilled" about the location of the attack. Trump clarified that the decision was Prime Minister Netanyahu's, not his, despite being notified by the US military, albeit too late to intervene. He praised Qatar as a "strong ally" and assured its leaders such an incident would not recur on their soil. While reiterating the worthy goal of eliminating Hamas, Trump's rare rebuke of Netanyahu highlights the diplomatic fallout and potential complications for regional peace efforts.</p>

          <p>A new blood test for Alzheimer's disease, capable of detecting rogue protein biomarkers, is being offered to over 1,000 suspected dementia patients across the UK in a trial that could revolutionize diagnosis. Scientists at University College London believe the £100 test will boost diagnostic accuracy from 70% to over 90%, significantly improving on current cognitive tests. This development is crucial as amyloid and tau proteins can accumulate for up to 20 years before symptoms appear. If successful, the blood test could become a standard part of diagnosis, paving the way for timely intervention with new drugs currently in clinical trials.</p>

This expansion of an existing program, which previously covered families up to 400% of the federal poverty level, has already significantly reduced poverty rates in the state. The initiative is expected to save families an average of $12,000 per child annually, providing substantial financial relief and supporting workforce participation. Experts praise New Mexico's data-focused approach as a "model for the nation," further bolstered by a new loan fund for facilities and a recruitment campaign for home providers.</p>

          <p>Community activists in Chicago are mobilizing to track and respond to increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz" by the Trump administration. Organizer Maricela Bautista reports that Southside neighborhoods are noticeably quiet due to residents' fears of racial profiling and lack of due process, leading to the postponement of cultural events. While Homeland Security states the operation targets criminals, local officials like Alderman Anthony Napolitano welcome the enforcement, citing concerns over crime rates and resource allocation.
