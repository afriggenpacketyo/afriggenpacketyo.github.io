        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury yields declined as investors reacted to President Trump's renewed trade war threats, including potential tariffs on the European Union and Apple. Trump's social media posts about tariffs on EU goods and iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. triggered a flight to safety, increasing bond demand and lowering yields. This move followed concerns earlier in the week about Trump's budget bill worsening the U.S. deficit, which had initially driven yields higher. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group criticized the muscled top-down approach to capitalism, saying that capitalism works best when it is left alone as businesses and consumers are left free to trade goods and services at prices agreed upon by both sides as it is a highly competitive world out there.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the decision to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit alleges that the ban violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claims the school failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and fostered an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students.

          <p>President Trump stated that Apple must pay a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the United States, causing Apple's stock to decline. Trump's comments followed Apple's plans to shift some production to India, a country with a friendlier trade relationship with the U.S. Analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. could significantly increase the price of the device, potentially costing consumers thousands of dollars more per phone.

          <p>Three independent analyses have refuted earlier claims of potential life signs on the exoplanet K2-18b, located over 120 light-years from Earth.

However, the new analyses found no compelling evidence of this molecule, attributing the earlier findings to faint noise in the data.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu launched a scathing attack on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the leaders of France and Canada, accusing them of siding with Hamas. The accusation followed a deadly shooting of Israeli embassy staff in Washington, D.C., and criticism from the UK, France, and Canada regarding Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza. Netanyahu blamed a UN official's claim about Palestinian babies dying in Gaza for the attack in Washington. UK armed forces minister Luke Pollard condemned the killings but rejected Netanyahu's criticism of the British prime minister.</p>

          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of a "campaign of retribution" and violating Harvard's First Amendment rights. Harvard President Alan M. Garber condemned the action, stating that it "imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard." The university also indicated it would file a request for a temporary restraining order to block the administration's action.</p>

          <p>Despite reforms and policy changes implemented after the murder of George Floyd, killings by police officers in the United States have remained high. States and cities enacted new policies aimed at improving policing, but the data suggests that these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers. Killings by police officers rose from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The article notes that the Trump administration has dropped efforts to investigate or oversee nearly two dozen police departments.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes the Republican domestic policy bill, arguing that it seeks to undermine Obamacare by restricting access to Medicaid. The proposed work requirement would strip Medicaid benefits from working-age adults without children unless they work at least 80 hours a month, resulting in millions losing health insurance. The editorial argues that health care is a right and that work requirements don't work, pointing to evidence from Arkansas and Georgia where such requirements primarily resulted in people losing coverage due to paperwork issues.</p>

          <p>A new report warns that President Trump's student loan policies will create hardship for struggling American borrowers, as they could face credit score drops and involuntary debt collection. The report identifies three groups at risk: borrowers behind on payments, those in default, and those enrolled in the SAVE plan. The Trump administration is restarting Treasury offsets and wage garnishment, which were paused during the pandemic. Republicans are also proposing a new income-driven repayment plan that would set minimum monthly payments at $10 for low-income borrowers.</p>

Kardashian testified emotionally about fearing for her life during the robbery, where she was bound and locked in a bathroom while the robbers searched for jewelry.

These findings challenge the Trump administration's claim that a Chinese lab leak was the "real source" of the pandemic.
