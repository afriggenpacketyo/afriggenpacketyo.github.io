            <p>The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating a tour helicopter crash in the Hudson River that killed all six people on board, including a family from Spain. The NTSB is considering all potential causes, including witness reports of a large flock of birds in the area. The helicopter, operated by New York Helicopters, went down near the Jersey City coastline, and divers are still searching for pieces of the aircraft. The CEO of the tour company said the pilot radioed about needing fuel before the accident, but it is unclear when this call was made. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Internal budget documents reveal the Trump administration's plans to drastically cut funding for climate science programs at NOAA and NASA. The proposed cuts would eliminate NOAA's oceanic and atmospheric research office and significantly defund NASA's planetary and earth science programs. Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad called the cuts a crushing blow to the country's ability to protect its citizens and lead the world in science. The plan also outlines moving the National Marine Fisheries Service under the US Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>

The tariffs will affect goods such as soybeans, aircraft, and pharmaceuticals. This action follows Trump's pausing of tariffs on most countries, except China, for 90 days, yet concerns persist about the potential damage to the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened Mexico with new tariffs over its failure to deliver billions of gallons of water to Texas under a 1944 treaty. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum acknowledged the country's inability to meet its commitments due to a severe drought. The dispute adds another layer of complexity to the strained US-Mexico relationship, as Trump has previously imposed tariffs on Mexico for failing to combat illegal immigration and fentanyl production.

            <p>The US and China exchanged heated words over tariffs, capping off a volatile week in the markets. China announced it would increase tariffs on US imports to 125%, while the White House warned that retaliatory measures "would not be good for China". The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 619 points. Beijing dismissed Trump's tariffs as economically insignificant, while the US urged China to make the first move toward negotiations.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth is demanding that struggling doctors immediately repay loans issued after last year's cyberattack on Change Healthcare. The company had offered no-interest loans to help medical practices with short-term cash flow needs. Now, providers are being asked to repay hundreds of thousands of dollars in days, with UnitedHealth threatening to withhold future payments if they don't. Several doctors say they cannot meet these demands, and the American Medical Association has urged UnitedHealth not to use a one-size-fits-all approach to loan repayment. (not investment advice)</p>
