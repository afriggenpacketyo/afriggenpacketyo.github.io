          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions, China's restrictions on rare earth element exports are raising concerns within the US defense industry. These elements are crucial for manufacturing military equipment like jet engines and radar systems. China, the world's leading producer of rare earths, implemented these controls in response to increased tariffs imposed by the US. This article highlights the potential vulnerabilities in the US defense supply chain due to reliance on Chinese rare earth elements. The restrictions specifically target seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, impacting the production of essential military technologies.</p>

This directive effectively eliminates the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the economic damage from global warming against the cost of limiting carbon pollution. Jeffrey B.
