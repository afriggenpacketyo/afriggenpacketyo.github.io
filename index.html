            <p>The average price of a new condominium in central Tokyo has risen for the second consecutive year, reaching 116.32 million yen ($827,000) in fiscal 2024, an 11.2 percent increase from the previous year according to a research institute. This surge is primarily attributed to escalating material and labor costs, while the number of new condominiums available for sale in Tokyo's 23 wards has decreased by 25.5 percent. Prices have also increased in surrounding prefectures like Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa, indicating a broader trend of rising real estate values in the Tokyo metropolitan area.

            <p>China has cautioned countries against entering into trade agreements with the United States that could compromise its own economic interests, threatening countermeasures against nations that comply with U.S. pressure. This warning comes in response to reports that the U.S. plans to incentivize countries to reduce trade with China in exchange for avoiding new tariffs. While the U.S. claims that numerous countries are seeking trade renegotiations to avert these penalties, China insists that appeasement will not lead to peace and vows to protect its interests. The situation highlights the intensifying trade tensions between the two economic superpowers and the difficult balancing act faced by other nations. Optimism score is 40.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, keeping the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision reflects China's focus on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., supported by recent strong macroeconomic data including a 5.4% GDP increase in the first quarter. The PBOC's move suggests a cautious approach, waiting for further data to assess the full impact of U.S. tariffs before considering any interest rate adjustments. Following the announcement, the Chinese yuan experienced a slight appreciation against the dollar. Optimism score is 65.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to exchange Venezuelan deportees held in El Salvador for political prisoners in Venezuela. Bukele addressed President Nicolás Maduro on social media, listing family members of opposition figures and activists detained in Venezuela. The proposal comes amid international scrutiny of El Salvador's detention of deportees, particularly in the "mega-prison" known as the Terrorism Confinement Center. Venezuela's prosecutor's office has criticized Bukele's proposal. Optimism score is 30.</p>

            <p>A federal program providing rental assistance to 60,000 families and individuals fleeing homelessness or domestic violence is running out of funds, potentially leading to mass evictions.
