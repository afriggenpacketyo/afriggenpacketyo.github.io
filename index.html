          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is projected to move up the Atlantic Ocean, bringing "life-threatening surf and rip currents" to the East Coast, though it is not expected to make U.S. landfall. Coastal flooding warnings and mandatory evacuations are in effect for North Carolina's Outer Banks. The storm, downgraded to Category 2, previously reached Category 5 and is forecast to maintain hurricane strength into the weekend. Officials urge caution against swimming at most East Coast beaches due to dangerous conditions expected through Thursday, emphasizing the widespread and prolonged threat posed by rip currents.

          <p>Lowe's reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by increased demand for home projects and strategic acquisitions aimed at expanding its business with home professionals. The retailer announced an $8.8 billion deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a distributor for large residential and commercial professionals, building on an earlier acquisition of Artisan Design Group. Despite a slight revision to its full-year earnings per share outlook, Lowe's raised its total sales forecast, signaling confidence in its growth strategy. Shares rose following the announcement, contrasting with rival Home Depot's recent sales miss, as both companies focus on the more lucrative professional customer segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent announcement to "rescue" Washington D.C. includes using federal officials to remove people experiencing homelessness, whom he grouped with criminals. This approach sparks debate on the criminalization of homelessness and the use of police to address social issues. Critics question what this D.C. takeover might signify for other U.S. cities, suggesting a broader, potentially politically motivated, application of federal power.

          <p>Israeli football clubs, including Maccabi Tel-Aviv, are playing their Europa League qualifiers in Serbia, as UEFA deems Israel unsafe for continental competition.

This arrangement reflects a broader trend of Israeli and Ukrainian teams playing European matches abroad due to ongoing conflicts. The article explores the debate over sporting sanctions for political actions, with UEFA's president expressing reluctance to ban athletes despite increasing calls for sports organizations to take sides in geopolitical issues.

The increase was primarily fueled by a substantial jump in air fares, likely due to the timing of school holidays, and rising food prices, particularly for beef, chocolate, and instant coffee. This higher-than-expected inflation strengthens economists' predictions that the Bank of England will slow the pace of interest rate cuts.

          <p>Weekly mortgage application volume, including both refinance and homebuyer demand, stalled last week despite only a minuscule increase in interest rates. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose slightly to 6.68%. Refinance applications fell 3% week-over-week, indicating volatility in this segment due to higher current rates compared to the previous year. However, applications for home purchases saw a slight increase of 0.1% and remained significantly higher than the same period last year. The article suggests that prospective homebuyers are more active despite economic headwinds and affordability challenges, with rates remaining within a narrow range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's declaration of a "crime emergency" in Washington D.C. has led to federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and deployment of the D.C. National Guard. While his control over the MPD is limited to 30 days without Congressional authorization, his authority over the D.C. National Guard is more extensive and lacks clear time limits. This unprecedented move, which D.C. officials are challenging legally, is seen by critics as politically motivated, despite city data showing violent crime at a 30-year low. The article highlights concerns about federal overreach and the potential for this action to intimidate other Democratic-run cities.

The 325-foot-tall, 450-year-old coastal Douglas Fir has been burning since Saturday, with heat detected within a trunk cavity 280 feet up. While the tree is not at risk of fully burning down due to its immense mass, the fire has already caused it to lose about 50 feet from the top, potentially impacting its global height ranking.

          <p>This article examines why the conservative movement appears more effective at cultivating young intellectual talent compared to liberals, highlighting a significant "pipeline problem" for the left. It contrasts well-funded conservative fellowship programs, which offer paid opportunities and direct engagement with influential figures, with the more professionally focused internships typically available to young liberals. The author argues that conservatives excel at fostering a comprehensive ideological worldview that bridges political philosophy and policy, while liberalism's traditional intellectual dominance has led to a siloing of academic and policy expertise. The article suggests that liberals need to develop a new, compelling vision and a dedicated cadre of young thinkers to articulate it, as the right gains an advantage in shaping future political discourse.</p>
