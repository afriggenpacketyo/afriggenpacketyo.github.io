          <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee has awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado for her long and non-violent struggle for democracy and free elections in her country. The announcement highlighted her persistent efforts against authoritarian rule, serving as a symbol of hope for many Venezuelans. The prize, which includes a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor, will be formally presented in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. This year's selection from 338 candidates underscores the committee's focus on individuals fighting for fundamental human rights and democratic principles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing significant financial and psychological distress for federal workers, who are either furloughed or working without pay. Employees express anxiety over how they will cover basic expenses like rent and bills, with many anticipating the need to take on debt if the shutdown persists. The closure has also halted the work of agencies like the National Labor Relations Board, preventing them from investigating unfair labor practice claims and leaving workers without legal recourse. This disruption is compounding morale issues within the federal workforce, which has already faced staffing shortages and layoffs under the current administration.</p>

          <p>At just 19 years old, Arjun Malaviya from Southern California has traveled solo to 118 countries, starting his journey on his 17th birthday. Financing the entire $22,500 trip himself, he aimed to connect with local cultures, from visiting remote villages in Oceania to conversing with a Taliban guard in Afghanistan. His experiences, which included being in Odessa during a bombing and being briefly held for money in Myanmar, taught him that people worldwide share similar desires for a better life for their families. Malaviya hopes his journey inspires other young people to embrace discomfort and explore the world to gain a broader perspective on humanity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated the use of the National Guard, deploying or suggesting deployment to nearly a dozen cities run by Democratic mayors, including Chicago, Portland, and Washington, D.C. The administration cites the need to combat crime and protect federal facilities, while critics and local officials condemn the moves as a dangerous abuse of power. These deployments have sparked legal challenges from states and cities, with federal judges in Illinois and Oregon temporarily blocking the federalization of their Guard units. The actions have created significant tension between federal and state governments, raising constitutional questions about the domestic use of military forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, Social Security Administration employees are unable to provide benefit verification letters, a crucial service for recipients needing to prove their income for housing, fuel assistance, and other aid. While the agency continues to disburse payments and letters are available online, many elderly and disabled beneficiaries lack the technical skills to access them, creating significant hardship. Union representatives report that a majority of calls are from distressed individuals who risk losing essential services or even their homes without this documentation.

This development leaves the LDP without a majority in parliament just days before a vote to select the next prime minister.

This approach mirrors strategies previously used in Italy, with figures like the governor of the Banque de France being suggested for the role. However, the idea faces skepticism due to the French public's deep political engagement, which may resist a government of unelected experts making tough economic decisions.</p>

Labeled with the KCCB coat of arms, the move is intended to uphold the regulations of Canon Law regarding the quality of items used in the Eucharist.

          <h2>JP Morgan Mandates Biometric Data for Access to New York Headquarters</h2>

          <p>JP Morgan Chase is now requiring employees at its new multibillion-dollar headquarters in New York to share their biometric data, such as fingerprints or eye scans, to access the building. This marks a shift from the bank's previous plan for voluntary enrollment and is being implemented to enhance security at the new skyscraper. While exemptions exist for some staff, the move has raised concerns amid a broader debate over workplace surveillance and technology used to track employees. The bank states the system is similar to secure consumer technologies like Apple's Face ID, where the company does not have direct access to the raw biometric data.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has announced plans to accelerate the development of a multi-layered air defense system known as "T-Dome" to counter increasing military threats from China. During Taiwan's National Day celebrations, Lai pledged to increase defense spending to over 3% of GDP next year, aiming for 5% by 2030, to build a robust deterrent. He called on Beijing to renounce the use of force and coercion, emphasizing Taiwan's commitment to maintaining peace through strength. China's Foreign Ministry responded by stating that Taiwan's pursuit of independence through force would lead to conflict.</p>

          <p>Former French finance minister Eric Lombard has declared that "free trade is over, it is dead," blaming the United States and China for dismantling the global system with protectionist policies. Speaking at a summit in Paris, Lombard argued that Europe must adopt a more "nationalistic" and assertive trade policy to protect itself from Chinese dumping and American tariffs. He warned that without tougher measures, European industries risk disappearing in what he described as a new, more brutal global economic environment. His comments reflect a growing sentiment in Europe for a strategic shift away from traditional free-trade principles.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted overwhelmingly to impeach and remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her administration's failure to control a severe national crime wave. The decision came swiftly after Boluarte did not appear before lawmakers to defend herself against the charges of "moral incapacity." This marks the culmination of her deeply unpopular presidency, which began in December 2022 and was plagued by protests and scandals. The president of Congress, José Jerí, was immediately sworn in as interim president, promising to lead a transitional government until the scheduled elections in April.</p>

          <p>A recent exhibition of ancient Egyptian artifacts at the Shanghai Museum has become a focal point for a growing movement in China that questions the authenticity of Western-centric world history. Chinese academics and online commentators are challenging the legitimacy of historical treasures from civilizations like ancient Egypt and Greece, suggesting they may be 19th-century forgeries created to support a Eurocentric worldview. This skepticism, exemplified by a retired professor questioning a pair of grass sandals from the exhibit, reflects a broader cultural and nationalistic trend in China. This movement aims to re-evaluate historical narratives and elevate China's own civilizational achievements.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone attacks have caused significant power and water disruptions across large areas of Kyiv, injuring at least nine people. The strikes are part of a recent escalation by Moscow targeting Ukraine's energy facilities as colder weather approaches. In a separate attack in the Zaporizhzhia region, a seven-year-old child was killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks as "cynical and calculated" and called on international allies to provide more air defense systems and take decisive action to counter Russia's strategy of crippling the country's essential infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a bipartisan measure aimed at curbing the export of advanced artificial intelligence chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD to China and other foreign adversaries. The legislation, part of the annual defense policy bill, is designed to bolster American competitiveness in critical technologies and address national security concerns. However, the bill has faced criticism from some tech industry leaders, who argue that such restrictions could stifle innovation and competition. The future of the measure remains uncertain as it moves through the legislative process, but it signals a continued effort in Washington to limit China's access to cutting-edge technology.

          <p>A strong 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the southern Philippines, resulting in at least two fatalities and causing significant damage to infrastructure, including a hospital and schools. The quake, which occurred at a shallow depth, prompted a tsunami warning and led to the evacuation of coastal communities, though the warning was later canceled. Widespread power outages were reported, and residents described intense ground shaking that caused panic. This event is the latest natural disaster to hit the Philippines, a country still recovering from a recent deadly earthquake and frequent typhoons.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James, a prominent Democratic critic of Donald Trump, has been indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements. The indictment, brought by a newly appointed U.S. attorney in Virginia, alleges that James misrepresented the intended use of a home she purchased in 2020 to secure more favorable loan terms. Ms. James has vehemently denied the charges, calling them a baseless act of political retribution and a "desperate weaponization" of the justice system by the Trump administration.

          <p>Reports of tech leaders like Mark Zuckerberg building elaborate, self-sufficient underground shelters are fueling speculation that some of Silicon Valley's wealthiest are preparing for a global catastrophe. While some deny these projects are doomsday bunkers, the trend aligns with growing concerns within the tech elite about existential risks, including the rapid advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Figures like OpenAI's co-founder have reportedly discussed the need for such shelters before releasing human-level AI, highlighting a paradox where creators of powerful technologies also fear their potential consequences. This preparation raises questions about whether their concerns are prescient warnings or simply anxieties of the ultra-rich.</p>

          <p>England's higher education watchdog, the Office for Students (OfS), has warned that universities could face sanctions if they fail to protect Jewish students from harassment and discrimination during pro-Palestinian protests. The OfS's free speech director emphasized that freedom of expression does not permit intimidation and that the regulator is prepared to act, with powers to issue fines or revoke degree-awarding abilities. The warning follows a series of campus protests on the anniversary of the October 7 Hamas attack, which raised concerns about rising antisemitism. The OfS is also prepared to act against universities that fail to protect academics from intimidation by foreign governments.</p>
