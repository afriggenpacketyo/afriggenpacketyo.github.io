        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Sean "Diddy" Combs in his sexual assault and racketeering conspiracy trial after calling 34 witnesses over 28 days. The prosecution aimed to demonstrate that Combs used his wealth and influence to coerce women into unwanted sexual acts, running a criminal enterprise to protect his reputation. Witnesses included former girlfriends who testified about forced participation in orgies and assistants who described catering to Combs' alleged criminal activities. The defense plans to rest its case without calling any witnesses, arguing that any sexual acts were consensual and that Combs is a "complicated man" but not a criminal mastermind. The case began with a civil suit filed by singer Cassie Ventura, which was quickly settled, prompting federal authorities to investigate further. Jurors saw security footage of Combs assaulting Ventura, which he apologized for, attributing it to drug addiction and jealousy. The defense has attempted to portray the relationships as consensual and adult choices, but the prosecution has focused on violence, coercion, and threats to maintain silence. The prosecution is aiming to prove that Combs ran a criminal enterprise under the guise of his business empire, relying on employees to commit crimes and enforce loyalty. The defense will present its closing arguments on Thursday.</p>

          <h2>Comparing the Costs of Home Equity Loans and Personal Loans in June 2025.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article compares the costs of borrowing $50,000 using a home equity loan versus a personal loan in June 2025. Home equity loans typically have lower interest rates due to the home serving as collateral, but personal loans don't require using the home as a funding source. The median personal loan interest rate is 12.65%, while the average home equity loan interest rate is 8.25% for a five-year loan. A $50,000 home equity loan at 8.25% would cost $1,019.81 per month, while a personal loan at 12.65% would cost $1,128.72 per month, making the home equity loan about $109 cheaper monthly and $6,540 cheaper over five years. The article also touches on HELOCs, noting they also use the home as collateral but typically have variable rates, making long-term budgeting difficult. Borrowers should ensure that the purpose of the loan is advantageous to ensure that it works for their financial goals both now and into the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California ports are seeing a surge in freight containers from China as shippers rush to beat a potential tariff increase, with President Trump having set an August 12 deadline for a U.S.-China trade deal. Vessel tracking services indicate a rise in ship arrivals at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, reaching the highest levels since January 2025. Despite the increase, officials do not anticipate congestion at West Coast ports due to recent softness in container traffic. Terminals at the Port of Long Beach are operating at about 60 percent capacity, while those at the Port of Los Angeles are at 70 percent. The rise in containers is expected to benefit trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies, as vessels are now arriving full.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned the Gaza aid distribution system, calling it a "death trap," after at least 46 people waiting for aid were reportedly killed by Israeli fire in two separate incidents. The incidents occurred near sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by the US and Israel. Witnesses reported that Israeli tanks opened fire on civilians waiting for aid north of Rafah. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the details are under review, while also claiming they are not aware of the incident in question at the Rafah aid distribution site. The UN human rights office criticized Israel's militarized humanitarian assistance mechanism, stating that weaponizing food for civilians constitutes a war crime. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) described the mechanism as an abomination that humiliates desperate people, leading to more deaths than it saves. The IDF maintains that it allows the GHF to operate independently and is working to ensure safe distribution in accordance with international law.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has criticized the Trump administration's postponement of a classified briefing on the Iran-Israel conflict, calling it "outrageous," "evasive," and "derelict." The House's classified briefing was also postponed, leading to demands for an explanation from lawmakers. The briefings were set to include officials from the Department of State, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and DNI Tulsi Gabbard. Schumer suggested the postponement was to allow Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, who are at a NATO conference, to attend. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie is considering pulling a bipartisan War Powers Resolution to rebuke the president's decision to launch strikes, especially if the ceasefire holds. President Trump announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, but expressed anger at both for violating the agreement shortly after it began.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are set to marry in Italy this week, hosting a three-day celebration in Venice. The wedding is expected to cost between $64 million and $76 million, with most provisions sourced from Venetian vendors. The guest list includes approximately 200 people, with celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Ivanka Trump expected to attend. Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's welcoming wealthy tourists while residents' needs are unmet, leading to protests against the wedding. Activists have unfurled banners criticizing Bezos for renting Venice and not paying enough taxes, with the "No Space for Bezos" campaign gaining traction. Venetian officials have defended their decision, stating that the event will not disrupt daily life.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how heat waves are often overlooked as disasters compared to events like hurricanes, despite their potential for fatalities. This week, nearly three-quarters of America's population experienced temperatures of at least 90 degrees, yet these events lack the memorable impact of named storms. Some organizations propose naming heat waves to increase public awareness and encourage safety measures, similar to how tropical storms are labeled. In 2022, Seville, Spain, piloted this idea, naming a heat wave Zoe, which reportedly led to increased heat-safety behaviors among residents. Implementing such a system in the United States would be challenging due to the frequency and varying intensity of heat waves across different regions, but it may provide a way to make these events more conspicuous.</p>

Tsikhanouski urged US President Donald Trump to help free the remaining 1,100 political prisoners in Belarus, stating that a single powerful statement could make a difference. He intends to reactivate his YouTube channel and publish files from his criminal proceedings, but has no ambitions to lead the Belarusian opposition in exile. Tsikhanouski believes the future of Belarus is linked to the collapse of the Putin regime and his wife Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya pledges to continue her fight until all political prisoners are freed and democratic elections are held.</p>

Despite the sale, Huang still owns over 800 million Nvidia shares, placing his net worth at approximately $126 billion. The company's stock has surged over 800% since December 2022, driven by the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence development.
