          <p>In a recent episode of ‚ÄúThe Ezra Klein Show,‚Äù Emma Ashford, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center, discusses the evolution of Donald Trump's foreign policy during his second term as president. The conversation addresses the shift in focus from international conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine to domestic issues, as well as Trump's evolving stance on foreign policy. Ashford provides a realist perspective, exploring the motivations behind Trump's ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù approach and evaluating its potential effectiveness.

The Crimea Bridge is a key strategic asset for Russia, and Ukraine's repeated attacks underscore its determination to disrupt Russian supply lines and infrastructure.

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported the deaths of three soldiers from Israel‚Äôs Givati Brigade who were operating in Gaza. Staff Sgts.

          <p>Portuguese and German authorities have initiated a new search for Madeleine McCann in Portugal, nearly two decades after her disappearance. Madeleine was three years old when she vanished from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in the Algarve during a family holiday on 3 May 2007. The search, spanning 21 plots of land, focuses on areas between the resort where Madeleine disappeared and where the prime suspect, Christian Br√ºckner, was staying at the time. Br√ºckner is currently serving a sentence in Germany for a separate sexual assault crime and is considered a formal suspect in Madeleine's disappearance, though he denies any involvement.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicts a sharp economic slowdown in the U.S., with GDP growth sliding to 1.6% in 2025 and 1.5% next year, down from 2.8% last year. The report attributes this slowdown primarily to the Trump administration's tariffs, which have increased the effective tariff rate to 15.4%, the highest since 1938. These tariffs are expected to cause inflation to spike, reaching 3.9% by the end of 2025, as costs are passed onto consumers. The OECD also warns of downside risks, including policy uncertainty and financial market corrections (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a marine fungus that shows promise in breaking down polypropylene, a common plastic used in food packaging and automobile parts. A team at the University of Sydney found that a terrestrial fungus could degrade polypropylene by 21% after 30 days, and this new marine-derived fungus may exceed that rate. The process involves pretreating the plastic with heat or UV light and then combining it with the fungus in a liquid solution. Researchers are working to optimize the process for industrial scaling, though they caution that it is not a complete solution to the plastic waste crisis.</p>

          <p>A 17-year-old TikTok star, Sana Yousaf, was shot dead in Islamabad, Pakistan, by a 22-year-old man after she repeatedly rejected his advances online. Police arrested the suspect, who they say spent hours loitering outside her home before the murder. Yousaf had over 800,000 followers on TikTok, where she posted lip-sync videos and beauty tips. Violence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting marriage proposals are not uncommon.</p>

          <p>Wildlife advocates are criticizing a proposal for a three-week bear hunt in Florida, which could result in the slaughter of almost 200 black bears. Opponents call it a trophy hunt based on bloodlust, not science, that would reintroduce outlawed practices including bear baiting and chasing with dogs. They argue that the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission (FWC) is using outdated data to justify the hunt, while falsely insisting the killings are necessary for conservation. The FWC claims the hunt is required due to a finite amount of suitable bear habitat, but critics argue it is driven by powerful interests seeking to limit the bear population.</p>

          <p>Male beauty standards are evolving towards hypermasculinity, influenced by the manosphere and incel-adjacent spaces, with a focus on impressing other men rather than appealing to women. Trends like shaving off eyelashes and tongue exercises to achieve a square jaw are becoming more prevalent. This shift reflects a growing divide between what men consider admirable and what women find attractive, exacerbated by misogynistic influencers who promote the dominance and supremacy of men. Ironically, the pursuit of these standards is leading to body dysmorphia among young men, mirroring the struggles faced by young women.</p>
