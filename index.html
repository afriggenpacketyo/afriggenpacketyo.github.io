          <p>Thousands participated in "No Kings" rallies across major US cities, including New York and Washington D.C., protesting President Trump's policies and perceived expansion of presidential power. Demonstrators voiced concerns about American democracy, holding signs like "Democracy not Monarchy" and criticizing the administration's use of executive orders and calls to prosecute perceived enemies. Despite accusations from Trump allies of links to the far-left Antifa movement, organizers emphasized the peaceful nature of the events, which saw significant participation from Democratic politicians like Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders. Police reported no protest-related arrests in New York City, where over 100,000 people gathered, highlighting the widespread public sentiment.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has accused the United States of conducting "long-term, highly covert, and state-level cyberespionage" against its National Time Centre. This critical facility, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is responsible for generating and distributing China’s standard time. It also provides highly precise timing services essential for the country's communications, finance, power, transport, mapping, and defense sectors. The accusation highlights escalating cyber tensions between the two global powers, with China asserting these attacks employed sophisticated state-level cyberespionage tools. The US embassy in China did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding these serious allegations.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" following a US strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine, which President Trump claimed was loaded with fentanyl and other illegal narcotics. Petro asserted the Colombian vessel was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure when it was struck, demanding explanations from the US government. While two survivors were returned to Ecuador and Colombia for prosecution, at least 27 people died in five prior US boat strikes in the Caribbean. UN human rights experts have labeled these strikes "extrajudicial executions," escalating regional tensions over drug interdiction efforts, with Trump defending the actions as necessary to stem drug flow.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago issued an unusual security warning, advising Americans to avoid government facilities due to heightened tensions between the US and Venezuela. This alert follows deadly US strikes in Caribbean waters targeting suspected drug traffickers, with local authorities confirming threats linked to these ongoing regional conflicts. The warning came ahead of a holiday weekend, urging awareness of surroundings and prompting Trinidad and Tobago to implement security measures in response to the reported threats. The situation underscores the precarious security environment stemming from US anti-drug operations, which have resulted in at least 29 deaths, and Venezuela's accusations of US attempts to make it an "American colony."</p>

          <p>Liverpool is experiencing significant challenges following Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid, despite substantial summer investments in new talent. This article analyzes how his absence has impacted the team's ability to bypass high defensive presses and execute effective long passes, skills where his two-footed ability and tactical positioning were crucial. Tactical compromises, such as deploying midfielder Florian Wirtz deeper, are now necessary to bring the ball upfield, potentially hindering his individual attacking prowess. This shift has contributed to three consecutive losses for the club, raising questions about Liverpool's squad balance and vulnerability ahead of their upcoming match against Manchester United, as opponents may exploit these new frailties.</p>

          <p>Companies like Accenture, Salesforce, and Klarna are citing AI as the reason for recent job cuts, but critics argue this is often a "scapegoat" for overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic or other business challenges. Experts, including Fabian Stephany from the Oxford Internet Institute, suggest that while AI adoption is occurring, mass technological unemployment isn't yet evident, with U.S. labor market data showing minimal disruption. Some firms may be using AI to appear innovative while concealing other reasons for downsizing, thereby feeding public fears about job displacement. The article highlights the need for greater corporate transparency regarding AI implementation and its true impact on the workforce, rather than using it as a convenient excuse.</p>

          <p>Royal biographer Andrew Lownie has criticized Buckingham Palace's handling of Prince Andrew's decision to stop using his royal titles, calling it "window dressing" that fails to address the full scope of his alleged involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. Lownie argues the King should have been firmer, fully removing Andrew's titles, evicting him from Royal Lodge, and compelling his cooperation with authorities to uncover the full extent of his dealings. He suggests the palace is worried about new, more damaging allegations emerging from the United States and that Andrew's continued denial of wrongdoing, without apology to victims, undermines the gesture, which Lownie believes was driven by government pressure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why sexual desire often decreases in long-term relationships, attributing the shift to evolving hormone levels, from passion-inducing to bonding hormones like oxytocin. Psychologist Andrea Seiferth emphasizes open communication about sexual needs and understanding one's own sexuality. Research by Meredith Chivers highlights differences in female sexuality, noting physical arousal can occur without psychological desire, potentially due to societal factors and experiences of sexual assault. The article stresses the importance of affection, emotional connection, and making time for intimacy to maintain sexual and relationship satisfaction, rather than viewing sex as a "must." It also notes that unmet sexual needs can lead to distress and suppressed libido, particularly for women, and that post-sex affection strengthens bonds.</p>

The poll also suggests a close contest for next year's midterm elections, with 44% favoring Democrats and 43% favoring Republicans on the generic congressional ballot. Voters' attitudes are potentially influenced more by the economy, which many see as heading in the wrong direction, than by "threats to democracy." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US State Department has received "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an "imminent" attack on civilians in Gaza, which it warns would constitute a "direct and grave" violation of the ceasefire agreement. Washington informed other guarantor nations—Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey—and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the terms, threatening protective measures if the attack proceeds. This alert emerges amidst the first phase of the ceasefire, which has seen hostages released and Palestinian prisoners freed. The article also mentions President Trump's previous warnings to Hamas against killing civilians, and notes a deadly Israeli tank shell incident and ongoing disputes over the Rafah border crossing, highlighting the fragility of the peace.</p>

          <p>AMIES Technology, a new Chinese lithography equipment manufacturer, offers renewed optimism for China's ambition to reduce its dependence on Dutch giant ASML in chipmaking. A spin-off from the state-owned Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE), AMIES aims for faster commercialization of advanced lithography tools, a critical bottleneck due to US export controls. While SMEE excels in back-end semiconductor processes, China still lags significantly in front-end wafer fabrication, with its most reliable production-grade tools supporting around 90-nanometer nodes. This article highlights AMIES's role in advancing China's domestic chipmaking capabilities, as the nation strives to overcome foreign technology restrictions.</p>

          <p>China's major airlines, including China Eastern, Air China, and China Southern, are increasingly offering free Wi-fi on domestic flights in an effort to win back business travelers. These travelers often prefer high-speed trains for inter-city commutes due to convenience. China Eastern recently launched a free "basic" service on all its widebody aircraft across 37 major routes, including Beijing and Shanghai, enabling passengers to "work from the air." This initiative reflects a growing competitive strategy by airlines to enhance the travel experience and compete with the nation's extensive and efficient high-speed rail network, following positive customer feedback from initial tests.</p>

This article highlights McLaren's recent dip in form and Verstappen's relentless pursuit, eroding nearly half of Piastri's previous advantage in just three races. The championship climax is expected to be "brutal," with McLaren acknowledging Verstappen's potent competitiveness and speed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it has "credible reports" indicating an "imminent ceasefire violation by Hamas against the people of Gaza," warning of a potential attack on Palestinian civilians. No specific details were provided, but the US informed guarantor nations of the Gaza peace agreement. This article details a CBS News video showing armed Hamas fighters executing Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, a "long pattern of punishment" according to Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin. President Trump also acknowledged Hamas targeting "very bad gangs," adding complexity to the group's future role in Gaza and raising questions about its commitment to the ceasefire and governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hamas transferred the bodies of two more possible hostages to Israel, as confirmed by the IDF and Prime Minister Netanyahu's office, bringing the total recovered remains to at least 10 confirmed, with 16 still unaccounted for. This action is part of a US-brokered ceasefire agreement involving hostage releases and prisoner exchanges, with Israel having released many Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Tensions persist, however, as Netanyahu's office announced the critical Rafah border crossing would remain closed until Hamas fulfills its part of the agreement, a move Hamas called a "blatant violation." The US also issued a separate warning about a potential Hamas attack on Palestinian civilians, highlighting the ceasefire's fragility.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted former Republican Congressman George Santos' prison sentence for fraud, leading to his immediate release, citing that Santos was "horribly mistreated" in solitary confinement. Santos, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, was serving an 87-month sentence and ordered to pay $373,949.97 in fines and restitution, which he will no longer have to do. Santos expressed gratitude for a "second chance" and plans to focus on prison reform and accountability, while critics like Congressman Nick LaLota condemned the commutation as politically influenced and insufficient punishment for his extensive crimes. Santos' attorney thanked several Republican figures for their advocacy in this article.</p>
