          <p>An opinion article reflects on the Nanking massacre's lasting significance as a powerful cultural and political symbol in China. The author notes how recent films about the event are introducing a younger generation to a historical trauma that continues to shape the nation's identity and foreign policy. For many Chinese people, the massacre is described not just as a historical tragedy but as a profound moral wound, one they feel has not been adequately acknowledged or atoned for by the Japanese government. The piece conveys a deep sense of historical grievance and unresolved pain.</p>

          <p>The wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran has been released from ICE detention after being held for two months in Louisiana. The 25-year-old mother of two was detained in May during a green card application interview, an event her husband described as a betrayal. Her detention occurred while she was still breastfeeding their infant daughter, and her case highlights the Trump administration's stricter immigration enforcement policies, which have increased arrests by over 120% compared to the previous administration. While released on bond with an ankle monitor, she still faces a lengthy immigration court process.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly scuttled negotiations between Senate Republicans and Democrats aimed at confirming a block of his nominees. In a social media post, Trump characterized Democratic demands for over a billion dollars in funding as "political extortion" and told Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL." The collapse of the deal meant that instead of potentially confirming up to 60 non-controversial nominees, the Senate only approved seven before leaving for its recess. Both parties blamed each other for the failure, with Democrats citing withheld funds and Republicans accusing Democrats of escalating their demands.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and staunch ally of President Trump, to the position of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation passed with a 50-45 vote, formalizing her role after she had been serving in an acting capacity since May. This powerful position oversees the prosecution of both federal and local crimes in the nation's capital. Her nomination followed the collapse of a previous nominee, Edward Martin, who faced opposition due to his advocacy related to the January 6th Capitol riot.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of the Special Counsel, an independent federal agency, has launched an investigation into Jack Smith, the former special counsel who led probes into Donald Trump. The inquiry centers on potential violations of the Hatch Act, which limits the political activities of federal employees. This action follows a request from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's efforts to expedite trials against Trump before the 2024 election constituted illegal political interference. Both criminal cases against Trump were closed following his reelection, and Smith resigned from his post in January.</p>

The scheme allegedly involved inflating the prices of state contracts for drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, a critical issue for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union. The arrests followed the recent restoration of independence for the country's anti-corruption bodies after a public backlash against a government bill that sought to limit their power.</p>

          <h2>Historical Mystery of Winston Churchill's Dead Platypus Finally Solved</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift intended to curry favour during World War Two. While popular legend claimed the creature died from shell-shock after an encounter with a German U-boat, newly examined archival records suggest a different cause. Logbooks from the ship's attendant show that as the vessel crossed the equator, water and air temperatures rose well above the safe threshold for the species, essentially meaning the platypus likely died from heat exposure.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a new criminal offense to target individuals who use the internet to advertise or promote illegal Channel crossings. The proposed law, part of a broader bill, could result in up to five years in prison for those creating online material that facilitates breaches of UK immigration law, such as advertising fake passports or illegal work. This move comes as the number of migrants arriving via small boats has reached a record high for the year. The Home Office reports that approximately 80% of these migrants used social media to contact agents linked to people-smuggling gangs.</p>

          <p>On the anniversary of the killer's arrest, an article revisits the stories of two survivors of the "Son of Sam" shooting spree that terrorized New York City in 1976-77. Robert Violante, who was shot on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz, was left permanently blind while Moskowitz died from her injuries. Carl Denaro, another victim, survived a head wound months earlier before the police had even identified a serial killer was at work. Both men, now retired, reflect on how their lives were irrevocably shattered by the attacks and their relief when postal worker David Berkowitz was finally captured.</p>

          <p>The global TikTok trend surrounding Labubu dolls is being exploited by criminals producing and selling dangerous counterfeit versions. Trading Standards officers in the UK have seized thousands of fake dolls, which pose a significant choking hazard to children as their parts, such as eyes and limbs, easily detach. Authorities warn that these fakes, often made with inferior or toxic materials, are flooding the market to meet overwhelming demand driven by social media. The genuine dolls are so popular that they sell out in seconds online, creating a lucrative market for both scalpers and counterfeiters.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following clashes between anti-migrant groups and counter-demonstrators outside hotels used to house asylum seekers. Protests took place in London, Newcastle, and Manchester, with police making arrests for public order offenses. The demonstrations highlight ongoing tensions regarding the UK's asylum system. In response to the situation, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process this autumn, aiming to reduce the number of people housed in hotels, which the government plans to phase out entirely by 2029 to cut costs.</p>

          <p>Rangers head coach Russell Martin has publicly criticized his players' mentality, effort, and ego following a disappointing 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their first league match of the season. Martin stated his team was "lucky to get a point" and lambasted what he called a "mentality problem" rather than a tactical one. He specifically called out two unnamed players for wanting to "do what they want to do" and urged some on his team to "drop their ego." The harsh public comments after just one game surprised pundits and signaled significant issues within the squad.</p>
