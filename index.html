          <p>As of early October 2025, the price of gold is approximately $3,893 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, attracting investors during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. The article explains that its value is influenced by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and central bank policies, making it a historically stable but short-term volatile commodity.

          <p>Amid a federal government shutdown, Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio has introduced the SHUTDOWN Act, a bill aimed at penalizing members of Congress by imposing a new tax on their salaries. Unlike other federal employees, lawmakers are constitutionally guaranteed to be paid during a shutdown. Moreno's proposal seeks to circumvent this by creating a daily tax that increases the longer the shutdown continues while Congress is in session, intending to pressure legislators to resolve funding disputes and reopen the government.</p>

          <p>Grocery stores across the U.S., including Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, are increasingly replacing paper price tags with electronic shelf labels. This technology allows for rapid, centralized price updates, which retailers claim improves efficiency and helps manage inventory for perishable goods. However, some lawmakers and consumer advocates express concern that these digital tags could enable "dynamic pricing," where prices surge during peak demand, sparking a debate over the technology's potential impact on consumers.</p>

          <p>At Italian Tech Week, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos described the current excitement around artificial intelligence as an "industrial bubble," where stock prices and investments are often disconnected from business fundamentals. He noted that during such periods, both good and bad ideas receive funding, but emphasized that the underlying technology is real and will ultimately bring transformative benefits to society. Bezos compared it to past bubbles, like the dot-com era, suggesting that while many companies may fail, the period will spur significant and lasting innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's cyberspace regulator has initiated a two-month "clean-up" campaign aimed at curbing online content that it deems incites "negative and pessimistic emotions." The crackdown targets a wide range of behaviors, including discussions that frame hard work as useless, content that sells "anxiety-inducing" courses, and posts that link social issues to identity or gender. Analysts note this campaign is distinct from previous censorship efforts as it specifically focuses on managing public sentiment and places direct responsibility on internet companies like Weibo to enforce the new restrictions.</p>

          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the investment "winter" for property technology appears to be over, citing recent successful IPOs and new unicorns in the sector. However, he notes that climate-related property tech is facing significant headwinds due to a negative shift in political sentiment away from sustainability and ESG initiatives. Despite this, Wallace remains optimistic about the long-term viability of climate tech, as local governments continue to pursue decarbonization goals, creating investment opportunities while valuations are currently attractive.

          <p>A new report from the EAT-Lancet Commission concludes that even with a full transition away from fossil fuels, emissions from the global food system will push temperatures past the critical 1.5°C threshold. The research body states the most effective solution is for people in wealthier countries to adopt more plant-based diets and significantly reduce their consumption of meat and dairy. This dietary shift, combined with reducing food waste, could cut food system emissions by more than half and prevent millions of premature deaths annually, according to the comprehensive study.</p>

Authorities are now trying to piece together how she ended up in Hollywood and her connection to the 20-year-old musician, who they say is cooperating with the investigation.

          <p>Vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes have been spared from the Trump administration's recent rollback of the "de minimis" exemption, which now applies tariffs to many imported goods valued under $800. The protection comes from the Berman Amendment, a Cold War-era law that prevents the regulation of "informational materials." This exemption is a relief for the booming vinyl industry and fans, as it prevents a potential price surge for records, which are largely manufactured overseas, and supports a rapidly growing segment of the music market.</p>

          <p>A growing number of recent college graduates in the U.S. are struggling to find full-time employment, challenging the long-held promise that a bachelor's degree provides a reliable path to a white-collar career. Data shows the unemployment rate for "new entrants" to the workforce has hit a nine-year high, with the gap between degree-holders and high school graduates narrowing significantly. This trend is attributed to a "low-hiring" environment, an oversupply of graduates, and concerns that AI may automate many entry-level roles, causing stress for young job seekers.</p>

          <p>An investigation by DW and De Groene Amsterdammer indicates that conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have likely been used in Volkswagen's electric vehicles. The report identified at least six smelters in VW's supply chain that have been linked to the trade of "3TG" minerals (tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold), which helps fund violent conflict in the region. While VW stated it cannot confirm or rule out the connection due to supply chain complexity, the findings highlight the challenges the auto industry faces in ensuring ethically sourced materials for the EV transition.</p>
