          <p>President Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the beginning of his four-day tour through the Gulf, his first major overseas trip of his second term, where he aims to secure business deals worth over $1 trillion. The trip includes stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, with expectations of lavish hospitality similar to his 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia. The deals are anticipated to involve investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and significant arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. The trip coincides with scrutiny over Trump family's financial interests, including pending real estate and cryptocurrency deals with Saudi-owned firms and the UAE, as well as a luxury Boeing 747-8 donation from Qatar for use as Air Force One. Trump maintains the plane will be retired as an exhibit in his library.</p>

          <p>Honda's fourth-quarter earnings revealed a 76% plunge in operating profit, falling short of expectations as the company braces for the impact of U.S. tariffs. Revenue for the financial year ended in March rose by 6.2% to 21.69 trillion yen, but operating profit declined by 12.2% to 1.21 trillion yen. The company had previously decided to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. to avoid potential tariffs. Amidst these challenges, discussions of a potential $60 billion merger with Nissan were terminated earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market continues to weaken, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% in the January to March period. The number of employees on company payrolls fell, and job vacancies also declined. Wage growth slowed but remains relatively strong, creating a tricky situation for the Bank of England regarding future interest rate cuts.

          <p>Cities worldwide are exploring public transportation to combat air pollution and traffic congestion, as cars contribute significantly to carbon emissions and road accidents.

Behavioral scientists suggest that addressing the psychological aspects of car ownership, such as status and comfort, is crucial.

Critics raise ethical concerns about accepting such a gift from a foreign nation, particularly one with ties to groups that have harmed U.S. service members. Trump also announced a 90-day agreement with China to reduce tariffs and a cease-fire between India and Pakistan.</p>

Experts believe China's pain threshold is higher than the U.S., but its top-down innovation model faces inefficiencies and structural imbalances.
