          <p>President Trump is scheduled to speak with Russian President Putin to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and discuss trade.

          <p>This article argues that Republican childcare policies, including cuts to Head Start and proposed eliminations of tax credits, are aimed at pushing women out of the workforce. The author contends that these policies are based on a sexist view that women are innately inclined to caregiving and should be confined to domestic roles. The article criticizes both right-wing and some left-wing rhetoric that romanticizes traditional gender roles and argues for policies that support women's participation in public life and paid work.</p>

          <p>US advocacy groups are campaigning against Republican proposals to cut Medicaid and Obamacare, potentially leaving millions without health insurance. The House bill proposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, while the White House budget could reshape healthcare and scientific research. Critics argue that work requirements add administrative burdens and fail to improve employment. Health Secretary Kennedy Jr. defended the cuts, stating Medicaid should be for poor children, mothers, and the disabled, while most Medicaid recipients who can work are already employed.</p>

          <p>This article draws a parallel between the U.S.'s historical failure to protect Jewish refugees during the Holocaust and the Trump administration's plans to send migrants to Libya and Rwanda. The author argues that sending migrants to these countries, known for human rights abuses and unsafe conditions, violates international and domestic legal obligations regarding nonrefoulement. The article emphasizes the importance of upholding the refugee protection framework established after World War II and taking a stand against policies that return those fleeing persecution to dangerous situations.</p>
