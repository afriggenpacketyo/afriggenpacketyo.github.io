Trump expressed confidence that China would eventually approve a deal, highlighting his past popularity on the app. The extension allows for continued negotiations to ensure American users can use TikTok with data security assurances.</p>

The changes mean anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically receive the discount, regardless of property size. While debt charities welcome the move, some express concern that the scheme still excludes some vulnerable individuals. The government says any potential bill increases to cover the cost will be offset by savings made by cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt.</p>

While some historians doubt the practice due to a lack of written records, others argue the secrecy surrounding the Underground Railroad explains the absence of documentation.

          <p>Heavy rain, flooding, and a rock slide have once again closed a section of Interstate 40 through the Great Smoky Mountains, disrupting travel between North Carolina and Tennessee. The closure occurred near mile marker 450 in Tennessee, affecting a section already heavily damaged by Hurricane Helene. Crews are working to clear the highway, but a reopening timeline is uncertain. The permanent fix involves stabilizing the road with steel rods and concrete, a process expected to take years.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance on assessing applications for oil and gas projects, requiring operators to consider emissions from burning oil and gas. This move follows a Supreme Court ruling and will affect decisions on controversial fields like Rosebank and Jackdaw. While the government aims to balance environmental impact with economic factors, climate campaigners argue that new developments will not significantly reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The guidance means that oil and gas companies will be forced to come clean over the enormous harm they are causing to the climate.</p>

The research highlights the insurmountable land use and financial challenges of relying on afforestation to balance CO2 emissions. The study suggests that fossil fuel companies lack incentives to reduce extraction and use, and regulatory measures have been slow to materialize.
