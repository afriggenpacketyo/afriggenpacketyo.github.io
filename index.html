          <p>The editorial discusses the market reaction to Donald Trump’s announcement of tariffs and the implications for the UK government. It questions whether Keir Starmer will be able to negotiate a trade deal that reduces or even eliminates the tariffs imposed on British exports to the US. It emphasizes the need to reset the trading relationship with the EU, which remains Britain's biggest and closest trading partner, and to address the impact of a global recession on the chancellor’s fiscal arithmetic.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the viral morning routine of fitness influencer Ashton Hall, questioning its implications for modern masculinity. It suggests that while the routine may appear absurd, it reflects a subtle shift towards a conservative gender philosophy.

          <p>A district court judge awarded over $6 million to four whistleblowers who were fired after reporting Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to the FBI. The judge found that Paxton's office violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by retaliating against the employees. The whistleblowers reported allegations that Paxton was using his office to accept bribes, which Paxton has denied. Paxton called the ruling "ridiculous" and said his office intends to appeal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled dozens of international student visas at California universities, including UCLA, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Berkeley and Stanford. The reasons for the visa revocations are unclear, but the actions have caught school administrators by surprise. The administration accused the students of supporting Hamas, which the U.S. designates as a terrorist organization, and says they are threats to national security and U.S. foreign policy. The students argue that their free speech rights in support of Palestinians are being trampled.</p>
