        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump may extend the upcoming July deadlines for reimposing tariffs on imports from numerous countries. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the deadlines are "not critical," suggesting extensions are possible for nations engaged in good faith negotiations. This potential delay aims to provide more time to finalize trade agreements, of which only two frameworks with China and the UK have been established so far. The remarks provided a temporary boost to stock markets, signaling a less rigid approach to the administration's trade policy.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in fashion for over three decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at American Vogue. While she will continue in her broader roles as Vogue's global editorial director and CondÃ© Nast's chief content officer, the U.S. publication will hire a new head of editorial content. This structural change, announced by the 75-year-old magnate, aligns the U.S. edition with other global Vogue markets. Wintour's move allows her to focus on her global and corporate responsibilities, marking a significant transition for the iconic magazine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent gradual rise, interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) could potentially decrease during the summer based on key economic events. The article identifies three dates that could trigger a drop: the release of the June inflation report on July 15, and the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. A decline in inflation or a formal rate cut by the Fed could lead to lower HELOC rates for borrowers. The analysis suggests homeowners should monitor these dates for potential relief in borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recently appointed CDC advisory committee has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal, despite scientific consensus that it is safe. The 5-1 vote followed a presentation by a vaccine skeptic and drew sharp criticism from some medical experts on the panel who cited a lack of scientific evidence for the decision. Opponents of the move warned that it could fuel vaccine hesitancy and potentially reduce access to vaccines globally, as thimerosal allows for more affordable multi-dose vials. The decision highlights a contentious shift in the committee's direction under new leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has narrowed the window for migrants to challenge their deportation orders, ruling in a 5-4 decision that a 30-day appeal period begins immediately upon receiving a final removal order. The case involved a Jamaican national, Pierre Riley, whose appeal was deemed too late because it was filed long after his initial order was issued, despite ongoing proceedings. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito affirmed that the law presumes an expeditious process, a stance the dissenting justices called logistically nonsensical. This ruling establishes a more rigid timeline for migrants seeking judicial review.</p>

          <p>In response to the EU's Digital Markets Act and a potential â‚¬500 million fine, Apple has unveiled a new, complicated set of App Store policies for European developers. The changes include a new "core technology commission" and other fees, which some developers will have to pay even for transactions outside the App Store. Critics like Spotify and Epic Games have accused Apple of "malicious compliance," arguing the new rules violate the spirit of the law by making alternatives to Apple's system commercially unviable. The European Commission is currently reviewing Apple's revised terms to determine if they are sufficient to avoid the penalty.</p>

          <p>Following Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, some Republican figures and groups are calling for his U.S. citizenship to be revoked and for him to be deported. The New York Young Republican Club urged the Trump administration to use the 1954 Communist Control Act against Mamdani, a naturalized citizen born in Uganda who identifies as a democratic socialist. These calls, echoed by figures like Rep. Andy Ogles, baselessly link his win to uncontrolled immigration and frame his progressive platform as a threat to the city and nation.</p>

          <p>The upset victory of 33-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York mayoral primary has intensified the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party about its ideological direction. Mamdani's win over the more moderate former Governor Andrew Cuomo is seen by some as a triumph for the party's progressive wing and a call for a new generation of leadership. However, the victory has also drawn concern from moderate Democrats and sharp criticism from Republicans, highlighting the party's internal fractures. The race is now a focal point for whether a progressive, youth-oriented platform represents a viable path forward for Democrats nationally.</p>

Officials stated that euthanasia was a last resort after numerous attempts to haze the bear away from populated areas failed, deeming it a significant public safety risk.

          <p>Indie pop artist MARINA is releasing her sixth album, "Princess of Power," following a difficult period in which she recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome.

Now living in Los Angeles, she has approached the new record with a focus on creating positive, euphoric energy, marking a personal and artistic transformation. The album represents a reclamation of her power after stepping back from her career and finding renewed popularity for her older music on TikTok.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Pew Research Center suggests that President Trump's 2024 election victory would have held even if every eligible American had voted. The analysis of validated voters found that non-voters in 2024 preferred Trump over Kamala Harris, a significant shift from 2020 and 2016 when non-voters favored Democrats. This finding challenges the long-held political assumption that higher turnout automatically benefits the Democratic party. The study also highlighted a shift in Trump's coalition, which became younger and more ethnically diverse compared to previous elections.</p>

          <p>Extreme heat poses a significant and growing threat to transportation infrastructure, according to Arizona State University engineering professor Mikhail Chester. In an interview, he explained how high temperatures can cause materials like asphalt and railway tracks to warp, buckle, or degrade, leading to safety risks and costly repairs. The discussion highlighted the need for infrastructure to be redesigned and retrofitted with more resilient materials to withstand the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves. This challenge requires proactive planning and investment to ensure the reliability of transportation networks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a coordinated effort to defend the recent U.S. strikes on Iran, countering a preliminary intelligence assessment that suggested the bombing's impact was limited.

          <p>A federal vaccine advisory committee, recently overhauled by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has recommended against using flu shots containing the preservative thimerosal. This decision was made despite a preponderance of scientific evidence showing the chemical is safe and its links to autism have been long disproven. The move has alarmed prominent medical groups, who fear it will sow public distrust in vaccines and the scientific process. The committee's focus on this issue is seen by critics as an orchestrated effort to advance a specific, scientifically unsupported agenda.</p>

A paper from Apple researchers, titled "The Illusion of Thinking," found that these models fail to solve problems beyond a certain level of complexity and may be memorizing patterns rather than genuinely reasoning. This potential "jagged intelligence" suggests a significant gap between current AI capabilities and real-world enterprise needs.

          <p>President Trump has escalated his public attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him "terrible" and "a very stupid person," fueling speculation that he may soon name a potential successor. This move is seen as an attempt to influence the central bank's interest rate policy ahead of Powell's term ending in 2026. The political pressure and talk of a "shadow chair" have impacted markets, with traders increasing bets on rate cuts. Potential candidates reportedly being considered include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. (not investment advice)</p>
