          <p>In southwest Madagascar, coral reefs and the fisheries they support are collapsing due to overfishing, climate change, and deforestation, creating a severe humanitarian crisis for coastal communities. Traditional conservation methods, like restricting fishing, have often failed because they neglect the extreme poverty driving environmental exploitation. A new approach is being tested, focusing on building artificial reefs to increase fish populations, thereby treating conservation as a byproduct of a public health and food security intervention.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has arrived in Israel to support the fragile ceasefire with Hamas and encourage negotiations toward a permanent resolution. His visit, along with those of special envoys, follows a recent flare-up of violence that threatened the truce. The U.S. aims to advance the second phase of its peace plan, which includes establishing an interim government in Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas, though Israel has conditioned such talks on the return of all deceased hostages.</p>

          <p>The second Trump administration has intensified its focus on anti-transgender policies, creating a climate of fear that is causing many transgender Americans and their families to prepare to leave the country. Actions have included erasing mentions of trans people from government functions, reinstating the military ban, limiting access to gender-affirming care, and creating obstacles for obtaining passports. This escalation from campaign rhetoric to official policy has made many feel that the country is becoming unlivable for them by design.</p>

          <p>A report from the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank, has proposed the creation of a "Pacific Eyes" intelligence-sharing alliance to offset China's growing security presence in the Pacific Islands. The study argues that such a body could help address institutional gaps in the region that external powers, particularly Beijing, are leveraging for geopolitical competition. The proposal comes as China continues to make unprecedented security inroads, raising concerns among Western allies about stability and influence in the strategically important region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a new round of tariffs on key imports like kitchen cabinets, timber, and wooden furniture, posing another hurdle for the U.S. housing market. Economists warn these levies will increase construction costs, which are already high, potentially slowing new builds and exacerbating affordability issues for homebuyers and renovators. The tariffs add to previous increases on materials like steel and copper, with businesses indicating that the rising costs will increasingly be passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy has become the first former French president to be incarcerated, beginning a five-year sentence for his role in a conspiracy to illegally finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. The 70-year-old former leader, who maintains his innocence, will serve his time in the isolation wing of La Santé prison in Paris. The conviction marks a historic moment in French politics, as no former head of state has been jailed since the World War II era.</p>

Giuffre, who took her own life in April, had settled a lawsuit against Andrew in 2022, and her book has renewed calls from politicians for him to cooperate fully with investigators.</p>

          <p>The rapid construction of power-hungry data centers, fueled by the AI boom, is contributing to rising electricity bills for U.S. households. Energy demand is so high that tech companies are securing power for future facilities that may never be built, creating a "land rush" that inflates today's energy prices. Consumer advocates in Maryland have asked the regional grid operator to halt this speculation, arguing that ordinary customers are unfairly bearing the costs and risks of infrastructure built to support a volatile tech expansion.</p>

          <p>New research shows that black garden ants actively modify the structure of their nests to slow the transmission of a lethal fungus. When exposed to the pathogen, the ants build more compartmentalized and less interconnected nests, with entrances spaced farther apart to reduce interactions. This "architectural immunity," combined with social behaviors like self-isolation, provides an effective defense, offering a fascinating example of how a social species can manipulate its environment to combat epidemics, potentially offering lessons for human public space design.</p>
