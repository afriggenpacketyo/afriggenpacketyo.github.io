          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has commenced radiation and hormone therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, which was diagnosed in May. His spokesperson confirmed the treatment plan, noting the cancer had metastasized but is considered "hormone-sensitive," suggesting a high likelihood of effective management. This follows a successful procedure in September to remove cancerous skin cells, from which his physician stated all cancerous tissue was removed. The radiation treatment is expected to last for five weeks as a new stage in his ongoing care.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting in Leland, Mississippi, has resulted in four fatalities and twelve injuries, with four individuals in critical condition. The incident occurred around midnight on the town's main street during a busy homecoming weekend for the local high school. Mayor John Lee expressed shock over the tragedy in the small, low-crime community, confirming that a police manhunt is underway as no suspects are in custody. A separate deadly shooting also took place during a homecoming event in another Mississippi town, though there is no indication the two events are connected.</p>

The Civil Guard reported finding the deceased animals in various stages of decomposition alongside 171 surviving animals in life-threatening conditions, some of whom were feeding on the dead. The rescued animals, including exotic and protected bird species, have been moved to recovery centers. The manager faces charges of animal abuse and illegal possession of protected species.</p>

          <p>Despite having the world's youngest population, Africa features numerous long-serving, elderly leaders, creating a significant political irony. The article highlights figures like Cameroon's 92-year-old Paul Biya, who has ruled for 43 years and is seeking an eighth term, and Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang Nguema, 83. This trend of "third-termism" persists in countries like Ivory Coast and Zimbabwe, often leading to constitutional changes and protests.

          <p>A major explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems military explosives plant in Tennessee has resulted in multiple fatalities and left 18 people unaccounted for. The blast, which occurred Friday morning, completely destroyed one of the buildings on the campus, with the local sheriff describing the scene as one of the most devastating he has ever witnessed. The cause of the explosion is under investigation by multiple federal agencies, including the FBI and ATF. The site remains unstable, with small fires still smoldering, complicating the search and recovery efforts for the missing individuals.</p>

          <p>A potential landmark peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, aimed at ending the war in Gaza, has reportedly been brokered with the help of Donald Trump, who is preparing to visit the Middle East. Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed how Trump's pressure was a key factor in bringing the parties together, particularly influencing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Analysts noted that Netanyahu's reliance on American support made him susceptible to pressure from Trump, marking a significant turning point in the long-standing conflict. The stability and long-term viability of the deal remain key questions.</p>

          <p>Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival, Queen Camilla paid tribute to her late friend, author Dame Jilly Cooper, who passed away at age 88 just days earlier. The Queen shared an affectionate and humorous memory of Dame Jilly's wish to "get so absolutely plastered" at a party. She also revealed that the Vesper Martini, famously James Bond's drink of choice, was a favorite of the author. The tribute was part of a broader outpouring of affection for the beloved novelist from figures like Sir Ian Rankin and Sir Salman Rushdie at the event.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired a 2.5% stake in electrical and infrastructure products manufacturer Atkore and is urging the company's board to explore a sale. Atkore's performance has suffered as post-pandemic demand normalized and an aggressive pricing strategy backfired, leading to declining revenue and a sharp drop in its stock price. The activist's move comes after the unexpected retirement of CEO Bill Waltz, leaving the company at a critical juncture. Irenic argues that a sale to private equity could unlock value more effectively than a standalone restructuring plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With 92-year-old President Paul Biya seeking an eighth term, many young Cameroonians are expressing frustration and apathy ahead of the presidential election. The disqualification of popular opposition candidate Maurice Kamto has led a significant portion of the youth, who make up over half the population, to lose faith in the electoral process. While some young people are becoming more politically engaged, widespread dejection over unemployment, corruption, and the perception of a closed political system may lead to low turnout. This disillusionment poses a challenge for the future of the nation's democracy.</p>

Ndam Njoya has been actively campaigning, including outreach to the Cameroonian diaspora in Europe, and has garnered endorsements from several former presidential candidates.

          <p>This article analyzes how Donald Trump strategically uses appearances at sporting events, particularly combat sports like UFC and professional wrestling, to cultivate a "brawling" political identity. By aligning himself with the machismo and "win-at-all-costs" ethos of these sports, he taps into fan psychology and projects an image of an "Ultimate Fighter." The author argues this presence is more than a distraction; it represents a "MAGA-fication" of sports culture, promoting a more brutish and boundary-breaking sensibility that mirrors his political style. This approach aims to weaken collective adherence to rules in both arenas and politics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown has entered its tenth day with no resolution in sight, as Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a bitter standoff. Democrats are refusing to fund the government until concessions are made on healthcare and other issues, while Republicans accuse them of holding the country hostage. The situation escalated as the White House began laying off thousands of federal workers, a move Democrats decried as "deliberate chaos." With both sides digging in, the legislative trench warfare continues to impact federal agencies and hundreds of thousands of employees nationwide.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters has drawn criticism for bizarrely claiming that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez "wants to sleep with" Trump administration aide Stephen Miller. The comments came after Ocasio-Cortez posted a video mocking Miller, to which Watters responded by praising Miller as a "high-value man" and a "sexual matador." This incident is part of a larger pattern of Watters's on-air adulation for Miller. The author argues that Ocasio-Cortez's mockery effectively exposed the thin skin of MAGA figures, who react defensively to humor and ridicule, as seen in the subsequent on-air response.</p>

          <p>Archbishop Gregory Aymond of New Orleans has testified under oath for the first time in the church's ongoing bankruptcy case, which is tied to a proposed $230 million settlement with clergy abuse survivors. The deposition was conducted under a protective order, barring attendees from discussing its contents. The archdiocese filed for bankruptcy protection in May 2020, a move that halted 34 pending sexual abuse lawsuits and effectively blocked Aymond's previously scheduled testimony in one of those cases. The settlement with claimants is currently awaiting approval, with a vote deadline set for October 29.</p>

Digital evidence revealed the suspect had a fixation on fire and used ChatGPT to generate disturbing, dystopian images of cities burning.

          <p>This article argues that despite Donald Trump's "pro-worker" rhetoric, his administration's policies have negatively impacted American workers. The ongoing government shutdown, which has led to furloughs and mass firings of federal employees, is presented as a key example of this disconnect. Analysts suggest that policies such as broad tariffs, which raise consumer costs, and mass deportations, which create instability in sectors like agriculture, contradict his populist image. The author contends that while Trump cultivates an aesthetic of blue-collar solidarity, his actions ultimately benefit corporations at the expense of ordinary workers.</p>

          <p>This article explores the emotion of regret, suggesting that instead of being a purely negative experience focused on the past, it can be a valuable tool for self-discovery. While looking backward with "what ifs" can be painful, the piece posits that embracing feelings of disappointment or guilt can lead to learning something new about oneself in the present. Regret is described as the "emotional price we pay for free will," an unavoidable consequence of having choices. By reframing the experience, individuals can potentially use it for personal growth rather than simply wallowing in past mistakes.</p>
