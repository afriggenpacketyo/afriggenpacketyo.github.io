          <p>The article explains wave refraction, a phenomenon where waves bend as they pass over varying depths, impacting how waves break.  Concave refraction focuses energy, creating powerful waves like those at Pipeline, while convex refraction defocuses energy, resulting in longer waves at point breaks like J-Bay. The article contrasts refraction with reflection, explaining how both affect wave formation and surfing conditions.</p>
