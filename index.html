          <h2>US Retailer Sam's Club Faces Backlash in China Over a Low-Priced Chocolate Pie</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart-owned Sam's Club, a retailer typically associated with premium, globally-sourced products in China, has sparked controversy among its middle-class members. The introduction of a mass-market, domestically-produced chocolate pie, priced at just 49.9 yuan (US$36.28) for a 48-pack, has led to accusations of brand dilution. Loyal customers, who pay an annual fee for access to curated, high-quality goods, feel the low-cost item undermines the store's premium image. This incident has triggered a broader debate about whether the retailer's quality standards are declining.</p>

          <h2>Many High-Income Americans Report Financial Anxiety and Do Not Feel Wealthy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 06:33:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant portion of Americans earning six-figure salaries, sometimes dubbed "HENRYs" (high earners, not rich yet), report not feeling wealthy despite their income. According to recent surveys and expert analysis, factors like rising living costs, substantial debt, and lifestyle inflation contribute to this sentiment. Many high earners live paycheck to paycheck and experience more financial anxiety than when they earned less. Experts suggest this paradox arises because accumulating wealth requires saving and delayed gratification, which conflicts with the feeling of richness derived from spending.</p>

          <p>A deadly attack on a courthouse in Zahedan, the capital of Iran's Sistan-Baluchistan province, has resulted in at least nine fatalities and over a dozen injuries. Assailants, disguised as visitors, used guns and a grenade to target the building. The deceased include six civilians and three attackers who were killed by security forces. The Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice) has claimed responsibility for the assault. This region, home to the Baloch ethnic minority, frequently experiences conflict between armed groups and Iranian security forces.</p>

There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could involve a 15% baseline tariff, similar to a recent agreement between the U.S. and Japan.

The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related documents.

          <p>Pemiscot Memorial, a vital hospital in Missouri's poorest county, is on the brink of closure due to long-standing financial struggles. The situation is exacerbated by a new Republican-backed bill, championed by President Trump, which mandates the largest-ever funding reduction to Medicaid. Hospital leaders fear these cuts will be devastating, as an estimated 80% of their revenue comes from Medicaid and Medicare. Despite the potential negative impact on healthcare access for their constituents, local Republican lawmakers supported the bill, creating a perilous future for the community's primary medical facility.</p>

          <p>A new study from Keck Medicine of USC reveals a significant increase in serious liver disease among heavy drinkers over the past two decades, even without a rise in overall alcohol consumption. The research found that the proportion of heavy drinkers with advanced liver scarring, or fibrosis, more than doubled from 1.8% to 4.3%. This trend is particularly pronounced in women, older individuals, and people with metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes. Researchers suggest the changing demographics and health profiles of drinkers are contributing factors to this alarming rise in a often-silent disease.</p>

While officials highlight cases of immigrants with severe criminal histories, the majority of those arrested in recent raids have no criminal convictions. The proportion of non-criminal immigrants arrested in the region surged to 69% in June. Critics and researchers argue this demonstrates a disconnect between public messaging and the actual implementation of a broader, quota-driven enforcement strategy that sweeps up ordinary community members.</p>

          <p>An inquest is investigating the tragic deaths of Alphonsine Djiako Leuga and her 18-year-old daughter, Loraine, who had Down's syndrome and lay undiscovered in their Nottingham home for months. The coroner found "missed opportunities" by social care teams to escalate concerns after the family, who was known to services, became isolated. Alphonsine, Loraine's sole carer, died of pneumonia in February 2024 after her gas supply was cut off and a call for an ambulance was wrongly categorized as abandoned. Loraine, who relied entirely on her mother, died weeks later from malnutrition and dehydration.</p>

          <p>The anticipated recovery in the luxury goods market is facing several significant challenges, creating a mixed outlook for the sector. Key headwinds include a sharp drop in sales in Japan due to currency shifts and a rebalancing of tourist spending. While U.S. sales have shown some strength, the looming threat of tariffs may force brands to increase prices. Furthermore, there is a clear divergence in performance across product categories, with jewelry and certain leather goods remaining strong while high-end watches and some fashion lines struggle.

According to observers, these diverging approaches are strengthening China-Africa relations. African nations are increasingly seeing Beijing as a more reliable ally for economic development, challenging long-held U.S. influence on the continent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a large-scale recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). Supporters of the recall are angered by the KMT-led legislative bloc's actions, including blocking a key defense budget and passing controversial reforms seen as favoring China. The outcome could potentially shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. The KMT has condemned the recall as political retaliation, while the elections have intensified tensions over the island's relationship with Beijing.</p>

The article details cases where the medication led to compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, and sexually coercive behavior, tearing families apart. Many patients and their families report they were not adequately warned about the severity of these potential side effects. Critics argue that the language on medication leaflets is too vague and that safety advice needs to be urgently strengthened to reflect the devastating impact.</p>
