          <p>Chimney Rock, North Carolina, is working towards a midsummer reopening to tourists following significant destruction caused by Hurricane Helene last September. The town's mayor, Peter O'Leary, is collaborating with FEMA and a task force to rebuild infrastructure, including water, sewer, and electrical lines. Over 2,000 volunteers are assisting in the recovery, aiming to restore what residents lost during the storm, though some residents believe full recovery could take up to two years. The Department of Transportation is also rebuilding area bridges to facilitate access to the town.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars is implementing an 18 billion Swedish krona cost-cutting plan due to a sharp decline in first-quarter operating profit, which fell from 4.7 billion krona to 1.9 billion krona year-over-year. The company's EBIT margin narrowed, and revenue decreased due to planned inventory reductions and adverse currency effects. The cost-cutting measures include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across global operations, and Volvo Cars is no longer providing financial guidance for 2025 and 2026. Despite these challenges, Volvo aims for electrified cars to represent 90% to 100% of its global sales volume by 2030.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 03:28:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to include milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, potentially impacting 203 milk-based drinks currently exempt. The consultation also proposes reducing the maximum sugar content allowed in drinks before the levy applies, from 5g to 4g per 100ml. While the original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to calcium concerns, the government now believes the health benefits don't justify the harms from excess sugar. The sugar tax has raised £1.9 billion since 2018, and the government aims to incentivize manufacturers to further reduce sugar in their recipes.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is encouraging citizens to revisit Mao Zedong’s essay “On Protracted War” as inspiration during ongoing economic hostilities with the United States. The Beijing Daily suggests that Mao’s commentary on China’s war against Japanese aggression can instill confidence in eventual victory amid the tariff war. This call comes after the Trump administration's tariff plan, which has led to escalating trade tensions between the two countries, with both imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has won Canada's federal election, marking a turnaround fueled by backlash against President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. Carney, a political newcomer, emphasized Canada's economic survival and warned against Trump's intentions, a strategy that resonated with voters. While the Conservatives made significant gains, they fell short of securing a majority, highlighting divisions within Canada, particularly in oil-rich provinces. The results also reflect a collapse of support for the left-wing New Democrats, as Canadians coalesced around the Liberals in response to external pressures.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a victory in the Canadian election, largely attributed to President Trump's actions, which include territorial threats and tariff policies. Trump's behavior caused a reversal in fortune for the center-left party, with Carney focusing on the threat posed by the US. Despite Trump's apparent lack of distaste for Carney compared to Trudeau, Canada is increasingly looking toward Europe as a reliable partner. Carney has pledged to initiate trade negotiations with Trump to avert tariffs on Canadian auto exports.</p>

          <p>Four former Hong Kong lawmakers, Claudia Mo, Gary Fan, Jeremy Tam, and Kwok Ka-ki, have been released from prison after serving over four years on national security charges. They were part of the "Hong Kong 47," arrested for participating in an unofficial primary poll in 2020. Critics argue that the lawsuit was part of a broad assault by Beijing on rights and democracy in the former British colony. The national security law, imposed in 2020, has radically changed Hong Kong's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China’s tech hub, experienced slower GDP growth of 5.2% in the first quarter, falling short of the national average of 5.4%. The city’s exports declined by 8.7% as firms rushed to lock in orders before US President Donald Trump’s rapid-fire tariff increases took effect. The disappointing numbers are attributed to a high baseline set in 2024 and pressures from the tariff war and industrial transition. Obstacles include high costs, insufficient orders, and pressure on foreign trade and exports.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party won Canada's federal election, with Carney vowing to "win this trade war" with the US, following US President Donald Trump's renewed calls to make Canada the US's 51st state. The Liberals secured a comeback after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau stepped down, with voters concerned about Trump's tariffs and comments. European leaders congratulated Carney on his victory, and Carney warned that America wants Canada's land, resources, and country. The election outcome reflects a shift in Canadian politics amid external pressures.</p>

Spearheaded by the Ministry of Natural Resources, the network will consist of surface buoys, submerged buoys, and seabed platforms. Surface buoys, equipped with satellite receivers, will provide real-time data via encrypted links. Mid-depth submerged buoys will be used to track water currents and salinity shifts using acoustic profilers.</p>
