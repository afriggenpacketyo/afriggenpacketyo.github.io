            <p>Jos Buttler's brilliant 97 not out guided Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League. Buttler expertly controlled the chase of 204 runs, hitting 11 fours and four sixes in the process. He relinquished the England white-ball captaincy earlier in the year but has found good form in the IPL, marking his third fifty in seven innings. The victory pushed Gujarat Titans to the top of the league table.</p>

            <p>Iran and the United States have commenced expert-level discussions to explore a potential agreement regarding Iran's escalating nuclear program. This development follows a second round of negotiations in Rome, led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. The experts will convene in Oman prior to a subsequent meeting between Araghchi and Witkoff later in April. These talks mark a significant moment given the historical tensions between the two nations, with both sides aiming to de-escalate the situation and avoid potential military conflict.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that widespread frustration with inefficient customer service systems is contributing to populist sentiment. The average Briton spends a significant amount of time each week dealing with poor customer service, leading to increased annoyance and potentially influencing political behavior. The survey highlights issues with booking NHS appointments, contacting local councils, and dealing with energy suppliers. The thinktank that commissioned the survey suggests that ministers must address these systemic issues to avoid losing voters to parties advocating for radical change.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's dual strategy of expanding coal mining while simultaneously cutting funding for miner health and safety agencies has sparked outrage. Advocates express concern that reduced safety measures, coupled with the resurgence of black lung disease, will endanger miners' lives. The administration's cuts have affected the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Critics argue that delaying a new rule on silica dust, which causes silicosis, further jeopardizes miners' health.</p>

            <p>Scientists claim to have discovered a "new color" called "olo" by stimulating specific cells in the retina using lasers. Participants in the experiment described olo as more saturated than any color visible in the real world. The experiment involved shining a laser beam into the pupil of one eye of each participant. While some experts are skeptical, suggesting the perceived color is a matter of interpretation, the researchers believe the findings could potentially aid research into color blindness.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is taking steps to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections. A new "Schedule Policy/Career" classification would affect approximately 50,000 employees, allowing them to be more easily removed if they don't advance the President's policy interests. Critics argue this move undermines the independence of the civil service. The new rule proposed by OPM is not immediately reclassifying these workers, but Trump will need to sign an executive order after OPM issues a final rule.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt to the deportation of Venezuelan men in immigration custody. The decision came after lawyers argued the men were at imminent risk of removal without due process. The ACLU claimed the men were being classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang and faced deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. The court's order prevents the administration from proceeding with deportations until further review.</p>
