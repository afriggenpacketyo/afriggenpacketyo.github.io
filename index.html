          <p>China's defense ministry announced it had warned and driven away the USS Higgins, a U.S. destroyer, which it claims illegally entered its territorial waters near the Scarborough Shoal. The U.S. Seventh Fleet refuted this, stating the warship was conducting a lawful freedom of navigation operation and that China's statement was false. This maritime incident occurs amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing, including an ongoing trade dispute and recent clashes between Chinese and Filipino vessels in the contested region. The area is a critical global shipping lane and subject to overlapping territorial claims.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Madonna has publicly appealed to Pope Leo XIV to travel to Gaza, emphasizing the suffering of children in the conflict zone. In a social media post, she framed her plea as a humanitarian call, stating she was not taking sides in the war but was moved as a mother to prevent children from starving. Her message highlighted the unique access the Pope might have to the region and called for humanitarian gates to be fully opened. This comes as aid organizations warn of escalating malnutrition among Gaza's children.</p>

          <p>Israeli forces have launched intense air attacks on Gaza City, causing significant destruction to residential areas ahead of a planned ground operation. Concurrently, the UK, EU, and other allies issued a joint statement demanding immediate action to address what they describe as an "unfolding famine" in the territory. The World Health Organization has also appealed for access to pre-stock hospitals with medical supplies to handle a catastrophic health situation. Israel denies that starvation is occurring and has outlined its own plan to increase aid delivery.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned a lower court's decision, allowing Arkansas's ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for minors to be enforced. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited a recent Supreme Court ruling on a similar Tennessee law, agreeing that the ban does not violate the equal protection rights of transgender minors. Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Attorney General Tim Griffin praised the ruling as a victory for protecting children. Opponents, including the ACLU, condemned the decision as unjust and harmful, vowing to consider their next steps.</p>

Despite these issues, some optimism remains due to recent interest rate cuts and new trade deals, though significant policy work is needed to restore the city's competitiveness.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a dramatic late-game collapse against the Los Angeles Angels, losing 7-6 in a walk-off defeat. A go-ahead ninth-inning home run by Shohei Ohtani seemed to secure a much-needed victory, but the bullpen was unable to hold the lead. The Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth and won it in the tenth inning on an RBI single by Jo Adell. This loss marks the Dodgers' third in a row and erases their once-large division lead, leaving them tied for first place with the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>The state of California and the federal government are in a legal battle over President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles during immigration protests. California's lawyers argue the deployment was an illegal use of a "standing army" in civilian life that violated the Posse Comitatus Act and caused public fear. The Justice Department contends the president acted within his authority under Title 10 to protect federal property and personnel during what was termed a "rebellion." The trial's outcome could set a precedent for future domestic military deployments, including the recent one in Washington, D.C.</p>

A separate report from the housing ombudsman likens the scale of window safety defects to issues of damp and mould, highlighting cases of severe maladministration.

Meesseman stepped up in the absence of Breanna Stewart, who was sidelined with a knee injury.

The findings also point to a regional disparity, where China's eastern coastal areas reaped more economic benefits while the central and western regions shouldered greater environmental burdens.

The author argues that Switzerland's long-standing policy of benefiting from the free world without sharing its burdens is no longer viable in an era of aggressive geoeconomics.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' bullpen has suffered another setback, with relief pitcher Brock Stewart being placed on the injured list due to shoulder inflammation. Stewart was acquired at the trade deadline just two weeks ago to help strengthen a relief corps already depleted by numerous injuries. While the team is optimistic that the injury was caught early and he will return this season, his absence adds another layer of uncertainty for the struggling team. In other injury news, starting pitcher Tony Gonsolin underwent season-ending elbow surgery, further compounding the team's pitching challenges.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance successfully launched its new Vulcan rocket on its first operational mission sanctioned by the U.S. Space Force. The powerful rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, carrying two military satellites destined for a high geosynchronous orbit. This launch marks a major milestone for ULA, as the Vulcan is now certified to carry costly national security payloads, and is set to replace the company's legacy Atlas V and Delta rockets. The mission's payloads included an experimental satellite, NTS-3, designed to test advanced navigation technology that could lead to more accurate, jam-proof GPS capabilities.</p>

National Guard, controlled by the president, has been activated under Title 32, granting them arrest authority, though their current mission is stated as support. The 1973 Home Rule Act allows the president to assume control of the D.C. police for up to 30 days during an emergency, placing them under federal command. This deployment involves numerous federal agencies and has been met with concern from local officials about the city's autonomy.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that any negotiations about Ukraine that exclude his country "will not work," ahead of a scheduled summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy revealed that Russia has signaled a potential readiness for a ceasefire, but he remains firm that Ukraine will not withdraw forces from the occupied Donbas region. He expressed concern that the one-on-one meeting in Alaska would primarily benefit Putin by providing a photo opportunity. A virtual meeting between Zelenskyy, Trump, and European leaders is scheduled to take place before the summit with the Russian president.</p>

          <p>A man arrested in connection with a fatal hit-and-run in Hollywood that killed 37-year-old Erika "Tilly" Edwards is currently free after posting $50,000 bail. The suspect, Davontay Robins, was arrested in July for the late June incident where Edwards was struck by a Mercedes G Wagon while walking to her car. Robins faces charges of vehicular manslaughter and hit-and-run, but his arraignment has been postponed until October. The victim's husband expressed shock and dismay at the low bail amount, stating it cost more to bury his wife than for the suspect to be released.</p>

          <p>In the days following a shooting attack on the CDC's main campus in Atlanta, employees have expressed frustration over a perceived lack of clear communication and steady leadership. An agency-wide all-hands meeting was described by some as brief and insufficient, while new CDC Director Susan Monarez's remarks were seen as heavily scripted. Staff noted the grim irony that the CDC's firearm violence prevention team had been dismissed just months before the attack, which investigators believe was targeted and related to COVID-19. Many employees are looking for more direct engagement and support from leadership during the traumatic aftermath.</p>

          <p>China has initiated a year-long program to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. According to a plan released by top financial authorities, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on qualifying loans for purchases like cars and education. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy, with provincial governments covering the rest. Officials hope this policy will channel more credit into the consumption sector and help make it the primary driver of the national economy.</p>

The move is a direct response to efforts in states like Texas to create maps favorable to Republicans. Newsom stated that California cannot stand by while a "power grab unfolds" and plans to ask voters to approve a new map proposal that could create five more Democratic seats. The White House has been lobbying other red states to engage in similar redistricting efforts.</p>

The Kremlin reported that Putin praised Pyongyang for its military support in the war against Ukraine and updated Kim on the preparations for the talks in Alaska. This diplomatic engagement highlights the deepening cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, which has included North Korea providing Russia with soldiers, missiles, and artillery shells. The war has driven Russia into near-total isolation from the West but has fostered an unprecedented alliance with North Korea.</p>

Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal. The move is seen by some as a strategic maneuver in the competitive AI landscape, though it is unclear if Google is considering a sale or if the bid is high enough to be taken seriously.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival has doubled in the last 50 years, a new study warns that progress has been highly uneven, with survival rates for some of the deadliest cancers showing little improvement. Research from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine highlights that while 10-year survival for melanoma now exceeds 90%, it remains below 5% for pancreatic cancer. Cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and lungs also lag significantly behind, widening the gap between the most and least survivable forms of the disease. Experts attribute the disparity to difficulties in early detection and fewer treatment options for these cancers.</p>
