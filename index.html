            <h2>Customs System Glitch Briefly Impacts Trump Tariff Exemptions</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-11 20:11:02 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Automated Commercial Environment system temporarily prevented U.S. shippers from claiming tariff exemptions for freight already in transit, causing confusion and raising concerns about Customs' ability to manage the administration's trade policies. The issue, which lasted over 10 hours, involved the entry code for exempting freight from new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. While Customs advised importers to file cargo release forms separately, the incident added to the uncertainty and anxiety surrounding the rapidly changing tariff regulations, prompting businesses to re-evaluate their financial plans and express concerns about potential disruptions and economic consequences. The glitch has since been fixed, but it raised questions about the ability of Customs to handle the new policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to provide information regarding the whereabouts and status of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The judge expressed frustration at the administration's lack of compliance with previous orders, including a Supreme Court directive to facilitate Garcia's release from Salvadoran custody. Abrego Garcia, who has no criminal record, was deported based on alleged gang ties, but the government has admitted the deportation was an error.

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Analysts suggest that the record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could serve as a test of China's ability to withstand Western economic pressure in a potential Taiwan Strait crisis. If China can endure the current tariff environment, it may embolden Beijing to face future Western sanctions in the event of a conflict over Taiwan. However, any decision regarding Taiwan remains a complex political and military calculation for Beijing, which views the island as part of China. The United States, while not recognizing Taiwan as independent, opposes any unilateral change to the status quo.</p>

            <p>Lishay, the wife of Israeli hostage Omri Miran, continues to send him WhatsApp messages as he turns 48, hoping he will one day read them. Omri has been held by Hamas since October 7, 2023, and Lishay sends messages with tales of their daughters and family life. The family has not returned to their home near the Gaza border, but Lishay visits the kibbutz to feel close to Omri. The square is full of symbols, including a mock-up of a Gaza tunnel, tents to represent the Nova music festival where hundreds were killed.</p>

            <p>Preliminary results from soil testing near the Eaton and Palisades fire burn areas in Los Angeles County reveal concerning levels of lead and other contaminants. Downwind of the Eaton fire, as much as 80% of soil samples exceeded the state health standard for lead, while the Palisades tests showed isolated "hot spots" of heavy metals and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Officials are requesting assistance from federal and state partners to further assess the Palisades hot spots and explore options for targeted lead testing in affected areas downwind of the Eaton fire. Residents with concerns are encouraged to consult environmental professionals for evaluation.</p>

            <p>Prosecutors are using intercepted jailhouse communications between Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker as evidence of a conspiracy to murder Fabio Sementilli. These communications include coded language, sex games, and promises of commitment, which prosecutors argue demonstrate a "secrecy pact" between the accused. Baker had pleaded no contest in July 2023, accepting a life sentence without parole. Monica will stand trial alone in April, and is pleading not guilty. Police are alleging that the jailhouse marriage was not an option for Monica, so the couple turned to murder.</p>

            <p>Laguna Beach has enacted a new ordinance requiring pickleball players at Lang Park to use quiet paddles to mitigate noise complaints from residents at a nearby senior living facility. The ordinance, which took effect Thursday, follows previous measures to reduce noise, including reduced play hours and a fence around the park. Players who fail to use quiet paddles risk a citation. While some residents feel the ordinance is insufficient, pickleball players express frustration with the council's concessions and call for the return of lost play hours.</p>
