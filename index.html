          <p>Across the UK, protests have taken place regarding the government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers, with counter-demonstrations also occurring. Police were deployed to separate opposing groups, leading to several arrests in cities like Bristol and Liverpool. This follows a High Court ruling blocking a hotel in Epping from accommodating asylum seekers, prompting other local authorities to consider legal challenges. The government maintains its commitment to eventually closing all asylum hotels in a managed way, as the number of housed asylum seekers continues to rise.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department released over 300 pages of transcripts from its interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell regarding Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell denied witnessing any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton and called a prominent accuser's photo with Prince Andrew "fake." The Giuffre family expressed outrage, stating Maxwell was given a platform to "rewrite history" despite her conviction. The interview, conducted while Maxwell serves a 20-year sentence, occurred as she seeks a Supreme Court review of her case.</p>

          <p>The Nigerian military announced it killed over 35 jihadists in an air strike near the Cameroon border, targeting Islamist militants who had reportedly gathered. This action follows a resurgence of violent attacks in northeastern Nigeria by groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP. The Nigerian Air Force stated the strikes aimed to stabilize the region and disrupt terrorist logistics, with ground troops confirming the improved situation. Nigeria is also grappling with armed bandit gangs and recently secured a weapons deal with the US to combat insurgency.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders had a challenging final preseason game, netting negative yards and taking five sacks, leading to his benching. This performance sparked a debate among fans and pundits, with many criticizing the Browns' coaching decisions and suggesting Sanders was put in a difficult position with backup teammates. Former NFL quarterback Derek Carr and sports talk host Skip Bayless questioned why Sanders wasn't allowed to finish the game. Despite a rough outing, Sanders expressed confidence in making the team's roster.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are navigating President Trump's increased tariffs by implementing mitigation strategies, such as diversifying sourcing and pushing costs back to vendors.

Retail executives report selective price adjustments to avoid widespread increases and potential White House scrutiny. However, costs from duties are expected to continue through the fiscal year, affecting lower-income households more significantly.</p>

          <p>Ron Howard's new film 'Eden' recounts the true story of disenchanted Europeans who sought to create a utopia on a remote Galapagos island in the 1930s, only for their experiment to descend into petty power struggles and murder. The movie, starring Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney, is described as a lurid and entertaining exploration of survival-of-the-fittest. Despite its melodramatic tone and focus on broad strokes of personality, the film offers a charged ensemble performance and a compelling, if cynical, look at the human condition in isolation.</p>

          <p>In a rare bipartisan moment, Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders have both spoken out against the famine in Gaza, urging the US to take action. Sanders called on President Trump to end the starvation and halt US taxpayer dollars to Israel's military. Greene, departing from many Republican peers, described the crisis as a genocide and questioned US financial and military aid, emphasizing compassion for innocent Palestinian civilians.

          <p>Serbia is experiencing escalating police violence and arrests during anti-corruption protests, prompting calls for a stronger response from the European Union. Critics argue that the EU's current "strategy of appeasement" towards President Aleksandar Vucic's government has failed, partly due to strategic interests like lithium reserves and concerns about Serbia's relations with Russia. While the EU ambassador called for de-escalation, many politicians and observers believe Brussels must adopt a tougher stance, potentially through economic incentives tied to reform implementation, as public trust in EU accession wanes.</p>

          <p>David Mackenzie's new film 'Relay' is a smart, paranoid thriller that explores the anxieties of the digital age through the story of Ash, a solitary off-the-grid fixer played by Riz Ahmed.

The movie is praised for its fresh premise, moving beyond the typical assassin narrative to delve into questions of uneasy peace with tormentors. As the story unfolds with clockwork precision and dizzying cat-and-mouse chases, it subtly examines the loneliness and moral complexities of Ash's chosen crusade.</p>

Countries like Azerbaijan are actively building new alliances with the US and Turkey, leveraging the 'window of opportunity' presented by Russia's engagement in Ukraine. This trend, coupled with China's quiet advancement in the region, suggests a multi-vector foreign policy approach by former Soviet states, challenging Moscow's traditional dominance.</p>

The department agrees with a lawsuit arguing that reserving grants for colleges with at least 25% Hispanic undergraduates provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity. This stance, citing the 2023 Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action, is seen as adverse to HSIs, which enroll 67% of Latino undergraduates but receive less funding than other institutions.
