          <p>Senate Republicans are debating changes to Medicaid within President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," focusing on a new proposal to address concerns about rural hospital funding. The Senate Finance Committee suggests allocating $3 billion annually over five years to states applying for a rural healthcare stabilization fund. However, some senators find this amount insufficient, while others consider it excessive, revealing divisions within the party. The debate centers on the Medicaid provider tax rate and its potential impact on rural hospitals and working Americans' benefits; some Republicans argue the rate is fraudulent and harms rural hospitals, while others seek higher funding for the stabilization fund.

          <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy signed an agreement with the Council of Europe to establish a special international tribunal to prosecute Russian officials for the war in Ukraine. Ukraine argues the tribunal is urgently needed to hold Russia's leadership accountable for launching the invasion in February 2022. The Council of Europe hopes the tribunal could begin its work as early as next year and will allow the widest possible number of countries to join and support the effort. The International Criminal Court has already issued arrest warrants for Putin and other Russian officials on war crimes charges, but it lacks the jurisdiction to prosecute them for the crime of aggression.</p>

          <p>NATO leaders agreed to a new defense spending goal of 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, significantly increasing the previous target of 2%. President Trump praised the agreement as a win for the United States, having consistently urged NATO allies to increase their defense spending. In 2024, NATO members spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Poland is estimated to spend the highest percentage of its GDP on defense, while Spain allocated the smallest share, leading to criticism from Trump.</p>

The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to build homes collectively, reducing costs and fostering community. The project, located in the Annadale neighborhood, represents a $1.46 million investment from the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis. The families worked alongside construction staff, learning skills like pouring foundations and wiring, while contributing to the revitalization of a historically underserved community.</p>

The judge stated that using copyrighted works to train large language models to generate new text is transformative. However, the judge also noted that Anthropic may have broken the law by using pirated books from online libraries, ordering a trial to determine damages.

Analysts suggest that BP's underperformance compared to Shell and U.S. rivals has fueled speculation about it being an acquisition target.

          <p>President Donald Trump's claim that U.S. strikes had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear sites has sparked controversy and debate. Trump and his aides have defended the description, even as an initial U.S. intelligence assessment suggested the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a few months. The strikes targeted three facilities: Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo, with massive bunker-buster bombs. However, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that it was "way too early" to know the full extent of the damage, and reports surfaced about a leaked initial assessment suggesting most of the damage was done to structures above ground.</p>

          <p>Senators on the Senate Appropriations Committee are challenging the Trump administration's proposal to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting and international aid programs. Republican Sen. Susan Collins noted that most of the funding for public broadcasting supports local programming and emergency communications. The White House argues the cuts are necessary because the targeted foreign aid programs are "antithetical to American interests," and that public broadcasting is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Democrats, like Sen. Patty Murray, question the legality of the request and argue the cuts would harm rural communities and children's programming.</p>

Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, ran an energetic campaign embracing progressive ideas, upsetting former Governor Andrew Cuomo. While some Democrats see Mamdani as a new leader, Republicans are eager to portray his policies as evidence of the party's shift to the left. Mamdani's emphasis on affordability and economic issues resonated with voters in a city facing high living costs, but his views on Israel and taxation have drawn criticism.</p>

The FHFA director stated this aligns with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Alabama woman is facing the potential deportation of her husband, who was detained by ICE and accused of being an ex-Iranian Army sniper. Ribvar Karimi was arrested along with 11 other Iranian nationals and accused of being in the country illegally. Karimi's wife, Morgan, contests the allegations, stating that they married within the required timeframe and that her husband was mistakenly swept up in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. She has sought financial assistance to hire an attorney to fight for his freedom.</p>
