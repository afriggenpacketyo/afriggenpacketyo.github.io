          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. The storm, driven by 60 to 70 mph winds over dry farmlands, caused significantly reduced visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and thunderstorms combined with the dust storm resulted in reports of "mud rain" in some areas, while some schools closed due to power outages from previous severe weather events. Cooler, dry weather is expected for the weekend, with a rainy pattern returning next week with projections of 1 to 1.5 inches of rain.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering shutting down two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's earlier announcement that it would close seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal year 2024. The closures are part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and address financial challenges faced by the automaker.

          <p>In this New York Times article, Michelle Goldberg reflects on the Democratic Party's handling of concerns about President Biden's age and fitness for office. Goldberg argues that many Democrats were in denial about Biden's decline, influenced by groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion. She suggests that the party needs to acknowledge its mistakes and be honest about Biden's limitations, rather than solely blaming Biden's inner circle. The article points to a broader issue of gerontocracy in American politics and the need for more courage and less deference within the Democratic Party.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post featuring seashells arranged to spell "8647." Trump supporters interpreted the numbers as a call to "86" (eliminate) the 47th president. The Secret Service launched an investigation, and Comey, who removed the post, claimed it was merely a political message and he opposed violence. The incident highlights ongoing tensions and concerns about inflamed political rhetoric, with various figures weighing in on the perceived threat and its implications.</p>

          <p>A sake brewery in southwestern Japan, Fujii Shuzo, is offering a seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques, which were added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list. The five-day seminar, organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to spread awareness and appreciation of sake beyond Japan. The initiative seeks to increase exports to Europe, where the brewery currently has few sales, and to enhance the value of Japanese sake by making it a commodity that can be brewed in any country.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration faced setbacks in the courts and Congress on Friday, as the president concluded a tour of the Middle East that did not include a stop in Israel. The Supreme Court rejected the administration's request to remove a block on deportations of Venezuelans, and right-wing lawmakers derailed Trump's signature legislation in the House of Representatives. The bill, which would extend tax cuts from Trump's first term, failed to advance through a key committee, raising questions about Republican unity.</p>

          <p>A four-minute audio clip of President Biden's 2023 special counsel interview was released, revealing him speaking softly and struggling to recall key dates. The audio, published by Axios, captured Biden stumbling over the years his son died and Donald Trump was first elected, adding to concerns about his mental acuity. Republicans have long sought the release of the full interview recording, arguing it might offer evidence of Biden's cognitive decline. The emergence of the recording comes amid new revelations about efforts to quash concerns about Biden's health during his presidency.</p>

          <p>Facing record-low approval ratings, many top Democrats are attempting to reposition themselves from Biden supporters to truth-tellers about the 2024 campaign. Some Democrats who previously vouched for President Biden's fitness for office are now acknowledging that he suffered cognitive decline while in office. Strategists believe that the party must rebuild trust by confronting how it handled the 2024 race, with some officials complaining that White House aides kept Biden cloistered as his condition worsened. As Democrats jostle for influence, the issue could emerge as a dividing line in the 2028 presidential primary.</p>
