        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactively securing its supply chain resilience, particularly concerning rare earth minerals. In 2010, China's export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo incentivized Japan to reduce its reliance on Chinese minerals. Japan invested in stockpiling, recycling, alternative technologies, and non-China rare-earth projects like Australia's Lynas. As a result, Japan's dependence on Chinese rare earths has decreased from over 90% to below 60%, with plans to reduce it further to below 50% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CSX Transportation is requesting federal approval to remove a safety signal near Rigby Yard in South Portland, raising concerns among workers and residents. The company claims removing the signal will reduce radio communications and streamline operations, however, workers fear it will compromise safety, especially with the introduction of remote-control operations. The signal alerts train crews to changing track conditions, and its removal could endanger rail workers, nearby residents, and Amtrak Downeaster passengers. The union and local officials are opposing the request, citing potential for accidents and reduced safety measures.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of a Minnesota lawmaker by an individual impersonating a police officer has raised concerns about verifying law enforcement officials. Authorities advise calling 911 to confirm the identity of an officer at one's door. Experts recommend not opening the door if unsure and instead speaking through it while verifying with authorities. In traffic stops, drivers are advised to be aware of their surroundings and pull over in public places if possible, as well as call to confirm the stop with dispatch.</p>

          <p>Recent criticisms of female celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae reveal underlying sexism and double standards in pop culture. The article argues that online platforms often amplify extreme views, leading to puritanical diatribes rather than meaningful critique. It references the "sex wars" of the 1970s, highlighting the need for nuanced discussions about desire, power, and capitalism in women's lives. The author suggests that policing women's sexuality under the guise of safety is a dangerous and historically ignorant trend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's property sector is facing further challenges due to a shrinking population, which is expected to suppress demand for new homes. Goldman Sachs estimates that demand for new homes in Chinese urban cities will remain under 5 million units per year, significantly lower than the peak of 20 million units in 2017. The country's declining population is projected to reduce home demand by 0.5 million units annually in the 2020s and 1.4 million units in the 2030s. Despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, stagnant incomes and job instability continue to discourage young people from having more children. (not investment advice)</p>
