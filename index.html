          <p>South Africa's ambassador to France, Nkosinathi Mthethwa, was found dead outside a Paris hotel in what investigators believe was a suicide. Mthethwa had been reported missing by his wife, and a secured window in his 22nd-story room was found forced open. His death occurs as a South African judicial commission investigates alleged corruption, with recent testimony implicating Mthethwa in interfering with a police investigation during his time as Minister of Police. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa described the passing as a moment of "deep grief" for the nation, noting the premature and traumatic end to his life of service.</p>

          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins endorsed a recent interest rate cut but expressed caution about the extent of future reductions, citing persistent inflation risks. Speaking in New York, she stated that while some easing was appropriate, maintaining a "modestly restrictive" policy is necessary to balance price stability with a softening labor market. Collins highlighted a highly uncertain economic environment, suggesting further cuts this year would depend heavily on incoming data showing inflation is under control. Her remarks align with a broader sentiment of vigilance among Fed officials amid economic challenges, including a potential government shutdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Addressing senior military leaders at Marine Corps Base Quantico, former President Donald Trump promised his "100%" support and declared a "reawakening of the warrior spirit" within the armed forces. He criticized what he described as a shift toward political correctness under the previous administration, stating that the military's purpose is to protect the republic, not "anyone's feelings." Trump asserted that his administration is refocusing on fitness, ability, and character to build a "fighting and winning machine." He also claimed that military recruitment goals, which had struggled, have now been met or exceeded under his leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Excessive credit card debt is not defined by a specific dollar amount but rather by its impact on an individual's financial health, according to financial experts. Key indicators of unmanageable debt include a high debt-to-income ratio, a credit utilization ratio above 30%, and the inability to pay more than the minimum monthly payment. The article suggests that if debt is causing significant stress or preventing other financial goals, it should be considered excessive. To address this, strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche methods, balance transfers, or seeking help from credit counseling agencies are recommended for regaining financial stability.

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley anticipates that the market share for electric vehicles in the U.S. will be cut in half, potentially dropping from a record high of around 10% to 5%, following the expiration of federal tax credits. He noted that the end of the $7,500 consumer incentive will significantly shrink the EV market, which he believes will be "way smaller than we thought." Farley observed that customers are hesitant to purchase expensive EVs and that "partial electrification," like hybrid vehicles, is currently more acceptable to consumers. The shift in policy will require Ford and other automakers to adjust their strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown, which would halt many non-essential services and furlough hundreds of thousands of workers. If funding is not approved, up to 4 million federal employees, including some military personnel, could go without pay, though essential staff like air traffic controllers and TSA agents would be required to work. The article outlines broad consequences, such as the closure of national parks, potential delays in services at agencies like the FDA and NIH, and a halt to the release of key economic data. A prolonged shutdown could disrupt the economy and cause financial hardship for many families.</p>

This direct use of a federal agency's platform for partisan messaging marks a significant departure from traditional government communication.

          <p>The fate of enhanced premium tax credits for 22 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has become a central issue in the government shutdown negotiations. Democrats are insisting that any funding deal include an extension of these subsidies, which are set to expire in 2025 and have nearly doubled enrollment in ACA marketplace plans since 2021. Without an extension, consumers could see their health insurance premiums rise by an average of 75%, potentially forcing millions to drop their coverage. Republicans are resisting the demand, leading to a stalemate as the shutdown deadline approaches and insurers prepare to notify customers of significant price hikes.</p>

Hegseth also stated he would overhaul the Inspector General's office to stop it from being "weaponized" by complainers and would empower drill sergeants to be tougher on recruits.

A crucial link was reportedly made through DNA evidence and a bullet casing found at the crime scene, which is believed to be consistent with the gun Brashers used.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Labour's pledge not to raise headline tax rates, many UK households will see their income tax increase due to a "stealth tax" known as fiscal drag. This occurs because income tax allowances and thresholds have been frozen since 2021 and are set to remain so until at least 2028. As wages rise with inflation, the static thresholds pull more people into higher tax brackets, effectively increasing their tax burden without any official rate change. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates this freeze will reduce average household incomes by £1,250 by 2025/26, representing a significant, albeit subtle, tax hike for working people.

          <p>Irish police are investigating the deaths of three family members—Louise O'Connor, 56, her husband Mark, 54, and their 27-year-old autistic son, Evan—as a homicide incident after they were found dead in their home. Authorities have described their deaths as "violent" and have a man in his 30s in custody, stating they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the case. The O'Connor family was well-known and respected in their community, where they were active advocates for autism services.

          <p>The historic rivalry between India and Pakistan has intensified, spilling over from politics into the sport of cricket during the recent Asia Cup finals. The tournament was marked by a lack of customary friendly gestures, culminating in the Indian team refusing to accept the winner's trophy from Pakistan's Interior Minister, who also heads the country's cricket board. The victory was hailed by India's Prime Minister in a social media post referencing a recent military bombing campaign, drawing a sharp rebuke from Pakistani officials. This politicization of the sport marks a departure from the past, when "cricket diplomacy" was often used to ease tensions.</p>

          <p>A woman who was knocked unconscious during a 2020 arrest by two Solano County sheriff's deputies has reached a $17 million settlement. Nakia Porter, who is Black, had pulled over with her family to switch drivers when the deputies approached, drew their guns, and slammed her to the pavement while handcuffing her. Body camera footage captured the incident, including a deputy acknowledging she was "out" after being handcuffed. Porter was jailed overnight on suspicion of resisting arrest but was never charged. Her lawsuit accused the deputies of excessive force and lying in their reports, and her attorney stated that what happened to her "should never happen."</p>

          <p>Louisiana's Republican Governor, Jeff Landry, has formally requested the deployment of up to 1,000 National Guard troops to New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and Shreveport to address what he describes as "elevated violent crime rates." The request follows President Trump's suggestions that New Orleans could be a target for military deployment and his previous decisions to send troops to other cities. However, crime data analysts note that New Orleans has seen a significant decrease in homicides and other violent crimes compared to previous years, leading critics to call the move an "unnecessary stunt." The deployment would place federally funded troops in three of the state's majority-Black cities.</p>

          <p>An asylum seeker from Syria, Mohammed Sharwarq, has been sentenced to 16 weeks in jail for a series of assaults at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, where he was being housed. The 32-year-old admitted to attacking a cleaner, a head chef, and two fellow migrants in several incidents. His lawyer stated that Sharwarq was experiencing a mental breakdown stemming from the trauma of fleeing the war in Syria and now wishes to return to his home country. The court heard that he had traveled to the UK by small boat and was on bail for a separate incident at another asylum hotel at the time of the attacks.</p>

The membership was confirmed during a visit from Malaysia's Prime Minister, who praised the decision as a benefit for the entire region. As Southeast Asia's newest and smallest nation, Timor-Leste has worked to establish its democratic credentials, recently demonstrated when its government reversed a controversial spending plan after public protests. Joining the 10-nation bloc is seen as a crucial step for the country's development, though some citizens remain skeptical about its immediate benefits.</p>

The announcement comes amid controversy over Ek's personal investments in Helsing, an AI-powered defense technology firm, which prompted boycotts from some musicians. However, the company asserts that the leadership transition was planned before this and is unrelated to the recent backlash against its founder's external business ventures.</p>

          <p>A group of House Democrats has raised concerns that the Trump administration is seizing the tax refunds of defaulted student loan borrowers "without required notice." In a letter to the Education Secretary, lawmakers argue that while the government has the authority to offset debts, it must provide a 60-day warning, which they claim is not being consistently issued. With collection activities resuming after a pandemic-era pause, millions of borrowers are at risk. The lawmakers suggest the administration may be relying on years-old notices, which fail to account for borrowers' changed life circumstances and that staff cuts could be worsening the problem.

The company confirmed that no personnel were injured and that it is assessing the damage to its test stand.

Despite high investor interest at its IPO last month, the stock has now fallen 50% from its opening day high.

Harris argued that history should note it was the "closest presidential election," a claim that overlooks other tighter contests.
