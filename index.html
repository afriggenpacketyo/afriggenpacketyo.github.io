To ensure their firsthand accounts of the nuclear attacks are not lost, younger Japanese individuals and organizations are actively working to preserve and share these harrowing stories. The article highlights a 12-year-old "successor" who guides tourists in Hiroshima, using his family's own tragic history to convey the devastating human cost and advocate for a future free of nuclear weapons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent national poll indicates that a significant portion of Latino voters who supported Donald Trump in 2024 may not vote for Republican congressional candidates in the 2026 midterm elections. The survey, conducted by Equis, found that only 27% of these voters would back a Republican candidate today, a notable drop from the 45% who voted for Trump. This potential shift is attributed to growing disapproval of Trump's presidency and concerns over the economy, presenting an opportunity for Democrats if they can effectively address these voters' concerns.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a vote on a contentious Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. The Democrats' departure broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a map that would create five new Republican-leaning districts. While the governor has directed state authorities to return the absent members to the Capitol, the order's jurisdiction outside of Texas is limited, escalating a dramatic political and constitutional standoff.</p>

          <p>In a major escalation of the Texas redistricting battle, Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking the removal of Democratic Caucus Chair Gene Wu from office. The lawsuit labels Wu the "ringleader" of the Democratic walkout that broke legislative quorum and argues that his absence constitutes an abandonment of his duties. This legal action targets a single lawmaker but is intended to set a precedent for removing all Democrats who fled the state to block the controversial Republican-drawn congressional map.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 22:27:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation announced that a medium-security state prison in Norco will be closed by fall 2026, citing a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The closure reflects broader trends in criminal justice reform and falling crime rates, with the state's inmate numbers nearly halving since their 2006 peak. The future of the Norco facility, which originally opened as a luxury resort in the 1920s, is uncertain, with local officials hoping for its restoration.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its ongoing investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan committee is seeking information about Epstein's activities and connections, issuing summonses to the Clintons and other high-profile figures, including former attorneys general and FBI directors. The move follows a controversial decision by the Trump administration not to release more federal files on Epstein, prompting lawmakers to intensify their own inquiry.</p>

          <h2>UK Charity Regulator Finds No Widespread Bullying at Prince Harry's Sentebale Charity</h2>

          <p>A review by the UK's Charity Commission found no evidence of widespread bullying or harassment at Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, following whistleblower allegations. The inquiry was launched after a bitter boardroom dispute led to the resignations of Prince Harry and several trustees earlier this year. While the regulator imposed no sanctions and the current leadership will remain, it criticized all parties for allowing the internal conflict to become a damaging public dispute and issued a plan to address governance weaknesses.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to anyone crossing the border illegally, but the court ruled that the government cannot disregard laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they could face persecution or torture. This directive reopens humanitarian pathways for asylum-seekers, though they will likely remain in detention while their claims are processed, marking a significant shift in border policy.</p>

          <p>Veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers, agreeing to a one-year contract worth a reported $8.52 million. Allen, the franchise's second all-time leading receiver, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap-related move. His return provides a major boost to the Chargers' offense and a reliable, experienced target for quarterback Justin Herbert, especially following the recent retirement of fellow receiver Mike Williams.</p>

          <p>During a recent nine-hour interview with the Department of Justice, Ghislaine Maxwell reportedly stated that Donald Trump never did anything concerning in her presence, according to sources familiar with the discussion. The interview with the convicted sex trafficker was requested by Maxwell herself as she appeals her conviction to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly considering a public release of the interview transcripts, a move that would add another layer to the politically charged Epstein saga.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal 2023 implosion of the Titan submersible has concluded that the tragedy was preventable and resulted from significant safety failures by its owner, OceanGate. The report details how the company used "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight and operated with a "toxic" safety culture, ignoring warnings about the vessel's flawed design and compromised hull. Investigators stated that CEO Stockton Rush, who died in the incident, exhibited negligence and would likely have faced criminal charges had he survived.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting an increase in cases of flea-borne typhus, a bacterial disease spread by fleas from animals like rats, opossums, and stray cats. Los Angeles and Orange counties have seen a rise in infections, which typically peak in late summer and fall and can cause fever, headache, and rash. Health departments are advising residents to protect themselves and their pets by using flea control, securing trash, and avoiding contact with stray or wild animals to prevent further spread.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has decided not to pursue the death penalty against three high-profile accused Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. The decision is notable given President Trump's advocacy for capital punishment for drug traffickers and the fact that the men were transferred outside of normal extradition processes, which typically preclude execution. The move may be linked to diplomatic considerations with Mexico, which abolished capital punishment and opposes its use on extradited citizens.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates to resolve claims related to the widespread contamination of "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other pollutants.
