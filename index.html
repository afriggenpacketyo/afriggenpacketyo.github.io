          <p>President Trump's new tariffs represent the most significant change to global trade in a century.  The universal 10% tariff on all US imports, coupled with higher rates for specific countries, is causing stock market declines and disrupting established trade routes.  The move aims to reduce the US trade deficit but could lead to higher prices for consumers and a global trade war. The long-term economic consequences remain uncertain.</p>
