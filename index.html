          <p>At least 20 tourists were killed and dozens injured in a terror attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir's Pahalgam area, a popular tourist destination. The attack, the worst in the region in nearly a year, occurred as tourism was recovering, with gunmen firing on civilians. Prime Minister Modi condemned the attack, vowing justice, while U.S. President Trump pledged support for India against terrorism. The attack happened during U.S. Vice President Vance's visit to India, highlighting the ongoing conflict in the disputed region claimed by both India and Pakistan.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surpassed $90,000 for the first time since March, driven by investors seeking alternatives to turbulent stock markets and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's rise coincided with stock market volatility and President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin experienced significant inflows, indicating renewed investor interest. Bitcoin's decoupling from risk assets suggests it is acting as a safe-haven asset amidst economic uncertainty, but light trading volumes suggest it needs a significant catalyst to break the $93,000 resistance level.

          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decrease by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, which may lead Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein to reduce their ad spending on Facebook and Instagram. MoffettNathanson analysts estimate that China accounts for over 11% of Meta's total sales, with Temu and Shein being significant contributors. A recession combined with the trade dispute could further decrease Meta's ad revenues by $23 billion. Meta's first-quarter earnings report is scheduled for next Wednesday.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that he does not believe transgender women are women, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining a woman as biologically female under equalities law. This marks a shift from his previous stance, where he stated that trans women are women, and aligns with the court's judgment protecting single-sex spaces. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson welcomed the clarity provided by the ruling, emphasizing the protection of single-sex spaces based on biological sex. Starmer has repeatedly stated that a woman is an adult female, prior to the court's judgment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's repeated criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell has raised concerns about his potential removal, but economists suggest that even firing Powell might not secure the desired rate cuts. To effectively influence monetary policy, Trump would likely need to replace the entire Fed Board, potentially triggering market instability. Experts note that individual Fed members could resist pressure to ease policy if they perceive Trump's actions as overstepping. Speculation about changes at the Fed, along with tariff uncertainties, has already impacted investor confidence, leading to declines in U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears inclined to rule in favor of parents seeking the ability to opt their children out of elementary school instruction featuring storybooks addressing gender identity and sexual orientation. The case involves a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education over First Amendment rights to religious freedom.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio is reorganizing the State Department, planning to close 132 agency offices and eliminate approximately 700 D.C.-based civil and foreign service positions. The changes will affect offices under the Energy Resources, Conflict and Stabilization Operations, and other wings, as well as special envoys. The Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability bureau will merge with the International Security and Nonproliferation Bureau, and the Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Extremism bureau will see reductions. No immediate layoffs are expected, with leaders having 30 days to implement the plan.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. The survey highlights that Musk is a polarizing figure, with significant disapproval among Democrats and independents. The biggest problem for Tesla is that potential customers are far more positive about electric vehicles than they are about the company itself. Tesla's stock has been under pressure due to concerns that Musk's political activities and support for President Trump are alienating prospective buyers.</p>

He said US and Indian negotiators have finalized terms for a bilateral trade agreement, and cooperation could lead to co-production of military hardware and investments in various sectors.

The rebound is attributed to factors such as the potential for a US-India trade deal and key Republicans supporting Fed independence.

These books include Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring,' which set the mold for reporting on an ongoing disaster, and John Vaillant's 'Fire Weather,' which connects resource extraction to megafires. Sheri Fink's 'Five Days at Memorial' explores human responses to life-and-death choices during Hurricane Katrina, while Ben Goldfarb's 'Crossings' examines the ecological impact of roads. Joe Sacco's 'Paying the Land' investigates the social fracturing resulting from fossil-fuel extraction, and Amitav Ghosh's 'The Great Derangement' discusses the inability of stories to change as quickly as the world. Lastly, Porter Fox's 'Category Five' delves into the ocean's role in the climate crisis and the underinvestment in predicting superstorms.</p>
