          <p>Following US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, global leaders are calling for de-escalation while Iran vows revenge. The Financial Times highlights the US administration's stance that it is targeting Iran's nuclear program, not engaging in a broader war, while the Metro emphasizes the shockwaves from the attack, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer. The Sun uses provocative language, referencing past conflicts, while the Guardian describes the attack as a consequential intervention. Other outlets focus on potential retaliatory actions, with the Daily Mail headlining fears of an "Iran terror backlash" on US allies and the Daily Express focusing on the UK's increased terror threat. The i Paper notes the UK's diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration of the situation, as the world anticipates Iran's response. Optimism hinges on diplomatic solutions to prevent further escalation.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, witnessed the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Despite initial fears for the monkeys' survival, most of the population of 1,800 monkeys survived the storm, a mystery that researchers attribute to possible sheltering behavior and changes in diet. The team also managed to preserve decades of research data and biological samples through dedicated efforts to maintain power to freezers. The experience highlighted the resilience of both the monkeys and the research team in the face of extreme environmental challenges.</p>

The 60 Minutes team waited five days before encountering a whale, which Vega described as an "otherworldly" experience, emphasizing the importance of conservation efforts to protect these marine mammals.

          <p>60 Minutes explores the unique survival strategies of sloths, the world's slowest mammals, with zoologist Lucy Cooke in Costa Rica. Cooke explains that sloths' slow movement is an energy-saving adaptation to their vegetarian diet of toxic leaves, allowing them to survive for over 64 million years. Despite their poor eyesight and hearing, sloths are masters of disguise in the trees and conserve energy by moving deliberately, and are uniquely built to survive. Cooke also discusses her book "Bitch," challenging conventional wisdom about gender roles in the animal kingdom, while highlighting efforts to protect sloths from human-caused dangers like power lines.</p>

          <p>Scientists studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, or Monkey Island, have gained rare access to over six decades of biological and behavioral data. The monkeys, descendants of a group brought from India in 1938, live in a natural laboratory setting where researchers study their social interactions and adaptability. Hurricane Maria in 2017 devastated the island, but most of the monkeys survived, leading to new research into their resilience and the impact of environmental stress on their health. The study revealed that monkeys who lived through the hurricane had immune systems that aged prematurely, suggesting the trauma of the event accelerated their biological aging.</p>

          <p>To prevent Social Security overpayments, recipients should regularly check their earnings history and verify payment amounts. If returning to work while receiving disability benefits, recipients must carefully monitor their income to stay below the Substantial Gainful Activity limit. Those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) should be aware of strict asset limits and report any changes in income or living arrangements. Promptly report any mistakes to the Social Security Administration and maintain detailed records of all communications, as this can be grounds for challenging overpayments or underpayments.

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities was driven more by his own assessment of the threat than by the consensus of the US intelligence community. While intelligence agencies maintain that Iran suspended its nuclear weapons program in 2003, Trump believes Iran is actively pursuing the capability to build a weapon. Trump's actions align with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's view that Iran is close to building a weapon. The decision to use military force was a judgment call by Trump, based on his interpretation of available intelligence, and is his to own.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack faced difficulties obtaining necessary treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns among hospital staff about Florida's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, blamed fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the delay, while acknowledging that abortion rights groups might see the issue differently. Despite the law not prohibiting treatment for ectopic pregnancies, medical staff were hesitant due to potential legal repercussions. The incident highlights the confusion and fear created by restrictive abortion laws, even in cases where the pregnant person's life is at risk.</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. officials claiming that strikes on Iranian nuclear sites have devastated its nuclear program, independent experts analyzing satellite imagery suggest the damage is not complete. Jeffrey Lewis notes that Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium appear untouched, and David Albright believes the program could be reconstituted. Satellite images show trucks at key sites before the strike, possibly moving uranium to secure locations. Experts emphasize that international inspections and cooperation from the Iranian regime are necessary to truly end Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>General Dan Caine outlined the US military's complex mission to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, involving decoy flights, B-2 stealth bombers, and mid-air refuelings. The operation, dubbed 'Operation Midnight Hammer', began with bombers departing from Missouri under cover of darkness, targeting Iran's most secure nuclear sites. The US employed deception tactics, including decoy flights heading west to distract from the main strike force heading east. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth claimed the US had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear regime, but the true extent of the damage and its aftermath are still being measured.</p>

          <p>Following unprecedented US military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, the situation remains precarious as both sides weigh their next moves. The strikes, a major escalation in the conflict, have prompted international alarm and raised concerns about a broader Middle East war. Iran's response is crucial, as it seeks to avoid appearing weak while also preventing further US attacks. The commander-in-chief, who promised to be a president of peace, has crossed this Rubicon with direct military strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites â€“ the most consequential move yet in the second term of a president who has prided himself on breaking all the old rules.</p>

          <p>The United States launched military strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities Sunday morning local time, an action President Trump said aimed to neutralize a threat "posed by the world's number one state sponsor of terror." This action has ignited concerns about possible Iranian retaliation and what form such responses could take. Among them are fears Iran could block oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial trade passage that the country partly controls. The water, a crucial piece of global trade infrastructure, facilitates the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products per day, according to the Energy Information Administration, or EIA, a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
