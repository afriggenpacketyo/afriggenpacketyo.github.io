          <p>Following weekend discussions between American and Chinese officials in Geneva, investors are showing optimism about potential progress in easing trade tensions. The meetings, the first since increased tariffs from both countries, concluded with positive remarks from both sides, raising hopes for lowered tariffs. Analysts anticipate an initial agreement to involve reduced tariffs, although economists warn that trade barriers could increase the possibility of an economic downturn. The World Trade Organization has also warned that the division of the global economy into rival blocs could significantly cut global gross domestic product.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to align Medicare drug prices with the lowest prices paid by other countries. This initiative, an attempt to revive a previously unsuccessful program, aims to lower medication costs for Americans. The proposal would likely impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and administered in offices, potentially saving the government money. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly oppose the order, arguing that it could hurt profits and innovation, however Trump insists that it will reduce healthcare costs for citizens.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting imports of live cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexico.

The USDA said NWS was recently detected in remote farms as far north as about 700 miles from the U.S. border. The suspension will continue month-to-month until containment is achieved, and livestock currently held for entry will be inspected and treated.</p>

The government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but proposals to increase costs for high medical cost patients have sparked backlash.

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court recently discovered 83 boxes of Nazi materials confiscated during World War II in its basement. The boxes, sent from the German embassy in Tokyo to Argentina in 1941, were initially seized due to concerns about their impact on Argentina's neutrality. The materials include postcards, photographs, and propaganda from the Nazi regime. The court has transferred the boxes to a secure room and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to help preserve and inventory them, seeking clues about unknown aspects of the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark will stop covering Zepbound, a popular obesity drug, in favor of Wegovy, despite research showing Zepbound results in more weight loss. This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, will force many patients to switch medications. The move has sparked criticism, with patients and doctors arguing that it limits their ability to tailor treatments. Caremark claims the decision lowers drug prices for employer clients, but the change has upset patients who have found success with Zepbound and are concerned about their health progress.</p>

The group said his release would come as part of ceasefire efforts to open Gaza's border crossings and bring aid to Gaza. President Trump confirmed the agreement with Hamas on Alexander's release, and Israeli officials have acknowledged the U.S. informed them of Hamas's intention.</p>

Concerns include calorie content and the differing impact of protein sources on muscles. Despite the hype, experts recommend a balanced approach to protein consumption.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial of weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective, leading to a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14%. Both drugs work by mimicking hormones that reduce appetite, but Mounjaro flips two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy flips one. The trial, involving obese individuals, showed that those on Mounjaro also had better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Experts suggest both drugs have a role, with Mounjaro potentially benefiting those needing to lose more weight.</p>
