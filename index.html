          <p>Russia launched its most extensive drone and missile attack of the war, striking multiple Ukrainian regions and damaging the cabinet building in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported at least two fatalities and condemned the barrage, which involved over 820 munitions. Ukrainian officials are urgently calling for increased international military aid, emphasizing that such attacks prolong the conflict at a time when diplomatic solutions could be pursued. The assault prompted NATO to scramble fighter jets in neighboring Poland as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has concluded negotiations with the United States to secure the release of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai battery facility in Georgia. Over 300 South Korean nationals were among the 475 people detained for allegedly working illegally. The incident has caused concern in Seoul, coming amidst sensitive trade talks and significant South Korean investment in American manufacturing. The White House defended the raid as standard immigration enforcement, while South Korean officials are now seeking to improve the visa system to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old Texas woman, Natasha Marie O'Dell, has been sentenced to six years in federal prison for the 2023 arson of the Seattle Laestadian Lutheran Church in Washington. O'Dell pleaded guilty to charges including arson and damage to religious property, admitting she was angry at churches. Surveillance footage that survived the fire captured her pouring gasoline on the building's exterior before igniting it. The attack caused over $3.2 million in damages, completely destroying the congregation's spiritual home and injuring one firefighter.</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers in the United Kingdom are preparing to view a total lunar eclipse, which will cause the full moon to take on a reddish hue, known as a "Blood Moon." The spectacle occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow on the lunar surface. Visibility in the UK will be limited and dependent on location, with eastern regions getting the best view as the moon rises. Astronomers encourage the public to watch, noting it's a chance to see the solar system's mechanics in action without special equipment.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been canonized as the Catholic Church's first millennial saint. Known for his technological skills, Acutis created a website to document Eucharistic miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican fast-tracked his sainthood, recognizing two miracles attributed to his intercession, in a move seen as an effort to connect with and inspire younger generations of Catholics. His preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, has become a major pilgrimage site in Assisi, Italy.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as the new prime minister of Thailand following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. His appointment comes after the previous prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was dismissed by a court order, marking a significant shift away from the nation's dominant political dynasty. Anutin secured the position with backing from the main opposition, the People's Party, on the condition that he dissolves parliament and calls for new elections within four months. The 58-year-old conservative is known for previously championing Thailand's cannabis decriminalization.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the US Open has transformed from a traditional tennis tournament into a large-scale cultural event, akin to festivals like Coachella, prioritizing consumption and social media presence. The focus has shifted to high-priced novelty items like the $23 Honey Deuce cocktail, celebrity sightings managed like assets, and influencer marketing, which are becoming as central as the tennis itself. While this evolution has driven record attendance and engagement, it also reflects a broader trend in sports where the spectacle of being seen at an event has become a primary draw.</p>

With a reported range of at least 1,000km, these drones could potentially strike targets deep within mainland China.

          <p>This opinion article by Simon Tisdall argues that world leaders who attempt to appease Donald Trump ultimately fail to secure lasting benefits, citing examples from France, India, and the EU. The author contends that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's "Trump-whisperer act" ahead of a state visit has yielded little for Britain while incurring high reputational costs. The piece suggests that resistance and strength, as shown by leaders in Brazil and China, are more effective ways to handle Trump. It concludes by urging Starmer to abandon a subservient approach and stand up for UK values.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists from the US and China has developed an innovative method for launching tiny, millimeter-scale robots by harnessing the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. The process, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat a surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that violently collapse, creating a powerful launching force. This technique can propel small jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. By controlling the laser, researchers can direct the launch or even make the small objects swim, opening new possibilities for micro-robotics.</p>
