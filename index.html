          <p>Student loan borrowers seeking Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are encountering significant new obstacles. Key challenges include potential eligibility changes from a Trump executive order, a major backlog in processing applications for new repayment plans after the SAVE plan was defunct, and long delays in the 'Buyback' program, which allows borrowers to purchase credit for past periods of nonpayment. These administrative hurdles are making it increasingly difficult for government and non-profit employees to access the debt cancellation they have been working towards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to impose an additional 25% tariff on India for its continued purchases of Russian oil, which would bring the total tariff rate to 50%. This measure, set to take effect in late August, represents one of the highest tariff rates imposed by the U.S. and is part of a broader strategy to economically pressure nations that undermine sanctions against Russia. India's foreign ministry has condemned the move as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," stating it will take necessary actions to protect its national interests.</p>

Officials confirmed that a suspect was taken into custody by the Army's Criminal Investigative Division, and there is no longer an active threat to the community. The incident prompted a temporary lockdown of the base, which is the largest Army installation east of the Mississippi River. The wounded service members were treated on-site before being transported to a hospital for further care, and an investigation into the shooting is now underway.</p>

          <p>A group of approximately 15 men armed with baseball bats attacked a taco truck and its patrons in South Los Angeles, resulting in at least six injuries. One of the truck's workers was hospitalized with abrasions and lacerations, while five others were also treated for injuries. The employees, who have operated at the same location for nearly 15 years without incident, have started a GoFundMe page to support the victims. The motive for the attack is still under investigation by the LAPD, and no arrests have been made.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of a Minnesota nurse, initially reported as a suicide, pivoted to a murder charge based on a crucial piece of evidence: a small metal ring from the bathroom door's lock. Detectives found the piece underneath the victim's body, which contradicted the suspect's claim that he broke down the door after hearing the gunshot. This discovery suggested the door was forced open before the victim, Alexandra Pennig, was shot, leading to the arrest and eventual conviction of her acquaintance, Matthew Ecker, for second-degree murder.</p>

          <p>The political standoff over Texas redistricting has escalated dramatically, with Democratic lawmakers who fled to Illinois receiving a bomb threat at their hotel. The lawmakers were evacuated but stated they would not be intimidated. This occurred as Texas Governor Greg Abbott filed an emergency petition with the state supreme court to declare the top House Democrat's seat vacant. The conflict stems from a Republican effort, at Donald Trump's request, to redraw congressional maps in their favor, which Democrats are blocking by denying a legislative quorum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities for retirement planning. It explains that while both are considered low-risk options, they serve different purposes. CDs offer simplicity, FDIC protection, and flexibility, making them suitable for short-term savings and capital preservation. Annuities, however, are specifically designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, offering a crucial hedge against the risk of outliving one's savings. For many retirees, a combination of both financial products can provide a balanced strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite nearly two years of devastating war, Hamas has managed to maintain a system for paying salaries to approximately 30,000 civil servants in Gaza. Using a secret, cash-based distribution network, the group pays out a fraction of pre-war salaries, causing resentment among recipients struggling with soaring inflation and severe food shortages. A senior Hamas source told the BBC that the group had stockpiled around $700 million in cash in underground tunnels before the war began, which has allowed it to continue these payments.</p>
