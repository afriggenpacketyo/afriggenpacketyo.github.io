          <p>New media reports allege that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to gather personal information about his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, in 2011. These claims surface as King Charles III faces increasing pressure to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following Andrew's decision to relinquish his other royal and military honors. The controversy stems from his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and allegations of sexual assault, which Prince Andrew has consistently denied, previously settling a civil case with Ms. Giuffre out of court.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture and Lufthansa, have recently announced job cuts, attributing the layoffs to the increased adoption of artificial intelligence. However, some critics and academics argue that AI is being used as a convenient "scapegoat" for downsizing that may stem from other factors, such as overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent research from institutions like Yale University and the New York Fed suggests that AI has not yet led to mass structural unemployment, challenging the narrative that the technology is the primary driver of current workforce reductions.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from the BBC, has culminated in the conviction of 14 individuals involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The company, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), defrauded over 3,500 victims, most of whom were elderly, by using high-pressure sales tactics and a "bait-and-switch" scam. The scheme's ringleader, Mark Rowe, was sentenced to seven-and-a-half years in prison, with prosecutors now working to recover the assets gained through the elaborate criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The co-founder of betting company Betfred has stated that a significant increase in gambling taxes could force the closure of all its 1,287 UK shops, placing 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers raising taxes on the industry, a move proponents argue could fund public services like child poverty reduction. The gambling sector contends that such a hike would render their high-street operations unprofitable and drive customers to unregulated offshore betting sites. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea is actively cultivating relationships with Southeast Asian countries, notably Vietnam and Laos, in an effort to counteract its international isolation under heavy sanctions. Recent high-profile visits by Vietnamese and Laotian officials to Pyongyang for the Workers' Party anniversary signal a diplomatic success for the regime. Analysts believe these partnerships could help North Korea evade sanctions and secure material goods, while offering limited but strategic political and economic engagement for its Southeast Asian counterparts.</p>

Over the past several decades, the Baijitan National Nature Reserve has implemented extensive sand control and afforestation projects, stabilizing a vast area of once-drifting dunes. These efforts have safeguarded the major city of Yinchuan and crucial agricultural areas from the threat of the encroaching desert.</p>

          <p>The 20th-ranked USC Trojans suffered a significant setback in their quest for a College Football Playoff berth, losing 34-24 to Notre Dame in a rain-drenched rivalry game. USC's performance was marred by key offensive mistakes, with head coach Lincoln Riley taking responsibility for poor play calls, including a critical fumble on a trick play late in the game. The Trojans' run defense also faltered, allowing Notre Dame to dominate on the ground and control the contest, leaving USC with no margin for error for the rest of the season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Marine Corps conducted a live-fire event at Camp Pendleton, prompting the temporary closure of a major section of the 5 Freeway in Southern California on Saturday. The demonstration, attended by Vice President JD Vance, involved firing live munitions over the busy highway, a decision California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned as dangerous and an "absurd show of force." The California Highway Patrol recommended the closure, citing "extreme life safety risk" for the tens of thousands of drivers who use the route daily.</p>
