        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has expressed strong disapproval of Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund's decision to divest from American manufacturer Caterpillar. The fund cited concerns over the company's alleged links to the conflict in the Gaza Strip, a move the U.S. State Department called "illegitimate." Norwegian officials emphasized that the fund's investment decisions are made independently by Norges Bank and are not political. The divestment has drawn criticism from U.S. politicians, highlighting the complex intersection of international finance, corporate ethics, and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>During a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reiterated false claims about vaccines, including agreeing with a new appointee that mRNA shots pose a dangerous risk. His testimony drew criticism from senators who pointed out his actions contradict earlier promises not to discourage vaccinations. The hearing took place amid a leadership crisis at the CDC, where the director was recently fired, and senior officials resigned citing the politicization of public health. Kennedy also defended his overhaul of a key CDC vaccine advisory panel, claiming he removed conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Ford's redesigned, three-row Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up 53.7% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years.

The strong demand for the Expedition, a key profit driver for Ford, indicates a persistent market for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. This trend aligns with Ford's strategy of prioritizing hybrid models alongside its EV development, positioning it differently from competitors.</p>

          <p>The city of Washington, D.C., has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, arguing that the deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement duties is unconstitutional and unlawful.

The legal action seeks a permanent injunction to halt the deployment, which was initiated as part of a broader crackdown on crime in U.S. cities.

The book argues that this practice, rooted in West and Central African religions, has deeply influenced American culture, from culinary traditions to the development of blues music. Stewart traces how Black women, as the primary practitioners of this domestic art, shaped American approaches to medicine, childbirth, and community care.

          <p>Aberdeenshire Council in Scotland has suspended its operation to remove saltire flags from public lampposts after council employees were subjected to threats and intimidation. The flags were put up as part of a social media campaign linked to anti-asylum seeker protest groups. The council, along with others like Falkirk Council, stated the flags were unauthorized and posed a safety risk, and will now request police assistance to resume the removals. The incident highlights growing tensions surrounding national identity and immigration, mirroring similar flag-raising campaigns that have occurred in England.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that his government is exploring the implementation of a digital ID system as a potential tool to address illegal immigration. He suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for people to enter the UK without authorization by making it harder to work illegally. Acknowledging that the public debate has evolved since a previous, controversial physical ID card scheme was scrapped, Starmer noted that people are now more accustomed to digital forms of identification. Officials are reportedly studying Estonia's extensive digital ID system as a possible model.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.5%, down from 6.56% the previous week, according to Freddie Mac. This marks the lowest level for this key borrowing rate since October of the prior year, a trend that could increase purchasing power for prospective homebuyers. The decline is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions heavily influence the bond markets.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of properties classified as "farms" by the USDA do not actually function as commercial agricultural operations, according to a new analysis. The USDA's broad definition allows properties to be counted as farms even with zero sales if they meet certain criteria, a system originally intended to account for bad crop years. However, this includes many hobby farms and properties categorized as agricultural for tax benefits, with over 25% of US farms reporting no sales. This inflated number is often used by industry lobbyists to argue against environmental regulations and secure subsidies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will withdraw a proposed rule from the previous administration that would have required airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays and cancellations caused by the carriers. The Biden-era proposal sought payments ranging from $200 to $775 for domestic flight disruptions, a measure strongly opposed by U.S. airlines. The Department of Transportation stated the withdrawal is consistent with its current priorities. This move reverses a key consumer protection initiative, aligning with other actions the administration has taken to roll back previous airline regulations.</p>
