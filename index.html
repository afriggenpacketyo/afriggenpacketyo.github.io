          <p>Germany's new coalition government, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is cracking down on illegal immigration at its border with Austria, implementing stricter controls and turning back asylum-seekers who don't meet vulnerability criteria. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt emphasized the government's commitment to stopping criminal people smugglers and ensuring order, deploying additional police officers and advanced surveillance technology. This policy shift reflects a departure from former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open asylum policy and responds to the electoral successes of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), although it has faced criticism from neighboring countries like Poland.</p>

          <p>A bronze sculpture of Melania Trump, located near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with police investigating the theft reported on Tuesday. Residents speculate the statue was either vandalized or melted down for cash, with little belief it was politically motivated. The statue, which replaced a wooden version set on fire in 2020, had been commissioned by American artist Brad Downey as an interrogation of President Trumpâ€™s immigration policies, but it never gained much affection from the locals.</p>

          <p>Two North Korean fishermen, who "accidentally defected" to South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, have been stranded for over three months, longer than any other reluctant defectors in history. Despite their repeated requests for repatriation, North Korea has refused to communicate with South Korea, reflecting strained relations and Pyongyang's displeasure with Seoul's hard-line policies. Experts suggest the men may remain stuck until relations improve, though they could eventually change their minds about returning, especially given the potential repercussions for their families back home.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago, revealing connections between languages, traditions, and genetic codes of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today. The study sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, finding that early settlers split into isolated groups, adapting to different environmental settings. These findings provide a deeper understanding of South American communities and underscore the importance of ancestral knowledge for people's identities.</p>

          <p>Automatic gunfire was heard in central Gaza early Saturday morning, hours after the Israeli military announced its forces had begun mobilizing for a broader advance into the territory. The origin of the gunfire remains unknown, and the fighting has prompted some civilians to flee westward, as mediators seek to broker a new temporary truce. Despite the immense toll of Israel's military campaign since October 2023, which has resulted in over 50,000 deaths, Hamas continues to resist, and the conflict persists.</p>
