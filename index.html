          <p>President Trump has announced that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino will also take on the role of leading the Presidential Personnel Office. This appointment places Scavino in charge of selecting and appointing a vast number of government positions. The administrative shakeup occurs as the White House and Democrats are in a contentious standoff over a government shutdown, with both sides blaming the other for the failure to pass a spending bill. The President has also directed the War Secretary to ensure military members are paid despite the shutdown.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is primarily fueled by a disagreement over extending enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits. Democrats insist on extending these subsidies before the November 1st open enrollment period, while Republicans argue there is more time as they don't expire until December. With polls showing broad public support for the extension across party lines, insurance commissioners warn that failing to act quickly could cause consumers to see massive premium hikes, potentially leading millions to become uninsured. The subsidies are popular but represent a significant cost to the federal government.</p>

          <p>Another collision has occurred in the disputed South China Sea, with the Chinese and Philippine coastguards providing conflicting accounts of the incident. China's coastguard claimed a Philippine ship dangerously approached its vessel despite repeated warnings, stating the Philippines bears full responsibility for the collision. Chinese forces reported they took control measures and expelled the Philippine vessels from the area near Sandy Cay. The incident is the latest in a series of confrontations in the contested waters surrounding the Spratly Islands, which both nations claim.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic party's attachment to traditional political etiquette and restraint is a significant disadvantage in the current political climate. The author suggests that this "cult of congeniality" leaves the party ill-equipped to counter the norm-breaking tactics of its opponents. Citing examples like Governor Gavin Newsom's aggressive countermoves on redistricting, the piece contends that Democrats must strategically embrace nonviolent disruption and spectacle to effectively defend democratic institutions. The author concludes that abandoning outdated decorum may be necessary to keep liberal democracy alive.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Considers Selling Federal Student Loan Debt to Private Sector</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 07:00:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in the Trump administration are exploring the possibility of selling parts of the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio to private investors. This move aligns with a broader goal of reducing government involvement in the student loan system but raises significant concerns among experts. Critics warn that such a sale could strip borrowers of important consumer protections and eliminate the government's ability to offer loan forgiveness. The plan is seen by some as an ideologically driven effort to shrink the Department of Education, potentially at the expense of borrowers' financial well-being.</p>

          <p>The annual Chicago Marathon is taking place amid community anxiety due to increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in the city under a federal initiative called "Operation Midway Blitz." Organizers, runners, and local business owners remain optimistic, though some undocumented runners have expressed fear about participating in public events. Community groups have been educating residents on their rights and will be present at the marathon as a precaution. Mayor Brandon Johnson encouraged residents to celebrate the event as a form of resistance against what he termed federal intimidation.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has strongly criticized a recent threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods, calling it a "typical example of US double standards." The statement came after Beijing tightened its export rules for rare earths, a move Trump labeled as hostile. China defended its export controls as a measure to safeguard national security and warned it is "not afraid" of a trade war, stating it could implement its own countermeasures if the U.S. proceeds with the new tariffs, further escalating tensions between the two economic powers.</p>

The author reflects on the gut-wrenching testimonies from parents whose children were severely damaged by the therapy, juxtaposing their stories with the legal argument that a therapist's conversation constitutes speech that should not be regulated based on its viewpoint.</p>

          <p>Ian Watkins, the disgraced former frontman of the rock band Lostprophets, has died at the age of 48 after being attacked in prison. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence at HMP Wakefield for a series of horrific child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. West Yorkshire Police confirmed they were called to the prison on Saturday morning following reports of a serious assault and have since arrested two men on suspicion of murder. Watkins' crimes, described by the sentencing judge as plunging to "new depths of depravity," led to the immediate disbandment of his successful band.</p>

          <p>Madagascar is facing a potential coup after President Andry Rajoelina announced that an "attempt to seize power illegally" was underway. The warning came after an elite military unit known as CAPSAT declared it was now in control of the entire armed forces. The situation escalated when some soldiers from the unit left their barracks to join large anti-government protests in the capital, Antananarivo. The protests, initially led by youth over power and water shortages, have grown into a broader movement demanding political change amid a severe cost-of-living crisis.</p>

          <h2>EU Doubles Steel Tariffs in Strategic Move to Counter US Protectionism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed doubling its tariffs to 50% for steel imports that exceed a newly reduced quota, a move that mirrors recent U.S. trade policy. This decision is aimed at protecting the struggling European steel industry from global overproduction, which has been largely blamed on China. However, the move is also seen as a strategic effort to gain leverage with the United States. By aligning its tariff policy with Washington's, Brussels hopes to pressure the Trump administration into negotiations that could lead to concessions for European steel exports to the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>China's automobile dealers are experiencing a severe financial squeeze, with many operating at huge losses and facing the threat of failure. An intense price war initiated by car manufacturers, combined with increasing competition from direct-to-consumer e-commerce models, has crippled their profitability. According to the China Passenger Car Association, the country's 14 major dealer groups saw a 10% sales decline in the first half of 2025. Industry bodies are now urging banks and financial institutions to provide support to stabilize the struggling car distribution sector.</p>

          <p>According to a new report, the United States has been providing intelligence to help Ukraine conduct long-range drone attacks on Russian energy facilities. This joint effort is reportedly aimed at damaging Russia's economy and compelling President Vladimir Putin to enter negotiations to end the war. U.S. intelligence allegedly assists with crucial details for the missions, including route planning and identifying vulnerabilities in Russian air defenses. While Ukrainian officials select the targets, the report suggests Washington is closely involved in the planning stages of these significant strikes.</p>

          <p>The European Union is phasing in its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) to monitor the entry and departure of non-EU citizens from the 29-country Schengen Area. This system will eventually replace manual passport stamping and requires travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial image, on their first use. While the goal is to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, there are concerns about potential delays and queues at borders, such as the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals, during the initial implementation period.</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has affirmed its goal of Welsh independence but clarified that it would not hold a referendum within the first term of a government it leads. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth announced a plan to establish a "standing commission" to engage the public in a national conversation about the country's constitutional future. This commission would be tasked with preparing a white paper detailing a formal path toward independence, a step the party views as part of a longer journey to be pursued when the time is right.</p>
