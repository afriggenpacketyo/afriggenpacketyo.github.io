          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that new investors should consider buying Broadcom, despite a slight dip in its stock price following a strong quarterly earnings report, citing the company's impressive AI business and long-term potential.

Cramer acknowledges the challenges Apple has faced, including the rocky rollout of its AI features, but believes the stock has the potential to bounce back.

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow the continuation of efforts to dismantle the Department of Education and proceed with laying off over 1,000 employees. This request is part of ongoing legal disputes with states, school districts, and teachers unions challenging the administration's plans. A federal judge previously blocked the layoffs, citing a violation of the separation of powers, as the administration's actions were seen as a unilateral effort to close the department. The Justice Department argues that the lower court overstepped its jurisdiction by interfering with the Executive Branch's management decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California FAIR Plan, the state's insurer of last resort for fire coverage, operates with a high degree of secrecy, withholding financial data and holding closed-door meetings. This lack of transparency is raising concerns as new rules allow the plan to collect funds from member companies, potentially impacting all property insurance ratepayers. A CBS News California review found that the FAIR Plan is far more secretive than similar plans in other states, and a Department of Insurance audit directed the board to increase transparency, but little has changed. The plan's growing role in fire insurance, fueled by non-renewals from major insurers, makes its secrecy a significant issue for California homeowners.</p>

          <p>House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington refutes Elon Musk's assertion that President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" is filled with "pork." Arrington explains that the budget reconciliation process does not involve discretionary spending or earmarks, which are typically associated with pork barrel spending. He clarifies that the bill deals with mandatory spending programs, such as entitlements, healthcare, welfare, and the tax code. Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller echoed this, stating that the bill cuts taxes, secures the border, and reforms welfare, with no pork included.</p>

          <p>A House GOP bill proposing cuts to Medicaid and changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) could result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage. Proposed work requirements for Medicaid eligibility could cause 5.2 million adults to lose coverage, with estimates suggesting that the number of uninsured could increase by 4.8 million. The bill also includes measures that would create state Medicaid funding challenges, reduce ACA enrollment, and add administrative hurdles to eligibility and enrollment, further contributing to coverage losses. The expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies would also increase costs for those remaining in marketplace plans.</p>

          <p>Meta has removed numerous advertisements promoting "nudify" apps, which use AI to create sexually explicit deepfakes, after a CBS News investigation uncovered hundreds of such ads on its platforms. The ads, found on Instagram and other Meta platforms, promoted the ability to upload photos and create nude images of real people, sometimes using deepfake images of celebrities. Meta stated that it has strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery and has blocked the URLs associated with these apps, but acknowledged that combating the spread of AI-generated content is an ongoing challenge. The ads were often targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65 in the U.S., EU, and UK.</p>

Advances in AI-fueled chatbots and automation may lead to fewer opportunities at the bottom of the career ladder. While current job market challenges for graduates may also stem from economic conditions and trade policies, the capacity of AI to perform written and computational tasks poses a risk to certain entry-level roles.
