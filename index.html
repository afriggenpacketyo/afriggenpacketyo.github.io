          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas for overseas workers already in the country. The government expects these changes to result in up to 50,000 fewer lower-skilled visas issued over the next year. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp criticized the plans as insufficient, advocating for an annual migration cap.</p>

          <p>The article examines the Trump administration's inconsistent application of the concept of "freedom of choice," promoting it in consumer markets while restricting it in political and social spheres. While advocating for more consumer options through deregulation, the administration has curtailed political and intellectual freedoms. This shift reflects a new form of authoritarianism that prioritizes consumer choice over broader civil and political rights. The author argues that Trump is making himself the nation's premier "choice architect," limiting options and narrowing parameters in non-consumer domains.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for a second day of negotiations aimed at easing trade tensions. The talks have significant implications for the global economy, which has been disrupted by tariffs imposed by both countries. Trump has signaled a willingness to lower tariffs if China makes concessions, but China has remained steadfast in its position. Economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a quick deal.</p>

          <p>Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban is leading a smear campaign against Ukraine, urging citizens to vote against its EU accession. This campaign involves spreading misinformation about Ukraine being a center for drug trafficking and organized crime. Orban's motives are primarily linked to domestic politics, as he faces growing opposition and seeks to discredit political rivals. The anti-Ukrainian stance also aligns with Orban's pro-Russian sentiments and nostalgic views of reclaiming historical territories.</p>

          <p>This article examines the ways in which some US news organizations have appeared to bend to Donald Trump's will, often driven by billionaire owners seeking to stay in his good graces. Despite this, Trump continues to attack the media, accusing them of "illegal" reporting. Examples include the Washington Post overhauling its editorial pages and ABC News settling a lawsuit brought by Trump. The article questions whether journalists can continue to resist pressure from owners and top management.</p>

          <p>Pakistan’s Chinese-made weapons have demonstrated strength against India’s Western and Russian arms in the recent Kashmir conflict. Tensions escalated after India conducted military strikes in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a terrorist attack. While India reportedly deployed French-made Rafale jets, Pakistan claimed to have shot down several Indian aircraft, including Rafales. Analysts caution it is too soon to determine which side’s arms technology will prove superior in combat.</p>

Two couples, Charlotte and Raffi, along with another couple, moved into adjacent townhouses to support each other in raising their children. This arrangement provides a modern take on the extended family, offering mutual support and shared responsibilities. While there are challenges, such as differing parenting styles, the benefits of companionship and shared caregiving outweigh the drawbacks for these families.</p>

          <p>This article is an interview with a researcher on the phenomenon of doomsday prepping in America, discussing its roots in American identity and self-sufficiency. The conversation explores the spectrum of prepping, from high-end kits marketed to Silicon Valley elites to more common emergency preparedness measures. The researcher argues that prepping is an American institution rooted in self-reliance, particularly in response to inadequate government responses to disasters. The interview also touches on the role of conspicuous consumption and the motivations of the ultra-wealthy in preparing for the end of the world.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are set to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the evolving trade agreement with the Trump administration. The wider aerospace industry would have “a specific guarantee of zero tariffs” in the agreement. The US is investigating whether imported aircraft and parts represent a threat to national security, which could pave the way for higher tariffs. However, the aerospace and aviation industry has been lobbying the White House to retain a 45-year-old treaty that allowed aircraft and parts to be traded duty-free across borders.</p>

The government has also amended a law to allow entire parties to be tried for crimes, not just individual members.
