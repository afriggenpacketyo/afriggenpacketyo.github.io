          <p>A Saudi-backed boxing event recently transformed Times Square, featuring fighters who were transported from a nearby hotel in a fleet of cars, including TeÃ³fimo LÃ³pez, who arrived in a traditional yellow taxicab. The vehicles navigated through regular traffic, stopping at traffic lights before reaching the ring, creating a unique and shortened ringwalk experience for the fighters. The event, captured in a series of photographs, showcased the spectacle of professional boxing amidst the iconic backdrop of Times Square. The photographs were taken by Cris Esqueda, Golden Boy, and Getty Images.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst a challenging global landscape influenced by the second Trump administration, deciding whether to grant Prime Minister Anthony Albanese a second term. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, despite Australia's historical reputation as a stable, recession-proof country. While both Albanese and opposition leader Peter Dutton have acknowledged these challenges, their proposed solutions have been viewed as small-scale, with voters expressing dissatisfaction with the major parties and increasingly turning to independent candidates. The article notes a shift away from major parties and a focus on bread-and-butter issues, '(not investment advice)'.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar, which had exceeded its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows.

This action occurred ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further increase capital inflow to Hong Kong.

          <p>A 25% import tax on key car parts entering the US has come into force, increasing pressure on the automotive industry amidst ongoing policy changes. While President Trump eased the measure somewhat in response to business concerns, the tariff is intended to incentivize domestic manufacturing. Analysts predict the tariffs will lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers, despite a current sales surge driven by concerns about future price hikes. Companies like GM are warning of billions in new costs due to the tariffs, while others are withdrawing financial guidance due to market uncertainties.</p>
