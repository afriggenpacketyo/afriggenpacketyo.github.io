            <p>The death toll in attacks in Nigeria's central Benue state has risen to 56, with the governor citing the figure while visiting villages attacked by gunmen. The attacks, blamed on suspected herdsmen, are part of a larger pattern of intercommunal violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt. Clashes between nomadic cattle herders and settled farmers over land use have become increasingly common, often taking on a religious dimension. Amnesty International has criticized the Nigerian government for failing to stem the violence.</p>
