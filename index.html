          <p>North Korea has amended its space development law, lifting a ban on the military use of space for national defense purposes. Analysis by 38 North, a U.S.-based organization, reveals that language opposing the militarization of space has been removed from the law. The revised law now includes a warning that countermeasures will be taken against any country attempting unfriendly acts. North Korea claims to have successfully placed a reconnaissance satellite into orbit in 2023, emphasizing its active promotion of space capabilities, and the amendment suggests a maturing space strategy.</p>

          <p>Commencement season in the United States is marked by concerns over the Trump administration's conflicts with universities. Speakers at commencement ceremonies are addressing Trump's efforts to control federal funding, campus protests, and international student admissions. Some speakers have delivered remarks criticizing Trump, leading to backlash and concerns about universities attracting unwanted attention. The situation is creating an atmosphere of 'insidious fear' within universities as they navigate the administration's increasing control over academic institutions, which has made it harder for universities to speak out.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order that cut federal funding to media outlets deemed "biased" by President Trump. The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, citing Trump's statements about NPR and PBS being "leftwing propaganda" as evidence of viewpoint-based discrimination. NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, asserts that the lawsuit is a matter of necessity and principle to defend freedom of speech and the press.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of Tibetan Plateau populations. Scientists analyzed ancient DNA to understand the origins of the 20% of the Tibetan genetic composition that is not linked to northern Chinese populations. The study fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that tough public spending choices are "unavoidable" as the government finalizes spending plans for various sectors. The level of spending on health will significantly impact potential cuts to "unprotected" areas outside the NHS, defense, and schools. While funding increased in 2024, it will no longer rise year-on-year, given government commitments, leading to concerns about underfunding critical plans. The upcoming Spending Review will outline departmental budgets and investments, with speculation that spending cuts are likely due to the government's fiscal stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Theoharis and Sandweiss-Back argue that amidst Trump's proposed legislative cuts, it's time to fight for a new social contract that uplifts those at the bottom of society. Drawing insights from past poor people's movements, they emphasize the need for greater discipline, sacrifice, perseverance, and patience. They highlight the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The authors propose four strategic principles for harnessing the transformational power of poor and dispossessed people.</p>

          <p>Starting in June, some Social Security beneficiaries may see smaller checks due to the resumption of student loan garnishments. The Trump administration announced that the U.S. Department of Education would resume collection activity on defaulted student loans. Over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers age 62 and older are in default and likely to be receiving Social Security benefits. However, there are multiple options available for borrowers to stop these payment offsets, including rehabilitation, consolidation, or challenging the garnishment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced late Saturday that he is withdrawing the nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, an associate of Trump adviser Elon Musk, to lead NASA, saying he reached the decision after a "thorough review" of Isaacman's "prior associations." It was unclear what Trump meant and the White House did not immediately respond to an emailed request for an explanation. He is the CEO and founder of Shift4, a credit card processing company. He also bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX and conducted the first private spacewalk. SpaceX has extensive contracts with NASA.</p>
