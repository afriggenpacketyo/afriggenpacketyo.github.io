          <p>With a government shutdown looming, negotiations between President Trump and Democratic leaders have stalled, increasing the likelihood of a shutdown. Both sides are blaming each other, with Democrats demanding healthcare concessions and Republicans pushing for a clean continuing resolution. House and Senate Democrats are united in their stance, while Republicans are trying to pass a stop-gap measure. The meeting marked the first bicameral, bipartisan congressional leadership face-to-face meeting of Trump’s second term, but it appears to have yielded little progress.

Robert MacIntyre emphasized the team's unity and willingness to follow Donald's lead, contrasting with the more individualistic approach of the US team.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto is expected to bring dangerous surf to the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda, with tropical storm conditions possible in Bermuda. The swells will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, according to the National Hurricane Center. Simultaneously, Tropical Storm Imelda is forecast to become a hurricane and move away from the southeastern U.S., bringing heavy rain to parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.
