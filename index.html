          <p>In its 19th annual study, CNBC has ranked all 50 U.S. states to determine the best locations for business, using 135 metrics across 10 distinct categories of competitiveness. The methodology, developed in consultation with business and policy experts, is based on data states use to attract corporate investment, with "Economy" being the most heavily weighted category this year. For 2025, the study introduced new metrics to assess risks from trade wars and a shrinking federal budget, while also enhancing its evaluation of infrastructure to meet modern power and data demands.</p>

          <p>Police in south Belfast have declared a major incident over a large bonfire built for the annual Twelfth of July celebrations, a key date in Northern Ireland's parading season. The structure's proximity to a major electricity substation has raised serious concerns it could endanger the power supply to two major hospitals. Authorities are attempting to dismantle the bonfire, leading to heightened tensions with local community members and bonfire builders who view it as a cherished cultural tradition and an attack on their heritage.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' shares surged after it reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and provided a stronger-than-expected forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while demand is lower than initially forecast, bookings have stabilized, with travelers booking closer to their travel dates. The airline's performance was bolstered by strong sales in premium seats and its lucrative American Express partnership, despite a dip in main cabin revenue and a downward revision of its full-year earnings forecast from January's optimistic prediction.

He challenges the notion that fewer people is the primary solution to environmental issues, citing examples where environmental quality improved alongside population growth due to policy and technology changes. Spears advocates for a thoughtful, non-alarmist conversation about encouraging higher birth rates, suggesting that societal support for families and greater gender equality are crucial first steps.</p>

From "The Day the Earth Stood Still" to "Dr. Strangelove" and "The Day After," these films created a cultural vocabulary for the atomic threat that is largely absent for younger generations. The author argues that as the nuclear threat persists but public fear has faded, new films are needed to remind society of the stakes and spur the serious public discussion that these earlier movies once inspired.</p>

          <p>A joint operation between Romanian police and the UK's tax authority, HMRC, has targeted an organized crime gang suspected of stealing millions in a sophisticated tax refund scam. Armed raids in Bucharest resulted in thirteen arrests, with another man arrested in Preston, UK. The gang allegedly used phishing to steal the personal data of over 1,000 British taxpayers, which they then used to make fraudulent claims for tax repayments and child benefits, laundering the stolen funds.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 50% tariff on copper imports, set to begin August 1, is raising alarms among economists about potential price increases for a wide range of goods. Copper is a crucial component in construction, electronics, appliances, and electric vehicles, and experts warn the tariff will inevitably be passed on to consumers. The administration argues the tariff is necessary to rebuild America's domestic copper industry, which it deems vital for national security and defense manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article contrasts the outcomes of recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas, highlighting the critical role of preparedness. While Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced a deadly flood, the community was somewhat prepared due to the known risks from recent wildfire "burn scars," mitigating a worse disaster. In contrast, the ferocity of the Texas flood caught officials by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll, illustrating how recent experience and awareness can dramatically shape a community's response to natural disasters.</p>

          <p>An analysis of letters from the Attorney General to tech companies reveals the Trump administration secretly claimed the "dispensing power," an ancient royal prerogative to exempt individuals from laws. The letters instructed companies to ignore the U.S. ban on TikTok, arguing the president can nullify legislation that interferes with his foreign policy duties. Legal scholars warn this claim is a dangerous and unconstitutional assertion of power, abolished in England in 1689, that could set a precedent for executive overreach.</p>
