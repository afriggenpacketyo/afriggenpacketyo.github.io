According to Greek government data, Chinese citizens constitute the largest group of participants, accounting for nearly half of all first-time permit holders. This trend is also reflected in visa renewals, where Chinese nationals make up over 60% of the total. The influx of investment has brought both visible and subtle changes to the Greek capital's economy and property market.</p>

The move aims to end decades of discussion and address frustrations from European partners over Germany's slow responses, a need highlighted by the war in Ukraine.

          <p>Researchers from the Bank of China are voicing concerns about the sustainability of Washington's expanding national debt, leading to calls for Beijing to reduce its exposure to US dollar assets. China has already been trimming its holdings of U.S. Treasuries to their lowest level since 2009. The researchers suggest a gradual adjustment of these holdings while advocating for an increase in reserves of gold and other key strategic resources to mitigate financial risks.
