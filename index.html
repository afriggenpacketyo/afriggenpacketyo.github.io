          <p>President Trump stated that he considers Sean “Diddy” Combs “sort of half-innocent” but finds a potential pardon “more difficult” due to Combs’s past hostile comments against him. The discussion follows Combs's recent conviction for transportation to engage in prostitution, with Trump acknowledging that the music mogul's prior criticism complicates any decision on clemency. This situation arises amid Trump's established pattern of pardoning political supporters, making his hesitation in this case notable due to the personal nature of the past remarks.</p>

The author shares her personal story of finding a fulfilling community, or "squad," in her children after experiencing significant loss and loneliness in her youth. She pushes back against a prevailing narrative that frames motherhood solely as a difficult sacrifice, advocating instead for women to openly celebrate the positive and life-giving aspects of parenting without diminishing its challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff met with families of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv, personally committing to work toward their release as protests urged the Israeli government to secure a deal. The meeting occurred as families expressed anguish over new videos of the captives released by Hamas, with around 20 hostages believed to still be alive nearly 22 months into the war. The article also notes the ongoing violence and desperation surrounding humanitarian aid distribution sites in Gaza, where dozens have been reported killed.</p>

          <p>President Trump fired Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after the July jobs report showed weaker-than-expected hiring and significant downward revisions for previous months. Trump alleged the numbers were manipulated for political purposes, a claim he made without providing evidence. The move drew immediate criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who warned that it threatens the integrity and public trust in crucial, nonpartisan economic data from a key federal agency.

          <p>A federal jury in Miami found Tesla partially liable for a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot technology, ordering the company to pay over $240 million in damages. The case involved a driver who, while distracted by his phone, crashed into a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs' lawyers successfully argued that Tesla's technology and marketing were flawed, a verdict that could encourage more lawsuits against the automaker as it develops its driverless taxi service.</p>

          <p>A Little League team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, was forced to miss the Senior League World Series after being denied travel visas to the United States. The team of 13- to 16-year-olds had won their Latin American qualifier but could not compete due to a U.S. proclamation restricting entry for citizens of several countries, including Venezuela. The decision has been called demoralizing for the young athletes and raises questions about exemptions for major sporting events, especially with the upcoming World Cup and Olympics in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A European Union proposal to penalize Israel for its actions in Gaza by restricting access to EU research funds has stalled due to a lack of consensus among the 27 member states. While countries like Spain and Ireland advocate for a tougher stance, others like Germany and Hungary have been hesitant, reflecting deep divisions within the bloc. Despite warnings of famine in Gaza and mounting pressure, the EU has struggled to agree on even minor punitive measures, highlighting its difficulty in forming a united policy on the conflict.</p>

Activists from the since-proscribed group Palestine Action claimed responsibility for the incident, which involved spray-painting the planes and causing an estimated £7 million in damage. Four individuals have already been charged in the case, which prompted a security review of all UK military bases and led to the government officially designating Palestine Action as a terrorist organization.</p>

Elliott, known for its experience in the tech and data center sectors, likely sees long-term value in Equinix's expansion plans, which are driven by the growth of artificial intelligence and cloud services, and may push for strategic or operational improvements.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should consistently message the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as proof that Donald Trump and the GOP protect powerful elites at the expense of ordinary Americans. The author suggests this narrative can connect the abstract scandal to everyday issues like economic inequality and a two-tiered justice system, resonating with voters who already feel the system is rigged. The piece advises relentless messaging on the issue to erode trust in Trump, even among his supporters, by highlighting his insider status.</p>

From 1969 to 1971, Indigenous activists occupied Alcatraz, a pivotal event that spurred major shifts in federal policy toward Native sovereignty and self-determination. Critics say using the site for detentions is an affront to this legacy and retraumatizing for a community that has historically faced violent displacement and incarceration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, the primary reason to pay for an early boarding upgrade on an airline is to secure overhead bin space for a carry-on suitcase. With airlines increasingly charging for checked bags, more travelers are bringing carry-ons, making bin space a premium commodity. While elite status or co-branded credit cards can grant priority boarding, travelers without these perks may find the add-on fee a valuable purchase to avoid having their bag gate-checked, especially on full flights.</p>
