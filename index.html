          <h2>UK Film Industry Faces Uncertainty as Trump's Proposed Tariffs Loom Over US-UK Trade Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 12:32:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on foreign-made films has sparked concerns within the UK film industry, potentially impacting the £1.36 billion sector and its 195,000 employees. The UK government is approaching trade negotiations with the US calmly, aiming to alleviate pressure on UK businesses. Industry experts warn that freelancers could face job losses if US productions are pulled from the UK, while some suggest that tariffs are not the solution to kick-starting the Hollywood film industry, citing factors like tax credits and changing audience habits. The uncertainty surrounding the details of the tariffs and their impact on co-productions adds to the worry within the UK film community.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared an imminent, forceful entry into Gaza, following security cabinet approval for deploying thousands more soldiers and relocating Palestinians southward. This escalation comes after months of stalled cease-fire talks and a blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza, criticized by aid groups for causing severe deprivation. Opponents argue the expanded military campaign endangers hostages and won't fundamentally alter the conflict's dynamics. The operation aims to pressure Hamas to release hostages and dismantle its infrastructure, but questions remain about its impact on the conflict's resolution and the safety of civilians and hostages.</p>

Participants must use the CBP Home app and will receive the stipend upon confirmed arrival in their country of origin.

The trial is expected to include sexually explicit evidence, including a surveillance tape showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who is slated to testify.

Sinner stated he didn't initially want to agree to a settlement, but chose the best option in a difficult situation. His ban expired just before the Italian Open, allowing him to compete in his home tournament. Sinner has a first-round bye and will face either Mariano Navone or Federico Cina in the second round.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans in Congress are struggling to reconcile deep divisions as they try to pass Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” which encompasses the bulk of his domestic agenda. The plan revolves around his 2017 tax cuts; Republicans want to permanently extend them before they expire at the end of the year, but they can’t agree on how to cover the more than $5 trillion price tag—or whether to cover it at all. The likeliest outcome, analysts say, is a bill that adds trillions to federal deficits, which could cause an already shaky economy to collapse. Republicans risk triggering economic instability by pushing for unfunded tax cuts and increased spending, potentially leading to a market downturn and higher interest rates. Economists warn that the GOP's fiscal plans could significantly worsen the national debt and undermine investor confidence.</p>

Ford has stopped exporting vehicles to China as a result of the tariffs, but Ford has not publicly announced any significant changes to its North American manufacturing plans.
