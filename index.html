            <p>Former Los Angeles Councilmember Kevin de León is facing an ethics fine for voting on city council decisions in which he had a financial interest and for failing to disclose income.

De León's spokesperson claims the matters involved homeless housing and health services, and that the outcomes would have been the same regardless. The Ethics Commission acknowledged De León's cooperation and lack of prior violations, but noted a concerning pattern of conduct.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans held in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, responding to concerns about due process.

Consumer advocates argue this is an attempt to avoid risk while collecting high premiums. The FAIR Plan has become overwhelmed due to increasing wildfire risks, leading to potential surcharges for all California homeowners. The plaintiffs seek three times the damages sustained.
