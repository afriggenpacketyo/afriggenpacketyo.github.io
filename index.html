            <h2>Customs System Glitch Creates Tariff Confusion for Freight Shippers</h2>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system used to exempt freight from tariffs has caused confusion and delays for freight shippers. The glitch affects the entry code used to exempt shipments, including those from China, leading Customs to advise filers to separate cargo release and financial filings. This issue raises concerns about Customs' ability to handle the rapidly changing tariff policies and collect revenue, with some shippers reporting they haven't been charged higher rates despite announcements of tariff increases. The situation has created uncertainty for businesses, forcing some to reconsider expansion plans amid fears of economic disruption. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Maryland has once again directed the Trump administration to "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The order comes after the Supreme Court largely upheld her original directive, but instructed her to clarify the wording. The Trump administration is asking for more time to respond, arguing that foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines. The case has become a high-stakes clash between the White House and the courts, raising questions about the administration's deportation policies. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>Frontier Airlines has announced cuts to its flight schedule after experiencing a drop in travel demand during March. The airline also lowered its first-quarter outlook, citing fare discounting and promotions across the industry.

            <p>The pilot of the sightseeing helicopter that crashed into New York’s Hudson River, killing all six aboard, reportedly sent a radio message moments earlier saying he was low on fuel and was heading back to the helipad.

Tributes were paid in Spain to Escobar, 49, chief executive of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, and his family, who were enjoying a sightseeing excursion of New York City. Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, said officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were on site and leading the investigation, and that the aircraft was not being monitored by air traffic controllers on the ground at the time it crashed.

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield has surged, reaching its highest level since February, as trade moves by President Trump cause investors to shift away from U.S. assets. The increase in yields has complicated the White House's approach to trade, prompting concerns about potential economic impacts. While some administration officials have downplayed the significance of the yield spike, analysts suggest it may have influenced the decision to pause tariffs on most countries. The bond market's reaction reflects broader anxieties about the economic outlook amid trade uncertainty. (not investment advice) Optimism score: 45</p>
