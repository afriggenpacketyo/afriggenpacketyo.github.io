          <h2>Intelligence Memo Contradicts Claims of Venezuelan Government Control Over Tren De Aragua Gang</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified U.S. intelligence memo reveals that the U.S. intelligence community does not believe Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro controls the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang, contradicting claims made by President Trump. The memo, obtained by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, indicates that while some members of the Maduro regime may tolerate or work with TDA, there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation or direction of the gang's activities, including the movement of migrants to the United States. The memo also challenges claims about the gang's power and reach, describing TDA as decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley introduced the Restoring Safeguards for Dangerous Abortion Drugs Act, seeking to impose stricter regulations on the abortion pill mifepristone, following a study suggesting adverse health effects in women using the drug. The bill proposes measures including requiring the FDA to create safeguards, allowing women to sue telehealth providers for complications, and banning foreign companies from importing the drug into the U.S. Hawley argues the FDA needs to act to protect women, citing a study indicating that approximately 1 in 10 women experience adverse health effects after using mifepristone. The introduction of this bill follows a request from Trump's Department of Justice to dismiss a case that could restrict access to mifepristone.</p>

          <p>DoorDash said Tuesday that demand for deliveries remained strong in the first quarter even as more Americans feel increasingly uneasy about the U.S. economy. Total orders climbed 18% to 732 million, a quarterly record. Demand for grocery delivery surpassed prior quarters. DoorDash also added U.S. restaurants to its platform and broadened its geographic reach. DoorDash confirmed that it will acquire Britain's Deliveroo for 2.9 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in cash, expanding its business in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</p>

The acquisition of Deliveroo will expand DoorDash's operations to 40 countries, while the purchase of SevenRooms aims to enhance its offerings to merchants and improve in-store sales and customer relations. DoorDash's revenue rose 21% to $3.03 billion, although this fell short of Wall Street expectations, and net income was $193 million.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military conducted strikes on the main airport in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, targeting runways, aircraft, and infrastructure, claiming the Houthis were using the airport to transfer weapons and operatives. The strikes followed a missile attack by the Iran-backed Houthi militia that landed near Israelâ€™s main airport, causing flight cancellations and prompting Israeli retaliation. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that anyone targeting Israel would be held accountable, while a Houthi official declared that the attacks were failed terrorism and vowed to continue supporting Gaza. The strikes have raised concerns about the impact on Yemeni civilians, who rely on the airport for essential connections to the outside world.</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a key Republican, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin as U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision is likely to prevent Martin's nomination from advancing out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Republicans and Democrats are evenly split. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire on May 20. The U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. prosecuted the January 6th cases before Trump issued blanket pardons to defendants in the cases on his first day back in the White House in January.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected President Trump's repeated suggestions that Canada should become the 51st U.S. state during an Oval Office meeting. Carney stated that Canada is "not for sale" and "won't be for sale, ever," countering Trump's romanticized view of merging the two countries. Despite the disagreement, Trump insisted that the rejection would not hinder trade negotiations and reiterated his stance by saying, 'never say never.' Their meeting, the first since Carney's Liberal Party won the federal election, addressed strained U.S.-Canada relations due to tariffs and border tensions.</p>

The Israeli military had issued warnings on social media, urging evacuation before the attack, and also targeted power stations and a cement factory. The Houthis have declared an air blockade on Israel and vowed to continue attacks, while Yemeni analysts suggest the bombardments will not deter the group.</p>

Buffett emphasized that the people one works with and admires are enormously important, as they shape habits and influence life's trajectory. He encouraged attendees to find jobs they enjoy and work for individuals they respect and can learn from, rather than focusing solely on lucrative trades or high-paying fields. Buffett noted that he preferred to work for himself, but if working for someone else, it should be with people who are wonderful to work with.</p>

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer and his allies are actively attempting to expand the Senate map, focusing on recruiting candidates capable of winning in traditionally Republican states in order to regain a majority in 2026. Despite growing optimism about midterm prospects due to President Trump's sagging approval rating, Democrats face the difficult reality of defending Republican-held seats, most of which are located in states that Trump won by significant margins in 2024. The strategy involves identifying and supporting candidates who can appeal to voters across the political spectrum, even in deeply conservative areas.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang was unlawful, marking the second such ruling. Judge Hellerstein granted a preliminary injunction in the case of two plaintiffs who were pulled off planes to El Salvador and transferred back to New York from Texas. He stated that the administration's invocation of the AEA lacked justification and violated the Constitutional requirements of due process. This decision follows a similar ruling in Texas, further challenging the administration's deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A woman visiting Boston claims that a security guard at the Liberty Hotel wrongly accused her of being a man in the women's restroom and forced her to leave during a Kentucky Derby party. The woman and her girlfriend, both cisgender, allege that after being escorted out, other women hurled insults at her, and security demanded they show IDs to prove their gender before asking them to leave the hotel. The Liberty Hotel issued a statement claiming the women were sharing a stall and engaged in physical altercations with security, which the couple denies. The incident has prompted discussions about discrimination and the experiences of transgender women, particularly amidst heightened tensions surrounding LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>A columnist discusses the difficulty of being a conservative critic of Trumpism, often finding agreement with Trumpworld on goals but disagreeing on methods, which pleases neither side. The author argues that the abuse of power is wrong, regardless of who wields it, and uses examples like media bias, the situation at Harvard, and threats to law firms and NATO to illustrate this point. The author suggests that the increasing ideological polarization of journalism and universities has led to a situation where extreme actions are seen as necessary corrections, but ultimately laments the hero-villain mindset that has fueled the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new vehicle registrations in Germany and Britain experienced significant declines in April, reaching their lowest levels in over two years, highlighting a broader trend of decreased demand for the U.S. automaker in Europe. The drop in sales is attributed to growing competition from European and Chinese electric vehicles, as well as public dissatisfaction with Elon Musk's political activities and policies. While new registrations of electric vehicles generally increased in both countries, Tesla's share of the market has slipped, indicating that the company's European issues are more deeply rooted than just a model changeover.</p>
