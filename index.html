          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's birth rate fell below 700,000 in 2024, marking a 5.7% decrease from the previous year, signaling a continued trend of delayed marriages and childbirths. The country's total fertility rate also reached a record low of 1.15, down from 1.20 in 2023, as reported by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Both the number of births and the fertility rate have declined for nine consecutive years, outpacing government projections by 15 years. While the number of marriages saw a slight increase, the natural decrease in population reached a record high, underscoring the severity of Japan's demographic challenges.</p>

          <p>European companies are facing potential production halts due to Chinese government restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing smartphones and electric vehicles. These measures, perceived as retaliation against US tariffs, have led to the EU Chamber of Commerce engaging with China's Ministry of Commerce. Thousands of export applications are under review, straining the ministry's resources and causing delays. While some approvals have been granted, many companies have been forced to cease production due to the export controls on dysprosium, gadolinium, lutetium, samarium, scandium, terbium, and yttrium.</p>

One family uses an old laptop screen and an electric motorcycle battery to power a television for limited entertainment.

          <p>President Donald Trump has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, reigniting concerns about supply chain disruptions and a prolonged global trade war. The move, which took effect Wednesday, suggests Trump intends to maintain his aggressive trade strategy despite potential price increases for consumers. While the UK secured an exemption, other countries are preparing retaliatory measures. Economists warn the tariffs could harm the US economy by raising prices and costing jobs in sectors that rely on these metals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's support for Nippon Steel's takeover bid for US Steel and promises of a "golden belt" for the industry, workers remain wary. Union leaders emphasize the need for written guarantees, citing past experiences of broken promises. Veterans of the steel sector express distrust of Trump's rhetoric, pointing to his history of flip-flopping on trade issues. Workers are concerned about job security and plant improvements, emphasizing that any deal must benefit them, not just executives and stakeholders.</p>

Even before the US imposed these measures, China's substantial investments in science were yielding positive results.

          <p>A decision to ban the question of Palestine from national school elections in Denmark has sparked controversy, revealing a sensitivity among governing parties. The exclusion of this issue, deemed too explosive for classroom discussions, has been criticized as contradictory to Danish values of free expression. Critics argue that it reflects a broader failure to address the moral implications of the country's foreign policy, particularly regarding its relationship with Israel. The government's actions expose a tension between its support for Ukraine and its complicity in the war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza.</p>

Extreme weather events also negatively impacted domestic final demand and exports.
