Coach Jim Harbaugh described the loss as a "gut punch," highlighting the somber mood within the team. The injury forces a major reshuffling of the offensive line, with Trey Pipkins III expected to step into a starting role. The team is now exploring the free-agent market to address the sudden lack of depth.</p>

In a show of solidarity, California's Democratic leaders, including the governor, have vowed to retaliate by potentially redrawing their own state's map if Texas proceeds with its plan. This escalation highlights a broader national battle over gerrymandering and political power ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

Originally a revolutionary design for its time, it became a staple for tradespeople, rock bands, and even, notoriously, bank robbers due to its space and speed. While production has moved from the UK to Turkey, Ford's British design and engineering centers continue to shape the van's future, focusing on electric and software-defined models.</p>

The UK's Advertising Standards Authority reports an increase in complaints about models appearing "unhealthily thin," raising concerns among activists about a regression from the body positivity movement. While brands defend the health of their models, critics point to styling and poses that emphasize extreme thinness, linking it to harmful social media trends.</p>

          <p>A BBC documentary explores the negative psychological effects that hook-up apps like Grindr can have on some users in the GBTQ community. The article features individuals who describe an addictive cycle of seeking validation through casual sexual encounters, which often leads to feelings of low self-esteem, anxiety, and objectification. While some enjoy the apps, others feel they contribute to a toxic culture that normalizes instant gratification and makes forming meaningful connections more difficult.</p>

          <p>The president of Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) in Suzhou, China, states that geopolitics is the greatest challenge facing institutions that aim to bridge Eastern and Western academia. President Xi Youmin argues that global division is stifling academic freedom and scientific collaboration. He suggests that improving the situation requires easing visa restrictions for foreign students to visit China, which would foster better understanding and counteract the negative impacts of political conflict on universities worldwide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Billy Long as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service after less than two months in the position. Long, a former congressman whose term was meant to run until 2027, is expected to be nominated as the ambassador to Iceland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will serve as the acting IRS commissioner in the interim. The abrupt departure comes after the implementation of new tariffs and tax code changes by the administration.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making regarding Gaza is primarily driven by the need to appease his far-right coalition partners for his own political survival. His recent proposal to occupy Gaza City runs counter to the preferences of both the Israeli security establishment and the majority of the public, who favor ending the war with a hostage deal. This dynamic creates a significant gap between the country's strategic interests and its government's actions.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. This move aligns Canada with the European Union and the United Kingdom, who recently took similar action to increase economic pressure on Moscow. The policy is designed to limit a crucial source of revenue that funds Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, according to Canada's finance minister. (not investment advice)</p>
