          <h2>Trump States He Will Not Fire Federal Reserve Chair Powell</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump clarified that he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends next year, marking a significant shift from his recent rhetoric. Trump has been critical of Powell and has pressured him to cut interest rates to stimulate economic growth. This statement comes after weeks of escalating tensions between the president and the Fed chair, where Trump even suggested he could remove Powell from his position.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the American food supply by the end of next year. The FDA is looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and work with the food industry to eliminate six remaining synthetic dyes used in various products. Studies suggest a link between these petroleum-based synthetic dyes and health conditions, including ADHD, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and gastrointestinal issues. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives.</p>

Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that Abrego Garcia was moved to a lower-security facility, contradicting the Trump administration's reports that he was being held at CECOT.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year, despite the UK facing higher-than-expected inflation. The IMF predicts UK inflation will be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%, attributing it to higher energy and water bills. The UK economy is projected to grow by 1.1% in 2025, lower than previous predictions due to global fallout from US trade tariffs. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the IMF still projects stronger UK economic growth in 2025 compared to other major European countries.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing pressure from investors to prioritize the electric car maker after first-quarter results revealed sales and profit fell short of expectations.

Tesla's stock price has significantly declined, and analysts suggest that Musk's involvement with the Trump administration has alienated consumers.

Despite the market turbulence, Buffett's approach emphasizes taking advantage of market downturns to buy stocks at lower prices.
