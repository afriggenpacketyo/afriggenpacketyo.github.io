          <p>During a Premier League match between Liverpool and Bournemouth, play was stopped after Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo reported being racially abused by someone in the Anfield crowd. Despite the distressing incident, Semenyo went on to score two goals, though his team ultimately lost 4-2. The player later highlighted receiving further online abuse, prompting widespread condemnation from the Football Association, both clubs, and anti-racism organizations. The event has renewed calls for more effective measures to combat racism in the sport, as similar incidents have recently targeted other players.</p>

During the 35-minute tirade from a police car, McLeod referred to himself as "Superman" and "God" and made threats against other political figures. The South Carolina Democratic Party has since called for him to withdraw from the race, citing the need for him to focus on his well-being.

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell has been indicted on federal charges, including conspiracy, fraud, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors allege she and her bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, engaged in a scheme to defraud the city after developing a personal relationship. The indictment claims Cantrell arranged for Vappie to accompany her on numerous trips to maximize their time together, resulting in over $70,000 in fraudulent travel payments from the city. The two are also accused of using encrypted messages to conceal their activities, which prosecutors say exploited their public authority for personal gain.</p>

Human rights advocates have condemned the incident as an act of transnational repression, highlighting concerns about China's growing influence and its efforts to silence critical voices abroad.</p>

          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally named Kisean Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for his role in a fraud scheme that exceeded $1 million. Kingston and his mother, Janice Turner, were convicted of using his celebrity status to acquire luxury items—including jewelry, a Cadillac Escalade, and a large TV—by providing fake wire transfer receipts as payment. Before his sentencing, the "Beautiful Girls" singer apologized to the court for his actions. His mother was previously sentenced to five years in prison for her involvement in the scheme.</p>

          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice has agreed to scale back the Trump administration's federal takeover of the city's police force. The agreement ensures that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, reversing a directive that had appointed a DEA administrator as emergency police chief. The DOJ also consented to rewrite an order that had ended the city's "sanctuary" rules limiting police cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This development came after a federal judge indicated she would likely intervene if the administration did not alter its course.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, a startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a new electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by simplifying its base model and allowing extensive customization. The company's strategy focuses on keeping manufacturing costs low with a spare, two-seat design, while offering over 100 accessories and an "open source" platform for third-party add-ons. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but the expiration of these incentives raises the price to around $27,000. This shift positions the truck against established competitors, creating uncertainty about its market competitiveness.</p>

These lawsuits argue that Roblox prioritizes profits over user safety and misrepresents its platform as a safe environment for its young user base, which averages over 111 million daily visitors. In response, Roblox stated that any assertion of intentionally putting users at risk is untrue and highlighted its rigorous safeguards and investments in safety.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, a move that follows a recent surge in the company's stock price and a pressure campaign from investors. The company's stock has risen dramatically since June but its latest earnings report failed to assure investors of a successful turnaround. In her announcement, Wheeler stated that stepping aside would allow the company to focus on its future without distraction. Activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, had been publicly calling for her departure. The company has named its technology chief as interim leader.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, with CEO Ben Kohn citing California's "anti-business" climate and high operational costs. The media and lifestyle brand is the latest high-profile company to leave the state for more business-friendly environments. The relocation includes plans for a new Playboy Club and multimedia studios in Miami Beach, a city Kohn praised as being very supportive of business. This move marks a strategic return to South Florida for the company, which previously operated a club and hotel in the area during the 1960s and 70s.</p>

          <p>As Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at a U.S. air base in Alaska for a summit with President Donald Trump, he was greeted by a military flyover featuring a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and F-35 fighter jets. The display of military hardware included the same type of long-range bomber used in a recent U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. The B-2 bomber is considered a significant symbol of American power, capable of global reach with both conventional and nuclear munitions. The flyover occurred as the two leaders met on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for high-stakes talks regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Luke Sung, the former co-owner of Kis Cafe in San Francisco, has spoken out about a viral TikTok video that he says ruined his reputation and led to his restaurant's closure. Influencer Karla Marcotte posted a video describing a "nightmare" experience where she claimed Sung criticized her social media following and dismissed her. Sung recounted that he questioned her professionalism and food knowledge after viewing her content, which he says offended her. The resulting social media backlash forced the cafe to close in July; it has since reopened under a new name with Sung's former partner.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume a federal program that funds the installation of high-speed electric vehicle chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation had frozen the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, created by a 2021 bipartisan law, which the president has criticized as wasteful. While the funds will now be released, the administration has removed several Biden-era requirements, such as those related to community engagement and labor standards, in a move it claims will cut red tape and speed up the rollout.</p>

          <p>Choreographed dance videos posted on TikTok by sororities for recruitment have been repurposed on the social media platform X to manufacture a culture war controversy. Right-leaning accounts have shared the videos with captions claiming that liberals and Democrats are "seething" or "outraged" by the displays of traditionally feminine, happy young women. However, there is little to no evidence of any such negative reaction from the groups being targeted. This phenomenon appears to be driven by engagement-farming accounts that profit from generating outrage, capitalizing on pre-existing political tensions to create a conflict where one does not exist.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a direct government intervention in Intel by taking an ownership stake in the struggling semiconductor company. The news, which caused Intel's stock to climb, aligns with the administration's goal of bolstering domestic chip manufacturing for national security reasons and reducing reliance on foreign producers like TSMC. While details remain unclear, the intervention could be funded through the CHIPS Act. Some technology analysts argue that such a move, while unusual, is essential to revive the company and secure the nation's technological and military capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell by 14% after the company issued weak financial guidance for the upcoming quarter.

This downturn comes as Chinese clients reportedly ease their spending after a period of rapid manufacturing expansion, raising concerns about the company's near-term performance.
