            <h2>MLB Considers Salary Cap Amidst Potential Labor Dispute in 2026</h2>

            <p>Major League Baseball is contemplating introducing a salary cap and floor as part of the next Collective Bargaining Agreement, set to expire in December 2026. This proposal faces strong opposition from the MLB Players Association, which historically favors a free market system, raising the specter of a potential lockout. The current spending disparity among teams, with some exceeding $400 million and others below $100 million, fuels the debate about competitive balance. While a salary cap could benefit players by tying salaries to revenue, the union remains wary of restrictions on individual earnings, leading to a likely contentious negotiation.

            <p>Colossal Biosciences unveiled genetically modified wolves with traits from extinct dire wolves, sparking debate about the ethics of de-extinction. Critics argue that these "designer dogs" are novel animals for whom humans are morally responsible, while the company claims it's reviving a species. The company's work on cloning endangered red wolves is more directly beneficial to conservation, raising questions about the true purpose of de-extinction efforts. Concerns exist about the potential for animal suffering during experimentation and the commercial exploitation of de-extincted animals, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications.</p>

            <p>With inflation persisting, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, while locking in rates for the CD's term. Current national average CD yields range from 1.55% to 1.88%, but top CDs offer significantly higher rates, especially from online banks. Short-term CDs, particularly those with six-month to one-year terms, often have the most competitive rates due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by purchasing CDs with varying terms, can help savers take advantage of high short-term rates while also saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy believes that third-party sellers on the platform will likely pass on increased tariff costs to consumers. In response to President Trump's tariffs, Amazon has been strategically buying forward inventory and renegotiating purchase orders to mitigate price increases. While some consumers may be stocking up in anticipation of price hikes, the long-term impact of the tariffs remains uncertain. Amazon Web Services has diversified its supply chain over the past five years, allowing it to source components from various markets.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates remain elevated, but both new homebuyers and those looking to refinance can still secure favorable rates by strengthening their credit profiles. The average rate for a 30-year mortgage is 6.70%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.96%. Experts suggest that if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, mortgage rates may stabilize, offering some relief to borrowers. Shopping around and comparing lenders, as well as considering shorter loan terms, can also help borrowers secure the best possible rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Global bond yields reversed course after equities rebounded, following a volatile week driven by President Trump's tariff policy. Trump acknowledged the bond market's sensitivity to his policies, leading to a pause in tariff implementation. The U.K. bond market was particularly affected, with yields tumbling after a sharp spike. Analysts attribute the bond market reversal to a reassessment of monetary policy and profit-taking by leveraged investors.</p>

            <p>China on Wednesday raised tariffs on imports from the U.S. to 84%, the country's latest response in an escalating trade war with President Trump whose 104% tariff on Chinese goods also went into effect on Wednesday. The 84% tax will make it much more costly for Chinese companies to purchase and bring U.S.-made goods into the country, and could cut U.S. producers off from an important trade market. President Trump on Wednesday afternoon said he's increasing the tariff rate on Chinese imports to 125%, while also moving to pause reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days and lowering that rate to 10% for most nations.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's tariffs have sparked debate about their legality, purpose, and impact on consumers and businesses. While tariffs are legal under WTO rules, economists disagree on their effectiveness, with some arguing they act as a tax on consumers and businesses. The tariffs aim to pressure other nations into more favorable trade deals and encourage domestic manufacturing. Consumers face higher prices on everyday items, and the long-term outlook is uncertain, with potential risks to economic growth and a possible recession.</p>
