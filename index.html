            <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML experienced a 6% drop in shares after reporting lower-than-expected net bookings for the first quarter, totaling 3.94 billion euros, below analysts' forecasts. CEO Christophe Fouquet attributed the shortfall to uncertainty stemming from new U.S. trade restrictions, which may impact demand for its chipmaking machines. While the company maintains a strong demand outlook driven by artificial intelligence, tariff concerns are creating new uncertainties on a macroeconomic level and with respect to market demands. Nvidia disclosed it expects to take a $5.5 billion quarterly charge due to U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 graphics processing unit to China and a handful of other countries.

The attack resulted in serious injuries to two officers, prompting criticism from Manchester Arena attack survivor Martin Hibbert, who highlighted the "comfort and privilege" Abedi had access to. Hibbert expressed outrage that Abedi, a convicted murderer serving a life sentence, was able to carry out the attack, pointing to a failure of prison security. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full, independent review into the incident and has suspended access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centers.</p>

            <p>Miriam Adelson, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, faces criticism from fans due to the team's performance following a controversial trade and her political affiliations. Adelson's support for Donald Trump and Israel has alienated some fans, adding to the discontent caused by the team's struggles after trading a key player. The Mavericks' performance has declined, and the franchise has relinquished control of future draft picks, further fueling fan frustration. The team also announced an average season ticket price increase of 8% for the 2025-26 season, which has angered fans.</p>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as its new trade envoy, replacing Wang Shouwen, amidst escalating trade tensions with the United States. This change comes as Beijing criticizes the U.S.'s use of "tariff barriers and trade bullying," which it claims is negatively impacting the global economy. The appointment occurs as China reports a better-than-expected GDP growth of 5.4% for the first quarter. While some analysts view the change as a potential effort to break the impasse in trade negotiations, others suggest it could be a routine promotion during a tense period.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off, with yields on the 10-year Treasury soaring to their highest levels since February, amidst market turmoil caused by President Trump's tariffs. This occurred despite recession fears, which typically drive investors toward the safety of U.S. debt. Analysts suggest potential factors behind the sell-off include China weaponizing its Treasury holdings, Japanese life insurers reducing exposure, and hedge funds engaging in bond vigilante behavior. The selling could also have been fueled by a combination of European and Japanese pension accounts selling long-dated Treasurys to purchase European fixed income. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.K. Supreme Court is set to rule on a legal challenge concerning the definition of a woman, stemming from a dispute between a women's rights group and the Scottish government. The case focuses on whether a transgender person with a gender recognition certificate can be legally regarded as a woman under equality laws. While the case centers on Scottish law, the outcome could have U.K.-wide consequences for sex-based rights and single-sex services. The women's rights group argues that "sex" should refer to biological sex as understood in everyday language.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's post office will suspend shipping small parcels to the United States due to Washington's plan to impose tariffs on small-value parcels from the city. The U.S. government is ending a customs exception that allowed small-value parcels from Hong Kong to enter the U.S. without tax, imposing a 120% tariff starting May 2. The Hong Kong government criticized the U.S.'s actions as "unreasonable and bullying." The post office will continue accepting mail containing only documents.</p>

            <p>The special election for Oakland mayor remains too close to call, with former City Councilmember Loren Taylor holding a slim lead against former Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee in early results. The election was triggered by the recall of the city's mayor in November amid frustrations with crime and homelessness. Oakland uses ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to select multiple candidates by order of preference, and final results may take several days to be tallied. Taylor's campaign has focused on addressing the city's problems and appealing to voters seeking a change in leadership.</p>

            <p>A report warns that the increasing energy demands of data centers, driven by AI, could lead to higher utility bills for consumers if regulations are not reformed. Special contracts between utilities and data center companies can shift costs to consumers due to opaque accounting practices. Excessive development of energy infrastructure based on overestimated data center load forecasts could also affect utility prices. A proposed reform to the UK's electricity market could favor data centers that harness renewable energy, potentially raising wholesale prices for other consumers.</p>

Endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles are among the species at risk, with wildfires destroying their habitats. This year has seen a significant increase in wildfires, with a record dry spell and high temperatures contributing to the blazes. Conservation charities are calling for increased funding for peat bog restoration and closer oversight of controlled burns to protect wildlife and prevent fires.</p>

The JFTC found that Google violated Japan's anti-monopoly law by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. Google also required manufacturers to exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model. The action is aligned with similar crackdowns on firms in the UK and the U.S.</p>
