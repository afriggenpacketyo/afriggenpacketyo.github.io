          <p>The upcoming presidential election in Ivory Coast is testing the nation's democratic stability, a decade after a post-electoral crisis. Incumbent President Alassane Ouattara is seeking a controversial fourth term, a move made possible by constitutional changes, while several key opposition figures have been barred from running, raising concerns about the fairness of the process. Despite strong economic growth under Ouattara's leadership, the exclusion of challengers and a government ban on protests have led to criticism from rights groups and accusations that the election is a mere "coronation."</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Saturday and a major hurricane by Sunday, posing a significant threat to several Caribbean nations. The storm is projected to bring 8 to 14 inches of rain to parts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica, creating conditions for potentially catastrophic and life-threatening flash floods and landslides. While the mainland United States is not expected to see major impacts, hurricane watches and tropical storm warnings are in effect for the affected islands as the storm slowly moves through the region.</p>

According to the Coast Guard, the driver ignored multiple verbal commands to stop and proceeded to back toward the base, posing what was perceived as a direct threat to personnel. The incident, which occurred late Thursday night, resulted in no injuries to any Coast Guard members, and the situation was contained without further escalation.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has issued a preliminary finding that TikTok and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, have violated transparency obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The tech giants are accused of failing to grant researchers adequate access to public data, a key requirement of the landmark EU law designed to increase platform accountability. Meta was also cited for not providing simple mechanisms for users to report illegal content, and the companies could face fines up to 6% of their global annual turnover if the breaches are confirmed.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive conservation effort is underway to save the Houston toad, one of America's most endangered amphibians, from extinction. At the Fort Worth Zoo, scientists are using advanced assisted reproduction techniques, including hormone injections and genetic matchmaking, to breed tens of thousands of toads for release into the wild. This initiative is coupled with habitat restoration programs that incentivize private landowners in Texas to manage their properties in ways that support the toad's survival, representing a multi-faceted approach to species recovery.</p>

          <p>A decadent chocolate bar filled with pistachio cream and shredded phyllo pastry, known as 'Dubai chocolate,' has become a viral sensation, driven largely by its popularity on TikTok. Created in 2021 by a Dubai-based chocolatier, the treat's appeal lies in its crunchy texture, gooey interior, and ASMR-friendly qualities, making it perfect for social media videos. Despite its high price point, the chocolate has become a status symbol and a prime example of what some are calling the "IRL brainrot aesthetic," where unusual and aggressively marketed products achieve massive, seemingly random popularity online.</p>

          <p>A Chinese geopolitical expert has suggested that China could enhance its military capabilities by learning from the United States' success in integrating civilian technology into its defense sector. The researcher, Gu Jianyi, pointed to companies like SpaceX and Palantir as models for a new industrial ecosystem driven by Silicon Valley-style innovation. He argued that Chinese tech giants such as Huawei and Tencent possess core technologies that, if properly channeled, could provide a "revolutionary momentum" to China's military development, though institutional barriers currently hinder this fusion.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that the recent FBI arrests of NBA figures in connection with illegal gambling are an inevitable consequence of the league's deep integration with the sports betting industry. By embedding betting odds and promotions into its broadcasts and marketing, the NBA has created an environment where the game's integrity is compromised and athletes are viewed as financial instruments. The author contends that the scandal reveals a systemic issue, suggesting that the line between the game and the bookmaker has been dangerously blurred.</p>

          <p>High Court documents have revealed that Prince Andrew accepted £60,500 from a businessman connected to SVS Securities, a wealth management firm that collapsed amid allegations of mis-selling pensions to savers. The payments were made in December 2019, just weeks after the prince stepped back from public duties following his controversial BBC interview. This revelation adds to the persistent questions surrounding Prince Andrew's personal finances and his association with controversial business figures since he stopped receiving public funds.</p>

          <p>This article examines the rapid political ascent of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the close relationship she has cultivated with former U.S. President Donald Trump. Meloni, whose party has historical roots in Italian fascism, has become one of Europe's most prominent right-wing leaders, and her kinship with Trump is solidifying her role as a key, albeit divisive, figure in transatlantic relations. Trump has recently used his platform to promote Meloni, highlighting a strengthening alliance between populist leaders on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's campaign of military strikes against alleged drug boats has expanded into the Pacific Ocean, but it faces growing questions from lawmakers and legal experts regarding its legality. The White House has not provided public evidence to support its claims that the targets are cartel members, and the use of lethal force in international waters without congressional approval is being described as extrajudicial killing. Critics also question whether the true goal of the heightened military presence, particularly in the Caribbean, is countering narcotics or pressuring Venezuela's government.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance from cancer survivors on the most meaningful ways to support a friend or family member undergoing treatment. Rather than broad offers of help, survivors suggest taking on specific, practical roles like being a designated note-taker at doctor's appointments, a comforting companion during long chemotherapy sessions, or a household helper who manages meals and chores. The key is to reduce the patient's mental load by taking initiative with concrete tasks, which is often more helpful than asking open-ended questions like "how can I help?"</p>

          <p>A progress report from the UK's police and fire services inspectorate has found that while police forces have improved their approach to tackling child exploitation by grooming gangs, significant systemic issues persist. The watchdog highlighted that inconsistent definitions of exploitation, inaccurate data collection, and poor national coordination are undermining efforts to protect vulnerable children, with many opportunities for intervention still being missed. The findings come as the government's national inquiry into grooming gangs continues to be beset by controversy and delays.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.5% in September, marking the fourth straight month of growth and defying analyst expectations of a slight decrease. The Office for National Statistics reported that the increase was driven by strong online sales of gold and new technology products, including the Nintendo Switch 2 and iPhone 17. The positive data suggests a degree of consumer confidence, though some economists remain cautious about the sector's ability to sustain this momentum amid broader economic pressures.

The result is being interpreted as a significant blow to Welsh Labour and a potential sign of Plaid Cymru's growing viability as an alternative ahead of the next Senedd election. For Labour, the loss in one of its safest seats prompts difficult questions about its strategy and appeal to voters in Wales.</p>
