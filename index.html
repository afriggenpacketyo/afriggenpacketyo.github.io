The coin's value has fluctuated wildly, creating winners and losers, while the Trump family has profited from the venture.

          <p>The Trump administration has halted Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing a dispute over a records request as part of an investigation by the Department of Homeland Security. The move could affect about a quarter of the school's student body and is seen as an escalation of the administration's efforts to pressure the university. Harvard has been asked to comply with a list of demands to regain its ability to enroll international students, including providing disciplinary records for non-immigrant students. The university called the administration's action “unlawful.”</p>

These moves have triggered controversy and have significant implications for regional geopolitics. The author suggests these actions are characteristic of Trump's mercurial policy flourishes. </p>

The justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision.

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is investigating the admissions system at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, alleging discrimination against Asian American students. The investigation is based on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The administration has argued that the Supreme Court’s ban on affirmative action in college admissions should also apply to K-12 education. The school changed its admissions process in 2020 to diversify its student body, leading to a decrease in the percentage of Asian students. </p>
