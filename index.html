          <p>A groundbreaking study has for the first time ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing significant differences between drugs. Researchers analyzed 151 studies involving over 58,500 patients, noting impacts like weight changes and heart rate variations within the first eight weeks of treatment. This article emphasizes that these findings should empower individuals to engage in shared decision-making with their practitioners, advocating for personalized antidepressant prescriptions. The study also highlighted that commonly prescribed SSRIs generally have fewer physical side effects, pushing for a reevaluation of current prescribing practices.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 02:22:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in September, a surprising development as the Bank of England and economists had anticipated a peak at 4%. This marks the third consecutive month the rate has stayed constant, with core inflation also seeing a slight decrease. The article notes that while petrol prices and airfares were upward drivers, these were offset by lower costs for recreational items and a fall in food prices. Economists suggest the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates from 4% given the persistent inflation, despite modest economic growth.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley, captain of the US Ryder Cup team, has revealed he may "never get over" the team's defeat to Europe in September, describing the period since as one of the toughest of his life. The 39-year-old oversaw a 15-13 loss at Bethpage, with his leadership decisions questioned in the aftermath. Bradley stated he will forever wonder and wish things had gone differently, despite a dramatic final day comeback attempt. He expressed regret at not playing but maintained it was the right decision given his exhaustion, affirming his continued availability for future Ryder Cup events.</p>

          <p>Over 800 prominent figures, including tech luminaries like Steve Wozniak and Richard Branson, have signed a statement urging a halt to the development of 'superintelligence' — AI that surpasses human intellect. The statement warns of potential risks ranging from human economic obsolescence and loss of freedoms to national security threats and even extinction. This article highlights that the signatories, including AI pioneers, advocate for a prohibition on superintelligence development until public buy-in and scientific consensus on its safety and controllability are achieved. The initiative underscores growing concerns within the tech community and beyond regarding advanced AI.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly nearing a trade deal with the United States that could involve a significant reduction in its oil purchases from Russia. Indian media outlet Mint reports that Washington might slash tariffs on Indian exports to 15-16% from 50% as part of the agreement. This article highlights President Donald Trump's assertion that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him of scaled-back Russian oil imports, though Modi's public statement focused on counter-terrorism without directly addressing oil. India, a major importer, has prioritized safeguarding consumer interests in a volatile energy market, becoming Russia's second-largest crude buyer since 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese exports rebounded in September, climbing 4.2% year-on-year, snapping a four-month decline, primarily driven by robust shipments to Asia. However, exports to the United States, Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped 13.3%, continuing a downward trend despite a trade deal that reduced US tariffs. This article details that semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth, while auto shipments to the US saw a significant hit. Analysts note that while external demand is expected to recover, US-China trade tensions cloud the outlook, and policy factors like tariffs seem to have a larger impact than currency fluctuations on exports.

          <p>A NASA astrophysicist, Robin Corbet, proposes a new theory suggesting that extraterrestrial civilizations may not possess technology significantly more advanced than humanity's, potentially resolving the Fermi Paradox. Corbet's "radical mundanity" principle posits that aliens likely lack warp drives or wormholes, explaining why we haven't encountered them. This article highlights that the theory suggests civilizations might be too distant or technologically limited for large-scale interstellar travel or communication. This perspective offers a less terrifying explanation for the absence of definitive evidence of advanced alien life, challenging popular notions of highly sophisticated extraterrestrial visitors.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned gambling advertisements from Kwiff and Betway featuring Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and the Chelsea football club logo. The ban stems from concerns that these figures and symbols have a strong appeal to individuals under 18, violating advertising guidelines. This article details that the ASA cited Hamilton's significant youth following on social media, his appearance in a children's video game, and his role as a CBeebies storyteller.

A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal.
