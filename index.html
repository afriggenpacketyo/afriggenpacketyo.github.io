          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave plummeted by 17% after the company reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, exceeding analyst expectations. The financial results were released just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, a time when insiders are permitted to sell shares, potentially increasing stock volatility. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, and the company raised its full-year 2025 revenue forecast, citing that demand for its AI infrastructure continues to outpace supply.

          <p>The Senior Citizens League, a retiree advocacy group, estimates that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be 2.7%. This projection, based on recent inflation data, suggests a slight increase from this year's 2.5% boost. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall using inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists express concern that a modest adjustment may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to factors like tariffs.

The incident, which went viral, has led to seven arrests, all of whom are African American, fueling racial tensions in the city. While some city leaders argue that video evidence shows the white individuals instigated the violence, the police union maintains that investigators have identified them as victims. The Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office is handling the case amid a tense community atmosphere.</p>

          <p>President Trump participated in a virtual call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and various NATO leaders to align on strategy before his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Convened by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the meeting aimed to ensure European and Ukrainian interests are represented. Leaders emphasized the need for a ceasefire as a primary goal, with Merz stating that any territorial agreements must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and be negotiated by Ukraine itself. Zelenskyy used the opportunity to reiterate his belief that Putin is "bluffing" about wanting peace.</p>

          <p>Hashem Abedi, who is serving a life sentence for his role in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, has been charged with the attempted murder of three prison officers.

Abedi, the brother of the suicide bomber Salman Abedi, now faces additional charges including the unauthorized possession of a knife. The original bombing killed 22 people and injured over a thousand at an Ariana Grande concert, and this new development adds another chapter to the tragic event.</p>

However, the data also indicates a corresponding rise in traffic to smaller, less-regulated sites, and an increase in the use of VPNs to bypass the new rules.

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive timeline of the case against Bryan Patrick Miller, known locally as the "Zombie Hunter," who was convicted for the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The case went cold for over two decades until 2014, when investigators used genetic genealogy to link Miller to the crime scenes. The investigation culminated in an undercover sting to obtain his DNA, leading to his arrest in 2015. Miller was sentenced to death in 2023, having been found guilty of the brutal stabbings and sexual assaults.</p>

          <p>An undercover operation at a Phoenix Chili's restaurant was the crucial final step in capturing the "canal killer" after a two-decade-long cold case. In 2015, a cold case detective, posing as a security consultant, met with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller with the sole purpose of obtaining his DNA from a drinking glass. Although skeptical at first, the detective's ruse worked. Eleven days later, the DNA was confirmed as a match to evidence from the 1990s murder scenes of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, leading directly to Miller's arrest and eventual conviction.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated and the potential for future rate cuts, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time for retirees to consider annuities for guaranteed income. The ideal amount to invest depends on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, rather than a universal percentage. A common approach is to calculate the gap between essential monthly expenses and current guaranteed income, then use an annuity to cover that shortfall. This strategy helps secure a stable income floor while balancing portfolio growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, are alarming some residents due to the appearance of black, horn-like tumors on their heads and faces. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have identified the cause as Shope papillomavirus, a virus specific to rabbits that causes these wart-like growths. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or other animals, is often spread by biting insects and usually does not harm the rabbit unless the growths obstruct its vision or mouth. Researchers suggest the appearance of these "zombie" rabbits may have been the origin of the jackalope legend.</p>

          <p>Despite public criticism from President Trump, who suggested the bank's CEO should "get a new Economist," Goldman Sachs is standing by its research on tariffs. The bank's analysis concludes that while businesses have absorbed most tariff costs so far, the burden will shift to consumers in the coming months, who will eventually bear about two-thirds of the cost. This would push a key inflation gauge higher, though the bank believes it will be a one-time price effect that is unlikely to significantly alter the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions.
