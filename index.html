          <h2>Hims & Hers to Enter Canadian Market with Generic Weight-Loss Drug Semaglutide</h2>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health will begin offering generic semaglutide in Canada, marking its entry into the country's market. This move capitalizes on the upcoming expiration of Novo Nordisk's patent for its popular weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. The Canadian market for these drugs is substantial, projected to grow significantly in the coming years. Hims & Hers aims to provide an affordable alternative, although it has not yet confirmed if it has applied for approval from Canada's health agency, stating it is working with an approved partner.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com has launched its "Double Hundred Plan," investing over $1.4 billion to bolster select brands and challenge competitors in the on-demand delivery sector. This initiative aims to increase sales for certain brands by offering enhanced traffic, marketing support, and better after-sales service. The move escalates the rivalry with market leader Meituan and Alibaba, which recently engaged in a price war and announced its own significant subsidy program. The competition comes as China's daily on-demand delivery orders have surpassed 200 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is leveraging "Section 232" tariffs on specific products like cars, steel, aluminum, and pharmaceuticals, which could have a more direct impact than broader country-based levies. President Trump recently announced plans for a 50% tariff on copper imports and high rates on pharmaceuticals, causing market volatility. These sector-specific tariffs, justified under national security provisions, add complexity for businesses and are layered on top of other duties, squeezing both trading partners and U.S. consumers. Experts note these tariffs have a stronger legal footing than other trade measures and are likely to persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has announced its intention to continue investing in large-scale infrastructure projects to drive economic development. Li Chunlin, the NDRC's vice-chairman, emphasized the necessity of maintaining a significant level of investment to improve citizens' livelihoods, particularly as the country's per capita GDP surpasses $13,000. This strategy comes amid a push to boost domestic consumption as a buffer against trade tensions with the United States. The approach echoes past stimulus efforts but also raises concerns about potential increases in local government debt.</p>

          <p>Australia has implemented a groundbreaking climate visa program for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans annually to live, work, or study in Australia with a pathway to permanent residency. Unlike traditional visas, this "special mobility pathway" is not tied to specific employment or education and prioritizes those most in need, including individuals with disabilities. This proactive approach to climate mobility preserves dignity and agency, offering a potential model for other nations facing similar climate-induced displacement.</p>

          <p>During Prime Minister's Questions, UK leader Sir Keir Starmer declined to rule out extending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds beyond its 2028 end date. This freeze, initiated by the previous government, effectively increases the tax burden on workers as wage inflation pushes them into higher tax brackets. While reaffirming his manifesto pledge not to raise the rates of income tax, NI, or VAT, Starmer's ambiguity on thresholds suggests it remains a potential revenue-raising option. The government is constrained by its fiscal rules, which aim to reduce national debt.</p>

Even after release from prison, many lawyers and their families endure constant surveillance, harassment, and restrictions on movement and work, effectively serving a "supplemental sentence."

Despite an £11.8 billion fund, only 460 people have received full compensation so far, with many others not yet able to apply.

          <p>The Middle East is experiencing one of the world's most dramatic declines in fertility rates, a "quiet revolution" transforming its demographics. The average number of children per woman has more than halved since the 1960s, with several Arab nations now below the population replacement level. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of economic pressures, political instability, and significant social changes, including increased female education and employment. This shift could lead to future challenges, such as straining social safety nets with an aging population, but may also reduce environmental pressures.</p>

          <p>A swarm of more than 37 earthquakes and aftershocks, with magnitudes up to 5.6, struck Guatemala, resulting in the deaths of two men. The fatalities occurred in the department of Escuintla when large rocks, dislodged by the tremors, fell onto their vehicle. The seismic activity, centered in the Sacatepéquez department, caused landslides, minor property damage, and building evacuations, with tremors felt as far as El Salvador. Authorities have declared an orange alert, the second-highest level, and reported that at least five other people were buried by landslides.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally serving a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms in 2023. The toxic fungi, Amanita phalloides, contain a heat-stable toxin that causes catastrophic liver failure, with symptoms often delayed for hours after consumption. Most poisonings are accidental misidentifications, but prosecutors successfully argued Patterson knowingly used the foraged mushrooms. Experts note death caps only grow near specific trees like oaks, making it virtually impossible for them to contaminate commercially grown mushrooms.</p>

The company, which recently opened its first LightSpray factory in Zurich, says the process dramatically reduces the manual labor involved in traditional shoemaking. On aims to scale this technology from producing thousands of pairs to millions, giving it a significant competitive edge through innovation.</p>

          <p>Joseph Kurihara, a Japanese American U.S. Army veteran of World War I, became a prominent dissident during the incarceration of Japanese Americans in World War II. Witnessing the forced removal from Terminal Island, he lost faith in American democracy and actively resisted assimilationist leaders within the Manzanar camp. His radical rhetoric contributed to the "Manzanar Uprising" in 1942, after which he was moved to a camp for "troublemakers." Believing America had irrevocably betrayed him, he was one of the few to renounce his citizenship, moving to Japan after the war and never returning.</p>

The proposed watchdog would monitor the White House for fraud, waste, and abuse, ensuring that no administration is above the law. The move comes after years of criticism regarding President Trump's alleged conflicts of interest and his administration's firing of multiple inspectors general across the federal government.
