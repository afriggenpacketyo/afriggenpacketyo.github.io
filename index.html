          <p>Britain's common complaint about its weather is now addressed by a new interactive tool from the BBC, designed to offer a unique and engaging perspective on local climate. Users can input their location and compare its current forecast with various cities across the globe, determining if the "Sun really shines brighter everywhere else" or if their own region is actually quite pleasant. This innovative feature aims to provide a lighthearted yet informative way to explore global weather patterns and challenge preconceived notions about local conditions. It encourages public interaction with meteorological data, making weather comparison an accessible and entertaining activity for anyone curious about their climate.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers sensation Shohei Ohtani created a memorable moment of sportsmanship by high-fiving a persistent heckler after smashing his 45th home run of the season. During a game against the San Diego Padres, Ohtani jogged towards the dugout and extended his hand to the fan who had been vocally criticizing him throughout the afternoon. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noted the gesture was "very out of character" for Ohtani, yet it showcased the star's unique personality and was widely appreciated. The Dodgers secured an 8-2 victory over their longtime rivals, bringing the teams to a tie in the division standings with 31 games remaining. This display offered a lighthearted highlight amidst the intense rivalry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, directly influenced by growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This significant adjustment follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole conference, where he signaled a potential interest rate cut in September. The offshore yuan subsequently climbed to its strongest level since late July, reflecting broad market anticipation of easing US monetary policy. Analysts are now largely confident in a September rate cut, shifting their focus to the potential scale and pace of further easing throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these challenges, Djokovic advanced, highlighting his enduring drive. Concurrently, American contenders Ben Shelton and Taylor Fritz also progressed smoothly, fueling optimism for the home nation's quest to end a long Grand Slam men's singles title drought.

Forecasters predict it will continue to strengthen through Monday before a likely weakening trend begins late Monday or Tuesday, with its track keeping it over the open ocean, well east of Bermuda. This development occurs during a forecast above-normal hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which previously reached Category 5 intensity without making landfall.</p>

          <p>Following Donald Trump's re-election, a significant number of Americans are choosing to relocate to Europe, expressing profound concerns over the US's increasingly polarized political climate and perceived threats to personal freedoms and safety. Relocation firms across the continent have reported a substantial surge in inquiries and applications for passports and long-stay visas from American citizens. Many who have moved describe a sense of relief watching US policy shifts, such as those impacting gender identification, from abroad. Despite the considerable personal and financial adjustments involved, these individuals prioritize escaping what they view as a deeply embedded societal "rot" and a climate marked by "chaos, cruelty, and disinformation." They question whether the US will reckon with its "fascist impulses."</p>

A judge permitted his release from custody but imposed a strict prohibition on him leaving the country, also establishing a three-month period for additional investigation into the case. Chávez Jr.'s lawyer has dismissed the allegations as mere "speculation."

          <p>United States National Guard troops deployed in Washington D.C. have commenced carrying service-issued weapons, marking an escalation in President Donald Trump's controversial crackdown on crime in the nation's capital. More than 2,200 soldiers are assigned to the Joint Task Force-DC, operating under strict rules of engagement that permit the use of force only as a last resort in response to imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm. This deployment is part of President Trump's broader strategy to assert federal authority over local law enforcement in Democrat-led cities, despite federal data contradicting his claims of rampant crime by showing D.C.'s violent crime rates are at a 30-year low. Critics, including Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, have denounced this as an "authoritarian push."</p>

This rally follows the company's recent unveiling of its new ES8 SUV, which is priced at a more accessible 308,800 yuan ($43,000) under a battery subscription plan. This pricing strategy makes the ES8 one of Nio's most affordable vehicles, aiming to lower upfront costs for consumers while offering flexibility through battery swaps. The move is seen as a strategic response to mounting competition in China's electric vehicle market, as Nio, traditionally targeting the high-end sector, also launched cheaper brands like Onvo and Firefly to broaden its customer base.

          <p>France has summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner to address what it calls "unacceptable" allegations regarding its efforts to combat rising antisemitism. Kushner, father of Jared Kushner, had sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron implying France was not doing enough. The French foreign ministry firmly rejected these claims, citing the 1961 Vienna Convention against interference in internal affairs and stressing the importance of the transatlantic partnership. This diplomatic spat follows Macron's rejection of similar accusations from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding France's intention to recognize a Palestinian state, further complicating existing US-France tensions over trade, UN peacekeepers, and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Chinese property behemoth Evergrande has been officially delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, marking a definitive and grim milestone in its spectacular collapse. Once valued at over $50 billion, the company crumbled under the weight of $300 billion in debt, becoming a potent symbol of China's broader and ongoing property crisis. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, faced a $6.5 million fine and a lifetime ban from China's capital market for overstating revenue by $78 billion. The delisting, which followed a January 2024 winding-up order, is seen as final, with liquidators now focused on recovering assets for creditors. Experts widely agree that the property slump continues to be the largest drag on China's economy, with no immediate "light at the end of the tunnel." (not investment advice)</p>

While prosecutors have not yet confirmed if LA county money was directly disbursed as bribes, they aim to demonstrate a long-standing pattern of corruption. Separately, Fox News, which is defending against a defamation lawsuit filed by Smartmatic, alleges that LA County Registrar Dean Logan received unreported gifts from the company.

While Western media outlets have sometimes downsized in these regions, Russia is filling the void, offering free training to journalists and launching new language services. Experts warn that this strategy, though often presenting a seemingly legitimate news front, carefully manipulates narratives to undermine Western influence and normalize Russia's actions, such as the invasion of Ukraine, by portraying itself as a benign power and defender of the Global South.</p>

Despite a surge in applicants from Latin America due to cartel activity, US asylum law, particularly under the Trump administration's tightened interpretations, makes it harder for them to prove persecution based on the five recognized grounds. Many are forced to live in hiding, fearing deportation and reporting threats, even as they work and pay taxes. Immigration experts advocate for updating asylum definitions to better reflect the complex realities of cartel-driven violence, which often intertwines with systemic corruption and a lack of state protection, leaving many vulnerable individuals in limbo.</p>
