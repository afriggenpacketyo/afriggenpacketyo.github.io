          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee visited a Christian village in the occupied West Bank after an arson attack targeted the ancient Church of Saint George.

Huckabee expressed solidarity with the community, condemning the act as a sacrilege and unacceptable. He strongly insisted that those who carry out such acts of terror and violence must be found and prosecuted, not just reprimanded.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated Australia 27-19 in Brisbane, but the match was noted for its lack of typical Test-level intensity. The Lions established a dominant lead in the first 50 minutes, looking sharp and battle-hardened against an underprepared Australian side. While the Wallabies scored late tries after the Lions made substitutions, the outcome was never in doubt, leading to a subdued atmosphere that felt different from the usual high-stakes drama of a Lions Test.</p>

          <p>Recently released air-to-air photos of two Shenyang J-35 fighters suggest that China's next-generation carrier-based stealth aircraft may have entered limited production and could be close to operational service. The aircraft in the images bear construction numbers and new shark markings, which are strong indicators they are low-rate initial production models for the People's Liberation Army Navy. This development points to a significant advancement for China's rapidly modernizing carrier aviation capabilities.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as 'Operation Valkyrie.' Led by officer Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, the attempt failed when a bomb he planted only minorly injured the dictator. Though unsuccessful, the plot is remembered as a significant moment of German resistance against the Nazi regime. The piece also explores the historical context and the evolving legacy of the conspirators.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Justice Department to seek the release of grand jury testimony from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, yet he simultaneously criticized those who have been calling for transparency. In a social media post, he referred to people making the request as 'troublemakers and radical left lunatics,' suggesting nothing would be good enough for them. This move comes amid intense public pressure, with analysis from a former prosecutor suggesting the released transcripts may not reveal much new information.</p>

These are a set of critical guidelines designed to ensure safety and quality in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. The recall affects several varieties of the brand's 1.8 oz roll-on antiperspirant deodorants.</p>

          <p>The first arrest has been made under Florida's new 'Super Speeder' law, which went into effect on July 1. The law classifies anyone driving over 100 mph or 50 mph above the posted speed limit as a Super Speeder, subjecting them to potential jail time and significant fines. Just two minutes after the law became active, Orange County deputies arrested a man for allegedly driving 104 mph, making him the first to face the new, stricter penalties designed to curb dangerous driving.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers from both Republican and Democratic parties are increasing pressure on the Trump administration to release all federal files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.
