          <p>Search efforts for Natalia Nagovitsyna, a 48-year-old Russian climber with a broken leg, have been indefinitely suspended on Kyrgyzstan's Victory Peak due to severe weather. Nagovitsyna has been stranded for nearly two weeks at an altitude of 23,000 feet, where temperatures plummet to -22 Fahrenheit at night. An Italian rescuer, Luca Sinigaglia, died on August 15 attempting to save her, and authorities now believe Nagovitsyna is also no longer alive, citing the extreme conditions and logistical impossibility of rescue from such heights. Her husband died climbing a different mountain four years prior.</p>

          <p>A U.S. national, identified as Martin D., has been indicted in Germany on espionage charges for allegedly offering sensitive U.S. military information to Chinese authorities. The suspect, who worked for a civilian contractor at a U.S. military facility in Germany from 2017 to early 2023, was arrested in Frankfurt in November. Prosecutors state he repeatedly contacted Chinese officials in summer 2024 with his offer, though German media suggests no data was transferred before his arrest. The case now awaits a trial decision from the court in Koblenz.</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a 6% decline to $4,548.32 on Monday, erasing gains from a weekend rally that saw it hit a fresh record of $4,954.81. This pullback follows Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's hints at upcoming rate cuts, which initially boosted crypto assets. The market shift triggered over $245 million in forced selling of long ETH positions. Despite this, Ether has been leading the crypto market recently due to regulatory tailwinds and increased corporate interest, with ETFs drawing steady inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indonesia and the United States have commenced their largest annual joint military exercises, "Super Garuda Shield," involving forces from 11 other countries. These drills, featuring over 4,000 Indonesian and 1,300 American troops, aim to bolster stability in the Asia-Pacific region and enhance deterrence against potential threats. The exercises take place amidst U.S. efforts to encourage allies to take China's growing influence more seriously, though Washington maintains the drills are not aimed at Beijing. China, however, views these expanded exercises as an attempt to create an "Asian NATO" to limit its regional power.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C. students are returning to school this week amidst President Trump's surge of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement, a move Mayor Muriel Bowser deems unnecessary for student safety. Bowser asserts that D.C.'s existing safe passage programs are sufficient, noting a prior decrease in crime rates. While the Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith acknowledged some positive impact from federal agents, the presence of military-style vehicles and troops near public transport raises new questions about student well-being. The city is focused on ensuring a joyful and safe start to the school year for its 100,000 students.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders confirmed his frustration after being benched by head coach Kevin Stefanski before a potential game-winning drive in a recent preseason game. Despite a challenging performance where he was sacked five times, Sanders, who was on an exercise bike, wanted to lead the final two-minute drive. Stefanski defended his decision to use veteran Tyler Huntley, citing the overall offensive struggles and the plan to give Huntley a final drive. The team has named Joe Flacco as the Week 1 starter, with the backup situation still uncertain as the 53-man roster deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>An opinion article raises a critical question: if tackle football is considered too dangerous for girls, leading to the rise of girls' flag football, why is it still celebrated and tolerated for boys? The article highlights the growing popularity of flag football for girls and the historical tendency to adapt sports for women based on perceived physical limitations. It underscores the known health risks of tackle football, including CTE and Parkinson's disease, arguing that society has not adequately addressed the self-destructive aspects of masculinity fostered by the sport, particularly for young working-class men of color. The piece suggests a reevaluation of the sport's role and a potential shift towards flag football for all youth.</p>

Experiments involving opioid mimics and blockers indicated that this "liking" of grooming is mediated by the fish's opioid system, while the "wanting" to be groomed might involve dopamine.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is set to meet with President Trump in Washington, D.C., facing U.S. pressure to shift the 71-year-old military alliance from primarily deterring North Korea to countering China. Lee expressed reluctance to "easily agree" to this, emphasizing North Korea as South Korea's main threat and wishing to avoid entanglement in a conflict with China. The summit also involves challenging trade negotiations, where South Korea has pledged $350 billion in U.S. investments to lower tariffs, with disputes over profit distribution and the nature of these investments.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled concerns about the U.S. labor market, opening the door to potential interest rate cuts. Recent government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and weaker payroll gains, alarming experts who predict more pain for job seekers. Red flags include a general slowdown in monthly job additions, a surge in long-term job seekers (over 27 weeks), and increasing difficulty for young workers to find first jobs, partly due to AI adoption. While the unemployment rate remains low, it's a backward-looking metric, and the current indicators suggest a challenging outlook for the job market in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals that the Trump administration's actions, including communication interference, stalled reports, and staff layoffs, hindered the CDC's response to a surging measles outbreak in Texas. This created fear and confusion among scientists, preventing timely communication with local health workers, leading to the worst U.S. outbreak in over three decades and resulting in child deaths. The administration's promotion of vitamin A as a treatment, amplified by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s anti-vaccine rhetoric, further exacerbated the crisis by fueling misinformation and potentially delaying proper medical care. The incident underscores the dangers of political manipulation in public health and declining vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>A fitness trend promoting weighted vests for improved posture, weight loss, and increased bone and muscle growth is gaining traction, especially among women in perimenopause. However, scientific research does not strongly support claims for significant bone density or muscle strength benefits from simply walking with a weighted vest. Experts emphasize that more effective methods for building strength involve resistance training through a full range of motion. While weighted vests can offer some cardiovascular benefits by increasing energy expenditure, they are not a substitute for proven exercises and should be approached with realistic expectations.</p>

Honoré criticizes the "pre-notion that the poor is going to loot," which influenced law enforcement's response.

Legal advocates describe witnessing the institution "die in real time," with conflicting security protocols and an atmosphere of fear.

Former principal Mary Haynes-Smith, initially resistant, now praises the autonomy granted to charter schools. However, the system remains a "work in progress," with challenges like socioeconomic disparities influencing access to higher-rated schools and the painful process of closing underperforming charters.

Experts suggest these incidents stem from "empathy failures," where brands attempt to navigate cultural complexity with outdated corporate thinking, failing to genuinely connect with diverse consumers.
