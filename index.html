          <p>An early summer heatwave is breaking records across Europe, with temperatures soaring past 40Â°C (104Â°F) in multiple countries.

          <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment program within a matter of months. Despite recent U.S. military strikes on its nuclear facilities, Grossi noted that the damage was not total and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity for rapid reconstitution. This assessment contrasts with President Trump's claims of "total obliteration" and aligns more closely with a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting only limited setbacks to the program.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to advance the major Republican tax and spending package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," after a lengthy negotiation with four conservative holdouts. The senators, including Ron Johnson and Mike Lee, agreed to move the bill forward after leadership reportedly promised a future vote on an amendment to reduce Medicaid spending. The procedural vote kicks off a formal debate process, though final passage of the bill, which includes permanent tax cuts and national security spending, is not yet guaranteed.</p>

He specifically called out the phrase "Globalizing the Intifada" as unacceptable and emphasized that Mamdani will need to convince the Jewish community of his commitment to fighting antisemitism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is warning Americans about a growing "brushing" scam where people receive unsolicited packages containing low-value items they didn't order. This scheme is a red flag that your personal information, such as your name and address, has been compromised. Scammers, typically third-party online sellers, use this information to ship items and then post fake "verified" reviews in the recipient's name to boost their product ratings. Officials advise reporting such incidents and auditing financial accounts for fraudulent activity.</p>
