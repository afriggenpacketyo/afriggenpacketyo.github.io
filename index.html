          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James's legal team is challenging the bank fraud case against her, alleging the interim U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, engaged in improper communication with a journalist. James's lawyers plan to file a motion to dismiss the indictment, questioning the legality of Halligan's appointment. The dispute stems from Halligan's unsolicited messages to a Lawfare editor criticizing her coverage of the case, which James's team argues violates Justice Department rules. James denies wrongdoing and claims the Justice Department is retaliating against her because she sued President Trump. This situation could undermine James's right to a fair trial, according to her lawyers. The article also mentions challenges to Halligan's appointment in other cases. </p>

          <p>The FBI has launched an investigation after a driver allegedly rammed a vehicle occupied by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Avondale, Arizona. The incident occurred after ICE agents attempted to stop the driver, who initially fled the scene. The suspect later returned to a residence and rammed the ICE vehicle, leading to the FBI's involvement. The FBI will present its findings to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona for a charging decision. Officials have not yet released the suspect's identity or reported any injuries. This article also references another ramming incident in San Diego involving a man in the country illegally and injuring three federal officers.</p>

          <p>The FBI and federal prosecutors have announced charges against dozens of individuals, including current and former NBA players and a coach, in connection with two investigations into a widespread sports betting scheme and organized crime ring. Chauncey Billups, coach for the Portland Trail Blazers, and Terry Rozier of the Miami Heat, are among those arrested. The charges involve wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery, and illegal gambling, with some defendants allegedly connected to organized crime families. The sports betting ring allegedly involved players faking injuries, while the poker games were rigged using sophisticated cheating technologies. According to prosecutors, the scheme defrauded victims of over $7.15 million and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several states, including North Carolina, Missouri, Texas, California, and Utah, are undertaking mid-decade redistricting efforts that could significantly impact the composition of Congress. This push, initiated by Republicans seeking to expand their majority, has led to legal challenges and political maneuvering. In Texas, the new maps aim to create more GOP-friendly seats, while California Democrats are attempting to redraw districts to gain seats. Missouri's redistricting targets a Democratic representative, and Utah's changes are court-ordered to address gerrymandering. The outcome of these efforts remains uncertain, as challenges persist and voter behavior in the 2026 midterm elections could be influenced by various factors. </p>

          <p>Jonathan Rinderknecht, the man charged with starting the Palisades fire that resulted in 12 deaths and widespread destruction, has pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles court. Rinderknecht faces three federal arson charges related to the fire, which investigators believe started as the Lachman fire on January 1. Prosecutors say Rinderknecht made 911 calls and mentioned non-public information about the fire, while geolocation data placed him near the fire's origin. His lawyer questions the initial suppression of the Lachman fire and his client's involvement. Rinderknecht is being held without bond, and his trial is scheduled for December.</p>

Jashanpreet Singh, an Indian national, entered the country by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in 2022. Despite his immigration status, California transportation officials said the federal government approved Singh's Employment Authorization Documents, allowing him to receive a federal REAL ID and a commercial driver's license. Singh faces charges including driving under the influence of drugs, causing bodily injury, and gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated.

          <p>As school lunch debt soars to nearly $200 million a year in the U.S., communities are stepping up to help. Nationwide student lunch debt has soared to nearly $200 million per year. DJ Bracken created the Utah Lunch Debt Relief Foundation, paying off debt for over 30 schools. Special education teacher Kati Jo Christensen has raised close to $30,000 through TikTok dances to erase school lunch debt. While kindness helps, Bracken believes lawmakers need to broaden free lunch access. Only nine states have permanently adopted free meals for students.</p>

          <p>A cyber attack on Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) caused a five-week shutdown of its factories, leading to a significant slump in UK car production in September. JLR facilities did not produce a single vehicle last month, causing overall UK car production to fall by 27%. The SMMT reported that the JLR cyber-attack was largely responsible for the slump. The attack is estimated to cost £1.9bn and be the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history. JLR said production across sites in Solihull, Wolverhampton and Halewood was returning in a phased approach.</p>
