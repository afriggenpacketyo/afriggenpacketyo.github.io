Despite winning the first set, the world No. 6 fell to Mexico's Renata Zarazúa in a tough three-setter. Keys also recorded 14 double faults, hindering her performance in a significant Grand Slam. The defeat marked a disappointing start for one of the main home contenders, with other American players also facing early losses in the tournament.</p>

          <p>California state lawmakers are calling for Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara to investigate State Farm General's handling of fire claims and to halt any new rate increases. Legislators, representing Altadena-area fire victims, highlighted widespread hardships due to alleged insurance delays, denials, and underpayments following January's fires. State Farm, California's largest home insurer, is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a recently approved 17% increase. Critics accuse the Commissioner of being too lenient with the industry, as fire survivors demand swift reforms and accountability.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Nas X, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, has pleaded not guilty to felony charges of battery with injury to a police officer and resisting arrest. The charges stem from an incident last week where he was detained while reportedly wandering the streets of Los Angeles in his underwear. Police allege the Grammy-winning artist charged at them when they responded to a call. He was taken to a hospital for a possible overdose after the altercation, and his bail has been set at $75,000.</p>

          <p>This article explains the critical consequences for seniors who fail to meet their obligations on a reverse mortgage, such as paying property taxes, insurance, or maintaining their home. Default can lead to the entire loan balance becoming immediately due, swift foreclosure proceedings, and a negative impact on credit scores. While highlighting these severe risks, the article also emphasizes that reverse mortgages can be a valuable financial tool for retirees, providing access to home equity without monthly payments, especially for those who are house-rich but cash-poor.

          <p>Starbucks stock experienced a 2% drop following reports that the coffee giant is scaling back production at its five U.S. plants from a seven-day to a five-day schedule, starting in January. This move, potentially driven by cost-cutting and lower demand after six consecutive quarters of negative same-store sales, has raised competitive concerns. The news comes as Keurig Dr Pepper announced its acquisition of Peet's Coffee, further intensifying market dynamics. While the operational efficiency is noted, a reduction in capacity due to decreased demand is generally viewed negatively by investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo refresh has sparked public furor and caused its stock value to decline by nearly $100 million, prompting the company to acknowledge it "could've done a better job."

This misstep highlights the challenge for legacy brands in modernizing without alienating their core customer base, who often have deep emotional ties to traditional imagery.

          <p>Ukraine is set to receive 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munitions (ERAM) from the US, significantly boosting its standoff strike capabilities with these relatively low-cost, air-launched missiles. The weapons, with a range of 150-280 miles, are expected to arrive in approximately six weeks, with most funding provided by European allies. While their use against targets deep within Russia may require Pentagon approval, ERAM will enable Ukraine to strike targets far behind front lines, offsetting Russian advantages.

          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. military is prepared to deploy the National Guard to cities to address crime, even without a governor's request, after signing an executive order for a specialized unit. However, he later hedged on immediate plans for Chicago, citing the lack of a request from the governor. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson swiftly condemned such a move as "illegal and costly," asserting it would be undemocratic and unconstitutional. This exchange highlights a contentious debate over federal intervention in local law enforcement matters and the balance of power between state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, a co-founder of the notorious Sinaloa cartel, has pleaded guilty to federal racketeering and criminal enterprise charges in New York, bringing an end to his long-standing criminal career. The 77-year-old drug lord, arrested last year under disputed circumstances, expressed apology for the harm illegal drugs have caused in the U.S. and Mexico. His plea deal, which came after prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty, marks a significant victory for law enforcement. Zambada’s cartel was responsible for trafficking vast quantities of cocaine, heroin, and fentanyl into the United States.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has confirmed its first human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, in a Maryland patient who had traveled to El Salvador. While the risk to public health is deemed very low, the detection has heightened alerts for the country's cattle industry, as the parasite has been spreading northward from South America. Federal authorities are ramping up efforts, including building a new sterile fly production facility in Texas and increasing border surveillance. These measures aim to prevent a wider outbreak, leveraging historical success in eradicating screwworm from the U.S. in the mid-20th century.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the Department of Justice will sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's efforts to create a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map. This move comes days after Trump praised Republican Texas legislators for passing a redistricting plan expected to give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races. Newsom quickly responded with defiance, challenging the federal government's intervention. The dispute highlights a growing national political battle over gerrymandering, as states redraw electoral maps following census data or in response to partisan shifts, impacting future election outcomes.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how Donald Trump's second term is systematically undermining the rule of law, with actions suggesting a shift towards arbitrary and corrupt personal rule. Examples include accusations against political opponents, an FBI raid on critic John Bolton, and the purging of federal law enforcement officials. The piece argues that Trump is replacing nonpartisan public servants with loyalists, leading to a breakdown of post-Watergate ethics rules and widespread conflicts of interest. The author expresses deep concern that these actions are eroding public understanding of legal impartiality, making it difficult to restore governmental integrity in the future.</p>

          <p>China Evergrande's shares have been delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking another significant step in the collapse of the heavily indebted real estate developer. The delisting follows a Hong Kong court's liquidation order after the company failed to present a viable debt restructuring plan for its over $340 billion in liabilities. Evergrande's downfall, triggered by Chinese regulators' crackdown on excessive borrowing, has exacerbated a prolonged property market crisis, impacting the broader Chinese economy and leaving many homebuyers with unfinished projects.
