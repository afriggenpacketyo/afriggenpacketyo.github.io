          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new travel ban, set to take effect on Monday, impacting citizens from twelve countries including Iran, Afghanistan, and Yemen, citing national security concerns. The proclamation states these countries lack sufficient vetting processes to detect potential safety or terrorism threats. The ban includes exceptions for U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with clear evidence of their relationships. This policy mirrors a similar travel ban from 2017, which was later rescinded by President Biden, sparking criticism from Democratic lawmakers who argue it promotes bigotry and hatred rather than enhancing national security. Optimism remains relatively low given the restrictive nature of the ban and the potential for humanitarian consequences.</p>

          <p>Nintendo's highly anticipated Switch 2 console launched with excitement, resulting in shortages and special store opening hours in several markets. The company hopes this new console will continue the success of the original Switch, which has sold over 152 million units. Demand appears strong, with Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa noting that the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 in Japan was beyond expectations. While shortages are expected to persist in Japan, availability seems better in the U.K., and Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with analysts predicting even higher sales numbers. The launch signifies a positive outlook for Nintendo and the gaming industry, driven by innovative portable design and strong consumer interest.</p>

          <p>Older Americans are claiming Social Security benefits at a record pace, with a 17% increase in filings through May, potentially driven by concerns about the system's stability under the Trump administration. Staffing cuts at the Social Security Administration, combined with an aging population and the trust fund's projected depletion by 2035, are fueling anxieties. While the administration claims it will maintain services through technology, advocacy groups recommend delaying claims to maximize benefits, despite fears about the program's future.

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, reducing the deposit facility rate to 2%, following a dip in Euro zone inflation below the 2% target. The ECB's decision is based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook and the strength of monetary policy transmission, though one governing council member opposed the cut. While the ECB revised its inflation forecast downward, it left the growth forecast unchanged at 0.9%, citing uncertainty surrounding trade policies and geopolitical tensions. The rate cut reflects an attempt to stimulate the Euro zone economy amid concerns over trade and rising geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

This action follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which was blocked by a federal judge.
