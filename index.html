          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at an ICE detention center while protesting with a group of demonstrators and U.S. House Democrats. According to the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials. However, Representative LaMonica McIver stated that Baraka had already left the property when he was arrested, sparking controversy over the arrest's legitimacy. Baraka, who is running for governor, was protesting the opening of the facility which is expected to play a central role in President Trump's mass deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle undocumented immigrants, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller stated that the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in times of invasion, framing illegal immigration as such. This proposal has faced criticism, as the writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a few times in U.S. history, typically during times of war or rebellion.

          <p>A stage adaptation of Yann Martel's "Life of Pi" is reviewed as a marvelously inventive and profound theatrical experience, succeeding through magical simplicity rather than technological thrills. The story revolves around Pi Patel, a 17-year-old boy who survives at sea after a shipwreck, accompanied by animals from his father's zoo. The staging transitions dreamlike between the hospital where Pi recounts his story and his childhood in India, using scenic design, video animation, and puppetry to create a captivating world.

          <p>Jack Katz, a comic-book artist and writer known for his 768-page epic, "The First Kingdom," has died at the age of 97. Katz's magnum opus, published in installments starting in 1974, is widely credited with helping give birth to the long-form graphic novel. "The First Kingdom" is a sprawling blend of fantasy and science fiction with philosophical underpinnings, influenced by Homer's epics. Despite facing commercial constraints and artistic challenges throughout his career, Katz's ambition and attention to detail earned him recognition as a maverick genius in the comics world.</p>

Tufts University has defended Ozturk, stating that her op-ed did not violate university policies.

          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to steep tariffs imposed by President Trump, making it too costly for U.S. retailers to import goods from China. As a result, shipments from China to the U.S. decreased by 21% compared to the previous year. Meanwhile, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, highlighting the disruption of trade patterns caused by the tariffs. The Trump administration is considering lowering tariffs to 80%, though this would still be considerably high, but businesses are waiting to see where tariff rates will settle.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new trade pact with the U.K. is being viewed with skepticism by some experts, who suggest that it signals the continuation of high tariffs. While the deal offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports, which is higher than the pre-Trump effective tariff rate. Economists warn that even with new trade deals, the average tariff rate will remain high, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Uncertainty over the level and duration of tariffs continues to pose significant risks to businesses.</p>
