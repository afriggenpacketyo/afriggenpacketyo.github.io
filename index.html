          <p>A federal judge has partially blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling U.S. elections, specifically preventing the implementation of documentary proof of citizenship requirements for voter registration. Judge Kollar-Kotelly ruled that the president lacks the constitutional authority to regulate federal elections, a power reserved for Congress and the states. The ruling responds to lawsuits from voting rights groups and the Democratic Party, who argued the executive order was an overreach of presidential power. The White House intends to fight for election integrity and is confident of an ultimate victory in court.</p>

Intel is reducing its operating expense target and gross capital expenditures. The company's outlook is clouded by high retaliatory levies on U.S.-made semiconductors by China.</p>

          <p>A prolonged trade war could lead to retail shortages, particularly in apparel, footwear, toys, and home goods. Tariffs are acting as an import ban, with limited opportunity to shift sourcing. Declining freight vessel bookings and sailings to the U.S. are contributing to the risk. Low-end stores with lean inventories will be hit hardest and fastest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal health officials plan to cut funding for the Women’s Health Initiative, a landmark study of women’s health. The study, which enrolled over 160,000 participants, has shaped clinical guidelines and prevented numerous cases of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Funding for the regional centers will be terminated in September, with the clinical coordinating center funded through January 2026. The budget for 2025 is $9.3 million.</p>
