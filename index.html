          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders in Washington to discuss ending the war with Russia. While the summit did not yield immediate concrete peace deals, it set the stage for potential direct talks between Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which Trump is actively arranging. European leaders pushed for a ceasefire as a precondition for further negotiations, a point Trump seemed to dismiss, while Zelensky emphasized Ukraine's urgent need for comprehensive security support. The meeting highlighted the complex diplomatic maneuvering required to bridge the significant gaps between Ukrainian and Russian demands for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets experienced declines, mirroring Wall Street's performance as investors await an upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. Market sentiment was also influenced by the high-stakes talks in Washington between U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and European leaders regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. While Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight increase, indices in South Korea and Australia fell. The downturn in the U.S. was partly driven by losses in major tech stocks like Meta and Microsoft, setting a cautious tone for global investors. (not investment advice)</p>

An evolution of the Type 99 series, the 55-tonne Type 99A features an improved 125mm smoothbore gun and a larger turret. As global conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East renew focus on land-based military systems, the Type 99A underscores China's continued investment in its army alongside its naval and air force modernization.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is forecast to move up the U.S. East Coast without making landfall, though it will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents. As of Monday evening, the Category 4 storm had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and was located southwest of Bermuda. While the storm's center is expected to remain offshore, tropical storm watches and storm surge warnings have been issued for North Carolina's Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations are in effect for some islands. Officials are urging coastal residents to heed local warnings and avoid the dangerous ocean conditions throughout the week.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed unease about the current state of artificial intelligence investment, describing valuations as "insane" and acknowledging the market is in a bubble phase. While warning that some investors are likely to get "very burnt," he remains confident in AI's long-term societal value and plans for OpenAI to spend trillions on datacenter construction. Analysts like Wedbush's Dan Ives view the massive capital expenditures by tech giants as a validation of AI's potential, distinguishing the current boom from the dot-com era due to the strong earnings and cash flow of the companies involved.

This self-defeating rat race is symptomatic of a larger issue where local governments and enterprises feel they have no other viable options for growth.

          <h2>California Democrats Advance Plan to Redraw Congressional Maps in Response to Texas GOP</h2>

          <p>California's Democratic leaders have initiated a legislative process to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move they describe as a necessary counter to Republican efforts in Texas to create more GOP-leaning seats. If passed, the plan would go before voters in a November special election and would create new maps for the 2026, 2028, and 2030 elections. Democrats argue this is essential to protect democracy and stymie President Trump's agenda. Republicans have condemned the proposal as a partisan power grab that subverts the will of voters, who previously established an independent redistricting commission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a plan to eliminate mail-in voting and restrict the use of certain voting machines ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, claiming these methods are corrupt and unreliable. He stated that an executive order is being drafted to bar states from using mail ballots, a move legal experts argue exceeds presidential authority, as the Constitution grants Congress and states the power to regulate elections. This initiative follows years of unsubstantiated claims about widespread fraud associated with mail-in voting, a method that has been used since the Civil War and saw increased adoption during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>An investigation reveals the dire situation of women in Afghanistan's largest mental health facility, many of whom are effectively trapped long after they are medically ready for release. Due to strict Taliban regulations and patriarchal traditions that prevent women from living independently, they are often abandoned by their families with nowhere to go. The center is severely overcrowded and struggling to cope with a surge in patients as the mental health crisis among Afghan women worsens under the erosion of their rights. The report highlights a systemic failure where cultural and legal barriers turn care facilities into long-term prisons.</p>

          <p>One week into President Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C., the militarization of the capital is intensifying with the deployment of National Guard troops from several Republican-led states. Despite the administration citing a need to combat crime, the goals and end-date of the operation remain undefined, raising concerns about a potentially indefinite federal occupation. Federal forces are largely absent from high-crime areas, while immigration arrests have increased, and residents report feeling intimidated rather than safer. The move is viewed by some as an improvisational power grab that could serve as a model for federal intervention in other Democrat-run cities.</p>

          <p>A second airman from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in a fatal shooting, marking the second such case in a month. Airman First Class Jadan Orr, 20, was arrested after allegedly firing an AK-47 through an apartment wall during a night of drinking, killing a 23-year-old man. This incident follows the July shooting death of another airman at the base, which led to the arrest of a different airman and prompted the Air Force to suspend use of the Sig Sauer M18 handgun due to concerns about accidental discharge.</p>

          <p>The California state legislature has passed a bill ensuring that homeowners, rather than mortgage lenders, receive interest earned on insurance payouts for homes damaged or destroyed by natural disasters. Currently, lenders can deposit these funds into escrow accounts and keep the accrued interest while homeowners wait for the money to be released for rebuilding. The new legislation, which now awaits the governor's signature, guarantees homeowners at least 2% interest on these funds. The bill aims to close a loophole in existing law and provide additional financial support to residents recovering from catastrophic events like wildfires.</p>

          <p>Professor Malik Peiris, a renowned Hong Kong virologist who discovered the original SARS coronavirus, has warned that a future pandemic is inevitable and that the world may not be better prepared than it was for COVID-19.

Peiris emphasized that the COVID-19 crisis demonstrated the massive destructive potential of pandemics on health, economies, and social well-being. He called for a more resilient global approach that integrates human, animal, and environmental health to prevent future catastrophes.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent fired at a moving vehicle in Southern California after the driver allegedly struck two agents and sped away during an immigration stop. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agent fired in self-defense, and no one was hit by the gunfire. However, video taken by the driver's son shows agents smashing the car's windows before it drives off, followed by the sound of shots. The family's advocate says the driver, an undocumented immigrant, was targeted, while DHS criticized local police for not arresting him, citing California's sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting effort have returned to the capital, declaring their protest a success in raising national awareness. By breaking the legislative quorum for weeks, they temporarily derailed plans to redraw congressional maps in a way that would favor the GOP. Now back, they plan to fight the new maps in court, arguing they are discriminatory. Their return allows the legislature to resume, with Governor Greg Abbott expected to push the redistricting bill through, setting the stage for a legal battle and inspiring similar counter-moves in Democrat-led states.</p>

          <p>Following a high-stakes meeting in Washington, President Trump announced he is arranging a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. However, the Kremlin has remained noncommittal, stating only that Putin would consider "raising the level" of negotiations without confirming a presidential summit. The talks in Washington, attended by Zelensky and six European leaders, revealed a key division: European nations are insisting on a ceasefire before further negotiations, while Trump, influenced by his recent meeting with Putin, has suggested a peace deal could be worked out while fighting continues.</p>
