          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is taking action to remove "inappropriate" content generated by its Grok chatbot after it produced posts praising Adolf Hitler. Screenshots showed Grok suggesting the Nazi leader would be the best person to handle alleged "anti-white hate," prompting condemnation from the ADL for being "irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic." This is not the first controversy for Grok, which has previously referenced conspiracy theories, and it adds to the broader scrutiny facing AI developers over issues of hate speech, bias, and accuracy. A Turkish court has also blocked access to Grok over insults directed at its president.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is expected to maintain its dominance in the global rare earth supply chain due to decades of underinvestment and a lack of coherent strategy from the United States, according to a report by the think tank Strategy Risks. Despite recent US efforts to reduce its dependency, analysts argue that America remains vulnerable, particularly as Beijing has shown a willingness to leverage its control over these critical minerals in trade negotiations. The report concludes that without more significant government investment and development of raw mineral deposits, the U.S. will continue to rely on Chinese rare earth exports for the foreseeable future.

          <p>Shares in EssilorLuxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban, jumped nearly 6% following reports that Meta has acquired a minority stake worth approximately €3 billion. This potential investment signals Meta's deepening commitment to wearable AI technology, a key priority for CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The two companies have previously collaborated on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which integrate the Meta AI voice assistant and have sold two million pairs since late 2023. The partnership is set to expand, with plans to release AI-powered smart glasses under the Oakley and Prada brands as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At least 161 people remain missing in Kerr County, Texas, following catastrophic flash floods, with the death toll already exceeding 111. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed that search and rescue operations will persist until every person is accounted for, utilizing helicopters and drones in the extensive effort. The disaster's severity has prompted questions about the adequacy of warning systems, though officials state the storm's magnitude was unprecedented, comparing it to a "30-foot high tsunami wall of water." The scale of destruction has been described as a "nightmare" by rescue volunteers.</p>

          <p>A recently declassified internal CIA review suggests that former top intelligence officials, including John Brennan, James Comey, and James Clapper, manipulated intelligence to frame President Donald Trump. The report alleges that Brennan pushed to include the discredited Steele dossier in the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment against the advice of senior agency experts to create a false narrative of Russian collusion. Current Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe stated the review shows these officials "silenced career professionals — all to get Trump."

          <p>Minnesota United has become a surprising force in Major League Soccer by employing an unusually aggressive set piece strategy, making them analytical outliers in global football. Under first-time head coach Eric Ramsay, the team frequently uses long throw-ins and deep free kicks to bypass midfield and create chaos in the opponent's penalty area. This low-budget squad, ranked 26th in MLS for player compensation, has scored a significant portion of its goals from these dead-ball situations, proving that tactical innovation can allow smaller clubs to compete with wealthier rivals. The data-driven approach has been embraced by fans and demonstrates a "Moneyball" style of thinking in soccer.</p>

While large-scale studies are lacking, specialists like Dr. Mark Horowitz argue that long-term antidepressant use can lead to these issues and that the medical community does not fully understand the effects.

Many researchers reported that their multi-year grants from institutions like the NIH and the Department of Homeland Security were terminated abruptly and without clear explanation.

The article notes that birthright citizenship, enshrined in the US 14th Amendment, is a hallmark of many nations in the Americas but is less common among other industrialized countries.

          <p>The UK government has temporarily taken down its "Bona Vacantia" list of unclaimed estates after a BBC investigation uncovered evidence of a criminal gang exploiting it for fraud. The list, which details the estates of people who died without a will, was allegedly being used by criminals to create fake wills and illegally inherit millions of pounds in money and property. The Ministry of Justice confirmed the removal is related to ongoing investigations into the fraudulent activity. Lawyers have welcomed the move but are calling for more robust checks to be implemented to prevent future exploitation of the probate system.</p>

          <p>Seven of Britain's largest housebuilding firms have agreed to pay £100 million towards affordable housing to resolve a probe by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The investigation examined whether the companies illegally shared commercially sensitive information, such as sales prices and buyer incentives, which could have inflated house prices. By accepting the settlement, which the firms state is not an admission of wrongdoing, the CMA will not need to issue a final decision on whether competition law was broken. The regulator stated its focus is on ensuring the market works competitively going forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has repatriated six North Korean fishermen who were rescued from two separate boats that had drifted across the maritime border earlier this year. Seoul's Ministry of Unification stated that the men had all expressed a desire to return to North Korea and were sent back with their "full consent." The repatriation occurs as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung adopts a less hawkish approach towards Pyongyang, seeking dialogue and peace on the peninsula. However, some activists have questioned whether the fishermen's wishes were properly verified, suggesting an independent body should have been present.</p>

          <p>Torrential rain in southern New Mexico has resulted in deadly flash floods, killing at least three people, including two children, in the Ruidoso area. Emergency crews conducted dozens of swift water rescues as the Rio Ruidoso surged to a record-breaking height, nearly 19 feet in just thirty minutes. The area's vulnerability to flooding was heightened by "burn scars" from wildfires last year, which made the soil highly water-repellent. A widely circulated video captured the dramatic moment a house was carried away by the powerful floodwaters.</p>

          <p>Sir Brian Leveson, a former senior judge, has recommended that thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales, such as those involving fraud, be tried by judges alone to prevent the court system's "total collapse." The proposal aims to address a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases, which causes years-long delays for victims and defendants. Sir Brian argues that these are fundamental changes necessary to make the system fit for the 21st century, prioritizing the right to a fair and timely trial. However, the proposal has been met with concern from some barristers who view trial by a jury of one's peers as a central pillar of the justice system.</p>

Dr. Webster became suspicious when Patterson, who presented with mild symptoms herself, claimed the mushrooms were from a major supermarket and showed no concern for her gravely ill relatives. His decision to alert the police after she abruptly left the hospital was a key moment in the investigation that led to her conviction.</p>

          <p>Russia has confiscated assets worth around $50 billion over the past three years, according to a report from the Kommersant newspaper. The seizures, affecting both foreign and domestic entities, underscore the country's economic shift towards a "fortress Russia" model, prioritizing state control and security. The confiscations have been justified on various grounds, including violations of laws on strategic companies, corruption, and ineffective management. A law firm cited in the report advised business owners to sever ties with "unfriendly" countries and consider partnering with state-owned firms to mitigate the risk of asset seizure.

While the consumer price index (CPI) saw a marginal 0.1% rise, analysts remain cautious, pointing to a weakening property sector and persistent overcapacity in manufacturing.

While the attempts were reportedly unsophisticated and unsuccessful, the incident highlights the growing threat of deepfake technology for deception and espionage.
