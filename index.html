          <p>Chinese government scientists have released results from a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4% across 8,000 sq km. The operation generated over 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. This test, led by the CMAâ€™s key laboratory of cloud-precipitation physics and weather modification, indicates potential advancements in addressing water scarcity in arid regions. The experiment highlights the ongoing efforts to leverage technology to mitigate environmental challenges and improve agricultural productivity.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and alleged Russian interference. The initial election saw a far-right, pro-Russian candidate surprisingly win the first round, but the results were challenged in court. George Simion, an ally of the banned candidate, is expected to advance to a second-round run-off. The election is being closely watched as it reflects the ongoing tensions between pro-Western and pro-Russian factions in the country.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches and ultra-processed foods (UPFs), arguing that it is another way of shaming mothers. While acknowledging the need to examine the marketing of baby food, the author argues that the criticism often overlooks the social, political, and economic factors at play, including the time and labor involved in preparing fresh baby food. The author calls for a more ambitious vision that supports parents with improved paternity leave, workplace creches, and access to resources that facilitate good food choices.</p>
