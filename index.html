          <p>Capital One's shares increased after reporting strong quarterly results driven by improved credit quality. Third-quarter revenue rose 53% year-over-year to $15.36 billion, surpassing estimates, while adjusted earnings per share increased 32% to $5.95. The company's credit performance exceeded expectations, with better-than-expected net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. Capital One repurchased 4.6 million shares for $1 billion in the third quarter and authorized a new $16 billion share repurchase program. The company is integrating Discover and expects $2.5 billion of net synergies. (not investment advice) The financial performance and strategic moves signal stability and future growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paul Ingrassia, President Trump's nominee to lead the Office of the Special Counsel, withdrew his name from consideration after controversy arose over racist text messages. Ingrassia reportedly made disparaging remarks about Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black people in the texts, and he also claimed to have a "Nazi streak." Republican senators called for the White House to withdraw the nomination, leading Ingrassia to pull out before a scheduled hearing, stating that he did not have enough Republican votes. Ingrassia had also been investigated for allegedly making a lower-ranking female colleague uncomfortable during a business trip. The withdrawal highlights rare Republican pushback against a Trump nominee. Optimism for this article is very low, given the nature of the events.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced his concerns about the New York City mayoral race, suggesting he would prefer a Democrat over a candidate he described as a "communist." Trump stated that the city could soon elect a "communist" mayor, and he appeared to reference Democratic socialist nominee Zohran Mamdani. He also lamented the city's decline under progressive leadership. Mamdani has embraced calls to legalize prostitution and tax the wealthy, drawing endorsements from prominent progressives. Trump indicated he would be willing to speak with Mamdani if elected, but he criticized the progressive direction of the city. The political landscape in New York City is a subject of national discussion.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets were poised for a mixed open as investors closely monitored Japan's new government and key export data from Tokyo. Sanae Takaichi was inaugurated as Japan's new prime minister, appointing Shinjiro Koizumi as defense minister and Satsuki Katayama as finance minister. Japan's Nikkei briefly set an intraday record before retreating after Takaichi's win. Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new closing record, driven by strong earnings reports. The market performance reflects a blend of optimism and caution.</p>

          <p>Federal agents conducted a joint Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) crackdown in New York City's Chinatown neighborhood, targeting criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods.

          <p>A criminologist predicts French authorities will likely apprehend the thieves who stole royal crown jewels from the Louvre museum, but recovering the treasures is unlikely. The heist occurred in broad daylight, and the robbers left DNA at the scene, including on a crown they abandoned. Police recovered a crane lift, power saw, gloves, and gasoline. The stolen jewels are estimated to be worth 88 million euros, but experts say they could be worth millions if broken up and sold on the black market. The incident highlights security vulnerabilities at the Louvre. The outcome of the situation remains uncertain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The French Ministry of Culture stated that the jewels stolen from the Louvre museum were not privately insured, as French law prohibits insuring state property. The Louvre's collections are considered state property, and the state bears sole responsibility. If the jewels had been loaned to another institution, insurance would have been calculated based on their estimated value. Authorities are investigating the theft, but experts believe the jewels are unlikely to be recovered. The lack of insurance raises concerns about the financial implications of the loss. The situation underscores the risks associated with housing priceless artifacts.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner stated that the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire is progressing better than expected, despite recent violence. Vance insisted this is "not the end" of the peace plan, but rather, "exactly how this is going to have to happen when you have people who hate each other." The peace process has seen incremental progress, with Israel returning the remains of Palestinians to Gaza and Hamas releasing Israeli hostages. However, the long-term viability of the peace plan remains uncertain, and some Israelis are skeptical of Netanyahu's commitment to lasting peace. The article reflects cautious optimism about the fragile ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A technical issue at Amazon Web Services' Northern Virginia facilities caused a widespread internet outage, affecting over 1,000 sites and services. The incident highlights the fragility of the modern web, which relies heavily on a few massive companies. Amazon controls a significant portion of the global market for cloud computing, making it a central point of failure. The outage serves as a reminder that the internet is physical, fallible, and controlled by a small group of digital landowners. This situation is a cause for concern.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil accused the Trump administration of using immigration court to "control the process" and remove him. The pro-Palestinian activist's comments came after his attorneys appeared before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Khalil, a green card holder, was arrested by ICE agents and detained for protesting a genocide. A federal judge previously blocked the government from removing him. The case raises concerns about the government's treatment of protesters. The future of the situation remains unclear.</p>

          <p>As construction begins on President Trump's new White House ballroom, questions remain about the wealthy donors and corporations funding it. The funding model has sparked concern among legal experts, who suggest it may amount to paying for access to the administration. A dinner for potential donors included senior executives from prominent US companies. Only one contributor has been revealed: YouTube, which will pay $22 million as part of a settlement. The situation raises ethical questions about influence and access. The outcome is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's personal relationship with Xi Jinping could serve as a guardrail for US-China relations. Despite trade tensions, Trump has shown restraint in antagonizing Xi or challenging Beijing's red lines. Trump's control over his administration means leader-to-leader diplomacy is increasingly important. However, some analysts caution that Xi Jinping is not easily swayed by charm. The article suggests a complex dynamic between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>Around 2,000 Waymo vehicles are under investigation after one of the self-driving taxis failed to stop for a school bus. The NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation to examine Waymo’s autonomous technology around stopped school buses. The vehicle initially stopped but then drove around the front of the bus, ignoring the stop arm and flashing red lights. Waymo is working collaboratively with the agency and has made software updates to improve its performance. The incident raises concerns about the safety of driverless vehicles.</p>
