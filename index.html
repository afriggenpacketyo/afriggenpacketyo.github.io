          <p>Five individuals, including three women, a child, and the pilot, were successfully rescued after surviving for 36 hours in a swamp teeming with alligators in the Bolivian Amazon following an emergency landing. The pilot, Andres Velarde, recounted that the plane began losing altitude, forcing him to land in a swamp near a lagoon, where they were surrounded by alligators and an anaconda. They survived by eating cassava flour brought by one of the passengers and were eventually spotted by local fishermen, leading to their rescue via helicopter. All five were reported to be in excellent condition despite their ordeal.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has achieved its first local council control in 10 areas, along with two mayoral positions, signaling a shift in British politics. Nigel Farage's party plans to implement efficiency measures, inspired by Donald Trump's 'Doge' initiative, focusing on cutting council spending on climate change initiatives and diversity programs. Reform aims to resist central government placement of asylum seekers in their controlled areas, with a focus on prioritizing essential services and reducing what they view as excessive expenditure. The party's deputy leader acknowledges the inexperience of newly-elected councillors but believes it will bring fresh perspectives and common sense to local governance.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit argues that these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts, specifically mentioning an apartment complex in Aurora allegedly controlled by a Venezuelan gang due to these policies. The suit seeks to invalidate laws that prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, claiming they violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Both the governor's office and the Denver mayor's office have responded, defending their respective positions and vowing to uphold their values.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway reported a 14% drop in operating earnings for the first quarter, falling to $9.64 billion due to a significant decline in insurance-underwriting profits, which were impacted by Southern California wildfires. Warren Buffett cautioned that tariffs and geopolitical events are creating considerable uncertainty for the conglomerate, making it difficult to predict their potential impact on the business. Despite the earnings decline, Berkshire's cash hoard grew to a record $347 billion as Buffett continued to be a net seller of stocks, primarily reducing holdings in Apple and Bank of America. Buffett also criticized protectionist trade policies, stating that 'trade should not be a weapon'.</p>

          <p>A hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in South Sudan was bombed, resulting in at least seven deaths and twenty injuries, while also destroying all medical supplies. The hospital, located in Old Fangak, served approximately 40,000 people and was the only functional medical facility in the area. MSF strongly condemned the attack, calling it a clear violation of international humanitarian law, with a Fangak County official attributing the attack to a drone and plane belonging to the South Sudan government. The incident is the latest escalation in government-led assaults on opposition groups, raising fears of a return to civil war.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage is celebrating Reform UK's "unprecedented" election results, including control of 10 local councils, two mayoral races, and a fifth MP, largely at the expense of Labour and Conservative parties. Prime Minister Starmer acknowledged that people are not yet feeling the benefits of a Labour government, while Conservative leader Badenoch pledged to make her party a "credible" alternative. Farage claims that Reform UK is ending two-party politics, while Labour faces calls to redistribute wealth and Conservatives apologize for losing council seats.

          <p>Several German states are considering banning smartphones from classrooms, with one high school already trialing the initiative to encourage students to focus on lessons and interact more. The pilot program, called "Smart without your phone", requires students to leave their phones in their schoolbags during the day, with sanctions for violations. Education researchers support smartphone bans, citing increased social wellbeing and reduced cyberbullying, while some student representatives express skepticism, arguing that students should learn responsible smartphone use.

          <p>The Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to El Salvador and paying for their imprisonment is facing constitutional challenges, particularly regarding the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishment." While due-process claims have been the primary focus, concerns are rising about the harsh conditions in El Salvador's prisons, where deportees face indefinite incarceration among violent criminals. Legal experts argue that the Supreme Court should clarify that the government cannot circumvent the Bill of Rights by imprisoning individuals without trials and sentences, potentially violating their Eighth Amendment rights. The policy raises questions about the definition of punishment and the extent of constitutional protections for non-citizens.</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has called the administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act “unlawful”—and was among other judges from across the country who have ruled against the president. Although judges “operate at a different tempo than politicians or executive orders,” he added, “you have seen in the last few weeks a really dramatic move by the judiciary to step in.” The defining fact of the first three months of this second term of Trump is that so many of the institutions that so successfully opposed him in the first term have been absent or in retreat,” Michael Scherer, an Atlantic staff writer, said last night.</p>

          <p>With college costs rising, more high school seniors are choosing colleges based on cost, leading to a higher percentage enrolling in public schools over private ones. Soaring college costs and looming student debt balances have pushed this trend, and this year, there are added concerns about the economy and dwindling federal loan forgiveness options. As a result, this year's crop of high school seniors is more likely to choose local and less-expensive public schools rather than private universities far from home. Financial concerns govern decision-making for 8 in 10 families, according to one report by education lender Sallie Mae, outweighing even academics when choosing a school.</p>

The goal is to flood the zone, as we call it, with Black history, said Crenshaw of the campaign.

          <p>Last weekend the terrible news broke that Virginia Giuffre, one of the most prominent victims of the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein, had died by suicide. Conspiracy theorists immediately started circling. Far too often, when a woman accuses a powerful man of abuse she will have her life destroyed, while the man walks away. Society is set up to protect powerful predators and their enablers: misogyny is woven into the fabric of all our institutions. And yet, five years after the sex offender’s death, the only person to have faced any real consequences is Ghislaine Maxwell, who is in a low-security federal prison.</p>

          <p>Recent happiness research suggests that young people can only really flourish when they have “real-life human contact and love,” Arthur C. Brooks writes. Social connection and community is important for human well-being—not least because it aids in the process of finding meaning and feeling that one’s life has purpose, Brooks notes. But young people are facing a series of roadblocks to finding that meaning: Institutions such as organized religion are in decline, and alternative communities are hard to find, especially when young adults are glued to technology.</p>
