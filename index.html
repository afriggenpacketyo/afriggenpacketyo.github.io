          <p>Australian leg-spinner Alana King achieved the best bowling figures in Women's World Cup history, taking seven wickets for just 18 runs against South Africa.

This dominant victory secures Australia's top spot in the group stage with an undefeated record. The win sets up a semi-final match against India, while South Africa will face England in the other semi-final.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" following the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, to the Caribbean. The move significantly increases U.S. military presence in the region, where it has already conducted air strikes against alleged drug traffickers. U.S. officials state the deployment is to combat transnational criminal organizations, but it fuels speculation in Venezuela of a U.S. plan for regime change, as President Trump has not ruled out "land action."</p>

          <p>Wang Huning, a high-ranking Chinese official, stated that Beijing will leave no room for any "Taiwan independence" separatist activities. The comments were made during an address marking the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return from Japanese rule, a day Beijing uses to assert its sovereignty claim over the self-governed island. Wang emphasized the need to deepen cross-strait integration and foster a shared Chinese national identity. This rhetoric underscores the Communist Party's stated commitment to achieving what it calls the "complete reunification of the motherland."</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the prosecution of several former high-ranking Biden-era officials, including former Attorney General Merrick Garland and special counsel Jack Smith. He accuses them of illegally spying on Republican lawmakers by obtaining their phone records during an investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election. This demand is the latest instance of Trump advocating for legal action against his political adversaries. The officials were involved in the "Arctic Frost" probe, which the Senate Judiciary Committee revealed had accessed call data but not the content of conversations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army's new Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) successfully completed a series of crucial tests, hitting targets 124 miles away at White Sands Missile Range. Developed by Lockheed Martin, the PrSM is set to replace the older ATACMS tactical missile system and can be fired from HIMARS launchers. This next-generation missile offers double the firepower per launch pod and a significantly increased range, potentially up to 250 miles, enhancing soldier safety by allowing them to operate farther from enemy lines. The system is also being adapted to launch drones and other advanced munitions, boosting its strategic capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime (GI-TOC) suggests that mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group systematically used military equipment supplied to Mali's armed forces. Evidence, including open-source photos and interviews, indicates the mercenaries used armored vehicles, heavy machine guns, and drones that were originally procured by the Malian state from countries like China and Turkey. This diversion of equipment could constitute a violation of the Arms Trade Treaty, which requires importers to ensure weapons are not transferred to unauthorized end users, potentially exposing Mali to diplomatic consequences.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off the planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying from billionaire tech CEOs Marc Benioff and Jensen Huang. The sudden reversal quelled a day of crisis in the Bay Area over the imminent arrival of border protection agents. The president's decision, which he said was based on being asked "very nicely," highlights a capricious approach to domestic policy and military deployment. While the immediate crisis is averted for San Francisco, it remains unclear if other Bay Area cities are also spared from the deployment.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law that will permit the year-round hunting of non-native mute swans, classifying them as an invasive species. Wildlife officials argue the measure is necessary to protect the state's dwindling wetlands, as the large, aggressive birds consume vast amounts of aquatic vegetation and displace native waterfowl. The law, which takes effect January 1, has been supported by conservation and waterfowl groups but criticized by animal advocacy organizations as inhumane. Mute swans were introduced to North America from Eurasia in the 1800s for ornamental purposes and are not protected under federal migratory bird treaties.</p>

          <p>California wildlife officials have euthanized four gray wolves from the Beyem Seyo pack following an "unprecedented" number of cattle kills in the Sierra Valley. These four wolves were responsible for 70 livestock losses between March and September, prompting the decision after non-lethal hazing methods failed to deter them. While the return of the apex predator has been celebrated by conservationists for its ecological benefits, it has created significant conflict with ranchers. Wolves remain a protected endangered species in California, and lethal removal is only permitted under strict circumstances where a pack becomes dangerously habituated to preying on livestock.</p>

A new law signed by President Trump is projected to cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, potentially causing hundreds of thousands in Louisiana to lose their health insurance. The law will impose new work reporting requirements and more frequent eligibility checks, which experts warn will create bureaucratic hurdles that disenroll many people.

By framing the issue around "narco-terrorism" and leveraging the designation of a Venezuelan gang as a terrorist organization, Rubio has shaped a policy aimed at regime change.
