        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a decline, falling below 140 yen for the first time in seven months, after President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. Trump's comments raised concerns about the central bank's independence and the potential for further rate cuts. Safe haven assets like gold saw a boost as investors grew wary of the U.S. economy, and Tokyo stocks showed mixed performance, with semiconductor-related issues declining and domestic demand-sensitive stocks attracting buying.

          <p>Prince William's decision to appoint Jason Knauf, who previously accused Meghan Markle of bullying, as CEO of The Earthshot Prize is seen as a significant move that exacerbates the royal rift. Experts suggest this decision sends a clear message that Prince William disregards the opinions of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. This appointment reinforces the legitimacy of the bullying allegations against Meghan, while solidifying Knauf's position as a trusted advisor within William's inner circle, highlighting the ongoing tensions within the royal family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores alternative systems for the NFL draft that could address issues of parity and player agency. Proposed changes include flipping the draft order to reward teams closer to the playoffs, implementing a draft lottery similar to other sports leagues, and waiving the eligibility rule to allow younger players to be drafted and stashed. Another suggestion involves a salary pool system, allowing teams to negotiate with prospects based on available funds, giving players more control over their destination and compensation.</p>

          <p>The climate crisis is intensifying the global housing crisis, with extreme weather events and rising sea levels impacting housing costs and availability. As high-income individuals move away from vulnerable coastal areas, lower-income residents are displaced, leading to climate gentrification. Post-disaster housing shortages further exacerbate the problem, driving up prices and making accommodation unaffordable for many. City planning and risk reduction strategies, such as shifting housing density to low-risk areas and implementing climate-resilient retrofitting, are crucial to ensuring affordability and climate resilience.</p>

          <p>India and the US are making progress in negotiating a bilateral trade deal, according to statements made after a meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice-President JD Vance in Delhi. The meeting occurs as India seeks to avoid potential 27% tariffs from the US, with negotiations ongoing during a 90-day pause on higher tariffs. Despite a warm personal relationship between Modi and Trump, trade tensions persist, with the US highlighting a "serious lack of reciprocity" in the trade relationship.</p>

          <p>China's restrictions on critical metal exports to the United States are visibly impacting trade, with exports of these minerals plummeting, and shipments of several key items halting entirely in March. This move, a response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, is expected to pressure U.S. manufacturers heavily reliant on rare earths from China. China, a dominant player in the rare earths supply chain, is leveraging its strategic advantage amid the trade war, leading to significant declines in U.S.-bound shipments of tellurium, tungsten, and other critical materials.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss trade, reporting "significant progress" toward a trade deal between the two countries. The meeting is timely as India seeks to finalize a trade agreement before the expiry of a 90-day pause on tariffs from the Trump administration. The discussions also included enhancing cooperation in energy, defense, and strategic technologies, and are being viewed as an opportunity for India to host Trump for the Quad summit later this year.</p>

          <p>Over 100 presidents of US colleges and universities have signed a statement denouncing the Trump administration's "unprecedented government overreach and political interference" in higher education. This unified front comes in response to the administration's actions against universities, including funding cuts and demands for institutional autonomy. The presidents call for constructive engagement but oppose undue government intrusion into campus life, highlighting the threat to academic freedom and partnerships between the government and universities.</p>
