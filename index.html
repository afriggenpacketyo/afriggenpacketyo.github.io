The Biden administration banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic uranium enrichment. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will still rely on other countries for uranium due to limited reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta is suing Joy Timeline HK Limited, the maker of the CrushAI app, which uses artificial intelligence to simulate nude images of real people. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent the company from advertising CrushAI apps on Meta platforms. Meta alleges that Joy Timeline circumvented its ad review process despite violating the social media sites' advertising policies. Meta is also sharing information about entities violating its policies with other tech companies through the Tech Coalition's Lantern Program and developing better technology to detect ads from nudify apps. </p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, due to a decline in food prices.

The Reserve Bank of India has relaxed monetary policy amid easing inflationary pressures, cutting its benchmark repo rate to 5.50%. Economists predict further rate cuts, citing softened commodity prices and weakened economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

Challenges persist due to rapid population growth, poverty, and climate change, which force families into labor.
