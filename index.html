          <h2>Tesla's First Quarter Revenue Plummets Amidst Market Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 20:19:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's first-quarter earnings revealed a significant 20% drop in automotive revenue, contributing to a 9% overall revenue decrease, falling short of Wall Street's expectations. The company cites factory updates for the Model Y refresh, lower average selling prices, and sales incentives as contributing factors to the decline. CEO Elon Musk's increased involvement in President Trump's administration, particularly overseeing federal government downsizing and navigating sweeping tariffs, has added to investor concerns, as well as spending much of his time in President Donald Trump's White House, overseeing an effort to dramatically downsize the federal government. Tesla refrained from promising growth this year and will revisit its 2025 guidance in the next quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, already convicted of murdering two of her children, has been found guilty in Arizona of conspiring with her brother to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019. Prosecutors argued that Daybell orchestrated the shooting to collect a $1 million life insurance policy and to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, invoking "twisted" religious beliefs as justification. The jury highlighted text messages discussing the insurance policy and religious justifications as key evidence. Daybell faces sentencing in this case and a separate trial for allegedly conspiring to kill her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux; she is already serving a life sentence for the murders of her children, while Chad Daybell awaits execution for those murders and the murder of his first wife.</p>

          <p>The Education Department will resume involuntary collections for defaulted student loans, including wage garnishment, starting May 5, potentially affecting millions of borrowers. This action follows the end of the COVID-19 pandemic-era payment pause, initiated in March 2020, and impacts over 5 million borrowers currently in default, with millions more at risk. The department will notify borrowers of repayment options, while Secretary Linda McMahon criticized the previous administration for misleading borrowers about debt waiver authority.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the restoration of Voice of America (VoA), reversing the Trump administration's decision to dismantle the federally-funded news agency in March. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, allowing VoA to resume operations after it was argued that the dismantling eliminated a crucial source of objective news globally. The Trump administration had claimed VoA promoted biased reporting and dismantled its parent company, the United States Agency for Global Media. The lawsuit filed by VoA employees argued that the dismantling would leave a void filled only by censored, state-sponsored media.</p>

Both students were arrested in March and face deportation under a 1952 law citing adverse foreign policy consequences.

While some studies suggest links between artificial dyes and neurobehavioral problems, scientists caution the evidence is not definitive.

          <p>President Trump stated he has "no intention of firing" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's monetary policy. Trump reiterated his call for lower interest rates, arguing it is a "perfect time" to do so, but acknowledged the decision ultimately rests with Powell. The relationship between Trump and Powell has been strained due to differing views on interest rates and the Fed's independence, raising concerns about political influence over economic policy. Powell has warned that Trump's tariffs could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, working with food companies to remove them. The FDA aims to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and eliminate six remaining dyes used in various food products. The announcement follows the start of a ban on Red No. 3 and aims to promote natural alternatives, but the plan is contingent on an "understanding" with major food companies. The International Association of Color Manufacturers has questioned the proposed timeline.</p>

Garcia accused the Trump administration of defying a Supreme Court ruling requiring the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return and of instilling fear in immigrant communities.

The tariffs have caused market instability and increased interest rates, but Trump insisted he would be "very nice" to China and not play hardball with President Xi Jinping.

Trump's tariffs on auto imports, particularly from China, have disrupted Tesla's supply chain, leading to suspended imports of crucial auto parts.

While the food industry denies safety concerns with artificial dyes, the FDA aims to work with companies to eliminate six remaining synthetic food dyes and accelerate the approval of new natural color additives. This decision follows concerns about potential health risks and behavioral changes in children associated with these dyes.</p>
