          <p>This article discusses the evolving role of grandparents in contemporary American family life, highlighting their increasing importance due to demographic shifts, longer life expectancies, and the rising costs of child care. Grandparents are spending more time with their grandchildren, contributing to better educational and mental health outcomes. They often provide crucial child care support, filling gaps in the strained child care system, though this can create financial and emotional challenges for them. The article emphasizes the need for policies that support grandparents' involvement without placing undue burden on them, advocating for affordable child care and paid parental leave to ensure grandparents can choose to participate without feeling obligated.</p>

          <p>North Korea launched multiple short-range ballistic missiles into its eastern sea, prompting condemnation from South Korea, which described the launches as a "clear act of provocation." The missiles, fired from the Wonsan area, traveled approximately 497 miles and are believed to be tests of weapons systems intended for export, potentially to support Russia's war efforts against Ukraine. South Korean and U.S. intelligence agencies detected the launch preparations and are analyzing whether the tests are linked to North Korea's weapons exports to Russia. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command condemned the launches and called on North Korea to refrain from further destabilizing acts.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States and the United Kingdom have reached a comprehensive trade agreement, making the U.K. the first country to secure such a deal after the U.S. imposed tariffs on various trading partners. The agreement aims to strengthen the relationship between the two countries. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office confirmed ongoing talks and promised an update. The deal may address tariffs on steel, aluminum, and vehicles, which have impacted the U.K. economy. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, citing global growth concerns due to tariff uncertainty, though it expects minimal impact on the U.K.</p>

          <p>Cliona Ward, an Irish woman who has lived legally in the U.S. for decades, was released after being detained by U.S. immigration authorities for 17 days due to a criminal record dating back almost 20 years.

Ward's incarceration sparked outrage, with Irish officials and U.S. representatives speaking out.

The deal could support key sectors like the auto industry, which has been affected by high tariffs. While the U.S. is an important trading partner, the agreement's overall impact may be limited, as trade flows are heavily skewed toward services, which were not affected by the tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration has invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly removed to El Salvador. This action prevents the disclosure of documents related to Abrego Garcia's removal and any efforts to return him to the United States. A judge has ordered both sides to submit additional legal papers justifying the invocation of these privileges. Abrego Garcia's legal team accuses the administration of failing to facilitate his return, despite a Supreme Court agreement. The administration claims Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, while his lawyers deny these allegations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has once again criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the central bank decided to maintain steady interest rates, citing economic uncertainty caused by tariffs. Trump referred to Powell as a "fool" who doesn't have a clue, despite previously stating he liked him very much. The Fed's decision to hold rates steady is influenced by concerns about potential inflation stemming from Trump's trade policies. Powell has stated that the Fed's decisions are based solely on economic data and the outlook for maximum employment and price stability, unaffected by political pressure.</p>

With significant staff layoffs and a weakened regulatory framework, the CFPB is no longer effectively protecting consumers.

          <p>This article argues that President Donald Trump's policies are eerily reminiscent of Mao Zedong's strategies during the Chinese Cultural Revolution. It claims that Trump is emulating Mao's tactics by attacking universities, targeting scientific funding, and promoting a cult of personality. The piece suggests that the administration is dismantling state capacity while hunting down wrongthink, mirroring the fervor and zeal of Mao's regime. The author expresses concern that America's pursuit of Maoist ideals could cede global preeminence to China.</p>

          <h2>DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) Still a Joke, Failing to Meaningfully Reduce Federal Spending</h2>

          <p>This article critiques the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, arguing that it has failed to meaningfully reduce federal spending despite its initial promises. The article points out accounting errors, exaggerated savings claims, and the focus on small targets while neglecting major expenses like Social Security and Medicare. The analysis suggests that DOGE's cuts have been disruptive and harmful, but their total savings are minimal. The piece concludes that DOGE serves primarily to purge the civil service, reward MAGA voters, and potentially benefit Musk's companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a Los Angeles-based holistic medicine doctor and wellness influencer, as his choice for surgeon general, signaling a departure from establishment medicine. Means, a Stanford medical school graduate, aligns with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s mission to "Make America Healthy Again." However, some question her full alignment with Kennedy's views, particularly on vaccines and fluoride. Her focus on metabolic health and food as medicine suggests a different perspective for the role. She has publicly raised concerns about some vaccines and supported ending vaccine mandates.</p>

          <p>A new documentary has identified an Israeli soldier, Capt. Alon Scagio, as the shooter in the 2022 killing of Shireen Abu Akleh, a renowned Palestinian American broadcaster, in the West Bank. The Israeli military had previously acknowledged that an Israeli soldier most likely shot her but declined to identify the individual. Two Israeli military officials confirmed the documentary's conclusions to The New York Times. Ms. Abu Akleh's death sparked widespread mourning and international scrutiny, leading to friction between the American and Israeli governments. Captain Scagio was killed in Jenin last June.</p>

The National Energy System Operator's (Neso) report noted that detectives found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious.

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's consideration of tariffs on movies made outside America, a move that has sparked concerns in Hollywood. While the U.S. film industry has a trade surplus, fewer movies are being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax credits in other locations. Tariffs, however, are a messy solution, and the industry prefers tax credits to lure filmmakers back to America. The article explores the potential impact of tariffs on production costs, box office earnings, and global ticket sales.</p>

Families of the hostages have urged Netanyahu to prioritize a deal with Hamas to return the remaining hostages, rather than expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The prime minister has said that rescuing hostages is a "very important goal" of the war, but that "the supreme goal is to achieve victory over our enemies".</p>
