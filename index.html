        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has determined that Iran is not meeting its non-proliferation obligations, marking the first such instance in 20 years. This determination follows a report citing a lack of cooperation from Iran and concerns about undeclared nuclear material. The IAEA's resolution carries the potential for referral to the UN Security Council, which could complicate talks between Iran and the US regarding a new nuclear agreement and possibly escalate tensions in the Middle East. Iran maintains that its nuclear activities are peaceful and denies seeking nuclear weapons. Optimism for the situation is low given the high stakes and potential for international conflict.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that following a low-calorie diet may lead to negative mental health effects, including depressive symptoms. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 29,000 adults and found that those on calorie-restrictive diets, even overweight individuals, experienced an increase in depressive symptom severity. The study also noted that people who followed nutrient-restricted diets saw a larger increase in symptoms, while men on any diet showed higher somatic symptom scores. While the article suggests potential risks, it also emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet and cognitive behavioral therapy to foster healthy habits.</p>

          <p>Two police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, have filed a federal civil lawsuit seeking a court order to hang a plaque honoring police heroes who protected the Capitol. The lawsuit cites a 2022 law requiring the plaque's installation by March 2023, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to doing so. The officers argue that the failure to hang the plaque violates the Equal Protection clause, especially given President Trump's downplaying of the event and attempts to honor him in other ways. The lawsuit aims to ensure the officers' bravery is recognized despite ongoing political divisions.</p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium mining, now imports over 95% of its uranium, but recent bipartisan support, including a ban on Russian uranium imports and federal funding, aims to expand domestic uranium enrichment. However, experts note that even with increased production, the U.S. will still rely on other countries for uranium due to limited reserves. Uranium mining companies are working to restart and ramp up domestic production, but face challenges in meeting growing demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some parents are trying to delay their daughtersâ€™ first periods (menarche) by making changes to their diet and personal care products. This trend is influenced by research indicating that the average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier. Parents are concerned about the potential health risks associated with earlier menstruation, including increased risk of cardiovascular disease and reproductive cancers. Experts recommend limiting exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals but caution against overly restrictive diets that could lead to eating disorders.</p>

          <p>Multiple sources have informed CBS News that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, with U.S. officials anticipating potential Iranian retaliation on American sites in Iraq. This anticipation has prompted the U.S. to advise some Americans to leave the region and authorize military family members to voluntarily depart from locations throughout the Middle East. Despite these tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy still plans to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program, underscoring the delicate balance between potential conflict and diplomatic efforts.</p>
