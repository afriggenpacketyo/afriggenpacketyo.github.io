          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes as part of its ongoing turnaround efforts, which may result in a reduction of approximately 1,700 roles globally by 2027.

For the full fiscal year, sales were down 12%, compared to an expected 13% drop, with total revenue reaching Â£2.461 million.

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% following the announcement of a share buyback program worth up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst expectations, coming in at 203.6 billion yen, although it was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. Despite the positive news, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was somewhat lackluster, with projected operating profit growth of only 0.3%. (not investment advice)</p>

Both countries will maintain some tariffs, and the remaining amounts will be subject to negotiation during the 90-day pause.

These measures include expanding the BBC's fact-checking service, BBC Verify, and enhancing local journalism.

He also proposes a national plan to transition to internet-only delivery of programs by the 2030s, potentially launching a streaming media device to aid those who have not yet switched to streaming services.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in their homeowners insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and the adoption of the decision by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. This increase is meant to alleviate the company's financial situation after the Los Angeles-area wildfires. The decision grants State Farm a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company. Senator Sasha RenÃ©e PÃ©rez has requested a delay on the decision until an investigation into insurance payment delays is complete. The company has also agreed to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>New climate data from oyster fossils challenges the idea that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting that polar ice was present. During that time, the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius, which is comparable to today. The findings provide insight into climate change, indicating that reductions in Arctic and Antarctic ice are expected to continue, potentially leading to completely ice-free polar regions. Scientists note that this transition would shift the planet from a predominantly white winter to a blue one.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washingtonâ€™s demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reportedly presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. The plan aims to address both immediate and long-term concerns about Iran's nuclear program and would be a permanent arrangement.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decline in April, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs fell to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. Despite the decrease, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu, which has wiped out flocks of egg-laying hens. The progress of the virus is uncertain, and prices could increase again if outbreaks expand.</p>

          <p>U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risks associated with Chinese-made power inverters after the discovery of undocumented communication devices inside some of them. These rogue components, including cellular radios, provide additional communication channels that could allow firewalls to be circumvented remotely. The concern is that these devices could be used to destabilize power grids, damage energy infrastructure, and trigger widespread blackouts. Some utilities are attempting to minimize the use of Chinese inverters by sourcing equipment from elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Concerns have been raised about safety at HMP Five Wells, a prison in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, now housing a high number of sexual assault offenders.

Former inmates describe frequent attacks and bullying, while families express fear and unease. The prison, initially touted as a 'smart' facility, is facing accusations of inadequate rehabilitation and resource allocation, leading to a deterioration in conditions.</p>
