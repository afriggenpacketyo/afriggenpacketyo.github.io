          <p>The White House has unexpectedly imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss imports, a rate significantly higher than the 10-15% anticipated by market observers. This move has been described as a "devastating" blow by financial analysts, potentially impacting Switzerland's GDP and threatening tens of thousands of jobs in its export-driven economy. While Swiss officials express regret and seek a negotiated solution before the August 7 deadline, the pharmaceutical sector may be exempt, offering a slight reprieve amid the widespread economic uncertainty.

          <p>South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who is jailed while on trial for rebellion charges related to his imposition of martial law, has again refused to cooperate with investigators. On Friday, he resisted questioning by removing his prison uniform and lying on the floor of his detention cell. This is the latest act of defiance from the ex-leader, whose defense team claims he is unable to participate in legal proceedings due to various health issues. The special counsel investigating separate allegations against Yoon and his wife refrained from using force but vowed to execute their warrant in the future.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has turned down an opening offer from Liverpool for their 25-year-old striker, Alexander Isak. Reports suggest the bid was around £110 million plus add-ons, falling short of Newcastle's valuation, which is believed to be approximately £150 million. Isak, who was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, is reportedly keen on exploring a move despite his club's qualification for the Champions League. It remains uncertain if Liverpool, which has already spent heavily this summer, will return with an improved offer for the Swedish international.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many international aid organizations are choosing to remain silent in the face of significant funding cuts by the Trump administration, a strategy some experts term "anticipatory silence." Fearing further retaliation or hoping to negotiate privately, these groups have avoided public outcry, a tactic that has sparked intense internal debate within the non-profit sector. Critics of this approach argue that it allows the administration to control the narrative and could be a dangerous step toward authoritarianism. However, some groups believe quiet, behind-the-scenes advocacy is more effective at protecting vital programs and the lives they save.</p>

Despite the health challenges, James has shown significant progress in the G-League and is working to overcome the physical and mental hurdles from the life-threatening event.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman publicly explained their recent votes against holding interest rates steady, arguing that the central bank's cautious approach is a mistake. Both officials advocated for a quarter-point rate reduction, stating that the inflationary impact of tariffs is likely temporary and that waiting to ease policy poses a significant risk to the labor market and economic growth. They believe the Fed's "wait and see" stance is overly cautious and could result in falling behind the curve, emphasizing the need for gradual cuts to balance economic risks.

          <p>Massive wildfires in Arizona and Utah have grown so intense they are creating their own weather phenomena, including towering "fire clouds" known as pyrocumulus clouds. In Arizona, the Dragon Bravo Fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has become a "megafire," charring over 164 square miles and forcing the closure of the area for the season. These fire-generated clouds can produce powerful, erratic winds, creating dangerous and unpredictable conditions that have forced firefighting crews to retreat. Atmospheric scientists note that such events may become more frequent due to climate change, which is contributing to longer fire seasons and extreme drought.</p>

Non-profits like MSI Reproductive Choices were unable to acquire the contraceptives, as federal rules prohibit providing such goods to groups associated with abortion services.

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has confirmed that the league will not shrink from 20 to 18 clubs, despite growing pressure on the international football calendar. Masters criticized FIFA for a lack of consultation regarding the expanded Club World Cup and World Cup, stating that domestic football should not be sacrificed for global expansion. The congested schedule, which also includes expanded UEFA competitions, has already led to the scrapping of FA Cup replays. Masters argued that these external decisions are forcing the league to redesign its calendar at the expense of player welfare.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a majority of Americans hold the Trump administration and corporate interests responsible for their financial struggles amid the rising cost of living. Six in ten respondents blame the administration for driving up costs, with nearly 80% fearing that the president's tariffs will further increase prices on everyday goods. The survey highlights widespread anxiety about affording basic necessities like groceries and housing, with many Americans taking on debt to cope. The findings suggest a deep dissatisfaction with the current economic conditions and a belief that policies are favoring corporations over working families. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new peer-reviewed study concludes that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in southern California in January 2024 was likely caused by pesticide exposure. Researchers found hundreds of dead or dying butterflies near a wintering site, and tests on the insects revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each, some at lethal levels. The findings provide rare, direct evidence of pesticide impact on wild butterfly populations, which have declined by as much as 90% in some regions. The study suggests that reducing pesticide use, especially near sensitive habitats, is essential for the species' long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the trade of precious metals and gems, a sector previously exploited as a loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must report any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) to the country's financial crime watchdog within five days. This is China's first such regulation to expand supervision beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector. The move aims to close a significant gap in the country's efforts to prevent illicit financial flows and enhance compliance with international anti-money-laundering standards.

This shift from informal "handshake agreements" has boosted total compensation, with median pay for CEOs at larger firms exceeding $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity, reflecting a growing formalization in this exclusive corner of the wealth management industry.

Research from Pew indicates that 18-to-29-year-olds are more evenly split between the parties than in previous years. This dynamic presents a challenge for both parties, as Gen Z's pessimism and disengagement make them an unpredictable and up-for-grabs voting bloc.</p>
