            <h2>IDF Inquiry Finds 'Professional Failures' in Killing of Gaza Medics</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 16:27:44 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry concluded that "professional failures" led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The investigation cited an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders" as contributing factors. One commander was dismissed, and another will be reprimanded, though the Palestine Red Crescent Society dismissed the report as invalid. The IDF maintained that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim that is disputed. The incident occurred in a "hostile combat zone" with poor visibility, leading to the misidentification of the ambulances.</p>

            <p>Both Russia and Ukraine accused each other of violating the one-day Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and drone strikes, suggesting Putin may not have full control over his army. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Ukrainian forces launched attacks in the Donetsk region and sent drones into Russian territory, resulting in civilian casualties. Despite the ceasefire's apparent failure, President Trump expressed hope for a deal between the two countries this week.</p>

He urged the justices to limit the order to AEA removals only. The lower courts have not yet weighed in on the government's "notice" and "opportunity to appeal" process.</p>

            <h2>Trump Tariffs Could Lead to Economic Slowdown After Artificially High Start, Says Chicago Fed Chief</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 14:14:57 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a summer economic slowdown after an initial period of inflated activity. Businesses and consumers are stocking up on inventory in anticipation of the tariffs, which could create an "artificially high" level of economic activity in the short term. Sectors like the auto industry are particularly likely to stockpile inventory. The uncertainty surrounding the tariffs is causing concern among business owners, with some already struggling to afford rush orders.</p>
