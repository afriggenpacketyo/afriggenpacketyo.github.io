        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese customs officials are intensifying efforts to stop smugglers of Pop Mart toys, particularly the Labubu and Molly series, as the demand and prices for these dolls surge globally. Agents have confiscated undeclared toys from passengers attempting to resell them for profit, with hundreds of toys seized at airports in Hunan and Anhui provinces. This trend is driven by travelers buying the toys overseas, where they are sometimes cheaper due to currency fluctuations, and bringing them back to China for resale. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has rapidly expanded internationally with over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7 million by Ofwat, the UK water regulator, for breaching rules related to sewage operations and shareholder dividends. This is the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, following its most extensive investigation to date, and will be paid by the company and its investors rather than customers. The fine includes Â£104.5 million for sewage operation breaches and an additional Â£18.2 million for undeserved dividends, marking the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for such payouts. Thames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK population, is under scrutiny for its performance and faces a Â£20 billion debt, having recently secured a Â£3 billion emergency loan.</p>

          <p>Tesco is implementing AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, which has reached record levels in the UK. The technology identifies when items are not scanned properly and shows a replay to the customer, accompanied by a message prompting them to try again. While some shoppers have mocked the new system, comparing it to VAR in football, others have expressed concerns about increased surveillance. This move follows a similar initiative by Sainsbury's and comes in response to a significant rise in shoplifting offenses recorded by both police and retailers, costing the industry billions of pounds annually.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has temporarily suspended scheduling new interviews for student and exchange visas as it prepares to expand its vetting process of applicants' social media accounts. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued the order in a cable to U.S. embassies and consulates, citing the need for increased scrutiny, though existing appointments will still be honored. This move comes as President Trump pressures universities to restrict certain speech, particularly regarding Israel, and follows Rubio's previous actions to revoke visas and scrutinize foreign visitors' social media. Critics argue that the administration is attempting to suppress free speech and enforce ideological conformity.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has agreed to pay $82.5 million to the federal government to settle claims related to the 2020 Bobcat Fire, which devastated areas northeast of Los Angeles. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement, stating it provides significant compensation for firefighting costs and extensive damage to public lands. The government alleged the fire started due to inadequately maintained trees contacting electrical wires, leading to the closure of campgrounds and damage to the habitat of endangered species. While SCE will pay the settlement within 60 days, the utility does not admit any wrongdoing or guilt.</p>

          <p>Thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to Â£1,000 each, and may have debts written off due to the forced installation of prepayment meters. Energy companies will pay over Â£70 million in compensation and financial support following a review by Ofgem, which found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. The scandal, which emerged during the peak of the cost of living crisis, involved energy firms remotely changing smart meters or forcibly entering homes to install new meters. A new code of practice with stricter conditions is now in place for prepayment meter installations without customer consent.</p>

          <p>Japan's bond market is raising concerns about capital flight from the U.S. and a potential carry trade unwind, as long-dated yields hover near record highs. Higher Japanese government bond yields could trigger Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially impacting U.S. tech stocks and global markets due to increased borrowing costs. Some analysts suggest the carry trade impact may not be as severe as last year, while others warn of a potential financial market Armageddon if Japanese government bond yields continue to climb. This situation is influenced by the Bank of Japan scaling back bond purchases and Japanese life insurance companies meeting their buying requirements.</p>

Despite the failure, the flight marked progress as it successfully reached space, a milestone not achieved in previous tests, and the Super Heavy booster was re-flown.

          <p>As the Trump administration seeks a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly threatening to strike Iranâ€™s nuclear enrichment facilities. This tension has led to strained communications between President Trump and Netanyahu, with Israel concerned that Trump may allow Iran to maintain its enrichment facilities. Israel, not involved in the U.S.-Iran negotiations, believes Iran's vulnerability presents an opportunity for military action, while Trump prefers a negotiated end backed by the threat of force. Israeli officials have met with U.S. counterparts to discuss the situation, though Netanyahu's office has dismissed the report as "fake news."</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to supply lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas in response to soaring rice prices. This commitment follows the suspension of orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller shops. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries plans to allocate 100,000 tons of reserve rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. The move aims to ease the frustration of households affected by retail rice prices doubling from the previous year, after earlier auction releases failed to curb the price increase.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Metropolitan Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns regarding the government's proposals to release some prisoners early. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they warned that the plans "could be of net detriment to public safety," citing concerns about electronic tagging costs and repeat offenders avoiding jail. While acknowledging the need for reform, they argued against early releases for high-risk offenders and those jailed under national security legislation. The government has responded that its proposals address many of these concerns, with repeat offenders still facing short sentences and terrorists ineligible for early release.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" during its ninth flight test, although the vehicle successfully reached orbit before encountering issues. An apparent propellant leak after entering its suborbital trajectory caused a loss of attitude control, leading to the spacecraft spinning and mission control losing command. Consequently, Starship re-entered Earth's atmosphere at an unideal angle for its heat shield, resulting in most of it burning up, with debris expected to fall into the Indian Ocean. Despite the failure, SpaceX continues its iterative approach, evaluating data and making adjustments for future missions to improve Starship's reliability.</p>

          <p>A former 999 call-handler, Issy Vine, has resigned from the Met Police, accusing the force of failing to uphold its promises to whistleblowers after a colleague she reported for offensive comments, including describing a sexual assault victim as a "slut", was reinstated. Vine is suing the force for constructive dismissal, alleging that the original disciplinary panel was deemed too influenced by the Casey Review, which found the Met to be institutionally misogynist. Despite the Met's acknowledgement that the comments were "entirely unacceptable," the staff member's reinstatement has led Vine to question the force's commitment to addressing toxic behavior and supporting whistleblowers.</p>
