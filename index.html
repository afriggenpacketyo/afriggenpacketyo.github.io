        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that the company's significant expansion, which outpaces rivals, is proving successful due to customer preference for its superior products and technology. Kirby believes United's brand loyalty makes it resilient even during economic downturns and anticipates strong fourth-quarter results as the economy recovers. He contrasted this growth with the struggles of ultra-discount carriers like Spirit Airlines, reinforcing his view that their business model is failing in the current market. The airline is also two-thirds complete with a fleet-wide cabin modernization project.</p>

          <h2>Common Financial Habits May Be Worsening Personal Debt Unintentionally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 14:24:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights three subtle yet costly habits that can exacerbate personal debt despite regular payments. These include falling into the "minimum payment trap," where most of the payment covers interest rather than principal, and overusing "buy now, pay later" services, which can lead to an accumulation of hidden debt. Another pitfall is relying too heavily on balance transfers without addressing underlying spending habits, often resulting in high interest rates once promotional periods end. The article advises borrowers to be more strategic by paying more than the minimum and using credit tools as part of a structured debt-reduction plan.</p>

She reflected on how this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic."

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a safety probe into the 2021 Tesla Model Y following multiple reports of inoperable electronic door handles. The investigation, covering over 174,000 vehicles, focuses on incidents where owners were locked out, including several concerning cases where parents could not access children inside the car. Some owners reported having to break windows to regain entry. The issue appears to stem from insufficient voltage to the door locks, and the agency noted that while manual releases exist, they are not operable by small children.</p>

The article points out that promised "bone-crushing" sanctions against Russia failed to materialize and deadlines for Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire passed without consequence. It argues that Trump's recent demands on EU allies—such as increasing LNG imports and imposing high tariffs on China—are unrealistic preconditions for imposing tougher sanctions on Russia. This strategy is seen as a diversion that emboldens Putin and weakens the Western alliance against Russian aggression.</p>

While variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings offer more flexibility, their rates will likely decrease if the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cut campaign.

          <p>A framework deal for TikTok's U.S. operations has been reached, which will involve both new and existing investors from its parent company, ByteDance. According to sources, the deal is expected to close within 30 to 45 days and will allow Oracle to maintain its cloud and data security agreement with the social media platform. This development follows years of uncertainty after Congress passed a bill requiring ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns. The final structure and capitalization of the new entity are still being determined, but it is not expected to go public.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a military veteran and retired federal employee expresses feelings of being "lost and pointless" despite achieving an ideal early retirement. The letter writer struggles with ennui while witnessing global and national turmoil. The columnist, James Parker, suggests this may be a form of survivor's guilt and advises the reader to embrace idleness and gentleness with themselves. He reframes this state not as self-care but as a form of revolution in a chaotic world, arguing that people who can savor existence will be needed in the difficult times ahead.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland supports the Democratic strategy to potentially force a government shutdown if Republicans do not agree to reverse Medicaid cuts and extend Obamacare subsidies. In an interview, he argued that the risk is worth taking to prevent President Trump from getting a "blank check" for what he calls lawless activities, such as illegally withholding funds from federal agencies. Van Hollen believes Republicans would bear the political blame for a shutdown. He also expressed alarm at Trump's rhetoric following the killing of Charlie Kirk, viewing it as a threat to civil liberties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The reverse mortgage 6-month rule dictates the timeline for heirs to address the loan after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Lenders must issue a "Due and Payable" letter, giving the estate six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to cover the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While extensions are possible with HUD approval, the deadline underscores the importance of advance estate planning for borrowers who wish for their heirs to keep the family home.

A majority of respondents predict this pressure campaign will lead to negative economic outcomes, including higher inflation, weaker growth, and increased unemployment. The survey also revealed a consensus that the Fed will cut interest rates this week, though there is significant disagreement on whether that is the correct policy move. Tariff uncertainty and the administration's policy were cited as the top threats to the economic expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the death of actor Robert Redford, a 2019 editorial he wrote for NBC News sharply criticizing President Donald Trump has gone viral. In the piece, Redford described the Trump administration as a "dictator-like attack on everything this country stands for" and lamented the nation's deep political divisions. The resurgence of these scathing words stands in contrast to President Trump's brief and seemingly neutral comments on Redford's passing. The actor's pointed critique highlights his strong political convictions and adds another dimension to the remembrances of his life and career.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring full access to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. The move reverses a 2021 Biden administration policy that had limited the validity of travel authorizations for some Hungarians due to security concerns over the country's simplified naturalization process. Officials stated that Hungary has now taken sufficient steps to address these security vulnerabilities. This decision is another sign of the warming relationship between the Trump administration and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whom Trump has praised as a "fantastic leader."</p>

          <p>A judge has denied Erik and Lyle Menendez's petition for a new trial, ruling that new evidence of sexual abuse by their father would not have changed the jury's verdict. The brothers, who have been imprisoned for over 35 years for the 1989 killing of their parents, argued that new testimony and a letter from Erik should warrant a retrial. However, the judge concluded the evidence did not alter the fact that the murders were premeditated. This ruling is a significant setback in their efforts for release, which also include pending clemency petitions and future parole eligibility.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed the state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last December. While Mangione will still face a second-degree murder charge and multiple weapons counts, the judge ruled that the targeted killing did not meet the legal standard for terrorism. The defense had argued the terrorism charges were inapplicable, and the judge agreed there was no evidence of intent to terrorize the public or engage in a broader campaign of violence. Mangione still faces separate federal charges that carry the possibility of the death penalty.</p>
