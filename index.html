          <p>A tragic shooting incident unfolded just outside the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta, resulting in the death of a police officer and the gunman's subsequent self-inflicted fatality. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified the assailant as Patrick Joseph White, whose recovered documents indicated strong discontent with COVID-19 vaccinations, a key motive under investigation. White had also reportedly verbalized suicidal thoughts weeks prior, leading to law enforcement contact. Despite nearly 200 rounds impacting six CDC buildings, no CDC employees or visitors were harmed. Officer David Rose, a 33-year-old Marine veteran, was killed in the line of duty, leaving behind a wife and three children.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump intensified his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, threatening a "major lawsuit" concerning the costly renovations at the Fed's Washington D.C. headquarters, which Trump claims should have been significantly cheaper. Trump vehemently demanded an immediate interest rate cut, asserting that Powell's delayed actions have caused "incalculable" economic damage, despite the Fed having gradually cut rates in 2024 and expecting further reductions in 2025. He argued that lower rates would save the U.S. vast sums in government borrowing costs. Powell has previously defended the renovation costs and pushed back against Trump's claims directly.

          <p>Lior Ron, the founder and CEO of Uber Freight, is transitioning to Waabi, a self-driving truck startup, to serve as its Chief Operating Officer. Ron's move is driven by his conviction that the era of autonomous big rigs operating at scale is imminent and will fundamentally transform the freight industry. Waabi anticipates deploying fully driverless trucks on routes across the U.S. Southwest by the end of the year, a region chosen for its high freight volume and favorable weather conditions. Ron will continue as chairman of Uber Freight, which will now be led by Rebecca Tinucci. The shift underscores a broader industry focus on automation for increased efficiency and safety.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a U.S. woman from West Allis, Wisconsin, has been found guilty of conspiracy to murder, possessing a self-loading pistol, and illegally importing ammunition in the UK. She was hired as a killer and attempted to shoot a man in Birmingham in 2019, but her gun jammed, allowing the target to escape unharmed. Betro, who concealed her identity with a niqab during the attack, went on the run for nearly five years. Her co-conspirators, Mohammed Nazir and Mohammed Aslam, were previously jailed for their roles in the vendetta against the victim's family. Betro's motive remains unclear, and she is scheduled for sentencing on August 21.</p>

The statement, from which Hungary dissented, also pledged continued military support for Kyiv, emphasizing Ukraine's inherent right to self-defense and its path towards EU membership.

The fire department responded to a distress call on Monday evening, deploying a rescue swimmer with a jet ski to successfully bring six individuals caught approximately 100 yards offshore to safety. Tragically, a seventh person found in the water was rushed to shore, where CPR was performed, but was later pronounced dead at the Community Medical Center. The beach did not have lifeguards on duty at the time of the incident, which highlights the dangers of rip currents, responsible for 49 deaths this year.</p>

However, economists identified worrying underlying trends, particularly the influence of Trump administration policies. "Core" CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose to 3.1% annually, its fastest pace since February, with predictions of reaching 3.8% by year-end as tariffs fully impact consumer prices. Additionally, immigration policies are cited for limiting labor supply in service sectors, contributing to upward pressure on inflation, notably in personal care services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated a military takeover of Washington D.C., deploying National Guard troops and seizing control of the municipal police department for one month, invoking an obscure section of the 1973 D.C.

Critics argue this move, following similar deployments to Los Angeles, is a thinly veiled demonstration of power designed to erode the longstanding American taboo against domestic military law enforcement.

The firm identified six key factors of employee satisfaction—innovation, direct management, organizational effectiveness, engagement, emotional connection, and organizational alignment—which consistently outperform extrinsic rewards like pay in boosting stock price.

A key distinction is that MMAs typically include a debit card and check-writing capabilities, though they might require higher minimum balances or tiered rates. HYSAs often have lower barriers to entry and are generally recommended for emergency funds or short-term savings goals due to their ease and flexibility.

Experts suggest reinvesting RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, favoring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for their tax efficiency and ease of tax-loss harvesting. Charitable individuals aged 70½ or older can utilize qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) for a tax-free transfer directly to eligible non-profits, satisfying RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, RMDs can be contributed to a 529 college savings plan for family, offering state tax benefits and legacy planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new provision in the UK's Online Safety Act, mandating age verification on adult sites and other platforms, has triggered significant backlash from internet users and U.S. politicians. Intended to prevent children from accessing harmful content, the measures have led major porn sites to require personal ID or credit card details for access, causing a surge in VPN usage. Spotify, Reddit, and X have also introduced their own age verification systems. U.S. politicians like Vice President JD Vance and House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan criticize the law, fearing it infringes privacy and free expression, though UK officials maintain the issue is not open to debate.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly intensifying its pursuit of Crystal Palace and England center-back Marc Guehi, who has one year remaining on his contract with Palace. Club chairman Steve Parish indicated a potential sale this summer to prevent the defender from leaving on a free transfer in 12 months. Sources close to the situation suggest that Liverpool has held initial talks regarding a potential deal for the 25-year-old. If an agreement is reached between the clubs, Liverpool may still need to persuade Guehi on the level of playing time he would receive, which is a crucial consideration for him in a World Cup year, given his regular role at Palace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed federal cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act marketplaces could result in 10 million Americans losing health insurance by 2034, creating substantial hidden costs across society. Uninsured individuals often resort to federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) or hospital emergency rooms, straining these critical services. FQHCs, heavily reliant on Medicaid patient revenue, face instability without increased federal grants, potentially impacting their ability to provide comprehensive care. Hospitals bear billions in uncompensated care costs for the uninsured, which are ultimately subsidized by taxpayers through nonprofit hospital tax exemptions. Furthermore, increased medical debt for patients and a less healthy workforce pose broader economic detriments, demonstrating that initial savings from cuts may be offset by costs elsewhere.</p>

The company continues to gain significant market share, particularly in its running segment, and has seen strong growth in key markets like the U.S. and China, where sales grew approximately 50% in the second quarter.

          <p>The Trump administration's sudden and vocal concern for eagles, specifically targeting wind-energy projects for their impact on the birds, is being widely questioned as a thinly veiled pretext to stall renewable energy development. While wind turbines do pose a threat to birds, critics point out that much larger threats, such as stray cats and climate change, are often overlooked. The administration has simultaneously moved to weaken protections for other endangered species and cut funding for bird monitoring programs, suggesting a selective application of environmental concern. This apparent contradiction aligns with the administration's broader anti-wind energy stance, indicating a potential conflict between stated environmental goals and energy policy objectives.</p>

Detectives believe there may be more victims, as Pinkerton has since worked as a traveling evangelist across multiple U.S. states and internationally.

          <p>As President Trump and Vladimir Putin prepare for a one-on-one summit in Alaska, foreign-policy experts and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warn Trump could be walking into a "trap." Putin, seeking to buy time amid military and economic struggles, is offering a meeting Trump desires, but with maximalist demands for Ukraine, including retaining conquered territory. Concerns are high that Trump, eager for a peace deal and a Nobel Peace Prize, might agree to terms unfavorable to Ukraine, potentially making Kyiv the "bad guy" if they reject it. The summit's quick arrangement and Trump's past rhetoric raise skepticism about its outcome, with some fearing he might "carry far too much of Moscow’s water."</p>
