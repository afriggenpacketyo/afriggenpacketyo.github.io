            <p>Austan Goolsbee, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" level of economic activity due to businesses stockpiling inventory and consumers accelerating purchases in anticipation of rising import levies. This preemptive purchasing, particularly in sectors like the auto industry, could inflate economic activity in the short term, potentially causing a slowdown in the summer as demand is satisfied early. Goolsbee remains optimistic about the longer-term economic outlook, citing steady full employment and decreasing inflation rates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A draft executive order indicates that the Trump administration is considering sweeping changes to the U.S. State Department, including shuttering embassies in Southern Africa and eliminating bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order proposes consolidating regional bureaus into four "regional corps" and drastically cutting diplomatic presence in Canada. Hiring practices would also be overhauled, with the Foreign Service Officer Test potentially scrapped in favor of evaluations based on alignment with the president's foreign policy vision.

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, London, by Toby Carvery has sparked widespread anger and upset among local residents and beyond. The pub chain admitted to cutting down the tree after receiving advice that it was dead and posed a health and safety risk, but locals dispute this assessment, noting the tree appeared healthy. The incident has prompted protests and calls for accountability, highlighting the emotional significance of trees in British culture, reminiscent of the Sycamore Gap tree felling. Enfield Council is considering legal options, while the community mourns the loss of a cherished landmark.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Ukrainian front lines were hit by numerous Russian assaults, while Russia's defense ministry stated it had repelled attempted Ukrainian assaults and accused Kyiv of launching drones and shells. Zelensky dismissed Putin's truce declaration as a PR exercise, while the Russian defense ministry insisted its troops had strictly observed the ceasefire. The surprise truce announcement came shortly after President Trump threatened to withdraw from Russia-Ukraine peace talks.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen claims that the El Salvadorian government "tried really hard" to prevent him from visiting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from Maryland. Van Hollen says the government relented after realizing it was "not a good look," but staged the meeting to create a false impression of Abrego Garcia's well-being. Abrego Garcia was deported despite a protective court order and has been labeled an MS-13 gang member by the Trump administration, a claim Van Hollen disputes, challenging officials to provide evidence in court.</p>

Healey refuted claims that Harvard merits losing its tax-exempt status, calling the attacks an attempt to silence critics and warning of the broader implications for non-profit organizations.

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA). Solicitor General John Sauer called the order "unprecedented" and argued that the detainees have no standing since the government paused deportations. Sauer also implored the justices to limit the order to AEA removals only.

While the idea of selling citizenship is often met with resistance, many countries, including the U.S., offer residency in exchange for investment or donations. Trump's approach aligns with a market-driven perspective, aiming to streamline and enhance the U.S.'s "golden-visa" scheme, which is currently seen as cumbersome and inefficient.

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month found "professional failures" and will result in the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation found that the deputy battalion commander assessed that the ambulances belonged to Hamas militants due to poor night visibility. Video footage contradicted Israel's initial account that the medics' vehicles did not have emergency signals on. The Israeli military investigation said the examination found "no evidence to support claims of execution or that any of the deceased were bound before or after the shooting."</p>

Instead, the article recommends focusing on actual data from companies driving consumer spending, capital investment, and labor markets, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies.</p>
