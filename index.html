          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 12:31:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CDC reported that 216 children have died from the flu this season, marking the highest number of pediatric deaths in 15 years, since the 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic. The agency estimates at least 47 million illnesses, 610,000 hospitalizations, and 26,000 deaths from the flu overall this season. Experts attribute the severity to declining vaccination rates among children, with rates falling from 64% five years ago to 49% this season. Despite the flu vaccine's effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations and deaths, rising vaccine skepticism is contributing to increased hospitalizations and fatalities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that the Trump administration's tariffs will significantly increase costs for American families, potentially ranging from $4,000 to $8,000 per household annually. An analysis from The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates tariffs will increase costs by at least 3%, averaging around $4,900 per household. The Consumer Brands Association warns that food product costs will rise due to the need to import ingredients like coffee, oats, and tropical fruits. Concerns are also raised about the impact on baby formula, diapers, and children's products, with calls for tariff exclusions on essential safety items like car seats and cribs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year outlines $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, primarily affecting the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The budget prioritizes defense spending, proposing a 13% increase to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion towards the southern border. While budget proposals serve as an administration's wish list, they highlight the president's priorities and initiate negotiations with Congress. The Office of Management and Budget director emphasized that these cuts would lead to "significant savings" while still protecting funding for homeland security, veterans, seniors, law enforcement, and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to cut public funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), citing left-wing bias. The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to "cease federal funding" for these outlets, arguing that government funding of news media is outdated and corrosive to journalistic independence. Public media are expected to fight the order, with PBS exploring all options to continue serving the American public with educational programming. The CEOs of PBS and NPR were previously called to testify before a House subcommittee to defend their programming against accusations of bias.</p>

          <p>U.S. payroll growth totaled 177,000 in April, surpassing expectations despite worries about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%, while the labor force participation rate increased to 62.6%. Job gains were primarily driven by the health care, transportation, and financial sectors. The report led traders to delay expectations for an interest rate cut, with the strong numbers suggesting resilience in the economy before the tariff shock. However, experts caution that the economy may weaken in the coming months if tariff tensions escalate.</p>

In addition to her role on "Laugh-In," Buzzi had a long career in television, film, and theater.</p>

          <p>Trade tensions between the United States and China have escalated, with the two countries unable to agree on whether they are even engaged in discussions. The Trump administration is seeking trade deals with numerous countries that may face high tariffs, while China has shown reluctance to negotiate until the U.S. rolls back what it perceives as unfair trade measures. The economic impact of this trade war is becoming evident, with the International Monetary Fund lowering growth outlooks for both countries. The standoff raises concerns about a protracted economic fight between the world's largest economies.</p>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 has achieved a record for its longest winning streak, rising for fifteen consecutive days. Analysts attribute this rally to the UK's neutral trade status amidst global tariff tensions, attracting investors seeking refuge from volatility. The index's defensive giants, such as healthcare and energy companies, have drawn investors seeking refuge from volatility, supported by a high dividend yield. Robust corporate results and a resilient UK economy also contribute to the FTSE 100's upward momentum. However, risks remain, including geopolitical hotspots and a firmer pound that could pressure export-heavy members (not investment advice).</p>
