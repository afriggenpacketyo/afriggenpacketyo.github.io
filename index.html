          <p>Thousands gathered at State Farm Stadium to honor conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. Speakers, including Vice President JD Vance and Donald Trump Jr., remembered Kirk as a courageous "warrior" and a pivotal figure in modern conservative politics who reshaped the political landscape. Trump Jr. described Kirk as being like a brother and urged the massive crowd to ensure his legacy continues by having "a million more Charlie's" step up to continue his work.

          <p>The memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk was characterized by a strong focus on his Christian faith, with many speakers and attendees framing him as a martyr for the gospel. Colleagues stated that Kirk's primary identity was as a Christian and that his work was ultimately a Christian movement, not just a political one. Several attendees told Fox News that they believed Kirk "made it cool to be Christian again" for younger generations by defending the faith in the public square. The event's atmosphere was described as being akin to a large-scale worship service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and autism, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is expected to issue a warning against its use unless necessary for a fever. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, has strongly refuted these claims, stating there is no credible scientific evidence for a causal link and expressing concern over the health risks this could pose to expectant mothers.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," the Democratic governor described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged Americans to focus on common values over division. Shapiro, whose own home was firebombed in April, stressed the importance of distinguishing between protected political speech and illicit incitement to violence.</p>

          <p>Mandy Damari, the mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was held captive by Hamas for 15 months, has strongly criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state. Damari argued that the move effectively "rewards" Hamas for its October 7th attack, especially while hostages remain in captivity and the group retains power in Gaza. Her emotional response highlights the deep pain and political complexities surrounding the conflict, offering a personal perspective that contrasts with the diplomatic intentions behind the UK's policy shift.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris finished seventh in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, gaining only six points on his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri, who crashed out of the race. Norris attributed his disappointing result to a poor qualifying session in which he hit a wall, arguing that the difficulty of overtaking in Baku meant his starting position largely determined his final one. While Norris felt he maximized his performance during the race itself, the weekend is widely viewed as a missed opportunity to significantly close the gap in the F1 championship standings.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have formally announced their recognition of a Palestinian state. The largely symbolic action is intended to build momentum for a two-state solution and revive hopes for peace in the Middle East. The decision was met with swift and strong opposition from Israel, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calling it a "huge reward to terror" and asserting that a Palestinian state "will not happen." The move marks a significant policy shift for these key Western nations.</p>

          <p>A Department of Justice investigation into President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, was reportedly shut down early in the Trump administration, according to sources familiar with the matter. The probe involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was allegedly recorded accepting a bag containing $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking government contracts. White House officials have since called the investigation blatantly political, stating that a full review found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by Homan.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director during President Trump's first term, stated that the U.S. job market has "degraded," with job creation slowing significantly in recent months. He argued that companies, facing rising input costs from tariffs and other pressures, are cutting labor costs as the primary way to protect their profit margins. Cohn's analysis aligns with the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its benchmark interest rate, citing a cooling labor market and slower economic growth as key factors.

          <p>President Donald Trump appeared to dismiss concerns over new Pentagon rules that severely restrict journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters, stating, "Nothing stops reporters." The directive, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, requires journalists to get prior approval before releasing any information, even if it is unclassified. Press freedom advocates have strongly condemned the policy as a form of prior restraint and a direct assault on the principles of independent journalism and government transparency.</p>
