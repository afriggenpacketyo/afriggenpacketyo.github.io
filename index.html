            <p>An Israeli airstrike struck a field hospital in Gaza, resulting in casualties among medics and patients, marking the second attack on a Gaza health facility in three days. This incident follows an attack on Al-Ahli Hospital, which the UN reported as being "out of service" after being struck by Israel. These attacks have occurred as efforts to negotiate a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas continue, with Hamas officials indicating they are considering a new proposal from Israel for a 45-day halt in fighting in exchange for hostage releases, but reiterating that there would be no ceasefire without a commitment by Israel to end the war and withdraw forces from Gaza. The ongoing conflict has resulted in significant casualties and displacement in Gaza, further straining the territory's healthcare system. </p>

            <p>The Chinese government has reportedly instructed its domestic airlines to cease accepting deliveries of Boeing jets and to halt purchases of airline parts from U.S. companies, signaling an escalation in trade tensions between China and the United States. This directive follows China's increase in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, matching tariffs imposed by President Trump on Chinese imports. Boeing, which was scheduled to deliver approximately 10 737 Max aircraft to Chinese carriers, declined to comment on the matter, while its shares experienced a decline. The move highlights the impact of the trade war on major industries and the potential economic consequences for both nations.</p>

            <p>A survivor of the Manchester Arena bombing has voiced anger and disappointment after the bomber, Hashem Abedi, attacked three prison guards at a high-security facility. Abedi, who was jailed for life for his role in the 2017 attack, used hot oil and improvised blades to assault the officers, prompting criticism over his access to kitchen facilities and the perceived lack of accountability within the prison system. The survivor, Martin Hibbert, who was paralyzed in the bombing, penned an open letter to the Justice Secretary expressing his frustration and calling for stricter controls on Abedi's privileges. The Ministry of Justice has announced a full independent review into the incident.</p>

            <p>European companies are increasingly concerned about potential marginalization in China as Beijing pursues technological independence through its "Made in China 2025" initiative. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China suggests that while foreign firms may initially serve as bridges to advanced technology, they risk exclusion once Chinese companies achieve comparable capabilities. The chamber recommends that China focus on opening up and attracting foreign investment with clear metrics and accountability, as European business confidence in China has reached an all-time low. The initiative aims to establish China as a global leader in key technological sectors.</p>

            <p>A group of Pacific Palisades and Malibu residents, all aged 70 or older, are suing the city of Los Angeles, alleging that the Department of Water and Power (DWP) failed to adequately prevent and contain a massive wildfire that destroyed their homes in January. The plaintiffs, including a Holocaust survivor and a former U.S. Navy pilot, claim the city should have ensured key reservoirs were full and fire hydrants were operational. The lawsuit alleges the DWP ignored wind warnings and kept electrical equipment energized, contributing to the fire's spread. This case joins several others filed since the fire, seeking compensation for property loss.</p>

Experts believe the two issues are linked, as sick or deceased adult pelicans leave their young unable to fend for themselves.

            <p>Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen is traveling to El Salvador to attempt to visit Kilmar Ábrego García, a constituent who was deported and incarcerated in the country. Van Hollen aims to assess Ábrego García's condition and convey it to his family, as the Trump administration refuses to comply with a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return. The senator believes the administration's actions are pushing the U.S. into a constitutional crisis. He hopes to meet with Salvadoran officials to discuss Ábrego García's situation and request his release.</p>

The IPO market has been relatively quiet since late 2021, but Figma's filing could signal a potential revival, though market turmoil could affect the timing.</p>

Overall vaping use has plateaued after years of growth. The government's ban aims to reduce littering, protect the environment, and address rising youth vaping rates.</p>

The complex and deeply integrated nature of the global chip ecosystem also poses challenges for the U.S. to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>
