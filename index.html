          <p>Fabio Wardley achieved a significant upset in heavyweight boxing, defeating Joseph Parker in eleven rounds at London's O2 Arena. Wardley, initially the underdog, exchanged powerful blows with Parker throughout the exceptional fight. The referee intervened in the eleventh round as Parker was pushed onto the ropes, securing Wardley's victory. This impressive win positions the Briton for a potential challenge against undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk, marking a major step in his career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pizza Hut is closing half its UK restaurants after being bought out of administration twice this year, signaling a decline in its popularity. Factors contributing to this include soaring food prices making its all-you-can-eat model expensive, increased operating costs like minimum wages, and intense competition from delivery-focused rivals like Domino's. Consumers also now prefer premium, lighter pizzas from independent pizzerias over Pizza Hut's traditional American-diner style and carb-heavy offerings. The brand needs to reinvent itself to appeal to younger generations lacking nostalgia for its past.</p>

          <p>BBC's Dr. Chris and Dr. Xand van Tulleken share practical health tips from their podcast, emphasizing that struggling with wellbeing is not a personal failure. Key advice includes not obsessing over exactly eight hours of sleep, as a healthy range is 6-10 hours, and learning to "pause" before committing to new requests. They also advocate for mindful teeth brushing and the understanding that "willpower" is less about inner strength and more about structuring one's environment for healthier choices. The doctors aim to help listeners align their lives with their values by cutting through external pressures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As winter approaches, UK households are deliberating when to turn on their heating, largely influenced by rising energy costs. Many delay as long as possible, using blankets and jumpers, while some adhere to traditional dates like November 1st. The Energy Saving Trust and WHO recommend setting thermostats between 18C and 21C, with 15C often being a trigger point for many. This article highlights the financial strain and potential mental health impacts of inadequate home heating, noting that some innovative solutions like second-hand Agas help families manage expenses.</p>

          <p>Britain's major supermarket chains, including Tesco and Sainsbury's, have warned Chancellor Rachel Reeves that new tax increases could further inflate food prices for households. They specifically cite concerns over higher business rates, particularly a surtax on large commercial premises, arguing it adds significant costs to the industry. Economists from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggest the Chancellor will likely need to raise taxes due to public finance shortfalls, despite previous pledges not to. Supermarkets maintain they are striving to keep prices affordable but face mounting costs from taxes and global supply issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods, accusing Ontario of a "hostile act" for airing an anti-tariff advertisement featuring Ronald Reagan. Despite Ontario Premier Doug Ford's pledge to pause the campaign, the ad ran during the World Series, further angering Trump. This escalation comes amidst ongoing trade tensions, with Canada being the only G7 nation without a new trade deal with the US. The move impacts Canada's export-heavy economy and its auto manufacturing sector, drawing criticism from the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.</p>

          <p>Conservative attorney Mike Davis, a close associate of former President Trump, claims a federal grand jury has been empaneled in Florida to investigate a decade-long conspiracy against Trump. Davis asserts this grand jury will consider criminal charges against Democratic figures accused of colluding to impede Trump, from the 2016 Russian interference probe to current legal cases. Court documents confirm a grand jury will convene in Fort Pierce in January at the Trump administration's request.

          <p>The White House Family Theater, along with parts of the East Wing, is being demolished to make way for a new $300 million ballroom, marking the end of an 80-year cultural era. Since its conversion by Franklin Roosevelt in 1942, the theater served as a private entertainment and rehearsal space for presidents and their guests, screening hundreds of films. Critics argue its destruction bulldozes a piece of American history, though reports suggest a new theater might be rebuilt.

However, Maduro and Venezuelan officials fear the military build-up is a pretext for regime change, given the US does not recognize Maduro's legitimacy.

          <p>Manchester United has achieved three consecutive wins, including a decisive 4-2 victory over Brighton, leading to speculation that the team has turned a corner after a period of negativity. Manager Ruben Amorim, however, urges caution, highlighting the rapid changes possible in football. The improved results are attributed to a squad better suited to Amorim's system, notably new signings Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo, and a more stable goalkeeping performance. The team's absence from European competitions and a forgiving fixture list also provide an advantage for continued preparation.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands protested in Valencia, Spain, demanding the resignation of regional leader Carlos Mazón one year after floods killed 229 people. Demonstrators accused Mazón's administration of issuing a disaster alert too late, hours after the national weather agency's highest alert. Residents reported receiving warnings only after their homes and streets were already flooding. A judicial investigation into the emergency response is ongoing, and Mazón faces heavy criticism for his handling of Spain's deadliest floods in modern history.</p>

          <p>Russian missile and drone attacks overnight into Saturday killed at least four people and wounded 20 in Ukraine, including two fatalities and 13 injuries in Kyiv. These strikes prompted President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to renew pleas for additional Western air defense systems, specifically US Patriot systems, to protect Ukrainian cities. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down 121 Ukrainian drones over its territory. The ongoing attacks underscore the critical need for robust air defenses as winter approaches and diplomatic efforts to end the conflict remain stalled.</p>

          <p>This article questions the US's stated aim of deploying a massive aircraft carrier group to the Caribbean for drug interdiction, suggesting President Trump may be misinformed or have an ulterior motive like regime change in Venezuela. The author argues that Venezuela plays a minor role in fentanyl production, which is primarily from Mexico, and that the deployed military equipment is unsuitable for effective drug smuggling interdiction. While Venezuela is a transit country for cocaine from other South American nations, the main routes for US-bound drugs bypass Venezuela.</p>

          <p>The "No Kings" anti-Trump protests, which featured inflatable chickens and drew thousands nationwide, were largely comprised of educated White women in their 40s, according to demographic research. Psychotherapist Jonathan Alpert suggests these rallies serve as a form of "group therapy," providing belonging and validation for participants, but not necessarily leading to tangible change. He notes the prevalence of "therapy speak" in political discourse and warns that such catharsis can sometimes mask personal unhappiness. The protests aimed to denounce President Trump's perceived "kingship" and authoritarianism.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking family, has been identified as the anonymous donor who pledged $130 million to pay US military troops during the government shutdown. While President Trump lauded him as a "great patriot," the donation amounts to only about $100 per service member, falling far short of the nearly $6.4 billion needed bi-weekly. The gift also raises legal questions under the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending unappropriated funds.

          <p>A new AP-NORC poll indicates a substantial drop in President Donald Trump's support among Hispanic adults since the start of his second term, falling from 44% to 25%. This decline is also reflected in decreased confidence in his handling of the economy and immigration, despite this demographic being crucial to his 2024 re-election. The poll highlights rising financial stress within Hispanic households and growing negative perceptions among younger Hispanic men. The administration's hardline immigration policies are seen as a key factor in this shift.</p>
