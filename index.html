          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls in 2022. The 53-year-old was convicted on four counts of sexual activity with a 14-year-old and two counts related to a 15-year-old. The incidents occurred after Alford purchased alcohol which the victims drank. Alford denied the charges, but a jury at St Albans Crown Court delivered a guilty verdict after 13 hours of deliberation.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot's climb to $1.7 billion is driving a surge in business for Jackpocket, the lottery courier app owned by DraftKings. The company reported a significant increase in ticket sales, with 15 million Powerball tickets ordered through the platform during the current run. This heightened activity highlights the strategic value of DraftKings' 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket, which aims to cross-sell lottery players to its sports betting and iGaming services. The massive jackpot underscores the lucrative, if state-regulated, market for online lottery services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial experts are advising investors to consider defensive strategies to protect their portfolio gains. A weak August jobs report has increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, but underlying economic weakness and trade-related uncertainty pose risks. Analysts recommend re-evaluating over-concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which dominate major indices like the S&P 500. Shifting some capital towards value and defensive sectors that have underperformed could offer a buffer against potential market downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Just before the release of a sluggish August jobs report, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicted that the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data would become more accurate. He attributed this anticipated improvement to President Trump's recent firing of former Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. Lutnick claimed that "holdovers from the Biden administration" were "rooting against America" and that their removal would lead to more correct numbers. The subsequent report showed job growth of only 22,000, far below economists' expectations.</p>

          <p>Rapper Post Malone has been forced to postpone two major shows at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium due to planned strikes on the London Underground. Promoters Live Nation stated that the lack of adequate public transport made it impossible to secure an event license for the original dates. The concerts, originally scheduled for September 7th and 8th, will now take place on September 20th and 21st. This follows a similar decision by the band Coldplay, which also had to move London dates because of the transit union's industrial action.</p>

          <p>A multi-agency federal operation, including ICE and the FBI, resulted in the detention of 475 immigrant workers at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgia. The raid targeted the construction site for a new electric vehicle battery plant, part of what has been called the state's largest-ever economic development project. The Department of Homeland Security stated the operation was part of an ongoing criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices. The South Korean Foreign Ministry has expressed concern, urging the U.S. to ensure the rights of any detained Korean citizens are not infringed upon.</p>

          <p>Peace organizations in Germany are reporting a significant increase in inquiries from young people about how to conscientiously object to military service. This surge in interest follows a new law requiring young men to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to join the army, seen as a step toward reintroducing conscription. Germany suspended mandatory service in 2011 but now faces pressure to expand its armed forces to meet NATO obligations. While polls show overall support for conscription, younger Germans are more opposed and are actively researching their constitutional right to refuse military service.</p>

While Yieldstreet reached a $5 million settlement with the borrowers, the company stated its own legal recovery costs exceeded this amount, leaving nothing for investors. The loans, intended to finance the dismantling of ships for scrap metal, soured after Yieldstreet allegedly lost track of the vessels used as collateral.

A recent budget bill successfully removed the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled firearms, a major victory for these groups.

The reviewer notes that Lee, who began his career as a writer, employs a highly visual and evocative style that foreshadows his later work in cinema. The stories, written during the repressive political climate of 1980s South Korea, use powerful imagery of light and darkness to communicate the era's paranoia and loss.

          <p>Along the coast of India, conservationists are working to protect the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle population. Activists collect eggs laid on the shore and incubate them in safe hatcheries to shield them from predators and poachers. Once the baby turtles hatch, they are carefully released onto the sand to make their crucial journey to the Arabian Sea. During this vulnerable crawl, volunteers and sometimes tourists watch over them, protecting them from crabs and birds, creating a heartwarming scene of human assistance for the tiny creatures.</p>

          <p>Chicago officials and residents are bracing for the arrival of federal law enforcement and ICE agents, part of President Trump's initiative to address crime in the city. Despite a decrease in the city's overall violent crime rates, the president has reaffirmed his plan to send in federal forces. In response, Mayor Brandon Johnson has issued an executive order to limit federal influence on local police, and community groups are organizing "Know Your Rights" campaigns. Local leaders and residents express concern that the deployment will erode trust in law enforcement and target minority communities.</p>

          <p>The United States is sending ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico to escalate its military operations against drug cartels in the Caribbean. This deployment follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat suspected of carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers. The move signals a more aggressive military posture in the region, which the administration frames as a response to a Venezuelan-led trafficking threat. The Pentagon also recently accused the Venezuelan military of a "highly provocative move" after its planes flew close to a U.S. warship in international waters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that will allow the U.S. to impose sanctions and other punishments on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The measure is modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation and aims to deter nations from using detained Americans as political leverage. The order could provide the State Department with tools to penalize countries and potentially issue travel restrictions for U.S. passport holders. The move follows several high-profile prisoner swaps and is supported by families of Americans who have been detained abroad.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military reports it has taken control of nearly half of Gaza City as it escalates its ground offensive, aiming to dismantle Hamas rule.

United Nations aid agencies and several Western governments are urging a halt to the assault, warning of a deepening humanitarian crisis and famine.

Administrators cited a challenging retail environment with high costs and fierce competition for consumer spending as key factors.

The plan would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves a series of demanding milestones. These targets include increasing Tesla's market capitalization to $8.5 trillion and reaching significant production goals for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 following a shareholder lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A recent Morningstar report reveals that actively managed investment funds struggled significantly to beat their passive index fund counterparts over the past year. Only 33% of active funds delivered higher returns than their index averages, a drop from the previous year. This underperformance occurred during a period of market volatility driven by elections and tariffs, challenging the conventional wisdom that active managers excel in such conditions. The report suggests that higher fees are a primary driver of this long-term trend, creating a hurdle that most active strategies fail to overcome. (not investment advice)</p>
