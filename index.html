          <p>Treasury yields decreased as investors responded to President Trump's threats of tariffs on the European Union and Apple. The 30-year Treasury yield fell by 3 basis points to 5.039%, while the 10-year Treasury shed 5 basis points to 4.507%. Trump's social media posts proposed a 50% tariff on EU goods and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., causing stock prices to drop and traders to seek safety in bonds. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group noted the negative impact of straying from free market principles with top-down economic approaches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration over its decision to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. The university argues that the ban violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claims Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment. Harvard President Alan Gerber countered that the university did respond to the Department of Homeland Security's requests as required by law, accusing the administration of retaliatory action against the university for supporting policies it dislikes.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced a sharp decline after President Trump announced potential tariffs on Apple and the European Union. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.1%, and the S&P 500 dropped by 1.2%, while the Nasdaq decreased by 1.6%. Trump's statements included a threat of a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. and a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union. This market dip erased some gains from recent weeks, as Trump had previously rolled back some levies. Consumers are facing the highest overall average effective tariff rate since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared that Apple would face a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States. He stated that he expected iPhones sold in the U.S. to be made domestically, not in India or elsewhere. Shares of Apple fell about 2% following Trump's post on Truth Social. Apple currently manufactures most of its iPhones in China but has been shifting some production to India, which has a more favorable trade relationship with the U.S. Analysts estimate that moving iPhone production to the U.S. could significantly increase the price of the smartphone.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose steep tariffs on goods from the European Union and a tax on foreign-made iPhones from Apple sent stock markets tumbling on Friday. The S&P 500 fell over 1% as trading began, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 index dropped nearly 2%. Trump cited stalled trade negotiations with the EU and his desire for iPhones sold in the U.S. to be manufactured domestically as justification for the tariffs. Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested the threat was intended to pressure the EU in trade talks, while rising U.S. debt levels also contributed to market jitters.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are reconsidering earlier claims of detecting potential signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b, located over 120 light-years away. While initial data suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a gas solely produced by life on Earth, three independent analyses have since challenged this finding. These analyses, utilizing data from the James Webb Space Telescope, indicate strong signals of hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane but lack clear evidence of dimethyl sulfide. Researchers suggest that faint noise in the mid-infrared light could be misleading, with other molecules like propyne potentially responsible for the observed signals.</p>

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans aims to significantly curtail electric vehicle (EV) adoption by repealing subsidies and incentives. The bill would eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for EV purchases, and funding for charging stations. It also imposes a new annual fee on EV owners to compensate for lost gasoline tax revenue. Analysts predict this rollback will slow EV sales and production in the U.S., putting the nation further behind China and Europe in EV adoption. The bill would also lead to higher emissions and dirtier urban air, according to environmentalists.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, of siding with Hamas following their criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. This accusation comes after a deadly attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington, D.C., where the suspect shouted "free Palestine." Netanyahu blames the UN's humanitarian chief for spreading false claims that incited the attack. The UK has condemned the killings but stands by its call for Israel to adhere to international humanitarian law and allow aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, which sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform, a New York Times article reports that surprisingly little has changed nationwide. Despite new policies and initiatives, killings by police officers have risen from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The article notes that the Trump administration has dropped efforts to investigate and oversee police departments. A 31-year-old Chicago man was charged with the murders of two Israeli Embassy workers outside the Capital Jewish Museum, stating that he "did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza."</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes a Republican domestic policy bill that seeks to undermine Obamacare by restricting access to Medicaid. The bill proposes adding a work requirement to Medicaid, which would result in millions of Americans losing health insurance. The editorial argues that this is an attempt to deprive Americans of health insurance to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. Evidence suggests that work requirements don't effectively increase workforce participation but rather strip eligible individuals of Medicaid coverage.</p>

          <p>A new report suggests that President Trump's student loan policies could create a harsh reality for struggling American borrowers. An estimated 1 in 12 Americans may face negative financial consequences, including credit score drops and involuntary debt collection. The report identifies three groups at risk: borrowers behind on monthly payments, borrowers in default, and borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan. The Trump administration has restarted Treasury offsets and wage garnishment, which had been paused during the pandemic, and is challenging the SAVE plan in court.</p>

          <p>Scientists discovered that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heat waves, according to research published in Science Advances. During a heat wave in Papua New Guinea, researchers measured clownfish and found that they got shorter by a few millimeters over several weeks. The study suggests that shrinking may be an adaptation to help clownfish survive hotter ocean temperatures. The fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival, indicating that being small has advantages in a hot climate.</p>

Community groups, such as RISE St. James, have used low-cost monitors to track pollution in "Cancer Alley." This data has been used to advocate for stricter pollution controls.
