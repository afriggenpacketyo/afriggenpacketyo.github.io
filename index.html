          <p>A coalition of 25 nations, including key U.S. allies, has issued a joint statement demanding an end to the war in Gaza and condemning Israel's handling of humanitarian aid. The statement criticizes the "drip feeding of aid" and the "inhumane killing of civilians," highlighting the deaths of over 800 Palestinians while seeking assistance. Israel has rejected the statement as disconnected from reality, while simultaneously expanding its ground operations into the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah, raising concerns for the safety of remaining hostages and displaced civilians.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has named former biotech executive and Stanford professor Dr. George Tidmarsh as the new director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The appointment comes amid significant upheaval at the agency under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background is seen as a stabilizing force, though his past criticisms of controversial FDA decisions suggest he may adopt a more stringent regulatory approach, particularly concerning accelerated drug approvals.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were hospitalized after a double-decker bus struck a low bridge in Eccles, Salford, completely tearing off its roof. The incident, which involved a number 100 service bus, prompted a major emergency response including ten ambulances and an air ambulance. This is the second time a bus has had its roof removed by this specific bridge, with a similar crash occurring in April 2023. Authorities have closed the surrounding roads and are advising the public to avoid the area while the investigation proceeds.</p>

          <p>Harvard University and the Trump administration are engaged in a high-stakes legal battle over more than $2 billion in frozen federal grants. The administration is demanding significant changes to Harvard's policies on antisemitism, diversity programs, and foreign student visas, which the university argues infringes on its academic freedom and constitutional rights. During a court hearing, Harvard's lawyers contended the government was attempting to control the university's "inner workings," while the judge questioned the administration's lack of clear procedure for its demands. The outcome could have profound implications for federal funding of higher education.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorean drug trafficker known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States, where he pleaded not guilty to charges of drug and arms trafficking. Fito, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape in 2024. His extradition marks a significant moment in the bilateral effort to combat transnational crime, as he is the first Ecuadorean national to be sent directly from Ecuador to the U.S. to face charges. The move comes as Ecuador grapples with unprecedented levels of gang-related violence.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a broad review of the Federal Reserve, suggesting it should examine the institution's overall success in achieving its mission, not just recent controversies over building renovations. His comments come amid a growing conflict between the White House and the central bank, with President Trump having publicly demanded interest rate cuts. Bessent indicated his support for easing rates, questioning the Fed's reluctance given moderating inflation numbers. The call for a review signals escalating political pressure on the nation's independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced the airline is considering increasing the bonus paid to staff who identify passengers with oversized bags. Employees currently receive a small fee for each non-compliant bag they intercept, a practice O'Leary says is aimed at eliminating boarding delays caused by the issue. The airline maintains that over 99% of passengers comply with its baggage rules. The comments were made as Ryanair reported a significant jump in profits, which it attributed to the timing of Easter and higher fares.</p>
