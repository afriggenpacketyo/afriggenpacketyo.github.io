          <p>President Trump's strategy of imposing tariffs on China has largely failed to achieve its intended goals, leading to a temporary truce and rollback of tariffs. The article suggests that while Trump aimed to reshape the global trading order and reduce dependence on China, the tariffs caused economic damage and market chaos. The current agreement involves reducing tariffs to pre-Liberation Day levels, plus a new 10 percent levy. This shift indicates that Trump is now seeking a deal he can claim as a win, rather than pursuing a grand rebalancing of the global trading order.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a temporary trade truce, drastically reducing tariffs on each other for 90 days while they negotiate a more permanent deal. While Wall Street has reacted positively, experts warn that supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers in the coming weeks. The article notes that the temporary truce brings tariff rates back to pre-trade war levels, but supply chains have already been disrupted. Scott Bessent, Trump’s Treasury secretary, has secured a commitment from China to cut non-tariff barriers, but acknowledges that the upcoming talks will be difficult.</p>

          <p>President Trump is defending the White House plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, referring to it as a "gift." The potential value of the plane and its handling has raised legal and ethical questions among critics, citing the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution. While a Qatari spokesman said it would be "inaccurate" to refer to the plane as a gift, Trump argues that the US has helped Qatar a lot over the years in terms of security and safety. The article notes that the plane would need to be retrofitted and cleared by security officials before use.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose, and then walk back, triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products demonstrated the power and global reach of U.S. trade policy. However, it also illustrated the limitations of Trump's aggressive approach. While the tariffs brought much trade between the countries to a standstill, they ultimately proved too painful for American businesses to sustain. The article suggests that the recent trade talks and tariff chaos did not generate any immediate concessions from China other than a commitment to keep talking.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli American national, following pressure from President Trump, who is set to travel to the region. Alexander's release came after mediators brokered a deal between Hamas and the United States, largely circumventing the Israeli government. The article notes that Alexander was held in a cage in a Hamas underground tunnel with his hands and feet bound and ate little. The release highlights the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce between Israel and Hamas.</p>
