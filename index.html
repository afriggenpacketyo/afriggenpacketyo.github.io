          <p>Costco is partnering with Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at approximately half the typical market price. This offer is targeted at members paying out-of-pocket, as many insurance plans do not cover these drugs, addressing the soaring costs and limited supply that have driven some to seek unregulated compounded versions. The move could significantly increase access to these authentic medications amidst growing public demand and competition from alternative sellers.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages and handing over Gaza's administration to a technocratic body. While the U.S. views the response as positive, Hamas indicated that some details require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing to facilitate the safe release of hostages, and Israel has reportedly begun preparations to implement the first phase of the plan.</p>

          <p>Small U.S. college towns are facing economic strain as the number of international students plummets, a trend exacerbated by the Trump administration's immigration policies and stricter vetting processes. Universities like Miami University in Ohio have seen a drastic reduction in enrollments, leading to significant revenue loss for both the institutions and local businesses that depend on the student population. This decline, driven by fears of detainment and visa revocations, threatens the financial stability of communities whose economies are closely tied to their colleges.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has found a more fulfilling and affordable lifestyle in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, after leaving the military. He lives in a modern two-bedroom apartment for $850 a month, supporting himself on an income of roughly $4,000 from VA disability, the GI Bill, and teaching English. Ryan contrasts this with his life in the U.S., stating that the lower cost of living in Vietnam removes monetary pressure and allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than just survival.</p>

          <p>The president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Jon Godfread, is warning that Congress must act quickly to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies before the open enrollment period begins. The extension of these premium tax credits is a key point of contention in the ongoing government shutdown. Godfread stresses that failure to do so will cause premiums to spike dramatically for millions of Americans, potentially pricing them out of the market and destabilizing the insurance risk pool.</p>
