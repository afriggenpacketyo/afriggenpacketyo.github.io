        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and prudent policymaking. While it doesn't yet rival the global status of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc, the SGD exhibits defensive characteristics during financial stress. Hurdles to becoming a global safe haven include its relatively small market size and the managed nature of its monetary policy, which limits liquidity. However, experts believe the SGD holds significant potential as a key diversification asset, potentially becoming the "Swiss franc of Asia" over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida has scheduled an August 19 execution for Kayle Bates, a 67-year-old man convicted for the 1982 kidnapping and murder of 24-year-old Janet White. According to case summaries, Bates abducted White from her workplace, took her into nearby woods, attempted to sexually assault her, and then fatally stabbed her before stealing her ring. Governor Ron DeSantis signed the death warrant, marking the 10th scheduled execution in the state for the year. Bates' attorney has stated he will file further appeals, arguing the execution would be unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>A provision in the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will require visitors needing nonimmigrant visas to the U.S. to pay a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This fee is in addition to existing visa application costs and will be collected upon visa issuance, starting in the 2025 fiscal year. The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying. However, significant implementation details remain unclear, and some experts advise travelers to treat the fee as nonrefundable for now.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a Sunday election. Despite the "harsh result," Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, citing his focus on ongoing trade negotiations. The defeat undermines the coalition's legislative power and reflects voter frustration over rising prices and other economic pressures. Analysts suggest the loss of support for the LDP was partly due to more conservative voters shifting to right-wing parties, viewing Ishiba as not conservative enough.</p>

In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed there is significant demand for the name change and that the heritage of Indigenous people is being "systematically being taken away." The team dropped its longtime name in 2020 following years of criticism that it was a racist slur. It remains unclear how Trump could intervene in the stadium project, which already has congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Canada is currently experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 confirmed cases in 2025, a figure that far surpasses that of the much more populous United States. The provinces of Ontario and Alberta are the hardest-hit, with outbreaks spreading rapidly within communities with historically low vaccination rates, including some Mennonite populations. Public health officials attribute the surge to declining immunization rates, fueled by misinformation and a growing distrust in the healthcare system following the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts stress that increasing MMR vaccination is the only effective way to halt the virus's spread.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to conventional wisdom, one market analyst argues that the stock market is buoyed by strong underlying factors that can withstand the drama of approaching trade tariff deadlines. The article points to a strong earnings season, massive economic stimulus from the "big beautiful bill," and pro-business tax relief as key drivers of optimism. Additional tailwinds include vast infrastructure needs for data centers and the grid, a renaissance in the U.S. energy sector, and a primed IPO market. This analysis suggests these powerful domestic economic forces will likely overshadow negative sentiment from trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has issued a warning that people retiring in 2050 are projected to be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly boosted. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions, as nearly half of working-age adults are not contributing to a private pension. The analysis revealed stark disparities, with low earners, the self-employed, women, and some ethnic minorities being far less likely to save. The commission will aim to build a national consensus on a future strategy to close this retirement savings gap.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities and believing the focus is not on dangerous criminals. This shift has contributed to a decline in the president's approval on immigration, even among Hispanic Americans. The poll also reveals that a large majority of Americans, particularly outside of the president's base, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Overall approval for the president has slipped, reflecting a growing disconnect.</p>

          <p>In one of the deadliest days for civilians seeking aid during the ongoing conflict, at least 85 Palestinians were killed at various locations across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The largest number of casualties occurred in northern Gaza, where witnesses reported Israeli forces fired on massive crowds trying to access a UN aid convoy. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a crowd that posed an "immediate threat," but disputed the high casualty figures. The violence comes as Israel issues new evacuation orders for central Gaza, further complicating humanitarian efforts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggles continued as they were swept by the Milwaukee Brewers, losing the final game of the series 6-5 and marking their tenth defeat in twelve games. The loss was compounded by an injury to star first baseman Freddie Freeman, who suffered a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. While X-rays were negative, the potential loss of a key player adds to the team's frustration over poor defensive play and inconsistent performance. The Brewers became the first team in two decades to sweep a season series of more than four games from the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Britain's massive High-Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, was beset by fundamental problems inherent to building large infrastructure in the UK, according to insiders. The project's issues stem from a combination of overly ambitious technical specifications and the complexities of the UK's democratic, property-owning society. The complex and expensive planning process, which required thousands of individual permissions and compromises, significantly drove up costs and caused extensive delays. This has led to questions about whether the project was doomed from its inception by systemic challenges.</p>
