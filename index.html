          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Limiting Work Permits for Asylum Seekers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 17:14:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering longstanding U.S. immigration policy. This proposal, spearheaded by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, aims to suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe challenging to meet given current backlogs. Advocates express concerns that this change could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, potentially driving them to work illegally. The proposed rule echoes a previous 2020 effort and aligns with the administration's broader goal of deterring migrants from using the asylum system primarily to work in the U.S. The article highlights the potential impact on asylum seekers and the ongoing debate surrounding immigration policy. The optimism score is 30.</p>
