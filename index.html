          <p>In a fiery speech at the UN General Assembly, former President Donald Trump heavily criticized the organization, accusing it of creating rather than solving problems, particularly regarding migrants and refugees. He touted his own administration's record, claiming it ushered in a "golden age" for the United States, while attacking "globalist institutions" and the Biden administration for weakening the world order. Trump also condemned European allies for purchasing Russian oil while supporting Ukraine and disparaged renewable energy sources like windmills.</p>

The event, hosted by commentator Michael Knowles, honored Kirk's memory and drew a large crowd of supporters as well as approximately 100 protesters. Following his death, Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, was named CEO and vowed that the organization's work would continue and expand.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell explained that the central bank's recent decision to lower its key interest rate was prompted by a weakening labor market, which now outweighs concerns about persistent inflation. He described the current economic landscape as a "challenging situation," with downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation, acknowledging that there is no risk-free policy path. Powell stated the Fed's current stance is "modestly restrictive" but leaves it well-positioned to respond to future economic developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has warned that 2025 could be the first year in decades to see a rise in global child mortality, potentially reversing 25 years of progress that cut annual deaths from over 10 million to under 5 million. To combat this, he announced a $912 million pledge to fight infectious diseases, stressing that sustained funding is critical for deploying innovations in global health. Gates urged the U.S. to maintain its foreign health aid, which constitutes about 1% of the federal budget, arguing the investment yields significant returns in global stability and disease prevention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American households are projected to face higher heating costs this winter, with average energy bills expected to increase by 7.6% to $976, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. The rise is driven by soaring electricity and natural gas prices, with natural gas users seeing an 8.4% jump and electricity users a 10.2% increase. This follows a costly summer for air-conditioning and has contributed to a 31% rise in unpaid energy bills since the end of 2023, compounding financial strain on families already dealing with record debt.</p>

          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth of single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, increasing just 2.3% year-over-year, which is below the pre-pandemic average. This slowdown was observed across various price tiers and in most major metropolitan areas, with markets like Miami seeing no rent growth at all, a sharp contrast to its 40% surge in 2022. The cooling rental market could indicate that landlords are adjusting to the financial struggles of consumers and may impact the strategies of single-family rental REITs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, providing relief for homebuyers. For a $350,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128. This is about $210 less per month compared to the 7.04% average rate at the beginning of 2025, saving a borrower over $75,000 in total interest over the life of the loan. The lower rates have also spurred an increase in refinancing applications from current homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly is being analyzed as a wide-ranging assault on the very principles of the institution he was addressing. He targeted global efforts to manage immigration and climate change, which he called a "con job," while claiming credit for solving numerous wars without recognition. The address lacked a singular focus, instead weaving through familiar grievances and controversial statements, such as his claim that European countries are "going to hell." The performance reinforced his isolationist, "America First" worldview in his second term.</p>

          <p>The Chinese military has publicly criticized Japan's advancements in laser weapon technology, labeling them a threat to regional stability. A commentary in the official PLA Daily newspaper highlighted Japan's progress on truck-mounted lasers and a new program for ship-mounted systems designed to counter drone swarms. China's warning underscores the escalating technological arms race in the region, as nations invest in directed-energy weapons as a cost-effective defense against the growing threat of unmanned aerial vehicles in modern warfare.</p>

          <p>The 2026 race for Georgia governor is taking shape with the entry of two Republicans known for resisting Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election: Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and former Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan. Raffensperger, a Republican, famously refused Trump's request to "find" votes, while Duncan, who has since switched to the Democratic party, also repudiated the false election claims. Their candidacies highlight the enduring political fallout from the 2020 election and set the stage for a contentious primary season within a state GOP still largely loyal to Trump.</p>

Her endorsement is significant as many other prominent Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have withheld their support for Mamdani. The reluctance from some party leaders stems from Mamdani's democratic socialist platform and his critical stance on Israel's actions in Gaza. Polls currently show Mamdani with a commanding lead in the race.</p>

The author humorously suggests that if Trump administration officials are responsive to bribes, perhaps taxpayers should adopt the same method to influence policy for the national interest. The piece lampoons the normalization of transactional politics and questions the effectiveness of such a small sum, sarcastically noting it's "chicken feed" compared to private sector influence.</p>
