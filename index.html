          <p>The House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill with a narrow 215-214 vote, marking a significant win for Republicans despite opposition from every Democrat and some Republicans. The bill, comprised of tax cuts and social safety net adjustments, advances to the Senate where it faces a complex path under budget reconciliation rules. Speaker Mike Johnson spent two months crafting the bill and two days making last-minute changes. The legislation's passage represents a major victory for Republican leaders, but its future in the Senate remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with prices rising by up to $10, while clothing and equipment will see increases between $2 and $10.

The team successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber, simulating flight conditions at Mach 8 and an altitude of 18 miles. This experiment ignited and sustained stable detonation waves for over two seconds, which researchers claim proves the concept's technical feasibility for military applications. The ODE concept, initially proposed by US Air Force-contracted researchers in 1958, promises propulsion without moving parts by coupling shock waves with combustion.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that a Republican tax bill threatens to cost over 830,000 jobs, raise energy bills, and increase pollution emissions by dismantling clean energy incentives. The bill, moving through the House, would eliminate key components of climate legislation, including tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. This could reduce US GDP by over $1 trillion over 10 years and cause Americans' energy bills to spike by an average of $230 by 2035. The legislation is projected to increase US emissions by 260 million tonnes in 2035, undermining efforts to combat climate change.</p>

More than a dozen states follow California's lead, covering nearly 40% of new light-duty vehicle registrations across the US.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Higher-than-expected government borrowing figures in the UK have increased the likelihood of Chancellor Rachel Reeves raising taxes in the autumn. Borrowing reached Â£20.2bn in April, Â£1bn higher than the previous year, marking the fourth-highest April figure since 1993. Experts suggest that this could make it difficult for Reeves to meet her self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing. The combination of weaker economic growth and potential increases in spending, such as the reinstatement of winter fuel payments, is intensifying the pressure for tax rises.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration violated a court order by deporting eight migrants convicted of violent crimes to South Sudan without due process. Judge Brian Murphy found that the migrants were not given a meaningful opportunity to object to their removal. While he did not order the return of the deportees, he mandated that the government conduct interviews to determine if they have a reasonable fear of being deported to South Sudan. The ruling underscores concerns about the rights and treatment of migrants facing deportation.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that U.S. semiconductor export controls on China have been "a failure," causing more harm to American businesses than to China. Restrictions aimed at curbing China's military advancement have instead spurred domestic innovation and created competitors for U.S. companies. Huang noted that Nvidia's GPU market share in China has fallen significantly due to these curbs. Experts suggest that the controls have incentivized China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor and AI technologies, leading to a closing of the gap between Chinese and U.S. capabilities.

This approach offers a cost-effective and scalable way to monitor biodiversity changes, detect invasive species, and identify pathogens. The technique has the potential to transform air quality networks into global wildlife monitoring systems, providing crucial data for conservation efforts and environmental impact assessments.</p>
