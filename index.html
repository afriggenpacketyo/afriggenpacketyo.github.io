        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has levied substantial fines against Apple and Meta, totaling €700 million, for breaching the Digital Markets Act. Apple faces a €500 million penalty for App Store practices restricting developers from informing users about alternative offers outside the platform, while Meta is fined €200 million for handling user data improperly. Commissioner Henna Virkkunen emphasized the EU's commitment to protecting citizens' rights and innovative businesses. Both tech giants have expressed strong disagreement, with Meta accusing the EU of unfairly targeting American businesses and Apple planning an appeal, claiming unfair targeting and forced technology giveaways.</p>

Boeing is also selling parts of its digital aviation businesses to Thoma Bravo for $10.55 billion to refocus on core operations.

          <p>The New Mexico Supreme Court has permanently banned former judge Joel Cano from holding judicial office after an alleged member of the Tren de Aragua gang was arrested at his home. The court's decision followed Cano's resignation after Homeland Security Investigations found Venezuelan native Cristhian Ortega-Lopez, residing at a property owned by Cano's wife, in possession of firearms. Ortega-Lopez admitted to illegally entering the U.S. and stated he was offered a 'casita' at the back of the residence by Cano's wife after doing some work for her. The incident has raised serious concerns about Cano's judgment and associations.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein's retrial for alleged sexual assault crimes has commenced in New York after his previous conviction was overturned. The court of appeals cited that the judge allowed testimony from women regarding uncharged conduct, leading to an unfair trial. Weinstein, already serving a 16-year sentence in California for a separate sexual assault conviction, faces accusations from a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress, and another unnamed woman. The retrial will likely include testimony from Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, who testified in the 2020 trial, and the proceedings are taking place with Weinstein under medical supervision at Bellevue hospital due to various health conditions.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Beradt, a German Jewish journalist, documented the dreams of people living under Nazi rule in her book, "The Third Reich of Dreams," revealing the psychological impact of authoritarianism. Beradt interpreted these dreams as attempts by the subconscious to make sense of a reality filled with propaganda and fear, highlighting a desire to conform. However, the interpretation of these dreams is complex, as they could also represent a subconscious warning or preparation to resist. The book underscores how authoritarianism hijacks people's brains, illustrating the rapid and thorough intrusion of Nazi ideology into the deepest recesses of the mind.</p>

          <p>Two documentaries, 'Kiss the Ground' and 'Common Ground,' advocate for regenerative agriculture as a solution to climate change, arguing that it can draw down massive amounts of greenhouse gases and store them in soil. While regenerative agriculture practices like reducing synthetic chemicals, eliminating tillage, planting cover crops, and rotational grazing have ecological benefits, experts caution against overly simplistic claims. Concerns include the potential for increased land demand and the lack of accurate tools to measure carbon sequestration effectively. Critics suggest that reducing meat and dairy production is a more effective approach to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.</p>

Applications for home purchases also decreased by 7%, as potential homebuyers face climbing home prices and stock market volatility.

          <p>The anti-abortion movement in the U.S. is increasingly embracing fetal personhood, advocating for laws that would treat fetuses as people and potentially subject women who have abortions to homicide charges. This shift is driven by the movement's growing alignment with Republican politicians and a belief that justice for the fetus means punishing a larger group of people, including abortion seekers. While most Americans support abortion rights in some or all circumstances, the anti-abortion movement is focusing on convincing judges that the 14th Amendment already recognizes embryos and fetuses as people, circumventing popular will.</p>

          <p>This article explores the question of whether courts can force a president to comply with their rulings, especially in light of the Trump administration's defiance of court orders. While courts have coercive powers, their effectiveness relies on democratic cultural norms and public vigilance. The judiciary can mandate officials to answer questions, discipline attorneys, and impose fines or imprisonment, but ultimately depends on the executive branch for enforcement. The article highlights historical examples of presidents complying with court orders due to a shared commitment to self-government, emphasizing the importance of public opinion and clear directives from the courts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's tariffs have caused economic uncertainty, leading investors to flock to gold as a safe haven investment. The price of gold has surged since Trump announced tariffs on U.S. imports, briefly climbing to a record high of over $3,500 per ounce. The tariffs have also caused the stock market to decline and raised concerns about the stability of U.S. Treasury bonds and the dollar. Goldman Sachs projects that the price of gold will continue to increase, potentially reaching $3,700 by the end of 2025, as central banks worldwide increase their gold purchases.

          <p>No members of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet visited the war-linked Yasukuni shrine during the spring festival, partly due to diplomatic considerations. Ishiba sent a ritual offering, prompting protests from China and disappointment from South Korea, who view the shrine as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The decision to avoid the shrine reflects Japan's efforts to thaw relations with China and South Korea after years of tension over wartime history and territorial issues. Past visits by Japanese leaders have drawn sharp rebukes from Beijing and Seoul, underscoring the sensitivity surrounding the shrine.</p>

          <p>A recent study by Allianz Life reveals that a majority of Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death. Factors contributing to this fear include inflation, high taxes, and concerns over Social Security benefits. Gen Xers, nearing retirement age, are particularly concerned about running out of money. Experts advise seeking professional help to navigate financial uncertainties and ensure adequate retirement savings. Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.</p>

          <p>The UK's public finances are under pressure as government borrowing exceeded expectations, coinciding with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' efforts to secure a trade deal with the US to mitigate the impact of tariffs.

The International Monetary Fund has also lowered its growth forecast for the UK in 2025, citing tariffs, inflation, and borrowing costs.

          <p>The UK government has pledged to clear the driving test backlog by next summer, aiming to reduce wait times for learner drivers in England. The government plans to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests per month to address the issue, with a goal of reducing average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) cited increased demand and changes in booking behavior as reasons for the backlog.

          <p>A new religious divide is emerging in politics, particularly within Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, fueled by recent converts who blend conservative ideologies with traditional beliefs. These converts, often young white men disillusioned with modernity, seek community and answers online, embracing traditionalism and questioning Protestantism. Figures like Vice President JD Vance exemplify this trend, challenging established hierarchies and cultural traditions within their newfound faiths. This polarization threatens the historical role of religious institutions as spaces for encountering diverse political views, accelerating the political division of American religion.</p>
