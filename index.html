          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to divide his estimated $13.9 billion fortune among the more than 100 children he claims to have fathered. Durov stated that all his children will have equal rights to the inheritance, which they will only be able to access after 30 years, ensuring they live normal lives and build their own independence. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, where he was arrested last year for allegedly failing to properly moderate Telegram to reduce criminality, charges which he denies. He believes his work defending freedoms has earned him enemies, including powerful states, making a will necessary. </p>

          <p>A Chinese military robotics lab has created a microdrone about the size of a mosquito for covert operations. The drone, developed by the National University of Defence Technology, features tiny wings and legs and can be controlled via smartphone. This presents manufacturing challenges, as sensors, power devices, and control circuits must fit into a very small space, requiring collaboration between various scientific disciplines. The micro UAV Black Hornet, a palm-sized drone developed in Norway, is currently widely used by armed forces around the globe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the UK experienced a significant drop in May, primarily due to a "dismal" month for supermarkets, according to official figures from the Office for National Statistics. Sales volumes fell by 2.7%, the largest monthly decline since December 2023, with food retailers seeing reduced sales of alcohol and tobacco. The decline followed a 1.3% rise in April, attributed to sunny weather, and separate figures revealed an increase in government borrowing. The data suggests that the economic growth experienced earlier in the year may be slowing, as consumers cut back on spending due to inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against proposed cuts to disability benefits, stating that these cuts should not be part of the solution to address the welfare bill. The government's bill aims to tighten criteria for personal independence payments (Pips) and reduce the sickness-related element of universal credit. Government officials claim the reforms will fix a broken welfare system, while impact assessments suggest hundreds of thousands of existing Pips claimants could lose out under the changes. Foxcroft's resignation highlights internal divisions within the Labour party regarding the welfare reforms.</p>

          <p>The matcha industry in Japan is concerned about potential tariffs imposed by the United States under President Donald Trump, which could increase prices and reduce sales. Despite a recent surge in demand for matcha, experts and tea farmers fear that a shrinking global market could lead to the loss of a promising opportunity. The Kokaen tea farm in Aichi Prefecture is among many that have benefited from the increasing popularity of Japanese powdered tea. The uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs has created anxiety within the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Right-wing populists are increasingly critical of cities, viewing them as centers of liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies, according to Andy Beckett in The Guardian. Populists often favor the nation state, countryside, and traditional values, contrasting with the fluid loyalties and diverse interests found in urban areas. This animosity stems from the transformation of many cities into strongholds of the center-left, a shift seen as a defeat for the right. Despite the complexities of urban politics, right-wing media often caricatures cities and their governments, ignoring the aspects of city life that might align with conservative values.</p>

          <p>India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is yet to decide whether flight data and cockpit voice recorders from the Air India flight that crashed last Thursday will be sent overseas for decoding and analysis. Investigators have recovered both sets of Enhanced Airborne Flight Recorders (EAFRs) - the "black boxes" - from the Boeing 787 crash site. The ministry said the AAIB will determine the location for analysis after a "due assessment of technical, safety, and security factors". India's aviation regulator had ordered additional safety checks on Air India's Boeing 787 fleet after the deadly crash as a "preventive measure".</p>
