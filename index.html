          <p>President Trump recently issued a series of pardons and commutations, including several convicted of fraud and those claiming to be unfairly targeted as his supporters. Among those pardoned were reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion, and former New York Representative Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud. Other pardons included former Virginia sheriff Scott Jenkins, ex-Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, and former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, as well as Nevada state lawmaker Michelle Fiore, former Tennessee state Senator Brian Kelsey, electric truck entrepreneur Trevor Milton, Ozy founder Carlos Watson, Paul Walczak, and Jeremy Hutchinson. Trump has often claimed that these individuals were victims of politically motivated prosecutions.</p>

Aaron Costello, the firm‚Äôs head of Asia, noted that despite aggressive tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, with Chinese and Hong Kong stocks remaining attractive due to compelling valuations and falling interest rates. This sentiment follows an agreement between Washington and Beijing to reduce tariffs, easing geopolitical risks. Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index has risen significantly this year, supported by monetary easing and policy coordination between the two nations, making it an attractive alternative to expensive US stocks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge upheld a court order blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to sponsor international student visas. Judge Allison D. Burroughs extended her restraining order, preserving the status quo while both sides confer on the matter. The Trump administration has accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, but Harvard claims the revocation is retaliation for its refusal to surrender academic independence. The court must consider the conduct of foreign student visa holders and whether they are engaged in serial violations of immigration law or supporting foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and unlawfully enabling trading in unregistered securities. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to an aggressive crypto crackdown, coinciding with efforts by the Trump administration to align itself with the crypto industry. Binance has recently partnered with World Liberty Financial, a crypto bank project, and Zhao has been appointed as an advisor to Pakistan's Crypto Council.</p>

          <p>After a severe spring season of toxic algae blooms that sickened numerous sea lions, experts report that the worst of the poisoning is over in Southern California. The Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro has not seen any new patients with domoic acid poisoning or recent signs of Pseudo-nitzschia algae. This year‚Äôs event was particularly challenging, with the center treating over 400 marine animals, including sea lions and dolphins, and experiencing reports of aggressive sea lion behavior.

Since February 2022, Russia has earned over ‚Ç¨883 billion from fossil fuel exports, with a significant portion coming from sanctioning countries. Despite efforts to limit Russia's ability to fund the war, Western policymakers fear that cutting imports of Russian fuels will lead to higher energy prices.

          <p>Commonly used herbal and dietary supplements, taken by millions of Americans, have been linked to a rising number of cases of liver damage and toxicity. Studies indicate a significant increase in supplement-related liver failure requiring transplants. Turmeric, black cohosh, red yeast rice, Garcinia cambogia, and green tea extract are among the supplements identified as potentially harmful. Insufficient testing, mislabeling, and a lack of disclosure to doctors are contributing factors, with some supplements containing different ingredients than stated on the label.</p>

          <p>Multiple senior DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) officials, including top attorney James Burnham and Musk lieutenant Steve Davis, are leaving the Trump administration as Elon Musk officially steps away. Musk, who helped launch DOGE to slash the federal government, stated he wanted to thank President Trump as his time as a Special Government Employee ends. DOGE has claimed government savings of $175 billion, though its cost-cutting tactics have faced lawsuits and accusations of being unconstitutional. Musk will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), making it easier to approve infrastructure projects. The ruling limits the consideration of upstream and downstream environmental effects of projects like highways, pipelines, and wind farms. The case involved a proposed railroad in Utah intended to transport crude oil. Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, argued that NEPA is a procedural statute and not meant to be a roadblock, while critics argue the decision undermines environmental protections.</p>
