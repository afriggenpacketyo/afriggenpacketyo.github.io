          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of government stockpiled rice following Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Shinjiro Koizumi's announcement of direct contracts to stabilize prices. The total amount requested represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons planned for release through these direct sales contracts, bypassing the auction system. Retailers such as Don Quijote and Rakuten Group Inc. are among the applicants, with Aeon Co. planning to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms starting in early June. This initiative aims to address the doubling of supermarket rice prices compared to the previous year despite previous government efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop of 49% in April, with 7,261 cars sold, despite overall battery electric car sales rising by 34.1%. This decline is attributed to reputational damage stemming from CEO Elon Musk's political involvement and increased competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like BYD, which outsold Tesla in Europe for the first time. The aging Tesla car lineup, coupled with a preference among European consumers for hybrid vehicles, further contributes to the sales slump. Investors have also voiced concerns about Musk's dedication to Tesla due to his advisory role with Donald Trump, although Musk has affirmed his commitment to Tesla for the next five years.

          <p>Japan has approved a $6.3 billion spending package to support businesses and households affected by U.S. tariffs, particularly in the automotive sector. The funds will aid small and medium-sized businesses and subsidize household energy costs as the country faces an expected economic slowdown and public concerns over rising consumer prices. This action mirrors similar measures taken by other nations like Spain and Canada in response to escalating tariffs. While President Trump has temporarily paused a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods, the automotive sector is already feeling the impact of existing tariffs, leading companies like Nissan to consider production shifts to the United States.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that rice plants can pass on adaptive traits acquired through environmental stress without DNA changes. The research, published in Cell, showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress developed tolerance to low temperatures that was passed down through five generations. This finding supports the 19th-century theory of Lamarckism, which posits that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study identifies heritable DNA methylation changes as the mechanism driving cold adaptation, suggesting a potential reconciliation of epigenetics with evolutionary principles.</p>

          <p>The Monaco Grand Prix introduced a mandatory two-stop rule requiring teams to use three sets of tires, aiming to increase strategic options and create more jeopardy. While this led to diverse scenarios and strategic maneuvering, it didn't significantly alter the race outcome, with the only top 10 changes being Lewis Hamilton gaining positions due to a grid penalty and Fernando Alonso's retirement. Some teams, like Racing Bulls and Williams, used strategic driver positioning to facilitate pit stops, raising questions about the impact of such tactics on the race's spectacle. The core issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, leading to debates about whether artificial gimmicks can fix a problem unfixable without track changes.</p>

          <p>Italian filmmaker Silvio Soldini's "The Tasters" is a fictionalized account inspired by the story of Margot Wölk, who worked as one of Hitler's food tasters.

While the film's historical accuracy has been questioned, it reflects the tasters' recruitment and daily schedule as described by Wölk.
