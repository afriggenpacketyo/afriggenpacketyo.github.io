          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. The club, currently 19th in the Premier League, sacked Potter after a string of poor results, including only three points from the first five league games this season. Nuno, who previously managed Nottingham Forest and led them to their highest league finish in decades, was dismissed from his former role just three games into the current season. He now takes on the challenge of improving West Ham's performance and league position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Labour Party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized Reform UK, stating their policies would "tear this country apart." He highlighted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants as particularly divisive, affecting individuals who have long contributed to British society. Starmer positioned the conference as an opportunity to present Labour's vision of "patriotic national renewal" as an alternative to what he described as Reform's politics of "divide and decline." The comments come as Labour faces polling pressure from Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has summoned hundreds of U.S. military generals and admirals from around the globe for an unusual meeting in Washington, D.C. The purpose of this large-scale gathering, which pulls senior leaders away from active fronts, has not been clarified, raising security concerns and speculation among analysts. This event coincides with new restrictions on press access at the Pentagon, limiting journalists' ability to question officials. Critics worry these developments may be part of a broader effort by the administration to assert new expectations over the military leadership.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Lynx head coach Cheryl Reeve was ejected from a playoff game against the Phoenix Mercury after a heated confrontation with officials. Her anger stemmed from a play in the final minute where star player Napheesa Collier suffered a potential leg fracture, which Reeve attributed to poor officiating. In a post-game press conference, Reeve bypassed questions and delivered a powerful critique of the league's officiating standards, calling for a change in leadership and describing the crew's performance as "malpractice." Her comments reflect a season-long frustration with officiating shared by other coaches.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data, including strong consumer spending and GDP growth, suggests the U.S. economy is resilient, potentially staving off a recession due to the wealth effect from a booming stock market. However, this strength is largely concentrated among the top 10% of earners who own the majority of stocks, while broader consumer sentiment remains low. Economists warn that this creates a precarious situation, as the economy is highly vulnerable to a downturn if the stock market falters, especially with stagnant job growth.

These government-funded centers, often based at universities, offer language courses and scholarships, attracting many young Africans seeking career opportunities. However, critics express concern that the institutes also serve to advance Beijing's political and economic interests, potentially influencing academic freedom and promoting undemocratic values. This cultural expansion is seen by some analysts as intertwined with China's strategic goals, including securing access to Africa's natural resources.</p>

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry has reported multiple drone sightings over several military facilities, including the country's largest airbase in Karup. The incidents, which occurred overnight, follow a series of similar events earlier in the week that temporarily shut down major Danish airports. This repeated, unexplained drone activity has heightened security concerns across Northern Europe, with possible sightings also reported in Germany, Norway, and Lithuania. While Danish officials have not assigned blame, the incursions are being investigated as a potential security threat, prompting discussions about enhanced anti-drone capabilities.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old Miami girl named Imani Dell was diagnosed with a fast-growing brain tumor after her aunt observed that her eyes were crossed. Her mother, initially thinking it was due to tablet use, sought medical help when Imani began seeing double, leading to the discovery of a golf-ball sized medulloblastoma. Surgeons successfully removed the tumor, and Imani has since completed a difficult year-long regimen of radiation and chemotherapy. Now in remission, she has returned to school, and her family is celebrating her recovery and return to a normal childhood.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves mixing soda with flavored syrups and cream, has exploded from its origins in Utah to become a national phenomenon influencing major food and beverage companies.

The trend's appeal lies in its affordability, customizability, and accessibility, helping to revitalize the sluggish carbonated soft drink category.

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is developing advanced cockpit alert systems designed to give pilots more time to react and prevent runway incursions, which have seen a recent spike. The technology, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), uses GPS data to provide automated audio and visual warnings of potential collisions on the ground or during takeoff and landing. Amid concerns over airport safety, the NTSB and FAA have urged the adoption of such systems. While not yet required by regulators, some airlines like Alaska and Southwest have already implemented similar tools to enhance situational awareness.</p>

However, the boycott proved more costly for the local stations, which lost viewers and ad revenue to replacement programming.

While some are proceeding with construction, about two-thirds of property owners have not yet applied for building permits, citing exhaustion from insurance battles, financial shortfalls, and anxiety about contamination and future fires. An initial defiant spirit of rebuilding is giving way to a harsh reality, as homeowners weigh the emotional and financial toll of returning to what is now a construction zone, uncertain if the new Altadena will ever resemble the place they lost.</p>

The author reflects on the painful yet crucial principle that the First Amendment must protect even offensive and hateful speech to be effective. David Goldberger, the ACLU lawyer who argued the case, acknowledges the deep pain it caused survivors but maintains that allowing officials to ban speech they find offensive creates a dangerous precedent.

          <p>Legal analysts suggest that President Trump's long history of public attacks against former FBI Director James Comey could support a defense claim of vindictive or selective prosecution. Comey was recently indicted on charges of making false statements to Congress, a move that followed the installation of a Trump ally as the lead prosecutor. The president's celebratory comments following the indictment, combined with reports of internal disagreement among career prosecutors about bringing the case, may provide Comey's legal team with strong evidence to argue the prosecution is politically motivated and seek a dismissal.</p>

The H-1B program is used by high-skill foreign professionals in fields like tech, medicine, and finance. The administration claims the fee will encourage companies to hire American workers and generate revenue for tax cuts and debt reduction. However, economists like Britta Glennon of the Wharton School warn the policy will likely harm the U.S. economy by deterring innovation, discouraging entrepreneurship, and driving companies to offshore jobs.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major hurricane currently in the Atlantic, has the potential to interact with another developing storm system through a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two storms get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely, the possibility exists as the second system, expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda, tracks toward the Bahamas. The interaction depends on the relative strengths of the two storms, with a weaker storm typically being absorbed by the stronger one.</p>

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's book "107 Days" suggests it details the immense challenges of her presidential campaign without fully acknowledging her own strategic failures. The book portrays a campaign constrained by Joe Biden's late withdrawal and plagued by indecision, such as the selection of Tim Walz as her running mate, whom she now criticizes for his debate performance. The analysis argues that Harris's memoir avoids grappling with her own policy weaknesses on issues like immigration and inflation, as well as the role identity politics played in her defeat. It ultimately paints a picture of a candidate who struggled to connect with key voter demographics.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing, prominent Trump administration officials and allies are increasingly framing their political agenda in terms of a spiritual battle against evil. This rhetoric draws heavily from the New Apostolic Reformation, a charismatic Christian movement that views politics as a fight against demonic forces to establish God's dominion over society. At Kirk's memorial, speakers described the current moment as a "spiritual war," with some calling Kirk the "first martyr of the third Great Awakening." This language reflects a growing fusion of charismatic Christian ideology with right-wing politics.</p>
