          <p>Hurricane Humberto rapidly strengthened to a Category 4 storm on Friday evening, though no immediate watches or warnings were issued for the U.S. by the National Hurricane Center. The storm is one of two systems in the western Atlantic that could potentially bring downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast. Forecasters are also closely monitoring a second system over the northeast Caribbean, expected to become a tropical depression and bring significant rainfall to Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of State announced it will revoke the visa of left-wing Colombian President Gustavo Petro, citing his 'reckless and incendiary actions.' This decision follows Petro's comments at the United Nations General Assembly, where he urged U.S. soldiers to 'disobey the orders of Trump' and criticized U.S. strikes on Venezuelan boats. The move escalates previous diplomatic friction, including a standoff earlier this year over deported migrants and retaliatory tariffs between the two nations.</p>

          <p>New documents released by Congressional Democrats from the Jeffrey Epstein Estate name billionaire Elon Musk and Prince Andrew among other prominent figures.

While the documents do not imply awareness of Epstein's alleged criminal activities, they include phone logs, flight manifests, and financial ledgers, adding to the ongoing scrutiny of Epstein's extensive connections.</p>

          <p>Investigators have identified Robert Eugene Brashers as the suspect in the 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders of four teenage girls, a decades-old cold case, using DNA evidence. Brashers, who died by suicide in 1999, was also suspected of being a serial predator and linked to three sexual assaults and murders in other states. This breakthrough overturns previous convictions and offers new insights into the tragic deaths of Amy Ayers, Eliza Thomas, Jennifer, and Sarah Harbison, whose case remains infamous in Austin.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired a group of up to 20 agents who kneeled during a civil rights protest in Washington, D.C., following George Floyd's death in 2020. Sources familiar with the matter indicated that the agents kneeled as a de-escalation strategy after being outnumbered by angry protesters, not as a political statement. The FBI Agents Association condemned the terminations, stating they are part of a 'dangerous new pattern of actions' by FBI Director Kash Patel that undermines the Bureau and its workforce.</p>

This debilitating condition, which combines symptoms of dementia, Parkinson's, and motor neurone disease, has previously had no effective treatment. While the therapy is still undergoing assessment and faces regulatory hurdles for widespread availability, scientists believe this breakthrough could also have broader implications for treating other neurodegenerative diseases. Families affected by the cruel illness are expressing immense optimism for the future.</p>

          <p>Three women—Ashleigh Brown, Cynthia Raygoza, and Sandra Carmona Samane—have been indicted on charges of illegally "doxing" a U.S. Customs and Immigration agent in Los Angeles. Prosecutors allege the women followed the agent from a federal building to their residence, live-streamed the event, and shouted slogans outside their home. This marks the first prosecution related to such tactics, as federal law enforcement leaders have expressed growing concern over the "doxing" of agents amidst ongoing protests against the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that one of the two counts in former FBI Director James Comey's indictment specifically targets his alleged role in sharing information about an FBI investigation related to Hillary Clinton with reporters. The indictment claims Comey knowingly lied under oath to Congress in 2020 when he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source for such news reports. 'PERSON 1' is identified as Clinton and 'PERSON 3' as Daniel Richman, Comey's close friend who previously shared memos with the press.</p>

Only minimal skeletal remains were recovered, and too much time had passed for a definitive autopsy. Decker, a former Army soldier with extensive survival skills, was the subject of a monthslong manhunt after his daughters, ages 5, 8, and 9, were found suffocated at a Cascade Mountains campsite.</p>

These 12 new towns will prioritize walkability, environmental friendliness, and 'gentle density' models like terraced housing over high-rise brutalism. TV architect George Clarke notes a mainstream shift towards the King's emphasis on community, local materials, and public spaces, aiming to create more humane and sustainable living environments that foster a stronger sense of belonging.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a new round of tariffs effective October 1, including a 100% tariff on patented pharmaceutical products (with an exemption for U.S. manufacturers), 30% on upholstered furniture, 50% on kitchen cabinets, and 30% on heavy trucks. Trump stated these measures are for 'National Security and other reasons' and to protect domestic industries. While some experts believe the pharma tariffs might have a modest impact due to exemptions, concerns persist about potential price increases for consumers and the lack of evidence for job creation despite previous duties.

This stance establishes a clear political dividing line with Reform and other parties, as Starmer seeks to prove Labour can deliver improvements and counter the rise of populist movements.</p>
