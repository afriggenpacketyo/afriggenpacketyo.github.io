          <p>The FBI has identified Guy Edward Bartkus, a 25-year-old with "nihilistic ideations," as the suspect in the fatal Palm Springs fertility clinic explosion. Bartkus, who is believed to have died in the blast, reportedly left behind writings expressing disapproval of people being brought into the world against their will. The suspect allegedly detonated explosives outside the clinic and attempted to livestream the attack, injuring four others who have since been released from the hospital. The FBI is continuing its investigation to piece together Bartkus's whereabouts before the explosion.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling continued concerns about consumption in the country, as sales grew 5.1% year-on-year, falling short of analysts' estimates. However, industrial output grew 6.1% year-on-year, surpassing expectations, indicating resilience against U.S. tariffs. Despite trade tensions with the U.S., China is focusing on diversifying exports and reducing mutual tariffs, though domestic demand still needs more momentum. The real estate sector continues to face challenges, with home prices in major cities declining, signaling a period of adjustment for the sector.</p>

          <p>The United States has lost its last triple-A credit rating after a downgrade by Moody's, heightening concerns about government debt and the economic impact of President Trump's policies.

The move could disrupt financial markets and raise borrowing costs for the U.S. government, with potential ripple effects on global interest rates and fiscal spending in other countries.

Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household using gas and electricity will fall by Â£129 a year, a decrease of nearly 7%. This would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to Â£1,720, down from the current level of Â£1,849. However, the price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, so the total bill still depends on usage.</p>

          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton shared his personal struggles with form and mental health, revealing feelings of anxiety and self-doubt. Haliburton discussed how negative messages on social media exacerbated his anxiety after being chosen for the US Olympic team but playing little due to injury. A study on Bundesliga players revealed that many experience depressive and anxiety symptoms during the season, highlighting the importance of mental health support in professional sports. The research also found that female players reported higher depression scores than male players, possibly due to differences in support and professionalism.</p>

          <p>The German Police Union (GdP) has warned that intensified border checks and asylum rejections are unsustainable due to staff shortages and suspended training. Over 1,000 riot police are currently deployed at the borders following tightened controls, leading to increased turnbacks. The GdP chief, Andreas Rosskopf, stated that the measures rely on adjusted rosters, canceled leave, and paused training, highlighting the strain on resources. Meanwhile, an Iraqi couple is on trial in Germany, accused of enslaving and abusing two Yazidi girls.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine has dismissed India's new Prachand combat helicopter as an easy target for China's Z-10 attack helicopter. The magazine claims the Prachand would be "a walkover" for the Z-10, undermining the aircraft's intended use in high-altitude operations along the Himalayan border with China. The Indian Ministry of Defence recently approved an order for 156 of these helicopters for operations at high altitudes. This assessment follows reports of India's French-made Rafale fighters being shot down by Pakistan's Chinese-made J-10C jets in Kashmir.</p>

Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. The election followed months of political turbulence, including the annulment of the initial presidential race due to claims of Russian interference.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered evidence of child sexual assault in South Africa's illegal mines, where children are recruited for cheap labor and sexual exploitation. Miners report witnessing young teenagers being abused by adult miners in exchange for gold or protection. Criminal gangs specifically target children, often abducting them from neighboring countries, with promises of employment in the formal mining industry. The findings highlight the vulnerability of children in the illegal mining industry and the urgent need for intervention.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism for stating he doesn't need to buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, amidst soaring rice prices affecting households. Eto's comments, made at a fundraising party, contradict his ministry's efforts to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has doubled due to a poor harvest, leading to public dissatisfaction. Eto has apologized for the remarks, but the incident has further eroded public support for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government.</p>

          <p>According to Kyle Chan, a researcher at Princeton University, China may already be on its way to surpassing the United States, harnessing its vast economic and technological potential. While the U.S. focuses on tariffs, China is investing heavily in cutting-edge technologies and increasing its budget for public research and development. This has led to China's dominance in multiple industries, from steel to electric vehicles, and is projected to account for nearly half of global manufacturing by 2030. Chan argues that the U.S. needs to invest in research, innovation, and global economic ties to avoid a future of diminished status.</p>
