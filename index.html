          <p>Facing increasing tariffs from the United States, Chinese e-commerce companies like Alibaba are assisting sellers in expanding their reach to markets beyond America, focusing on resilience and adaptability. Alibaba is providing resources and training to help businesses navigate customs procedures and advertise domestically, while the Chinese government offers tax breaks and incentives for international online sales. Despite concerns, many business owners are determined to pass tariff expenses onto customers and explore opportunities in Southeast Asia and Europe. The shift reflects a broader strategy to mitigate risks and maintain competitiveness in the global market.</p>

          <p>China's military is rapidly expanding its use of low-cost, AI-powered drones to gain an edge in modern warfare technology, with the latest micro drone weighing less than a kilogram and designed for infantry units. This micro drone features a coaxial dual-rotor system, enabling it to carry twice its weight and support both reconnaissance and attack missions, while an on-board neural processing unit facilitates AI-powered targeting. The military newspaper PLA Daily described this as a "phased leap" in unmanned combat technology, transitioning towards autonomous operations to define future battlefield rules and gain an early advantage in intelligent warfare.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a victory in the federal election, a surprising turn influenced by U.S. President Trump's annexation threats and tariffs, which overshadowed domestic issues. Voters considered sovereignty, affordability, immigration, jobs, and crime, with many concerned about Trump's impact on Canada. While the Conservative leader was viewed as similar to Trump, voters emphasized the need for Canada to broaden its global partnerships to reduce reliance on the U.S. Trump's continued interference in the election, including advocating for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, further fueled the debate.</p>

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has refused to send Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., while a federal judge has temporarily paused orders requiring updates on efforts to facilitate his return.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to announce measures to alleviate the impact of tariffs on imported cars and auto parts, providing automakers more time to relocate production to the United States. While tariffs of 25 percent on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, the administration will modify them to prevent "stacking" with other tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum. Automakers will also receive reimbursements for some tariff costs on imported components, phased out over two years. The changes aim to reward domestic manufacturing while offering a transition period for companies investing in U.S. production.</p>

Badenoch stated she is not concerned about criticism without a name attached and rejected claims of a rift with Robert Jenrick regarding an electoral pact with Reform UK.

          <p>A small group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators rallied in Brooklyn to condemn the assault of a woman by pro-Israel counterprotesters in Crown Heights, where tensions flared following an appearance by Israeli official Itamar Ben-Gvir. The police heavily monitored the protest, preventing the group from reaching its intended destination at the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, stated she was attacked by a crowd of ultra-Orthodox Jewish men, who kicked her, threw objects, and threatened her, while chanting anti-Arab slurs, as the events prompted calls for protests and condemnations from various groups.</p>
