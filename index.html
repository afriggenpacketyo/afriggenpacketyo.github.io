          <p>Douglas "Pete" Peterson, a former U.S. Air Force pilot who was held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam for six and a half years, discusses his journey from harboring intense hatred towards the Vietnamese to becoming the first postwar U.S. ambassador to the country. Peterson, now 89, shares how he made a conscious decision to leave his hate behind and contribute to reconciliation between the two nations. After being elected to Congress, he witnessed the poverty and friendliness of the Vietnamese people, which motivated him to seek accountability for missing Americans and improve safety for children throughout Asia, leading him to establish The Alliance for Safe Children with his wife. Peterson worries about the current state of international relations, noting the broken bonds of trust and the personalization of diplomacy by some world leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced significant flight delays, some lasting up to seven hours, due to a critical shortage of air traffic controllers at the Philadelphia facility managing Newark's air traffic. With as few as one or two fully certified controllers on duty during shifts that typically require fourteen, the FAA was forced to delay incoming flights. This incident is the latest in a series of setbacks for Newark, including recent radar outages caused by software and hardware problems, leading to increased stress among controllers and impacting travelers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the antiquated equipment and staffing challenges, announcing plans to reduce flights and upgrade infrastructure to address the ongoing issues, but also criticized the Biden administration for allegedly mishandling the relocation of air traffic management from Long Island to Philadelphia.</p>

Republicans on Capitol Hill have responded with a mix of jokes and avoidance when questioned about the proposed gift, estimated to be worth $400 million. Some senators expressed security concerns, suggesting the plane would need thorough sweeping, while others questioned the appropriateness of accepting such a lavish gift from a foreign government.

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks won the NBA draft lottery, securing the No. 1 pick and the chance to draft Cooper Flagg after trading away Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers. The Mavericks, who had only a 1.8% chance of winning, defied the odds, giving their fanbase a new star to cheer for. Flagg, who led Duke to the Final Four, is considered the consensus player of the year, averaging 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 4.2 assists in his lone college season.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled their plans for a comprehensive tax bill that includes temporary tax cuts, such as not taxing tips or overtime pay, and rolling back clean energy subsidies. The bill aims to fulfill President Trump's campaign pledges but faces criticism from within the Republican party due to concerns over state and local tax deductions. The proposed measures, which are expected to add at least $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years, also include tax breaks for businesses and tax hikes targeting Biden's agenda, universities, and migrants. The plan is structured with the majority of tax cuts expiring in 2029.</p>

          <p>Scientists around the world are in a race to discover why the Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building detectors to study neutrinos. The experiments aim to understand why matter won out over antimatter, allowing the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. The US-based Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) and the Japanese-led Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper K) project will study the behavior of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos to uncover the fundamental asymmetry. Both experiments involve international collaborations and are expected to provide transformative insights into the origins of the Universe.</p>
