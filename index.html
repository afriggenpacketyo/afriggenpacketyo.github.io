          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man wrongfully deported by the Trump administration, alleges he endured "psychological torture" and "severe beatings" in El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. In a new court filing, his lawyers detail severe mistreatment, including forced kneeling for hours, sleep deprivation, and inadequate food, leading to a 31-pound weight loss. Despite being returned to the U.S. to face separate human smuggling charges, his legal team fears he could be deported again and is seeking a court order for his protection. The administration has denied Abrego Garcia's claims and maintains he is an MS-13 gang member.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to gather enough votes to pass President Trump's major tax-and-spending package, facing opposition from both moderate and conservative members. The legislative process stalled as leadership worked late into the night to persuade holdouts who are demanding changes to the Senate's version of the bill. The White House has been directly involved, with Trump meeting with lawmakers to secure their support ahead of a tight deadline. The outcome remains uncertain as any amendments would require sending the bill back to the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ferry carrying 65 people, including passengers and crew, has sunk in the waters between the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, resulting in at least four confirmed deaths. Search and rescue operations are underway for dozens of people who remain missing after the vessel went down late Wednesday night. Four survivors have been found on a lifeboat, and authorities are investigating the cause of the incident, with the operator reporting engine trouble shortly before the sinking.

Three people were critically injured and airlifted to a hospital after the pilot reported engine trouble and attempted to return to the airport. Officials noted it was remarkable there were no fatalities, attributing the effective emergency response to a recent mass casualty training exercise at the same airport.

This surge, driven by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, positions the city to potentially become the world's top listing destination. Factors fueling the boom include regulatory support from Beijing, a slower pace of listings on mainland exchanges, and fears of delisting from U.S. markets.

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling for his immediate resignation in a post on his Truth Social platform. Trump's demand follows his long-standing criticism of Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to stimulate economic growth. Powell, who was nominated by Trump, recently suggested that the Fed would have already cut rates if not for the economic impact of the Trump administration's tariff policies. The president's ability to remove a Fed chair is legally questionable, setting up a potential clash over the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

This research refines understanding from earlier studies, emphasizing that the type and timing of hormone therapy are crucial factors.

Analysts argue that both parties have largely failed to address the core needs of the Latino community, creating an electorate that is increasingly responsive to candidates who prioritize economic mobility and populist messaging.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down the Trump administration's policy that banned migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled that the president exceeded his authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an alternative immigration system that supplants laws passed by Congress. The ruling, which the judge stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, was praised by immigrant rights groups like the ACLU as a critical affirmation that the president must adhere to existing immigration statutes.</p>

          <p>Rock icon Ozzy Osbourne is set to perform a final farewell show with his original Black Sabbath bandmates in his hometown of Birmingham. The 76-year-old frontman, whose career has been defined by both pioneering heavy metal and notorious debauchery, has faced increasing health challenges, including Parkinson's disease and spinal injuries. The concert, titled "Back to the Beginning," is being hailed as a major event in rock history, celebrating the band that forged the sound of heavy metal. Despite previous retirement teases, this performance is widely seen as his true swansong.</p>

          <p>A jury has ordered a man who participated in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot to pay $500,000 to the widow of D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, who died by suicide nine days after the insurrection. The civil lawsuit found that David Walls-Kaufman had assaulted Officer Smith during the riot, contributing to the trauma his widow, Erin Smith, said fundamentally changed him. Erin Smith called the verdict a relief, validating her fight to prove her husband was injured in the line of duty. She has been a key advocate for recognizing police suicides linked to on-the-job trauma.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon believes that U.S. airstrikes last month on three key Iranian nuclear facilities have set back the country's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. This assessment is more measured than President Trump's claim that the program was "obliterated" but more significant than an initial low-confidence report that estimated a setback of only several months. The evolving intelligence picture suggests significant damage was done to centrifuges at the Fordow enrichment site. The assessment comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, complicating verification efforts.</p>

The appeal claims the CPSC members have shown "hostility to the President's agenda" and created "chaos" at the agency, escalating the conflict over presidential power and the independence of regulatory bodies.</p>
