          <p>Steve Tandy, formerly Scotland's defence coach, has been appointed as the new head coach for the Wales men's national rugby team. He will assume the role on September 1st, taking charge until at least the 2027 World Cup. Tandy's appointment comes at a critical time for Welsh rugby, as the team has struggled recently, briefly dropping to a record-low 14th in world rankings. He expressed excitement about leading the rebuilding phase and helping a group of young, talented players compete at the highest level. His first match will be against Argentina in November.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Federal Law Change Could Lower Manufactured Home Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decades-old federal regulation requiring manufactured homes to be built on a permanent steel chassis may soon be eliminated, potentially making housing more affordable. This obscure rule has long been criticized for increasing costs, limiting design flexibility, and providing a pretext for exclusionary zoning. Housing advocates and industry leaders argue that removing the five-word mandate could scale up production and provide relief for the housing crisis, especially for first-time buyers. After years of legislative inertia, the Senate Banking Committee is expected to consider a bill that would give states flexibility on the chassis requirement, signaling a potential breakthrough.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant signalling failure at London's Waterloo station caused severe travel disruptions, leading South Western Railway (SWR) to advise customers not to travel. The issue, which began early in the morning, took numerous platforms out of service and is expected to cause residual delays and alterations throughout the day. Although the fault has been fixed, the operator warned that problems would persist. Passengers faced long waits and frustration, with SWR arranging for tickets to be accepted on some other rail and bus services to mitigate the impact.</p>

          <p>An Indonesian passenger ferry, the KM Barcelona 5, caught fire at sea, resulting in the deaths of three people, including a pregnant woman. A massive rescue operation involving coast guard ships, rescue vessels, and local fishermen successfully saved more than 560 other passengers and crew. The fire, which started in the vessel's stern, was extinguished within an hour. The incident highlighted a common issue in Indonesia where the number of passengers often exceeds the official manifest, complicating rescue efforts and underscoring ongoing concerns about maritime safety in the archipelago nation.</p>

The EU is preparing retaliatory measures and had hoped for a more favorable agreement similar to the one secured by the U.K. The potential for steep tariffs, particularly on the auto sector, has raised concerns about a significant negative impact on European exports and the global economy.</p>

          <p>Automotive giant Stellantis has issued a warning, projecting a net loss of €2.3 billion for the first half of the year due to a combination of factors, including the early effects of U.S. tariffs.

The author criticizes figures like Rahm Emanuel for critiquing the party's elitism while being part of the very establishment that shaped it. The piece contends that for too long, the party has focused on identity politics and rhetoric over tangible solutions for affordability, student debt, and healthcare. With no anointed heir apparent for the next presidential cycle, there is a chance for a new generation of leaders to emerge with authenticity and a focus on real economic issues.</p>

While reports have cited annual losses for the WNBA, other metrics like soaring broadcast rights, increased attendance, and skyrocketing team valuations suggest a much healthier financial reality. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure far below their counterparts in other professional sports. The players argue that their salaries, with a rookie minimum of just $66,000, and small roster sizes do not reflect their value or the league's rapid growth.</p>

          <p>The Bombay High Court has acquitted all 12 individuals accused in the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, overturning a 2015 trial court verdict that had sentenced five to death and seven to life in prison. The coordinated blasts on commuter trains killed 189 people and injured over 800. In its ruling, the high court panel stated that the prosecution had "utterly failed to prove the case" and found its witnesses unreliable. The decision means the remaining 11 accused will be released after spending nearly two decades in prison for a crime the court now believes they did not commit.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has conducted strikes on what it describes as Houthi terror targets at the port of Hodeida in Yemen. Israel's Defence Minister stated the operation was aimed at preventing the restoration of terrorist infrastructure and vowed that the Houthis would pay a heavy price for their attacks. The Houthi rebels, who are backed by Iran, have been launching missile and drone attacks against Israel and targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, claiming their actions are in solidarity with Palestinians. This attack marks a continued escalation in the regional conflict connected to the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>An investigation into the December 2024 Jeju Air crash in South Korea, which killed 179 people, has found that the pilots likely shut down the wrong engine following a bird strike. According to the accident investigation board, the right engine failed after colliding with ducks, but the pilots mistakenly cut power to the operational left engine, leaving the plane with no thrust. The cockpit voice recorder captured the command to shut down the correct engine, but flight data shows the wrong one was disabled. This error, combined with an improper landing procedure, led to South Korea's worst aviation disaster in decades.</p>

          <p>Tensions between Thailand and Cambodia have escalated after Thailand accused Cambodia of planting new landmines in a disputed border region where three Thai soldiers were recently injured. Thai authorities reported finding freshly laid Russian-made mines, which they claim is a violation of international law and a breach of sovereignty. Cambodia has denied the accusation, stating the soldiers strayed from agreed patrol routes into an area littered with unexploded ordnance from past wars.

Macías, who was recaptured in June after a prison escape, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His gang is known for using hitmen, bribery, and military-grade weapons to control key trafficking routes. The extradition proceeded after the U.S. provided guarantees regarding the respect of his rights.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on the "power law" principle when deciding which startups to fund, according to European VC Peter Specht. This concept dictates that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's returns, meaning one or two massive successes can outweigh all other losses combined. Consequently, VCs seek startups with "outsized-outcome potential" that can become category-defining companies like Spotify or Klarna. Founders are advised to pitch a compelling vision, demonstrate excellence in a key area, and tell a bold story to convince investors their company can be one of these outliers.</p>

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade agreement that eased some of Beijing's export controls. China, which dominates over 90% of the market for these critical components used in EVs, wind turbines, and other advanced tech, had previously placed restrictions on their export. The sharp increase in shipments reflects a scramble by U.S. firms to secure their supply chains. The situation highlights America's heavy reliance on China for these materials and the strategic leverage Beijing holds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Wagner's opera "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" continues to be a subject of debate due to its complex legacy, particularly its appropriation by the Nazis. The opera, which celebrates German art and craftsmanship, was a favorite of Adolf Hitler and was featured at Nazi party rallies. Scholars and directors remain divided on whether to interpret the work as a comedy or a serious piece with antisemitic undertones, particularly in its portrayal of the character Beckmesser. A new production at the Bayreuth Festival aims to emphasize its comical elements, while acknowledging the dark shadow cast by its historical associations.</p>

Its success reflects growing public unease over immigration and frustration with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

The report by Sir Jon Cunliffe makes 88 recommendations to address systemic issues like sewage spills, leaks, and underinvestment. Key proposals include setting minimum capital levels to ensure company resilience and granting powers to block ownership changes not in the public interest. The reforms aim to ensure continuous infrastructure investment and prevent the dramatic bill spikes now required to compensate for past neglect.</p>

These ETFs offer lower costs, diversification, and better liquidity than direct bond investments.
