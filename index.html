          <h2>England's Children's Commissioner Calls for Ban on AI 'Nudifying' Apps</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 06:30:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England, Dame Rachel de Souza, is urging the government to ban AI applications that create sexually explicit images of children, emphasizing the disproportionate targeting of girls and young women by these technologies. These apps, which allow for "nudification" of real photos, are reportedly causing children to avoid online engagement to reduce their risk of being targeted. While the government has announced plans to tackle AI-generated child sexual abuse images, Dame Rachel argues for a total ban on all nudifying apps to protect children adequately. It is illegal under the Online Safety Act to share or threaten to share explicit deepfake images.</p>

          <p>As Ukraine faces uncertainty regarding continued military support from the United States and potential cease-fire talks, the country is increasingly relying on its expanded drone program. This initiative, called the Line of Drones, focuses on assembling unmanned systems within Ukraine, primarily small exploding drones, to sustain its defense efforts. The program's importance could escalate should peace talks fail or U.S. arms shipments cease, allowing Ukrainian soldiers to continue fighting remotely.</p>

The proposal has gained bipartisan support, with President Trump indicating he would sign such a ban if it reached his desk. The ban would allow lawmakers to invest only in diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bonds, with violations resulting in profit forfeiture and potential fines.

          <p>A recent poll indicates that Elon Musk's approval rating is low, reflecting public opposition to the Trump administration's cuts to the federal government, which Musk is spearheading. Only 35% of Americans approve of his job performance for the Trump administration, while 57% disapprove. These negative ratings are linked to resistance against Trump's cuts to federal workers and agencies, with Musk's approval significantly lower among those who oppose these cuts. The poll also reveals that Musk's popularity is closely tied to Trump's, whose approval rating is at a historic low for a president at the 100-day mark.</p>

          <p>Polling data reveals a decline in President Trump's support across various demographic groups, with disapproval rates rising due to concerns about his handling of the economy and potential constitutional conflicts. A recent Pew poll found that 59% of respondents disapprove of Trump's job performance, while only 40% approve, reflecting historically low approval ratings. Key programs, such as government downsizing and tariff policies, are contributing to this decline, particularly among independent and unenthusiastic voters who secured his previous victory.</p>
