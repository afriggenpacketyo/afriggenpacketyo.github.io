        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ireland's public broadcaster, RTÉ, has announced it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel's inclusion proceeds. In a formal statement, the broadcaster described Ireland's participation under such circumstances as "unconscionable" due to the ongoing conflict and loss of life in Gaza. Ireland, a seven-time winner of the contest, is awaiting a final decision from the European Broadcasting Union before solidifying its position. This move adds to the growing international pressure surrounding Israel's involvement in cultural events amid the conflict.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing persistent economic uncertainty largely driven by the United States' aggressive tariff policies under President Trump. The decision to keep the deposit facility rate at 2% was widely expected by markets. Despite euro zone inflation nearing the bank's 2% target, concerns remain over sluggish economic growth and the potential impact of further trade disputes. All eyes are now on ECB President Christine Lagarde's upcoming press conference for signals about future monetary policy direction.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as ambassador to the United States following new revelations about his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The decision came after published emails showed Mandelson's friendship with Epstein was more extensive than previously known, including suggestions that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful. The British government stated this new information made his position untenable, especially in consideration of Epstein's victims. Mandelson had recently expressed profound regret for his association with Epstein.</p>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry has publicly stated he does not believe that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer tried to circumvent the NBA's salary cap. The comments address allegations that Ballmer used a third-party company, Aspiration, to covertly pay player Kawhi Leonard in 2021. Lasry, citing his long acquaintance with Ballmer, described him as honorable and stated there is pressure to win in the NBA, but not to break the rules. The NBA has launched an investigation into the matter following a report from journalist Pablo Torre.</p>

          <p>Russia's incursion into Polish airspace with 19 drones has created a significant challenge for NATO, marking the first such incident since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Poland and its NATO allies successfully scrambled aircraft to shoot down the drones, with Western leaders condemning the event as a deliberate provocation. The attack has intensified discussions about bolstering European air defenses, including a "drone wall," and the potential for new sanctions against Moscow. The event is seen as a deliberate test of NATO's readiness and response capabilities.</p>

          <p>Authorities have expanded the manhunt for the individual who assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. Two individuals initially detained were released after questioning, with the FBI confirming they have no ties to the shooting. The gunman, who fired a single shot from a distance, remains at large, and investigators are processing multiple active crime scenes. The event has been labeled a "political assassination" by Utah's governor, and President Trump has ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff in Kirk's honor.</p>

          <p>Eyewitnesses to the fatal shooting of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk have described a chaotic scene with what they perceived as minimal security. Attendees at the Utah Valley University event noted a lack of stringent measures like bag checks, with some comparing the police presence unfavorably to that at university sporting events. Accounts from the scene detail the moment the shot was fired, the ensuing panic as the crowd scattered, and the shock of seeing Kirk fall.

          <p>A recent Goldman Sachs survey reveals that investment firms for ultra-wealthy families are shifting their portfolio strategies, increasing allocations to public stocks while decreasing investments in private equity. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity holdings dropped to 21%, a significant change over the past two years. Despite concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation, these family offices are maintaining a "pro-risk" stance, often investing opportunistically during market dislocations.

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has drawn widespread condemnation from across the American political spectrum.

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, is facing pressure to clarify the financing of an £885,000 home in his Clacton constituency, which was purchased in his partner's name. A BBC investigation has raised questions about his explanation that his partner, Laure Ferrari, could afford the mortgage-free purchase due to a wealthy family background, as French property records do not appear to support this claim. The arrangement has led to accusations that Farage sought to avoid over £44,000 in second-home stamp duty, a charge he denies while facing criticism for hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic characterizes President Trump's economic agenda, or "Trumponomics," as less of a coherent ideology and more of a personalist formula for control. This approach reportedly involves declaring emergencies to justify interventions, using threats to compel private actors, and demanding tribute in return for relief. The article argues that this erratic style, which blends tax cuts with tariffs and direct corporate interventions, contrasts sharply with disciplined state capitalism, such as China's model. Ultimately, the piece suggests the administration's economic actions are driven by a desire to dominate any situation rather than to achieve specific, consistent policy goals.</p>

          <p>The tradition of teenagers babysitting, once a common rite of passage, has seen a significant decline as the job becomes more professionalized and dominated by adults. This shift is attributed to factors like heightened safety concerns, intensive parenting styles, and busier teen schedules filled with structured extracurricular activities. The article argues that this trend results in a loss for both teenagers and younger children. Teens miss out on valuable opportunities to develop responsibility, confidence, and real-world problem-solving skills, while young kids lose the unique mentorship and playful connection offered by an older, but not-quite-adult, caregiver.</p>

These couples rely on antiretroviral drugs, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and condoms to maintain their health and prevent transmission. Health officials and aid organizations report that the funding gaps have forced them to ration supplies, creating a precarious situation for vulnerable families.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin woman has been charged with two counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle following a crash that killed two Marquette University lacrosse players. Authorities allege that Amandria Brunner, 41, was drunk when she turned her pickup truck into the path of an SUV carrying the students. Scott Michaud and Noah Snyder, both sophomores on the lacrosse team, were pronounced dead at the scene. According to the criminal complaint, Brunner's blood alcohol level was well over the legal limit, and she has four prior convictions for operating while intoxicated.</p>

          <p>Mansfield Town has included striker Lucas Akins in its official squad list for the season, despite the player currently serving a 14-month prison sentence. Akins was jailed in April for causing the death of a cyclist by careless driving.

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's assassination, some of the conservative activist's supporters have directed blame towards the animated show "South Park." They point to a recent episode that parodied Kirk's campus debate format, suggesting it fomented hatred that may have contributed to the shooting. Kirk himself had previously described the episode as "hilarious" in a social media post. This theory is one of several circulating online as authorities continue to search for the shooter and have not yet identified a motive for the killing.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in a keynote speech to the country's ambassadors, has stressed that foreign policy is now more critical than ever for Germany. He described a new systemic conflict between liberal democracies and an "axis of autocracies," primarily China and Russia, that puts the existing world order under pressure. Merz argued that Germany can no longer afford an isolationist attitude and must take on greater responsibility on the international stage. This includes pursuing an interest-based foreign policy that supports the nation's export-driven economy and its geostrategic position within Europe.</p>

          <p>The Football Association has charged Chelsea FC with 74 alleged rule breaches concerning payments to agents between 2009 and 2022. The charges largely relate to the period when the club was owned by Roman Abramovich. The potential breaches, which involve agents, intermediaries, and third-party investments, were self-reported by the club's new ownership group after they took control in 2022. Chelsea faces potential sanctions including fines, a transfer embargo, or a points deduction, though their cooperation with the investigation will likely be considered a mitigating factor.</p>

          <p>In a first-of-its-kind ruling in Europe, a Spanish court has sided with residents of Galicia who sued regional authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The claimants argued that nitrate runoff from farm waste has contaminated drinking water, destroyed the local ecosystem, and violated their human rights. The court ordered authorities to compensate the residents, clean up the polluted Lima River, and implement preventative measures. The case, which successfully linked the environmental damage directly to the farms, could set a legal precedent for similar challenges across Europe.</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency, NASA, has barred Chinese citizens from accessing its facilities, systems, and networks, effectively preventing them from working on its programs. The move, confirmed by NASA, is intended to "ensure the security of our work" amid an escalating space race and growing national security concerns between the U.S. and China. This restriction further curtails scientific collaboration between the two nations, as Chinese astronauts are already excluded from the International Space Station due to U.S. law.
