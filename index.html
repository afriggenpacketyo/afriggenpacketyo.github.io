          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has detailed his vision for developing "personal superintelligence," framing it as a tool for individual empowerment rather than large-scale automation that replaces human roles. This announcement comes as Meta invests billions into AI, including hiring top talent from competitors like OpenAI and Google to staff its new Superintelligence Labs. The strategy is reminiscent of Meta's massive spending on the metaverse, which has accumulated over $60 billion in losses. Zuckerberg's letter aims to define the company's direction in the competitive AI landscape, positioning its development as a pivotal choice for society's future.</p>

          <p>Former and current NATO employees are publicly criticizing a major reorganization initiated by new Secretary-General Mark Rutte, labeling it an attempt to appease the Trump administration. Critics allege that key sections, such as those for Women, Peace, and Security and Climate Security, are being downgraded or merged to reduce their visibility, mirroring White House priorities. While NATO leadership defends the changes as necessary "optimization" for a more dangerous world, some staff report being discouraged from highlighting their work on these sensitive topics, raising fears about the alliance's long-term interests and public outreach capabilities.</p>

          <p>A freed British-Israeli hostage, Doron Damari, has sharply criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, arguing it "risks rewarding terror." Damari, who was abducted by Hamas on October 7, stated the move sends a dangerous message that violence earns legitimacy and could prolong the conflict by emboldening extremists. Her comments echo concerns from lawyers representing other British hostage families, who fear the policy may disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining hostages. Starmer announced the plan citing the "intolerable situation" in Gaza and the need to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting is expected to maintain current interest rates, but the decision is surrounded by significant internal and external pressures. Two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have publicly advocated for a rate cut, creating the potential for the first multiple-governor dissent since 1993. This division occurs amid sustained criticism from President Trump, who has demanded rate cuts and recently made a controversial visit to the Fed's headquarters. While Chair Jerome Powell is likely to hold rates steady, he faces the complex task of justifying the decision against a backdrop of dissenting colleagues and intense political scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old student, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, has been found guilty of assaulting two female police officers during a violent altercation at Manchester Airport in July of last year. The incident, captured on mobile phones, showed Amaaz punching one officer, breaking her nose, and knocking another to the ground. The jury convicted him of assault causing actual bodily harm and assault of an emergency worker, though they could not reach a verdict on a separate assault charge against another officer. The case highlights the risks officers face, with the Greater Manchester Police Federation noting that 35 officers are assaulted in the region every week.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated a significant rebound in the second quarter, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growing at a 3% annualized rate and surpassing economists' expectations. This growth marks a sharp reversal from the 0.5% contraction observed in the first quarter of 2025. However, experts caution that the headline figure is heavily skewed by a substantial decrease in imports, a direct consequence of the Trump administration's tariff policies. While consumer spending showed a modest increase, underlying indicators suggest that domestic demand is weakening, pointing to a cooling but still resilient economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of high-income American households are falling behind on credit card and auto loan payments, signaling that financial stress is affecting even those earning over $150,000 a year. According to data from VantageScore, delinquencies for this group have more than doubled since 2023, a faster rate of increase than for middle and low-income households. Economists attribute this trend to a weaker job market for white-collar workers and rising housing costs, which are eroding the financial cushion wealthier Americans previously enjoyed. This development raises concerns about broader economic health, as high-earner consumption now drives about half of all U.S. consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8-magnitude quake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula did not generate the catastrophic tsunami many had feared. Scientists explain that several factors likely contributed to the less severe outcome, including the specific mechanics of the fault rupture and the local seafloor topography, which shapes how tsunami waves build and travel. While the quake did displace a massive amount of water, the resulting waves were not as high as those in the 2004 Indian Ocean or 2011 Japan tsunamis. The effectiveness of modern early warning systems across the Pacific also played a crucial role in allowing for timely evacuations.</p>

          <h2>A Journalist's Perspective on Traveling with President Trump's Demanding Press Operations</h2>

          <p>A journalist from The Telegraph provides a behind-the-scenes look at the experience of traveling with President Trump's press pool, describing it as a whirlwind of constant access and high-stakes questioning. Over five days, the president turned six scheduled events into impromptu press conferences, taking questions for nearly three hours on topics ranging from Gaza to trade deals. This approach gives reporters extraordinary insight but also ensures Trump retains control over the narrative, as demonstrated by the exclusion of a Wall Street Journal reporter from the trip. The article contrasts this level of engagement with that of other administrations, highlighting a uniquely demanding media strategy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has abruptly dropped its entire case against restaurant company Fat Brands and its chairman, Andy Wiederhorn. They were indicted in May 2024 on charges of wire fraud and tax evasion related to an alleged $47 million sham loan scheme. The reversal comes months after a shake-up at the DOJ, which included the firing of the assistant U.S. attorney who had led the prosecution. Wiederhorn, who has maintained his innocence, still faces a separate civil complaint from the SEC over the same alleged conduct, but the dismissal of the criminal charges caused the company's shares to climb.</p>

          <p>A former senior CIA officer, Susan Miller, has forcefully pushed back against claims by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that the Obama administration orchestrated a "treasonous conspiracy" against Donald Trump. Miller, who led the 2016 Russia interference assessment, stated that Gabbard's allegations are based on falsehoods and a fundamental misunderstanding of intelligence tradecraft. She affirmed that the intelligence community's conclusion of Russian interference on Trump's behalf was based on multiple verified sources and was not politically motivated. Miller's remarks come as she and her former team have hired lawyers to defend against potential charges stemming from Gabbard's renewed inquiry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. rental market is showing signs of cooling as a massive influx of new apartment supply continues to outpace demand, pushing the national vacancy rate to a record 7.1% in July. According to a new report from Apartment List, national median rent was flat for the month and down 0.8% compared to a year ago, with rent growth stalling during the typically busy summer moving season. The softest markets are concentrated in the South and Mountain West, with Austin, Texas, seeing the steepest year-over-year rent decline.

For consumers, the bill would mandate that call center workers disclose their physical location and any use of AI, while also giving callers the right to be transferred to a U.S.-based agent.

These camps offer adults, typically 21 and over, a chance to disconnect, meet new people, and relive nostalgic childhood activities like rock climbing and waterfront sports, often with the addition of alcohol. Camp owners attribute the trend to a collective yearning for simplicity and community in an increasingly complicated world, especially as rates of worker burnout and loneliness reach all-time highs. For an average price of around $800, campers can enjoy a weekend of planned activities and social connection.</p>

The aggressive gerrymander, drawn at the urging of President Trump, consolidates Democratic voters and redraws boundaries in south Texas to capitalize on recent GOP gains with Hispanic voters. If the map had been in place for the 2024 election, Trump would have won 30 of the state's 38 districts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's sustained public attacks and pressure campaign against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president is constrained from firing him by the likely negative market reaction. An attempt to remove Powell would be legally dubious and would flout the historical norm of central bank independence, a principle designed to prevent politically motivated monetary policy. Such a move would almost certainly trigger chaos in financial markets, leading to higher interest rates—the exact opposite of what Trump desires. This dynamic creates a powerful check on the president, as even he cannot afford the economic instability that would result from such a move.</p>
