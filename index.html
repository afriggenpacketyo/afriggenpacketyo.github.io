          <p>Jens Spahn, a leading politician from Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary group, has called for Germany to gain access to nuclear weapons as part of a European deterrent.

He suggested Germany should participate in the nuclear arsenals of France and Great Britain to ensure Europe's ability to deter threats.

          <p>Cities in eastern Germany, such as Dessau, are witnessing a significant spread of right-wing extremism and nationalism among young people. Social workers and residents report that Nazi symbols and slogans have become a "cool" part of pop culture for some youths, with the Hitler salute and xenophobic chants becoming normalized in schools and at parties. This trend is occurring in a region that has struggled with economic decline and depopulation since reunification. The far-right AfD party has gained considerable political strength in the area.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) remained in contraction territory for the third straight month in June, signaling persistent weakness in the industrial sector. The PMI registered 49.7, just below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction, though it was a slight improvement from May. While production and new orders showed some improvement, manufacturers are still grappling with a price war and sluggish consumer demand, highlighting ongoing deflationary pressures in the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>China has announced a conditional and partial lifting of its blanket ban on Japanese seafood, which was implemented in 2023 following the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and recent studies are exploring the cause. Research from Chinese universities suggests that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a key factor. This system creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness in passengers. The findings highlight an unexpected challenge in the transition to new energy vehicles, affecting passenger comfort and health.</p>

Guardiola acknowledged the arguments made by other managers about the relentless schedule but noted that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by football's governing bodies.
