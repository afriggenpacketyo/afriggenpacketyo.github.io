            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the controversy surrounding his use of Signal to discuss military operations, specifically an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen, with individuals outside the Defense Department, including his wife and brother. Hegseth dismissed concerns as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees and asserted that he and President Trump are "on the same page" regarding his work at the Pentagon. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Hegseth, attributing the leaks to former employees and affirming the president's support for the defense secretary. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is currently reviewing Hegseth's use of Signal to discuss military actions.</p>

            <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the struggling U.S. shipbuilding industry, which lags far behind China. The order includes developing a Maritime Action Plan and addressing China's anti-competitive practices. Experts suggest that simply increasing funding won't solve the problem and that driving higher demand for U.S.-built ships is also necessary. The U.S. is significantly behind China in shipbuilding, responsible for only 0.1% of global shipbuilding compared to China's 50%. The Jones Act, a century-old law, requires U.S. ships to carry cargo between U.S. ports, which some experts claim hampers the U.S. shipbuilding industry.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned against trade agreements that undermine its interests, as the Trump administration negotiates trade deals with other countries. China's commerce ministry stated it respects efforts to resolve trade disputes with the U.S. through consultation but will take countermeasures if any deals harm China's interests. This warning follows reports that Trump intends to use tariff negotiations to isolate China, even as he expresses a desire for a deal with Beijing. Recently, Trump significantly raised tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory tariffs from China on U.S. goods.</p>

            <p>President Trump has intensified his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of a potential economic slowdown if interest rates are not immediately lowered. Trump asserts that there is virtually no inflation in the U.S. and that energy costs are declining. This latest attack comes as Trump's team explores the legality of firing Powell before his term expires in May 2026. Experts suggest that any attempt to remove Powell would likely trigger a steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets.</p>

Preliminary data suggests a decrease in synthetic opioid overdose deaths in California for the first time since 2018. Newsom's plan also includes placing naloxone in middle and high schools and potentially requiring workplaces to stock it in first aid kits by 2028.</p>

            <p>Enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, reflecting concerns about the safety and credibility of US assets, according to a survey by Renmin University's International Monetary Institute. The weakening dominance of the US dollar, exacerbated by new US administration policies, has created a favorable environment for the yuan's internationalization. Survey results indicate a rising percentage of enterprises planning to increase yuan settlements. A finance professor at Fudan University noted that global capital has not been flowing to the US during recent market turbulence, unlike in previous instances.</p>

            <p>Gold prices have reached a new record, breaking $3,400, as President Trump's threats against the Federal Reserve's independence shake investor confidence in the U.S. economy. Gold futures jumped, driven by investors buying the precious metal as the dollar hit a three-year low. Trump has ramped up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, leading to concerns about the central bank's autonomy. Citi analysts anticipate gold prices rallying further, projecting $3,500 over the next three months due to strong demand from central banks and institutions (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to the lowest point of his presidency, driven by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals that economic optimism has waned since Trump's election in 2024, with more Americans now anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents have become significantly more negative on his economic policies. The public disapproves of Trump's handling of inflation and federal government spending.</p>
