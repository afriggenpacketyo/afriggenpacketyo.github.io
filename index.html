          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation restricting entry into the U.S. for travelers and immigrants from a dozen countries, citing national security concerns related to terrorism, inadequate vetting, and lack of cooperation on deportations. The ban fully restricts individuals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while partially suspending entry for those from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Exemptions exist for U.S. permanent residents, Afghans who assisted American forces, diplomats, athletes, and dual nationals. This action follows a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, involving an Egyptian national who overstayed his visa, and echoes similar travel bans issued during Trump's first term. Optimism for this event is relatively low given the nature of the ban.</p>

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from studying at Harvard University, claiming the school is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs and citing concerns about ties to researchers based in China. The order suspends the entry of foreign students unless their entry is deemed in the national interest, and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking existing visas. This move escalates the administration's ongoing feud with Harvard, which has included attempts to cut off federal funding and accusations of failing to address antisemitism on campus. The administration has also been cracking down on international students more broadly, with increased vetting and visa revocations for those linked to pro-Palestinian activism. This event has low optimism because of the implications for international students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents, alleging a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline. The investigation aims to determine if Biden's aides used the autopen secretly, which Trump claims would have implications for the legality of numerous executive actions. Trump has previously suggested that pardons issued by Biden were illegitimate due to the alleged autopen use, despite legal experts stating that such pardons cannot be revoked. The scrutiny over Biden's mental acuity has increased recently, amid reporting about his exit from the 2024 presidential race. The implications of this investigation are uncertain, so the optimism score is relatively neutral.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their high school campus earlier in the year. The event was described as bittersweet, as students honored the opportunity to graduate at the Bowl, a storied venue, but lamented not being able to use their traditional Stadium by the Sea. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal addressed the graduates, acknowledging the adversity they faced and encouraging them to find growth and joy amidst the challenges. The ceremony was made possible by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which gifted the venue to the school, and included traditional elements like student performances and speeches. This event is relatively optimistic due to the students overcoming adversity.</p>

The full ban applies to nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, while the partial ban affects those from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. This ban is the result of an executive order Trump signed on his first day back in the White House, and mirrors similar bans enacted during his first term.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The study, which examined feathers dating back 99 million years, revealed how feathers evolved during the Cretaceous period. An essential feature of bird evolution was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly. The implications of this study are relatively optimistic.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging that top aides masked his predecessor’s ‘cognitive decline’. This investigation will build on a Republican-led campaign to discredit the former president and overturn some of his executive actions, including presidential pardons and federal rules issued toward the end of his term in office, that’s already underway. Trump took aim at Biden’s use of an autopen – a mechanical device that is used to replicate a person’s authentic signature, that presidents have used for decades – to sign executive actions. The administration’s investigation will focus on “who ran the United States while President Biden was in office”, according to the memo. The implications of this event are relatively neutral.</p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss injections are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding due to concerns about potential harm to unborn babies. Drug safety experts in the UK emphasize that the effects of medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro on unborn babies are unknown. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice.

The warning comes after President Trump announced new travel bans, with Venezuelans among those affected by partial restrictions. The U.S. is home to an estimated 350,000 Venezuelans, and while court decisions are pending, the Trump administration broadly ended deportation protections for Venezuelans in February.
