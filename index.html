          <h2>Trump Expresses Confidence in Hegseth Amidst Scrutiny Over Signal App Use</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump voiced his support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, despite ongoing concerns about Hegseth's use of the Signal app to share sensitive military information, including with individuals lacking security clearance. In an exclusive ABC News interview, Trump acknowledged having discussed the matter with Hegseth, emphasizing Hegseth's talent and potential. However, Trump stopped short of offering complete confidence, stating that he doesn't have 100% confidence in anything. The controversy stems from reports that Hegseth used Signal to communicate detailed plans for a military attack, raising questions about security protocols and information handling within the administration.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, facing scrutiny for allegedly mishandling classified military information, accompanied President Trump on a trip to Michigan, seemingly as a show of support. During a speech at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Trump praised Hegseth's performance, while Hegseth lauded Trump for rebuilding the military and restoring the warrior ethos. Hegseth's tenure has been marked by controversy, including allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual assault, and the use of the Signal app to share sensitive information. Hegseth has also ended a Defense Department program aimed at bolstering the participation of women in helping to resolve overseas conflicts, calling the effort a “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative.”</p>

          <p>In a closely watched election, Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured 169 out of 343 seats in Parliament, requiring support from other parties to govern effectively. The election was largely influenced by President Trump's economic and sovereignty threats towards Canada, including tariffs and annexation proposals. Carney, who campaigned as an anti-Trump candidate, warned of difficult times ahead and vowed to protect Canada's interests. The Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, suffered a significant defeat, with Poilievre losing his seat after holding it for 20 years, potentially triggering a leadership battle within the party. This New York Times article reports that Carney and Trump spoke by phone and agreed to meet soon.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Eases Some Automotive Tariffs Amid Industry Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 18:30:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order modifying some of the automotive tariffs imposed earlier in the month, addressing concerns from carmakers about rising production costs and squeezed profits. The changes aim to reduce the overall tariff burden by preventing tariffs on steel and aluminum from stacking on top of import tariffs. Automakers assembling cars in the U.S. will also be eligible for partial reimbursements on tariffs for imported components for two years. While the move provides some relief, a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts remains in place, and General Motors abandoned its profit growth forecast due to the uncertainty created by the trade policies. This New York Times article indicates that these changes stemmed from direct conversations with domestic automakers.</p>

          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop after the company announced better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties. The company pointed to potential constraints on advertising demand due to President Trump's evolving trade plans and the end of the de minimis exemption. Snap reported a net loss of $140 million, although daily active users increased to 460 million. The company is facing challenges similar to other tech firms amidst global trade uncertainty, leading to concerns about advertising spending. The company cited potential constraints on advertising demand as the reason for holding off on guidance.</p>

          <p>The Senate confirmed two of President Trump's diplomatic nominees, Tom Barrack as ambassador to Turkey and Warren Stephens as ambassador to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. The confirmation of these nominees comes as Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets, awaits a late-night vote on his nomination as ambassador to Italy and San Marino. Barrack's nomination passed by 60-36, while Stephens was confirmed 59-39, reflecting bipartisan support for these appointments. Fertitta is a GOP donor and has spoken fondly of Trump’s business sense. Barrack is fluent in Arabic and would therefore fit well with a Turkish ambassadorship.</p>

          <p>A federal judge condemned the Trump administration's termination of immigration records for thousands of foreign students as "arbitrary and capricious," demanding detailed explanations for the actions. The ruling came during a hearing for a student from India, Akshar Patel, whose SEVIS record was terminated based on a speeding ticket. The judge questioned the administration's process of mass terminations without individualized determinations, highlighting the "utter lack of concern for human individuals." While Patel's legal status as a student has not been terminated, lawyers representing other affected international students have said some schools saw it as more than a red flag -- thinking this meant their students needed to leave the country.</p>

The article in The Guardian highlights the end of the postwar order. As Trump has retreated from Europe, he has increasingly thrown the US’s weight around the western hemisphere.

          <p>The Chinese aircraft carrier Shandong made rare transits north of the Philippines within a week, in what analysts called a "show of force" as US and Philippine forces held joint drills in the area. The Shandong's passage through the Luzon Strait underscores Beijing's resolve to break through the first island chain. The exercises were conducted within Philippine waters, stretching from around Subic Bay to northern Luzon – close to where the Shandong was spotted. Aircraft on board the carrier conducted roughly 130 take-off and landing drills between Wednesday and Friday, according to the ministry.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is "doomed to fail". In a new report, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change. The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors. Reform UK has opposed net zero emissions by 2050. Downing Street said it would not be changing course.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. The proposal, aimed at addressing the root causes of rising college costs, would replace existing plans with a single "repayment assistance plan" that calculates monthly payments based on adjusted gross income. The plan would also limit Pell grants, scrap Grad PLUS loans, and require undergraduate students to take out their maximum loan amount before parents can access Parent PLUS loans. The Student Borrower Protection Center estimates that a typical borrower with a bachelor's degree would pay almost $3,000 more per year under the Republican plan.</p>

The findings come as Harvard is being scrutinized by the Trump administration over accusations of antisemitism and is fighting the administration’s withdrawal of billions of dollars in federal funding.

          <p>President Donald Trump has completed his first 100 days of his nonconsecutive second term, marked by a series of significant policy changes and visual moments. The president kicked off his nonconsecutive second term on Jan. 20 with a promise to usher in "the golden age of America." He has leaned heavily on the use of executive orders, implementing an unpredictable tariff regime and pushing for mass deportations. He has also worked to carry out an increasingly controversial mass deportation policy and, with the help of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, a plan to drastically downsize the federal government by slashing whole departments and firing thousands of workers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring ways to encourage Americans to marry and have more children, including a potential lump-sum “baby bonus”. The proposals have ranged from ridiculous (reserving Fulbright scholarships for married applicants or those with children) to unnerving, like awarding a “National Medal of Motherhood” to women with six or more children, a tradition once embraced by Nazi Germany. One idea Trump might be more likely to endorse is a lump-sum “baby bonus” — the Times floated a proposal for a $5,000 payment to mothers after giving birth — which Trump recently said “sounds like a good idea.” Despite potential benefits, there are concerns that such a bonus could bolster a political agenda focused on traditional gender roles and reproductive oppression.</p>
