          <p>Heavy rainfall in central Texas has led to what officials are calling a "catastrophic" flash flooding event, resulting in at least 24 deaths, including children. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically in a short period, inundating nearby areas and leaving numerous people unaccounted for, among them approximately 23 girls from a summer camp. Emergency responders are conducting extensive search and rescue operations via helicopter and boat amidst the devastation. The National Weather Service issued a "particularly dangerous situation" warning, noting that the rainfall far exceeded initial forecasts.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Vice President JD Vance's first six months in office highlights his central role in advancing the Trump administration's agenda. He was instrumental in passing a major tax and spending bill by negotiating with congressional holdouts and casting tie-breaking votes in the Senate. Beyond domestic policy, Vance has also become a key defender of President Trump's foreign policy decisions, including actions concerning Iran and Yemen, despite his previous non-interventionist stance. The article suggests Vance is uniquely positioned for a potential 2028 presidential run, serving as both a key operator for Trump and the RNC chair.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists and hairstylists are advising against going to bed with wet hair, citing several health and cosmetic risks. When hair is wet, it becomes more fragile and susceptible to breakage from friction against a pillowcase, leading to split ends and long-term damage. Furthermore, the damp, warm environment created on the scalp overnight is an ideal breeding ground for fungi and bacteria. This can lead to scalp irritation, dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, or folliculitis, while also potentially transferring bacteria to pillowcases and contributing to facial skin breakouts.</p>

          <p>A new appointee to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Vicky Pebsworth, has a decades-long history of arguing that vaccines cause autism, a claim widely refuted by scientific evidence. Pebsworth, a registered nurse, was selected by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. after he fired all previous committee members. Her appointment has drawn criticism from medical experts who point to her leadership role in the National Vaccine Information Center, an early anti-vaccine organization. This move is seen as part of a broader effort to reshape the influential panel with ideological allies, raising concerns about the future of U.S. vaccine policy.</p>

          <p>Writing from Tehran, an Iranian academic describes how recent Israeli attacks have shifted public opinion, uniting disparate factions under a banner of patriotism. The author argues that as civilian casualties mounted, initial indifference or even support for strikes against the IRGC transformed into widespread resentment of foreign aggression. This shift was reportedly amplified by the West's response, which is perceived as hypocritical and dismissive of Iranian lives, fueling deep mistrust. The article suggests this experience has damaged Europe's moral standing and is causing even ordinary Iranians to consider the necessity of a nuclear deterrent.</p>

          <p>Democrats are positioning themselves to leverage President Trump's major tax-and-spending bill as a key issue for the 2026 midterm elections. They are focusing their messaging on the bill's nearly $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which they frame as an assault on healthcare for millions of low-income and elderly Americans. While the bill is currently unpopular in polls, Republicans are highlighting provisions like work requirements, which have more public support. The political battle will likely depend on how each side frames the debate, with Democrats pointing to tangible healthcare losses and Republicans arguing against a tax increase.</p>

The article draws parallels between Trump's use of the combat sport and the tactics of 20th-century fascist regimes, which used spectacle and displays of masculinity to project strength and nationalism. The author argues that Trump's close relationship with UFC CEO Dana White has intertwined the promotion with MAGA mythology, using it to cultivate a strongman image. This event is presented as the culmination of a presidency that blurs entertainment with confrontational politics.</p>

The two projects are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes.

However, another study dismantled this explanation for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects non-human animals and even people blind from birth.

          <p>Authorities have found human remains at the site of a massive explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The Yolo County coroner's office made the discovery after gaining access to the devastated property, though no positive identifications have been made. Seven people were reported unaccounted for following the incident at the Devastating Pyrotechnics facility on July 1. The explosion triggered a large fire that destroyed multiple structures and burned approximately 80 acres. Investigations have revealed the warehouse was operating without the required local licenses to store commercial fireworks on the agricultural property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue in mice by activating what they describe as a disabled "genetic switch." The study, published in the journal 'Science,' found that the mice's inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this pathway, scientists were able to achieve complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application remains a distant goal, the findings offer significant hope and provide a new direction for research into organ regeneration in mammals.</p>

          <p>Supporter groups for the LA Galaxy staged a protest during their July 4th match to express frustration over the club's silence regarding recent ICE immigration raids in Southern California. The Angel City Brigade, a prominent fan group, organized a walkout at the 12th minute of the game, while other groups protested silently without their usual drums and chants. Fans displayed banners with messages like "Stop the Raids" and "Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants." The protest highlights the disconnect between the club, which has a large Latino fanbase, and its community's concerns, especially as other local teams have publicly supported immigrant families.</p>

          <p>Pride events across the United Kingdom, including the major Pride in London parade, are facing significant financial challenges due to a sharp decline in corporate funding and a drop in volunteer numbers. A survey of UK Pride organizers revealed that over 85 have seen a reduction in sponsorships, forcing some to cancel, scale back, or begin charging for previously free events. Organizers attribute the funding drop to a pullback in corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, particularly from US-based global companies. Despite these struggles, community organizers remain resilient and committed to continuing the Pride movement.</p>

While President Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon, sources indicate that Hamas is still seeking guarantees regarding a full Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. The development marks a potentially significant step in the nearly two-year-long conflict, though key details remain under negotiation.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President William Lai Ching-te is facing a dilemma over how to commemorate the legacy of World War II while promoting a distinct Taiwanese identity. His administration's approach has drawn criticism for honoring the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory over Japan without fully acknowledging its pre-1949 mainland Chinese roots. This reflects the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's broader political stance, which emphasizes Taiwan's separation from the mainland. The issue highlights the ongoing tension between the historical legacy of the ROC, which relocated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, and the modern push for a separate Taiwanese consciousness.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that to understand Donald Trump's style of governance, one should look to the dictatorships of Cold War-era Africa, many of which were supported by the U.S. The author draws parallels between Trump's actions and those of figures like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin, citing tactics such as loyalty demands, geographical renaming, and the use of military force against domestic dissent. The article suggests that the embrace of egomania, anti-intellectualism, and theatrical economic policies in the U.S. reflects a political model that America once fostered abroad and is now seeing come home.</p>

While the patient's experience was positive, his surgeon warns that AI can be unreliable and should not replace professional medical advice.
