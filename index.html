          <p>Paris Saint-Germain won its first Champions League title, defeating Inter Milan 5-0, marking a significant achievement for Qatari Sports Investments, which has owned the club since 2011. Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi celebrated the victory as vindication of their long-term project, overcoming past disappointments and player departures. The win took place in Munich, with Qatar Airways advertising prominently displayed, a controversial relationship due to human rights concerns. Despite fan protests against Qatari ownership, PSG fans largely embraced the success, focusing on the team's performance and the influx of talent, highlighting the blend of big-money signings and homegrown players.</p>

          <p>Kesha replaced the AI-generated cover art for her single "Delusional" with a photograph of herself after facing backlash from fans. The original cover, featuring AI-created imagery, was intended to highlight the undervaluation of artists, but Kesha decided to prioritize her integrity over making a political statement. The new cover features Kesha zip-tied to a chair, photographed by Brendan Walter, and credits her entire human creative team. "Delusional" is the second single from her upcoming album "Period," marking her first release under her independent label after parting ways with RCA and Kemosabe Records.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in its upcoming Spending Review, particularly regarding the NHS and unprotected areas like schools and the criminal justice system. The IFS noted that spending was front-loaded earlier in the parliamentary term, leading to a slowdown in future funding increases. The level of health spending will significantly impact potential cuts to other departments, especially given the government's commitments to prioritize reducing patient waiting times and improving dental care. The government has committed to increasing defense spending, which will necessitate cuts elsewhere. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes came into effect across the UK on Sunday, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops can no longer stock disposable vapes but can still sell rechargeable or refillable devices, and retailers violating the ban face fines. Disposable vapes have been identified as a key factor in the rise of youth vaping, contributing to environmental waste with millions of vapes discarded annually. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping.</p>

          <p>Following a 5-0 defeat by Paris St-Germain in the Champions League final, Inter Milan faces pressure to rebuild its squad with younger players. Inter coach Inzaghi acknowledged the need for new signings, mentioning the acquisition of Dinamo Zagreb midfielder Petar Sucic and the potential addition of Marseille winger Luis Henrique. The team's older average age, compared to PSG, was evident during the match, and PSG's pace and energy overwhelmed them. Despite Inzaghi's successful track record, his future with the club remains uncertain, and he did not commit to staying for the Club World Cup.</p>

The single-match format in the league stage reduced pressure on teams and allowed for more surprising results, such as Aston Villa's win against Bayern Munich. PSG's journey to the title, overcoming early losses to secure a playoff spot, demonstrated that finding form at the right time is crucial.

          <p>The US sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal after a report by the UN nuclear watchdog indicated Iran had increased its production of enriched uranium. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi confirmed receiving the proposal from his Omani counterpart, while White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt urged Iran to accept the deal. The IAEA report revealed Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, nearing weapons-grade levels, making it the only non-nuclear-armed state producing uranium at this level. The US proposal aims to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.</p>

The analysis of communication data revealed that the distribution of quantum keys from Micius was insecure, posing a risk to China's expanding quantum communication network.
