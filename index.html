        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 mark, driven by investors seeking refuge from stock market volatility and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency experienced a notable 4.8% increase, reaching $91,563.27, fueled by substantial inflows into U.S. ETFs tracking spot Bitcoin prices. Analysts attribute Bitcoin's resilience to its decoupling from traditional risk assets, although trading volumes remain light. Chart analysts indicate that overcoming the $88,000 resistance level signals a positive outlook, with the next target near $95,900 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a reorganization of the State Department, aiming to reduce staffing and consolidate domestic offices. The plan involves undersecretaries presenting proposals to eliminate positions, potentially cutting personnel by 22%. The reorganization targets offices related to human rights, democracy promotion, extremism countering, and war crimes prevention, though the department assures these functions will be absorbed elsewhere. Rubio argues the State Department has become bloated and ineffective, prioritizing radical ideology over American interests, with these changes intended to streamline operations and refocus on core diplomatic missions.</p>

          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decline by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on China, impacting Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein who are major advertisers on Facebook and Instagram.

Signs of reduced advertising spending are already emerging, and a broader economic recession could exacerbate the impact, potentially wiping out $23 billion in Meta's 2025 advertising revenues.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's sweeping tariffs could severely impact the global economy, potentially triggering a trade war. The IMF lowered its global growth forecast for the year to 2.8% and slashed its U.S. growth forecast to 1.8%. The organization noted the surge in policy uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs, warning that sustained trade tensions will significantly slow global growth. Investors fear retaliation from targeted countries and a potential decline in the U.S.'s status as a safe haven.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to end the IRS's Direct File program, which saved users an average of $160 in tax preparation fees. The program, launched during the Biden administration, faces opposition from private tax preparation companies that profit from charging users for their software. Democratic lawmakers are urging Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to keep Direct File open, while the IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, potentially eliminating up to 40% of its workforce.</p>

However, critics caution against relying on the exchange rate to suppress inflation and point to severe cuts in wages, education, and public infrastructure, leading to mixed results for Argentinians.</p>
