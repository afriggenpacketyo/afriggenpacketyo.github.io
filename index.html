        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state. The suit alleges the social media platform intentionally uses addictive design features to exploit young users, keeping them engaged longer for advertising and e-commerce purposes. TikTok has refuted the claims as outdated, highlighting its safety features for teens. This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges against tech companies focusing on platform design rather than user-generated content, as TikTok also navigates a potential U.S. ban or sale.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of its R&D team. This move is part of an ongoing "talent war" among major tech companies seeking to dominate the artificial intelligence space. While Google is not investing in Windsurf, it will gain a nonexclusive license to some of its technology, which is popular for "vibe coding." This type of talent acquisition, where key personnel are hired without a full company purchase, has also been used by Microsoft and Amazon to bolster their AI capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: NYC Mayor's Mask Ban is a Necessary Public Safety Measure, Not a Free Speech Violation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 18:58:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that New York City Mayor Eric Adams's policy banning face masks in certain public areas is a constitutional and sensible public safety measure. The author contends that the ban is not about suppressing speech but about preventing individuals from using anonymity to commit crimes, such as antisemitic vandalism or flash mob robberies. Citing legal precedent, the article asserts there is no constitutional right to conceal one's identity during public demonstrations. The measure is framed as a responsible effort to balance liberty with security, ensuring public protest remains public and accountable.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, after a temporary halt on critical arms shipments last week. The renewal of aid, including Patriot air defense systems, comes after a surge in Russian drone and missile attacks that have caused record civilian casualties. The new arrangement involves NATO purchasing Patriot systems from the U.S. and then distributing them to Ukraine, with some European allies helping to fund the costs. This development occurs as the U.S. administration expresses growing frustration over the lack of progress toward a negotiated peace.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the deadly Air India crash in Ahmedabad found that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines were flipped moments after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel, leading to a loss of thrust and the subsequent crash, which killed 270 people, including 29 on the ground. According to the cockpit voice recorder, one pilot was heard asking the other why he had cut the fuel, with the other pilot denying he had done so. The report does not assign blame but focuses on the switch activation, suggesting no initial mechanical fault with the Boeing 787-8 or its engines.</p>

          <p>Pressure is mounting on the Whittier City Council to respond more urgently to federal immigration raids that have instilled fear in the community. Prominent officials, including LA County Supervisor Janice Hahn and Congresswoman Linda Sánchez, have criticized the council for its perceived lack of action. A proposal was introduced to require ICE agents to be identifiable and unmasked during operations, but the council delayed a decision for a month to study its feasibility. This delay has angered residents and local leaders, who argue that the fear and trauma being experienced by the immigrant community constitute an emergency that cannot wait.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if President Trump follows through on a threat to levy a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. Trump's threat is linked to his opposition to the criminal trial of his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, which he has called a "witch hunt." President Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will invoke its reciprocity law, matching the U.S. tariff rate. This development risks a trade war between the two largest economies in the Americas, escalating tensions over U.S. interference in Brazil's domestic politics.</p>

          <p>This article explores the deep cultural significance of Camp Mystic, the 99-year-old Christian girls' camp devastated by last week's Texas floods. For generations of Texas women, Mystic was a cherished institution representing freedom, faith, and lifelong friendships, a place where many mothers enrolled their daughters at birth. The author reflects on the profound shock and grief within this tight-knit community as it grapples with how such an unprecedented catastrophe could occur in a place that always felt safe and divinely protected. The tragedy has forced a painful confrontation between the community's deep faith and the seemingly random cruelty of the disaster.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable achievement for a player who took an indefinite break from the sport in 2023. Citing burnout and mental health struggles, the former teen prodigy stepped away from the tour to prioritize her well-being, a move some warned could end her career at the top level. Her run to the final, which included a semifinal victory over the world's top-ranked player, marks a powerful comeback. It validates her decision to prioritize her mental health and proves a return to elite form is possible.</p>

          <p>Activists and civil rights attorneys accuse Los Angeles law enforcement of improperly using "less-lethal" weapons like projectiles and flash bangs against peaceful protesters during recent anti-ICE demonstrations. The article highlights the case of Sergio Espejo, who lost a finger after being hit by a police projectile, one of many who claim to have been injured. Critics argue that police are violating their own policies and a state law that restricts the use of such weapons to situations with immediate threats, and prohibits firing them indiscriminately into crowds. The incidents have sparked numerous civil rights claims and complaints against the LAPD and LA Sheriff's Department.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third major heatwave of the year, with temperatures soaring to 34.7C (94.5F) and prompting water restrictions for over seven million people. Yorkshire Water and South East Water have implemented hosepipe bans due to record-level demand for drinking water amid the extended dry, warm weather. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for large parts of England, warning of risks to the entire population.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting more than 1,300 civil and foreign service staff as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The move, which aims to reduce the department's U.S. workforce by about 15%, is part of a plan to streamline the agency by closing or merging offices and consolidating functions. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts. The layoffs are based on whether an employee worked in an office targeted for elimination on a specific date, a method the foreign service union has called "untethered from merit or mission."</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has overturned the mortgage fraud conviction of former Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, but upheld two convictions for perjury. The court ruled that jury instructions in the mortgage fraud case, which related to her purchase of a Florida condo, were improper. However, the two perjury convictions, which stem from her lying about financial hardship to make early withdrawals from her retirement account during the pandemic, will stand. Mosby, who gained a national profile for prosecuting officers in the Freddie Gray case, has maintained her innocence and recently completed a sentence of home confinement.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged past $118,000 to a new all-time high, liquidating $2.42 billion in short positions in the process. Despite the record price, market analysis suggests that the bull run is not being driven by the same speculative mania seen in previous cycles. Key indicators, such as Glassnode's NUPL ratio, remain below the "euphoria" zone, and exchange inflow data from CryptoQuant shows that selling pressure from long-term holders and large "whale" investors remains unusually low. This suggests the current rally is supported by more consistent, long-term buying rather than short-term speculative overheating. (not investment advice)</p>
