          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, revealing a 3.6% drop in U.S. same-store sales, the largest domestic decline since the pandemic's onset, as bad weather and cautious consumer spending affected the company. CEO Chris Kempczinski noted a decrease in traffic from low- and middle-income consumers, indicating broader economic pressures. Despite the U.S. challenges, McDonald's is focusing on value meals and new menu items, such as McCrispy Chicken Strips, to attract customers. The company is maintaining its full-year outlook, planning to open 2,200 locations and invest in capital expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has ruled that transgender women will be banned from competing in women's football starting June 1, a decision praised by some as ensuring safety and fairness. Critics, however, argue that this move will likely cause transgender women to abandon football altogether, as many do not feel safe or comfortable playing in men's leagues. While some former FA officials support the ban, anti-discrimination groups emphasize the need to show solidarity with the trans community. The government has stated that biology matters in women's sports, but it is up to sporting bodies to set their own rules.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has signed an agreement granting the United States control over a portion of its future revenue from natural resources, aiming to secure continued U.S. support amidst its ongoing conflict with Russia. This deal, finalized after months of negotiations, establishes a U.S.-controlled investment fund financed by revenues from new projects in critical minerals, oil, and gas. While past aid to Ukraine won't be treated as debt, future military assistance will require Ukraine to match it with resource wealth. The agreement, awaiting ratification by Ukraine's parliament, seeks to exclude countries adverse to Ukraine, like Russia, from benefiting from the country's reconstruction.</p>

          <p>General Motors has revised its 2025 financial guidance, anticipating a $4 billion to $5 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs, despite some recent tariff adjustments. The revised guidance includes lower net income and adjusted automotive free cash flow, although capital spending targets remain unchanged. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is working to mitigate the increased costs through supply chain adjustments and increased sourcing of U.S. parts. GM expects lower industry sales but stable pricing for the rest of the year and did not indicate plans to raise vehicle prices as a result of the tariffs.</p>

Continuing claims also increased, reaching the highest level since November 2021. A significant portion of the gain came from New York, possibly due to spring recess in public schools. The report follows recent data showing a contraction in GDP during the first quarter, driven by increased imports and cooled consumer spending, however, the longer-term trend remains intact, and economists expect an increase in nonfarm payrolls for April.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly reported strong first-quarter revenue and earnings, driven by high demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound, but lowered its full-year profit guidance due to charges related to acquiring an oral cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. The company maintained its sales guidance, which accounts for existing tariffs but excludes planned levies on pharmaceuticals. CEO Dave Ricks suggested that the threat of tariffs is already incentivizing drugmakers to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Eli Lilly's diabetes treatment Mounjaro and weight loss drug Zepbound both exceeded sales expectations, with shares falling after CVS Health favored Novo Nordisk's Wegovy.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks stated that the company can help address national security concerns related to essential medicines, particularly as pharmaceutical tariffs loom. Ricks acknowledged the validity of national security concerns around cheaper essential drugs, most of which are made overseas, but is unsure if tariffs are the answer. The Trump administration is considering tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing. Ricks noted that pharmaceutical companies are already announcing U.S. manufacturing investments, and also expressed a desire for lower tax rates in the U.S. to incentivize domestic production.</p>

The conversation touches on the complexities of defining right-wing art, the role of religion, and the potential for this counterculture to influence mainstream media and politics.

Moreover, tariffs disproportionately impact low- and middle-income households, potentially slowing economic growth and reigniting inflation. The administration's conflicting goals and back-and-forth on tariffs also undermine its ability to generate a new source of federal revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's deportation program has triggered fear and confusion within the Bhutanese refugee community in the United States. Legal refugees with past criminal records are being detained and deported, leaving families and community leaders grappling for answers. The deportees, now stateless, are being sent to countries where they have no citizenship, and some families have lost contact with their loved ones. The situation is causing widespread PTSD and anxiety within the community.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the minerals deal signed between the United States and Ukraine suggests it could bring significant money into a joint investment fund, but challenges remain regarding extraction and profitability. The deal lacks a security guarantee that Kyiv sought, though it has tied President Trump to Ukraine's future. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the agreement signals the Trump administration's commitment to a free and prosperous Ukraine. While some analysts believe the deal guarantees Mr. Trump’s interest in Ukraine, reaction within the country is mixed.</p>
