          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to strip the institution of its valuable patents derived from federally funded research. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick accused Harvard of violating legal requirements tied to this funding, initiating a "march-in" process that could allow the government to seize the patents. This action intensifies pressure on Harvard, which the administration has already targeted over its handling of campus protests and alleged civil rights violations, leading to a broader dispute over academic freedom.</p>

          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages" that promise relaxation and health benefits is facing scrutiny from nutritionists and dietitians. Brands like Trip, which was recently cited by advertising regulators, claim their drinks containing supplements like L-theanine and Lion's Mane can induce calm. However, experts are skeptical, noting the small quantities of these ingredients are unlikely to produce significant effects and that scientific evidence remains in its infancy. While some see them as a good alternative to alcohol, psychologists suggest any calming effect may be a placebo from the ritual of consumption.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors. For over 50 years, he has sold newspapers on the streets of the Left Bank, becoming a beloved local figure. Despite the decline in print media and sales dropping from 80 copies an hour to around 30 a day, the 72-year-old continues his work for the freedom and joy it brings. President Emmanuel Macron, who once bought papers from him as a student, will present the award.</p>

          <p>Residents of Pampa Clemesí, a village in Peru, live without electricity despite being located next to the country's largest solar complex. The Rubí and Clemesí plants can power over 350,000 homes, yet the 150 villagers rely on torches and makeshift stoves. While the plant's operator, Orygen, has funded infrastructure to connect the village, the final step of wiring individual homes is a government responsibility that remains unfulfilled. This paradox highlights a broader issue in Peru where infrastructure development often bypasses remote, sparsely populated communities.</p>

          <p>The Frederick County Board of Education is updating its policies to comply with a new Maryland state law requiring schools to facilitate student telehealth appointments during the school day. The policy, set for the 2025-26 school year, allows students to use a designated, supervised space for virtual medical or mental health visits. Schools will not provide care but will ensure equitable access, with parents required to schedule the appointments. The measure aims to help students access necessary healthcare with minimal disruption to their education.</p>

The event, which has run for nearly 50 years, celebrates unique canine beauty and promotes adoption, as many contestants are rescued from shelters.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who had been released by Rhode Island authorities despite an active ICE detainer. The man, Josue Santiago Perez Gomez, faces multiple charges related to child sex crimes, including patronizing a minor for commercial sexual activity. ICE officials criticized the local police for releasing Perez Gomez just hours after his initial arrest, stating he posed a clear threat to the community. He will now remain in ICE custody pending his removal proceedings.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Qatar's prime minister in Spain to discuss a new Egyptian-Qatari proposal aimed at ending the war in Gaza.

          <p>A man in Leicestershire was wrongly issued a £165 parking charge after an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system confused his car with another vehicle.

          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran's recent statement that he identifies as "culturally Irish" has ignited a social media debate about heritage and identity. Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, defended his connection by citing his Irish grandparents, an Irish parent, and formative childhood experiences in Ireland. This article explores the complexities of cultural identity in 2025, noting that for many, it is a fluid concept that transcends birthplace or citizenship.

Experts and film enthusiasts suggest that memorably bad films, often made with earnest but failed ambition, can be more entertaining than bland, forgettable blockbusters.

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to influence the tech landscape, despite fading from headlines. Its launch challenged the Silicon Valley assumption that superior AI requires massive computational power and investment, as DeepSeek claimed to rival top models at a fraction of the cost. This "Sputnik moment" prompted a shift toward developing smaller, more efficient models, a trend now being adopted by giants like OpenAI. However, concerns over data security and the company's ties to Beijing persist, and the American tech industry has largely returned to a strategy of massive spending.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu has started her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig with a victory, defeating Olga Danilovic 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Cincinnati Open. Despite a slow start, Raducanu demonstrated her increasing match-toughness and reliability against lower-ranked opponents. Her strong return game and solid defense allowed her to counter Danilovic's aggressive style and capitalize on errors. The win sets up a more challenging third-round match against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.</p>

Speaking to a supportive crowd of hundreds, Gallego argued the legislation would make "America poorer and sicker." The event is part of a broader Democratic offensive against the bill, which they see as a political liability for Republicans in the upcoming midterm elections. Gallego framed the issue as a "clarifying moment" for Democrats to position themselves as fighters for the middle and working classes.</p>

          <p>The chief financial officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the full-time town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Dawn Norton, who earned $210,000 a year in Wilton, claims she had informed her superiors of her plans and was working remotely while on family medical leave. However, Wilton officials state they were unaware she had accepted a second full-time public office, which would have violated town policy.

          <p>The UK's justice secretary has announced new plans to immediately deport foreign criminals after they receive a custodial sentence, rather than after they serve a portion of it. Under the proposal, offenders with fixed-term sentences could be deported right away, with their destination country deciding whether they serve any remaining prison time. The government argues this will save taxpayers money and protect the public, as foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the prison population. Critics, however, warn that some countries may refuse to accept the deported criminals.</p>

          <p>A neurologist is advising people over 50 to eat more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. Dr. Mill Etienne highlights that pomegranates are rich in polyphenols, which offer powerful antioxidant and neuroprotective benefits that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from the amyloid protein associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and seasonal, the article notes that pomegranate extract can be an alternative, though it cautions consumers to avoid versions with added sugars.</p>

The government proscribed the group after activists vandalized military aircraft to protest UK support for Israel. While the Home Secretary defended the ban, Amnesty International called the mass arrests "deeply concerning" and a disproportionate threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>The recent dismissal of IRS Commissioner Billy Long was reportedly preceded by a clash with the White House over using confidential tax data to locate undocumented immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security had requested the IRS cross-reference a list of 40,000 names, but the agency could verify few and refused to hand over information, citing taxpayer privacy rights. The incident highlights the administration's pressure on federal agencies to assist in its immigration crackdown, raising concerns about the politicization of the IRS and the protection of sensitive data.</p>
