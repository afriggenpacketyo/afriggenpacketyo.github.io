          <p>In a speech to the UN General Assembly, former President Donald Trump criticized the organization's headquarters, recounting his unsuccessful bid to manage its renovation years ago. He claimed he could have completed the project for $500 million with superior materials like marble and mahogany, contrasting it with what he described as the UN's more expensive and inferior result. Trump used this anecdote, along with malfunctioning equipment like an escalator and teleprompter, to frame the UN as incompetent and ineffective at its core mission.</p>

Despite its simple concept, the S&P 500 maintains a dominant market position due to its trusted brand, economies of scale, and status as a financial lingua franca, making it difficult for competitors to emerge.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has reduced the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128 per month, a saving of about $210 monthly compared to rates at the beginning of the year. This decrease in borrowing costs provides significant financial relief for new homebuyers and creates attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 11:09:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for initial H-1B visa applications, causing uncertainty for immigrant workers and employers. While the White House clarified the one-time fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders or renewals, immigration attorneys remain cautious. There is concern about how the rule might affect current visa holders who need to travel abroad while an extension or change of employer is pending, leading some lawyers to advise against international travel for now.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has lost its bid to appeal a High Court injunction that temporarily blocked the removal of an Eritrean asylum seeker to France. The man was set to be one of the first sent back under a new "one in, one out" agreement, but the court granted him time to pursue a modern slavery claim. The Court of Appeal upheld the injunction, noting that Home Office officials had themselves contradicted the removal by telling the man he could make further representations, creating an unusual legal situation.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UN General Assembly, the U.S. Secret Service uncovered a large network of electronic devices in the New York tristate area with the potential to disrupt regional cellphone networks. The operation seized over 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards, which could have been used for espionage or to facilitate criminal communications. While no specific plot was announced, officials confirmed the involvement of at least one foreign nation and stated the investigation was initiated after earlier telecommunications-related threats against senior U.S. officials.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Center for Strategic and International Studies reveals an increase in left-wing terrorism in the United States, with 2025 marking the first time in over 30 years that such incidents outnumber those from the far right. The study, which tracks attacks and plots since 1994, suggests Donald Trump's political ascent reenergized left-wing extremism, though right-wing attacks have historically been more numerous and lethal. The article argues that leaders must condemn all forms of political violence to break the cycle of extremism.</p>

          <p>According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the UK is projected to experience the highest inflation among the G7 nations this year, with a revised forecast of 3.5%. The report cites higher food costs as a contributing factor and predicts that UK economic growth will slow to 1% next year due to a tighter fiscal policy and increased trade costs. The forecast adds pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is preparing for a budget that may include tax hikes or spending cuts to manage government borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists in Argentina have identified a new species of megaraptor, named Joaquinraptor casali, an apex predator estimated to be over 23 feet long. The fossil discovery included a remarkable clue to its diet: the leg bone of an ancient crocodile relative was found inside its mouth, suggesting it was the dinosaur's last meal. This find provides some of the most direct evidence of megaraptor feeding habits and indicates these powerful predators, characterized by their large claws, thrived in Patagonia until the end of the Cretaceous period.</p>
