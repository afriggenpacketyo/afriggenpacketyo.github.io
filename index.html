          <p>Despite initial setbacks due to conservative concerns over insufficient spending cuts, President Trump's budget package has moved forward in the House. Negotiations led to minor modifications, satisfying some holdouts who voted 'present,' allowing the bill to advance to the Rules Committee. The legislation, extending tax cuts and increasing military and border security spending, faces further challenges from both conservatives seeking stricter Medicaid requirements and blue-state Republicans concerned about state and local tax deductions. Speaker Johnson remains committed to passing the bill before Memorial Day, emphasizing ongoing discussions to finalize the details. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating a Mexican tall ship's collision with the Brooklyn Bridge, which resulted in two fatalities and several injuries. The CuauhtÃ©moc's masts struck the bridge after the ship reportedly lost power while departing the South Street Seaport, causing the masts to snap. Senator Schumer raised questions about potential Coast Guard operational dysfunctions related to DOGE cuts, while the Coast Guard affirmed that the VTS was fully functional during the incident. The NTSB has dispatched a go-team to investigate the incident, and the Brooklyn Bridge sustained damage to its monitoring system, though not structural damage.</p>

          <p>After a four-day strike, NJ Transit engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) reached a tentative deal, ending the first rail strike in New Jersey in decades. While the specifics of the agreement remain undisclosed until union ratification, it's described as fair and fiscally responsible, involving work rule concessions. Train service will resume on Tuesday, allowing NJ Transit to safely reposition equipment and conduct necessary safety checks. The strike, driven by wage disputes and cost of living concerns, disrupted commutes for over 100,000 daily riders, highlighting the importance of a reliable transit system.</p>

Dan's victory was secured with 54% of the vote, including significant support from Romanians who want to see profound change in Romania. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and maintaining support for Ukraine, contrasting with Simion's EU-critical stance and calls to cut aid to Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis, Stage 4, came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is considered incurable at this stage, it is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management and potential survival for several years. Both President Trump and former Vice President Harris issued supportive statements following the announcement.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer has reignited discussions regarding his health and past decisions. The diagnosis underscores that concerns about his age and potential health issues expressed by a majority of American voters were valid. This medical revelation might give him a new platform, and a newly sympathetic public, to attempt to defend and burnish his presidential legacy. While there is no reason to believe that Biden's prostate issues were at all apparent while he was in the White House, the fact that such an aggressive form of cancer could avoid detection until it had already spread, despite the wealth of medical support and evaluation available to Biden, will raise new questions and concerns.</p>

          <p>Redcar and Cleveland Council in north-east England was targeted in a cyber-attack in February 2020, causing chaos and disrupting essential services. Hackers scrambled the council's IT systems and demanded a ransom for restoration. The attack, which originated from a malicious email attachment, affected everything from bin collections to social services. The council refused to pay the ransom, and it took months to fully restore the system, highlighting the vulnerability of public services to cyber-crime.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer has raised questions about the disease, its symptoms, and treatment options. The article explains that Biden's cancer has spread to his bones and is categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, indicating a poor prognosis without intervention. Treatment options include hormone therapy and bone-targeted treatments to control the disease, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. While prostate cancer is often curable if identified and treated early, the goal in Biden's case is to manage the disease and maintain his well-being.</p>
