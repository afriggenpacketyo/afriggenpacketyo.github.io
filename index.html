        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dame Louise Casey is calling for a newly announced inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue. Her report highlighted the need for openness to scrutiny and change from those giving evidence. Casey also addressed concerns about the ethnicity of perpetrators, urging people to "keep calm" and properly interrogate data, noting disproportionate Asian heritage involvement in child sexual exploitation cases. She emphasized the importance of implementing the recommendations from previous reports and holding the government accountable for action within six months, stressing the need for increased prosecutions and criminal investigations. The inquiry aims to ensure adults who sexually assault children face serious charges and to review convictions of victims who were criminalized instead of protected.</p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost-cutting measures due to weaker-than-expected travel demand, making it unlikely the company will achieve break-even operating margins this year. CEO Joanna Geraghty informed staff that the airline will further reduce flights, pause retrofits, and park some Airbus jets. The company is also evaluating its leadership structure to identify opportunities for consolidation and greater efficiency. This follows JetBlue's failed acquisition of Spirit Airlines and a recent partnership with United Airlines as it seeks to improve revenue. The carrier is relying on borrowed cash to maintain operations.</p>

          <p>Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were injured in targeted shootings. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, was apprehended after a two-day manhunt and is facing first-degree murder and attempted murder charges. Boelter, who was dressed as a police officer during the attacks, had served on a state board with Hoffman. Investigators are exploring whether Boelter knew the lawmakers personally, and a search of his vehicle revealed a list of potential targets, including abortion rights advocates. The shootings have sparked outrage and calls for an end to political violence, with Governor Tim Walz describing the deaths as a "political assassination."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales in the U.S. experienced a sharper-than-expected decline of 0.9% in May, signaling a pullback in consumer spending. The Commerce Department report indicated that this decrease was influenced by lower gas sales and economic uncertainty, following a smaller 0.1% drop in April. Excluding autos, sales fell by 0.3%, while building materials, garden stores, and gasoline stations also saw declines. Despite improved consumer sentiment surveys, the ongoing trade war and geopolitical tensions have contributed to cautious spending behavior among consumers, with many seeking deals and being selective about their purchases.

          <p>President Trump has denied reports of contacting Iranian leaders regarding a potential ceasefire and threatened severe consequences if Tehran attacks U.S. troops or assets. He dismissed intelligence assessments suggesting Iran is not developing nuclear weapons, stating he believes they are close to having one. Trump also reiterated that Iran should have accepted the deal previously offered and cautioned them against any actions against U.S. personnel in the region. These comments followed Trump's early departure from the G7 summit and a series of Israeli airstrikes against Iran.</p>

          <p>According to China expert William Figueroa, China's position on the Israel-Iran conflict mirrors its stance on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, emphasizing dialogue and de-escalation. Figueroa believes China's influence is limited due to its lack of power projection capabilities in the Middle East. While China has facilitated diplomatic efforts in the past, such as the Saudi-Iran reconciliation, it is unlikely to mediate in the Israel-Iran conflict due to the high costs and low potential gains. China's primary concern is the potential impact on its energy security, given its reliance on Middle Eastern oil.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British citizens are stranded in Israel due to the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, with the Israeli airspace closed and flights grounded. British nationals have reported sleepless nights, frequent trips to bomb shelters, and uncertainty about when they can return home. While the UK government has advised against all travel to Israel, there are currently no plans for an evacuation. Some Britons are attempting to leave via land crossings to neighboring countries, while others are unable to travel due to health or logistical constraints.</p>
