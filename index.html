          <p>Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke has announced a new policy requiring employees to demonstrate that they cannot accomplish their tasks using AI before requesting additional headcount or resources. The company expects employees to integrate AI into their daily workflows, viewing it as a productivity multiplier, and will incorporate AI usage into performance reviews. This directive comes as Shopify invests heavily in AI tools for merchants, while also seeking to streamline costs, and has seen its headcount decrease in recent years through layoffs. This initiative aims to leverage AI to enhance efficiency and tackle previously implausible tasks.</p>

          <p>As stock markets experience increased volatility due to global uncertainty, investors are turning to bonds as a lower-risk option.

Experts suggest that active management allows for greater return potential, particularly amid fluctuating treasury bond yields.

          <p>Campus activists are advocating for a "Mutual Defense Compact" among major universities to counter President Trump's executive orders targeting progressive initiatives in public education.

          <p>A Department of Homeland Security official defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, claiming that "due process does look different" for individuals deemed members of terrorist organizations. Despite acknowledging that the deportation was an "administrative error," the official maintained that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13. The official asserted that the administration's deportation processes are legal, even in cases where individuals are sent to foreign countries without hearings. However, the official declined to provide specific details about the due process afforded in such cases.</p>

          <p>Restaurant stocks are declining due to investor concerns about a potential recession driven by President Trump's tariffs. While the direct cost impact of tariffs on restaurants is considered manageable, the anticipated inflation is expected to put pressure on consumer spending and industry demand. Concerns about trade tensions are also impacting international sales, particularly in key markets like China. Starbucks, among other restaurant chains, has seen its stock decline amid these economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

The author notes that the market has struggled to determine the appropriate level of decline in response to the potential for an "economic nuclear winter." Factors contributing to this uncertainty include Trump's unwavering stance on tariffs, the muted response from corporate America, and the Federal Reserve's limited ability to intervene.

The EU is bracing for both the direct impact of Trump's tariffs on its exports to the US and the indirect consequence of Chinese goods being diverted to Europe at discounted prices. EU ministers are urging action to protect businesses from Chinese industrial overcapacity amid fears of economic pressure.</p>
