          <p>Despite global efforts, the world has failed to meet the 2025 target for eliminating child labor, with sub-Saharan Africa facing significant challenges due to rapid population growth and poverty. While the number of child laborers has decreased globally, it remains high in Africa, with younger children disproportionately affected. UNICEF emphasizes the need to address poverty at the household level, improve access to quality education, and enforce laws against child labor. Climate change also exacerbates the problem, pushing families into hazardous labor, such as mica mining in Madagascar, to survive. The article highlights the complex factors perpetuating child labor and the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to break the cycle.</p>

          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the company behind the CrushAI app, for using artificial intelligence to generate nude images of individuals from clothed photographs. The lawsuit aims to prevent CrushAI from advertising its apps on Meta's platforms, as the company believes this violates its policies against non-consensual intimate imagery. Joy Timeline reportedly attempted to circumvent Meta's ad review process, prompting Meta to take legal action and enhance its technology to detect such ads. Meta will also share information about entities violating its policies with other tech companies through the Tech Coalition's Lantern Program, focusing on child safety. Meta is committed to protecting its community from abuse and will take necessary steps, including legal action, against those who violate its platform policies.</p>

          <p>Charles Barkley has criticized the New York Knicks for their handling of the search for a new head coach after firing Tom Thibodeau. Barkley stated that the Knicks appeared to lack a clear plan, as several coaching candidates have reportedly turned down the team. The Knicks fired Thibodeau despite the team's recent success in reaching the postseason, leading Barkley to question the decision-making process. The team's offseason plans remain unclear, but they have a solid foundation built around Jalen Brunson. The Knicks' front office will need to find a suitable replacement to continue building on their recent progress.</p>

          <p>Recent polling data presents conflicting views on public approval of President Trump's deportation policies, with some surveys showing approval and others disapproval. NPR's Domenico Montanaro suggests this indicates that public opinion is not firmly set and can be swayed. While people may generally support deporting those without legal status, they differentiate between hardened criminals and hardworking community members. The Trump administration's plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants have also drawn criticism, with some arguing that it undermines efforts to combat climate change. This action is seen as propping up the coal industry despite the increasing impact of climate change on Americans.</p>

One family of five, including a three-year-old, was allegedly given minimal rations and limited water over a 48-hour period. These reports coincide with the planned deployment of marines to Los Angeles to assist with immigration enforcement, following protests against the raids. In related news, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain a Palestinian activist on claims that he is a threat to foreign policy, though he may still be held on other grounds.</p>

Warren's suggestions include cracking down on prescription drug middlemen, eliminating waste in federal charter school programs, and reforming the estate tax exemption.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently decided not to enforce regulations against BNPL companies, raising concerns about consumer protection.

Jewish scholars argue that Harvard's approach violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by subjecting Jews to harmful stereotypes about what constitutes authentic Jewish identity. The university's adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which conflates criticism of Israel with prejudice against Jewish people, is also under scrutiny.

          <p>Despite historical opposition, Israel should consider welcoming a potential nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran, as it may be the least bad option for curbing Iran's nuclear program. While hard-line Israelis prefer the total dismantlement of Iran's centrifuges, analysts suggest that a negotiated settlement could allow Israel to build on its advantage by pursuing closer ties with Arab states. Integrating Iran into the region's economy could also de-radicalize its foreign policy, making it less belligerent. A diplomatic deal would not only curtail Iran's nuclear program but also put the country on a path defined by its economic and pragmatic interests.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), including several well-known vaccine critics such as Dr. Robert Malone. This move has raised concerns among public health experts, who fear it could negatively impact vaccine policy and availability in the U.S. Critics argue that some of the new members hold anti-vaccine views and may not provide the same quality of advice as the previous committee. Kennedy defends his picks as highly credentialed scientists and public-health experts committed to evidence-based medicine.</p>

          <p>Three Democratic governors are set to testify before a House oversight panel to defend their responses to the migrant crisis and dispute claims of failing to cooperate with federal authorities. The governors' appearances come amid a legal and political standoff between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom over the deployment of troops to quell immigration protests. The governors are expected to emphasize their commitment to both compassion and pragmatism in addressing the influx of migrants, while also highlighting the need for federal intervention and cooperation from border states. The hearing follows a previous session on sanctuary cities with Democratic mayors.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is set to kick off in the United States with a new, expanded format featuring 32 teams, but the event is not universally loved. FIFA President Gianni Infantino aims to generate increased revenue with the new format, which will be held every four years. The teams are divided into eight groups, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. While participating clubs are pleased with the financial rewards, critics argue that the tournament adds to the already overcrowded football calendar, potentially increasing the risk of injury for players. The tournament is also facing challenges with ticket sales and potential disruptions from protests.</p>

          <p>The US is partially evacuating its embassy in Baghdad due to heightened security risks amid rising tensions with Iran, with non-essential staff and their families being removed. This decision follows reports that Israel was prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting concerns about potential retaliation against US sites in Iraq. The US has also restricted staff movements within Israel, and President Trump reiterated that the US does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. These actions occur as US talks with Iran over its nuclear program appear to have stalled, and the IAEA criticizes Iran's cooperation on nuclear matters.</p>

The doctor, Yoshikazu Okubo, was found guilty of administering a lethal dose of a sedative to Yuri Hayashi, judging that his actions were not socially acceptable. Okubo was also convicted of killing another individual in a separate incident, highlighting the complexities of end-of-life care and legal boundaries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's success in deterring immigration has led to unintended consequences, including more radical enforcement tactics and economic harm. With border crossings significantly reduced, the administration has struggled to exceed previous deportation numbers, prompting a shift towards targeting law-abiding, long-time US residents. This has resulted in increased social unrest and clashes between civilians and agents of the state. The slowdown in new arrivals is also hurting the US economy by exacerbating labor shortages and slowing economic growth. While immigration restriction is politically popular, it is coming at the cost of economic stability and social peace.</p>

The Polish firm Pepco sold the brand for a "nominal" sum after sales slumped. The proposed restructure will be put to the High Court in England. Poundland has been struggling to compete with other discount stores, and its appeal has been waning as consumers seek better quality and value elsewhere. After the sale, the business will continue to be led by Barry Williams and will operate under the Poundland brand in the UK.</p>
