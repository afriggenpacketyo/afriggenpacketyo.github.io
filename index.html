          <p>With national credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average APRs over 22%, many Americans face substantial financial burdens. This article examines debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, as a potential solution for individuals owing over $50,000. It outlines the stringent requirements for this option, such as demonstrating financial hardship and being delinquent on payments, which can negatively impact credit scores. Other strategies like debt consolidation, home equity borrowing, credit counseling, and bankruptcy are also presented as alternatives for managing overwhelming debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida State Representative Kevin Steele has introduced a bill that would mandate public universities and colleges rename campus roads in honor of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fictionally assassinated in this article. The proposed legislation includes a punitive measure, stipulating that state funding would be withheld from any institution failing to comply within 90 days. Steele stated the bill's purpose is to preserve Kirk's legacy for future generations of students who will encounter diverse ideas on campus. This action has generated significant political discussion.</p>

          <p>The remains of one of three skiers who went missing in a March avalanche near Girdwood, Alaska, have been recovered after seven months. The recovery was conducted by volunteers from the Alaska Mountain Rescue Group and the Girdwood Volunteer Fire Department. The initial rescue was hampered by extreme avalanche danger and the victims being buried under up to 100 feet of snow. The deceased has been sent to the state medical examiner for identification, while efforts to locate the other two missing men will continue.</p>

          <p>In the Women's Cricket World Cup, Beth Mooney scored a remarkable century to rescue Australia from a potential upset against Pakistan. Australia was struggling at 76-7 before Mooney's performance, coupled with a half-century from Alana King, propelled the team to a total of 221-9. This comeback turned a precarious situation into a dominant 107-run victory, reinforcing Australia's status as tournament favorites. The win places Australia at the top of the standings, while Pakistan remains winless after three matches in the tournament.</p>

          <p>France is facing a significant political crisis after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned just 26 days into his term, marking the third prime minister to leave in under a year. President Emmanuel Macron has given Lecornu until Wednesday evening to find a stable solution that would prevent the dissolution of parliament and another round of snap elections. Lecornu has been in talks with various political parties to form a potential pact, but opposition from both the left and right complicates efforts to pass a budget and stabilize the government.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has been downgraded to just above a Category 1 storm as it moves northwest off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 75 mph and issued a tropical storm watch for parts of Baja California Sur. While the hurricane is expected to continue weakening and remain offshore, it is generating large swells causing life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast. The storm's path is being closely monitored as it continues parallel to the peninsula.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 29-year-old Jonathan Rinderknecht in Florida, charging him with destruction of property by fire for allegedly starting the Palisades Fire in Los Angeles. The blaze, which erupted in January, resulted in 12 deaths and the destruction of nearly 7,000 structures, becoming one of the most devastating wildfires in the city's history. Investigators claim Rinderknecht ignited an initial fire on January 1 that smoldered underground before high winds caused it to resurface and spread a week later. The arrest offers a measure of justice to the many victims impacted by the disaster.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project reports that the Trump administration has appointed more than 40 individuals with direct employment history at oil, gas, or coal companies. The report identifies 111 officials across agencies like the EPA and Department of the Interior who are considered "fossil fuel insiders." This includes high-level figures like Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking CEO, and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, who has long-standing ties to oil interests, highlighting the industry's significant influence on the administration's environmental and energy policies.</p>

          <p>Iris Stalzer, the recently elected mayor of Herdecke, Germany, is recovering after being found in her home with multiple stab wounds. From her hospital bed, the 57-year-old politician identified her 17-year-old adopted daughter as her attacker. Police found signs of a struggle and two knives believed to be the weapons at the scene. Prosecutors stated that the daughter, who made the emergency call with her 15-year-old brother, is unlikely to face pretrial detention for attempted murder, with the case being treated as aggravated assault.</p>

          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell after the European Commission announced plans to significantly increase tariffs and cut import quotas on steel. The proposed measures, intended to protect the domestic steel industry, would double tariffs to 50% on excess imports and have sparked panic in the automotive sector. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association warned that the proposal goes too far, threatening automakers with higher costs and inflationary pressure. BMW's shares were hit particularly hard, also citing a fresh profit warning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. His legal team, led by attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, announced their intention to file a motion to dismiss the case, arguing it is a vindictive and selective prosecution driven by political pressure from former President Donald Trump. A trial date has been tentatively set for January 5. The indictment has caused turmoil within the U.S. Attorney's office, following the replacement of the previous U.S. attorney who had reportedly found insufficient evidence to charge Comey.</p>

The strategy may include selling rights for one first-pick game per round to a major streaming service like Amazon or Netflix. This expected revenue boom will primarily benefit the participating clubs, continuing the financial growth of European football's premier competitions.</p>

During the hearing, Norris publicly admitted for the first time his involvement in the attack but denied stabbing Lawrence and refused to name the other attackers.

          <p>Former England captain Steven Gerrard has described the acclaimed "Golden Generation" of English footballers from the 2000s as "egotistical losers," citing a lack of team unity as a key reason for their tournament failures. This view is echoed by former teammates like Rio Ferdinand and Frank Lampard, who suggest that intense club rivalries between Manchester United, Chelsea, and Liverpool prevented the national squad from connecting. Others point to tactical inflexibility under managers like Sven-Goran Eriksson and the simple fact that rival nations like Brazil and Spain had stronger teams during that era.</p>
