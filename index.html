          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by the largest daily inflow into Bitcoin ETFs this year. The rally, which also saw Ether climb back above $3,000, was intensified by significant short liquidations totaling over $650 million. Analysts attribute the momentum to institutional investment and speculation about a more dovish Federal Reserve policy, with expectations that upcoming crypto legislation and corporate buying will continue to support the price. The market remains sensitive to macroeconomic factors, but the current trend reflects strong investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an investigation that revealed minimal oversight and questionable spending, Texas is overhauling its Thriving Texas Families program, which funds alternatives to abortion. The program, with a budget growing to $100 million annually, will now require contractors like crisis pregnancy centers to document all expenses and seek reimbursement for actual costs rather than receiving flat-rate payments. This change aims to prevent misuse of taxpayer funds, such as organizations profiting from distributing free donated items or financing real estate deals, and to increase transparency about the services provided. Critics, however, argue the reforms don't address broader gaps in the state's social safety net.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has publicly expressed his support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), stating the agency performs an important function for the country. He described calls from within his own party to abolish ICE as "inappropriate and outrageous," a stance that drew praise from several Republican senators, including Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. While supporting the agency's law enforcement role, Fetterman also reiterated his support for providing amnesty to law-abiding migrant workers, advocating for a dual approach of deporting criminals while recognizing the economic contributions of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is piloting "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant step for artificial intelligence adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling tedious tasks, with plans to scale from hundreds to potentially thousands of AI agents. This move to "agentic AI" signifies a shift from AI assistants to programs that can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently. The initiative is expected to significantly boost productivity but also raises concerns about the future of human jobs in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>Two female residents of a care home in Sunderland, one in her 90s and another in her 80s, have died following a tragic incident where a stolen car crashed into the building. The crash occurred after a police pursuit of a BMW, which resulted in significant structural damage to the Highcliffe Care Home and forced the complete evacuation of its residents. Eight other residents were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Northumbria Police have since rearrested two 21-year-old men on suspicion of manslaughter, and the case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to the preceding chase.</p>

Currently in pilot testing in Xinjiang, the machine uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and vaporize the plant's top bud with a high-powered laser, a task described as "hitting a moving target with a moving gun." The development team from Xinjiang University reports the robot achieves nearly 99% accuracy in bud detection with minimal damage to the plants.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading the reorganization, which he argues is necessary to streamline a "bloated bureaucracy" and speed up decision-making. However, the move has been heavily criticized by former diplomats, who warn that the deep cuts are gutting the department's institutional knowledge and expertise. Critics fear the restructuring reflects a diminished global agenda and could weaken U.S. influence abroad, especially in areas like human rights and democracy promotion.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a new interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which may be the oldest comet ever detected, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object from beyond our solar system to be observed. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated from the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of water ice. As it approaches the sun later this year, it is expected to heat up and create a glowing tail, potentially becoming visible from Earth with amateur telescopes.</p>

The group, which has been instrumental in documenting election fraud, was labeled a "foreign agent" and faced years of persecution.

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $15 million in federal funding for research into "forever chemical" (PFAS) contamination on U.S. farms. The studies were aimed at understanding how these toxic compounds, often spread via contaminated sewage sludge used as fertilizer, move into crops, livestock, and water sources. The issue has already created a crisis in Maine, where dozens of farms are contaminated, and advocates say the research is vital for ensuring food safety and protecting farmers nationwide.

While consumers have been partially shielded so far, analysts warn that prices on goods like clothing and shoes are set to rise significantly as business inventories run out.

          <p>Following its recent strikes on Iran, Israel appears to be adopting its former Gaza strategy of "mowing the grass" on a regional scale, using intermittent military force to degrade the capabilities of its adversaries. This approach involves ongoing, low-grade conflicts in Lebanon, Yemen, and Syria, in addition to the war in Gaza, reflecting a higher tolerance for risk within Israel's leadership. While this multi-front engagement has been militarily successful and popular domestically, analysts question its long-term sustainability due to the immense economic costs and strain on military resources. The strategy's ultimate success in achieving regional stability or normalization remains an open question.</p>

The trustees' revised forecast reflects that inflation has remained more persistent than previously expected, aligning more closely with other analyst predictions that place the 2026 COLA between 2.4% and 3%.

          <p>The critical role of scavengers like vultures in preventing the spread of disease is being highlighted by new research, which also warns that a third of these species are in decline. In India, the near-extinction of vultures in the 1990s, caused by a toxic livestock drug, led to an estimated 100,000 additional human deaths annually from diseases like rabies, as feral dog populations boomed on uneaten carcasses. Scientists argue that the loss of these specialized "apex scavengers" disrupts ecosystems and allows pathogens to proliferate, creating significant public health risks. This underscores the deep connection between wildlife conservation and human well-being.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy contracted by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of decline and confounding analysts' expectations of slight growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the fall primarily to a drop in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with retail sales also described as very weak. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures "disappointing" but remained committed to boosting growth. The data suggests that the strong growth seen in the first quarter of the year was short-lived, putting pressure on the government's economic agenda and increasing expectations for an interest rate cut.
