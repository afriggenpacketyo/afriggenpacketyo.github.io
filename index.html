        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brentford striker Yoane Wissa has publicly criticized his club for blocking a transfer to Newcastle United, accusing them of breaking written promises. Despite two offers from Newcastle, the latest valued at £35 million plus add-ons, Brentford has reportedly increased their asking price significantly. Wissa, who has not been training with the first team, released a statement urging the club's owners to honor their agreement before the transfer window closes. This move is part of a potential chain reaction that could see Newcastle's Alexander Isak move to Liverpool.</p>

While the consumer price index has increased by about 36% in that period, the cost of the popular vodka-based drink has surged by 53%. If its price had matched inflation, the cocktail would cost around $20.33 today. Despite the high price, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue.

          <p>American painter Alex Katz has created over 300 portraits of his wife, Ada, who has been his primary muse for more than five decades. An exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 of these portraits, highlighting Katz's unique brand of realism that focuses on style, appearance, and the play of light rather than emotional depth. Katz, who came of age during the abstract expressionism movement, initially faced criticism for his figurative work. He describes his detached style as a mirror, allowing viewers to see themselves in his depictions of Ada.</p>

The plot was uncovered when the man he tried to hire, Rick Fuhrmann, went to the police and agreed to wear a wire. The recorded conversation captured Guglielmelli confirming his desire for his wife to be killed for a price of $80,000.

          <p>This commentary piece reflects on the case of Alix Tichelman, who pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter in the heroin overdose death of Google executive Forrest Hayes on his yacht. The author, Michael Daly, questions the allocation of blame, suggesting that Hayes was an active participant who created the situation by hiring Tichelman and asking her to inject him. Daly posits that if the roles were reversed and Tichelman had died, Hayes, with his high-powered status, might not have faced the same legal consequences. The article explores the ethical complexities of the case beyond the legal findings.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" investigation details the death of Google X executive Forrest Hayes, who died from a heroin overdose on his yacht in the presence of Alix Tichelman, a woman he met through the "sugar daddy" website SeekingArrangement.com. Crucial evidence came from the yacht's security camera, which captured Tichelman injecting Hayes with heroin at his request. The video shows Hayes going into distress while Tichelman gathers her belongings, steps over his body, and leaves without calling for help. Tichelman was later arrested in a sting operation and pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from "Mother Mary Comes to Me," the first memoir by Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy, reflects on the death of her mother. Roy describes her complex and tumultuous relationship with her mother, a formidable figure who was deeply woven into the landscape and life of Kerala, India. The passage touches on her mother's fierce independence, her legal battles for women's inheritance rights, and the profound, almost shameful, intensity of Roy's grief upon her passing. The author grapples with the pain of losing a person who had been a central, if unpredictable, force in her life.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Abruzzo, the former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), warns that the Trump administration's actions are crippling the agency's ability to protect workers' rights. Since taking office, President Trump has fired several key officials, including the NLRB chair, leaving the board without a quorum and unable to issue decisions. This has empowered corporations like SpaceX to challenge the NLRB's constitutionality and halt unfair labor practice cases. Abruzzo fears these developments threaten to roll back worker protections to pre-1935 levels, leaving working families with lower wages and fewer channels to fight back against corporate power.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece explores the ethical dilemma of experiencing personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering, from humanitarian disasters to political turmoil. The author draws on philosophical and religious traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, suggesting it is moral to feel the pain of others. However, the article argues that this empathy should extend to sharing in others' joys as well, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or mudita. To avoid both saccharine positivity and cynical despair, we should allow ourselves to experience the full spectrum of human emotion, recognizing that feeling good can be a form of resistance against forces that seek to create pain and confusion.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to reform the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), sparking concern among legal and public health experts. The VICP was established in the 1980s to provide a no-fault compensation system for rare vaccine side effects and to stabilize the vaccine market by shielding manufacturers from extensive litigation. Critics fear that Kennedy's proposed changes, or potential abolition of the program, could undermine vaccine availability by exposing manufacturers to increased legal liability, potentially causing them to exit the market. This could make it harder for both vaccine production to continue and for individuals with legitimate rare injuries to receive compensation. (not investment advice)</p>

This provides a crucial loophole for buyers facing vehicle delivery delays, allowing them to order a vehicle and put down a deposit to secure the tax break.

Judges have also expressed frustration with prosecutors for filing sloppy cases, causing unnecessary delays, and pursuing harsh felony charges for minor incidents. Despite the administration's claims of a crime emergency, the crackdown has led to a rapid increase in federal cases of questionable strength. This has raised concerns about government overreach and the potential for politically motivated prosecutions in a city where the federal deployment is deeply unpopular.</p>

The author contends that deploying Guardsmen for immigration enforcement, crime suppression, or even as substitute teachers and bus drivers blurs the line between military and civilian authority. This misuse erodes public trust, hollows out civilian institutions by providing a temporary patch instead of long-term solutions, and degrades the Guard's readiness for its intended emergency response and national security missions.

Researchers note that men are involved in roughly three-quarters of these fatal events, and tragically, bystanders who attempt rescues often become victims themselves.

The price for tencha, the tea leaves used to make matcha, jumped 170% at a recent auction. This has forced Japanese retailers to ration supplies and has put a strain on the nation's aging farming communities, prompting the government to consider subsidies to encourage more tencha production.

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is facing criticism for ordering the removal of approximately 400 "non-standard" crosswalk art installations across the state, a move framed as part of his "war on woke." The purge began with the painting over of a rainbow crosswalk memorializing victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting and has since targeted LGBTQ+ pride symbols, school safety art designed by students, and even checkered flags at the Daytona speedway. While the state claims the removals are for safety and to keep roads free of "political ideologies," several cities are vowing to fight the directive. Critics view the action as an overreach of state power and a targeted attack on the LGBTQ+ community and political opponents.</p>

          <p>In a rare commercial contract with a North American company, the Chinese launch provider CAS Space has successfully deployed two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a startup based in Tijuana, Mexico. The femtosatellites, each weighing less than 100 grams, were launched into orbit aboard a Kinetica-1 rocket. This mission marks Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit and is seen by CAS Space as a significant milestone for China's entry into the North American commercial launch market. The launch demonstrates growing international interest in China's rocket services, which are marketed as offering a good balance of cost and reliability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is moving to restore Confederate memorials, including a controversial statue at Arlington National Cemetery and a portrait of Robert E. Lee at West Point. Hegseth defended the move as honoring history rather than erasing it, but critics argue it glorifies a treasonous cause that fought to preserve slavery and cost hundreds of thousands of U.S. military lives. The author, a U.S. Army veteran whose grandfather fought for Mussolini, contends that one can mourn ancestors who fought for bad causes without celebrating the cause itself. The article asserts that these actions make common cause with Confederate apologists and have no place in U.S. military institutions.</p>

          <p>The deployment of U.S. warships to the Caribbean has heightened anxiety among Venezuelans, who are already grappling with a prolonged crisis of hyperinflation, shortages, and authoritarian rule under President Nicolás Maduro. While the Trump administration has sent mixed signals—imposing sanctions and offering bounties while also engaging in diplomatic talks and prisoner exchanges—the military presence has fueled rumors of intervention. In response, Maduro has bolstered his militia forces and condemned the U.S. action as imperialist aggression. For ordinary citizens, the escalating tensions add another layer of uncertainty to daily life, with some hoping for change while others are weary of political turmoil.</p>

They grew up in a non-ideological household focused on hard work and public service. Their story offers a poignant example of maintaining close personal relationships amidst the nation's heated and often toxic political environment, emphasizing empathy and mutual respect over partisan gain.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party's public approval is at a 30-year low, with many voters finding its leaders "weak," there are emerging signs of optimism for its future. Strategists note that in an era of negative partisanship, dislike for the opposing party—and an increasingly unpopular President Trump—can be a powerful motivator for voters. Potential presidential candidates like Gavin Newsom and J.B. Pritzker are adopting more aggressive anti-Trump stances, and the party is focusing on "kitchen table" economic issues. Despite internal divisions on policy and cultural issues, some analysts believe the party has a deep bench of talent and is finding its footing to compete in upcoming congressional elections.</p>

          <p>This commentary revisits a 1995 speech by author Toni Morrison, arguing that her genealogical approach to fascism, rooted in the history of American racism, provides a crucial lens for understanding current political threats. Morrison described fascism's rise not as a sudden jump but as a series of steps, including inventing an enemy and criminalizing them, a process she called racism's "succubus twin." The article suggests that the history of Black resistance—characterized by belief in democratic ideals, diverse methods of protest, and profound faith—offers a powerful model for combating authoritarianism today. It calls for a multifaceted resistance that can be found in courtrooms, classrooms, and even cultural expressions like Beyoncé's music.</p>

The rallies, which were promoted by opposition politicians and some far-right figures, led to several clashes. The Australian government condemned the events, stating they were linked to the far-right and had no place in the country. Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke emphasized that such movements seek to divide and undermine social cohesion, while Multicultural Affairs Minister Dr. Anne Aly asserted that the brand of activism grounded in racism has no place in modern Australia.</p>

          <p>As Britain experiences hotter summers, the use of home air conditioning is increasing, sparking a debate about its environmental impact, cost, and health effects. While air-con provides relief and improves productivity, environmental groups express concern over the potent greenhouse gases (HFCs) used as refrigerants. Financially, running even a portable unit can add to electricity bills, which remain high. Experts advise that while poorly maintained units can spread germs, clean systems are safe and can even improve air quality. The discussion highlights the paradox of needing cooling in a warming world while the cooling technology itself can contribute to climate change.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal grants designated for 12 port projects intended to support the U.S. offshore wind industry. This move is the latest in President Trump's campaign against wind power, which he has criticized as expensive and harmful to birds. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy labeled the projects "wasteful," suggesting the funds could be redirected to other port upgrades. The decision is a major blow to the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry and to ports, like Humboldt Bay in California, that were counting on the investment to create high-paying jobs and become hubs for clean energy manufacturing.
