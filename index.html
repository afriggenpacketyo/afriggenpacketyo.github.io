          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has decided to drop its appeal against a federal judge's ruling that allowed commodities exchange KalshiEx to offer bets on the outcomes of U.S. political elections.

          <p>Medicare in 2025 will not cover several key healthcare costs, including routine dental and vision care, hearing aids, overseas medical services, and long-term custodial care. These exclusions can lead to significant out-of-pocket expenses for seniors, potentially straining retirement finances. As a result, many retirees are considering Medicare supplemental insurance, such as Medigap, to help cover these gaps. Purchasing supplemental coverage early is advisable, as healthcare costs are rising and eligibility can depend on one's health status. Medigap plans can also offer peace of mind with foreign emergency medical coverage.</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to guide a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. The practice, known as red-boxing, involves posting strategic information publicly for outside groups to use, circumventing restrictions on direct communication. Cuomo's website features polling data, pre-edited video clips, and instructions for ad campaigns targeting specific voter groups. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned against red-boxing, but Cuomo's lawyer claims there is no evidence the super PAC acted on the information.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plans for mass deportations have raised questions about due process rights for non-citizens in the U.S., with legal experts emphasizing that all individuals on U.S. soil are entitled to due process. While the Constitution does not guarantee a trial for every migrant, the government must take steps to ensure fairness and the safety of vulnerable individuals. The specifics of "notice" and "hearing" vary based on an immigrant's status and circumstances. The Supreme Court has ruled that detainees must be given a chance to challenge their detention, but the expedited removal program allows for swift deportations without a hearing under certain conditions.</p>
