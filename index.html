          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's Labour Party has won the parliamentary election, securing him a second term in office. With approximately 28% of the vote, Labour will form a majority government with the support of four other left-leaning parties, narrowly defeating the right-wing coalition. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living and the quality of public services, alongside concerns over international instability. The victory is seen as a notable win for social democracy amid a broader right-wing trend in Europe.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that Americans' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to its lowest point since data collection began in 2013. The perceived probability of securing new employment after a job loss dropped significantly to 44.9%. This decline in optimism coincides with rising concerns about potential job loss and a generally pessimistic view of the economy. Recent labor market data, showing weak job growth and a slight increase in unemployment, supports this sentiment of economic stagnation and uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family's succession dispute has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement that confirms Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. The agreement resolves a legal battle initiated after Rupert Murdoch attempted to amend his trust to favor Lachlan. As part of the resolution, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares and roles in the companies, ensuring the conservative direction of media assets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. This settlement effectively ends the long-running family drama over the future of the influential media conglomerate.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, began with jury selection. Routh, who is representing himself, has exhibited eccentric behavior, submitting unusual questions for potential jurors, such as one involving a turtle in the road. Prosecutors allege Routh staked out the golf course with a semiautomatic rifle with the intent to kill the president.

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has returned to training with his county team, Durham, after recovering from a shoulder injury that sidelined him during the last Test against India. His head coach, Ryan Campbell, expressed confidence that Stokes will be prepared for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia this winter. The all-rounder has started batting again, with his bowling recovery expected to take more time. The return of Stokes, along with fast bowler Mark Wood who is also nearing a comeback, is considered crucial for England's chances in the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration's strategy of issuing a complete and indignant denial of a suggestive letter to Jeffrey Epstein has backfired now that the letter has been released by a House committee. The White House had labeled the story a "despicable hoax" and "bullshit," a stance that rallied many supporters who believed Trump was a victim of media overreach. By insisting the letter was nonexistent rather than offering an alternative interpretation of its content, the administration left no room for a fallback defense once its existence was confirmed, creating a significant credibility problem.</p>

Emergency services, including fire crews and specialist police officers, responded to the incident and conducted a thorough search of the area. No trace of any harmful substance was found, and the 21 people assessed for injuries were not in life-threatening condition, with only one taken to the hospital. The terminal reopened after a few hours, with the airport apologizing for the disruption and working to resume normal flight schedules.</p>

          <p>A former head of security at WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, has filed a whistleblower lawsuit against parent company Meta, alleging "systemic cybersecurity failures" that could compromise user privacy. The suit claims that Baig discovered approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to sensitive user data and that he faced retaliation after reporting these issues to leadership, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Meta has disputed the allegations, stating Baig was dismissed for poor performance. The lawsuit asserts these security flaws violate federal laws and a 2020 FTC privacy settlement, posing a significant regulatory risk.</p>

          <p>The CDC is investigating a multistate salmonella outbreak linked to ready-to-eat meals from the home delivery company Metabolic Meals. At least 16 people across 10 states have become ill, with seven requiring hospitalization, though no deaths have been reported. The agency has warned consumers not to eat specific meals delivered during the week of July 28, 2025, and has provided a list of affected products and lot codes. Metabolic Meals is reportedly cooperating with the investigation and has contacted customers who purchased the potentially contaminated meals to inform them of the risk.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing a legal challenge that could result in the government refunding between $750 billion and $1 trillion in tariffs if the Supreme Court sides with lower courts. Two courts have already ruled that the president overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose steep levies on trading partners. The Treasury Secretary warned of "significant disruption" if the tariffs were unwound, and the administration has asked the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to mitigate the potential financial fallout.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve being widely expected to cut interest rates again in September, opening a high-yield savings account may still be a worthwhile financial decision for many. While returns are no longer at their recent peaks, rates on these accounts remain significantly higher—nearly 1,000% more—than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Since the initial rate cuts are expected to be gradual, savers can still benefit from the higher interest in the short term. Furthermore, these accounts provide liquidity and access to funds, which is valuable in an unpredictable economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its focus on Democratic-led cities by launching new immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and Boston. In Chicago, "Operation Midway Blitz" is said to target "criminal illegal aliens" who the DHS claims are protected by the state's sanctuary policies. A similar surge, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," is underway in Massachusetts. These actions follow a pattern of increased federal presence in cities like Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, which the Trump administration has justified as necessary for public safety, despite criticism from local leaders who call the moves political and inhumane.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Rivian has laid off approximately 200 employees, about 1.5% of its workforce, as the automotive industry braces for the end of federal EV tax credits. The impending expiration of the $7,500 credit for new EVs is expected to dampen consumer demand, and other automakers like GM and Volkswagen have also slowed production. Rivian is preparing to launch its more affordable R2 SUV model next year in a challenging market. The layoffs reflect the company's efforts to improve operational efficiency amid slowing sales and significant policy changes affecting the EV sector.</p>

          <p>A massive, bright yellow vessel named the TX-10,000, America's largest heavy-lift ship, has docked at the Port of Pensacola, drawing significant attention from local residents. The vessel, which has a lift capacity of up to 7,500 tons and is used for offshore oil operations, is temporarily visiting Pensacola to wait out heavy weather in the Gulf of Mexico. Previously known as the VB-10,000, it played a key role in the largest wreck removal in U.S. history, salvaging the Golden Ray car carrier.

          <p>The FDA has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines for a more targeted population, primarily adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness. While officials state anyone can get a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower official approval may limit access for some. Eligible conditions include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, and obesity, among others. The change in strategy means vaccine availability at pharmacies may be more restricted, and some may require a prescription depending on state regulations.</p>
