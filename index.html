            <p>Following an attack on prison officers by Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi, the Prison Officers' Association (POA) is demanding that staff be immediately equipped with electric stun guns in the UK's most dangerous jails. The POA is calling for specially trained staff to be able to deploy tasers to neutralize threats, as current equipment like batons and incapacitant spray are deemed inadequate. The Ministry of Justice has launched a full, independent review into the incident, while the POA is also renewing calls for stab vests for all staff and "Supermax"-style rules for high-risk inmates. This comes amid criticism that current protective equipment is insufficient for the level of threat prison officers face.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing sensitive details about a March attack on Houthis in Yemen via the Signal messaging app, this time in a group chat that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The information shared reportedly included flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets involved in the attack. This follows a previous incident where Hegseth inadvertently shared similar information with a journalist, prompting investigations into potential leaks. Democrats are calling for Hegseth's firing, while the Pentagon dismisses the reports, claiming no classified information was shared. </p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month to "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders." The IDF claims its troops opened fire believing they were facing a threat from enemy forces, and that six of the casualties were Hamas members. However, a spokeswoman for the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has dismissed the report as invalid, while a UN official suggested the investigation did not go far enough. The IDF has dismissed the deputy commander of the unit involved and will reprimand another commanding officer.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's US production hub due to the increased cost from tariffs imposed by both the US and China. The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, was one of several waiting at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. Trump recently raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, prompting China to impose a 125% tariff on US goods. This situation has created uncertainty for aircraft deliveries, with some airlines considering delaying deliveries rather than paying the duties.</p>

The New York Times was first to report Hegseth's sharing of the details in a second Signal group. The Pentagon's independent inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app "to determine the extent to which the Secretary of Defense and other DoD personnel complied with DoD policies and procedures" to conduct official business, the acting inspector general, Steven Stebbins, said in a notification letter to Hegseth.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%. This decision comes as China reported better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% year-on-year GDP rise in the first quarter. The PBOC's move allows it to focus on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The decision was in line with economists' expectations, and the Chinese yuan appreciated slightly following the announcement.

            <p>China has issued a warning against countries entering into trade deals with the United States that would harm China's economic interests, following reports that the US is pressuring nations to curb trade with China to avoid new tariffs.

Several countries, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, are reportedly negotiating trade deals with the US to avoid the tariffs.

            <p>As the U.S. tightens controls on Nvidia's sales to China, domestic AI chipmakers like Huawei stand to benefit. The Commerce Department's new export license requirements for Nvidia's H20 GPUs and additional chips from AMD could provide Chinese companies with greater impetus to grow and improve their solutions. Huawei, with its "Ascend 910" GPU series, is seen as a leader in China's race to find an Nvidia competitor. However, export controls also hinder China's ability to produce advanced GPUs at the same scale as Nvidia due to reliance on foreign chipmaking equipment.</p>

            <p>Women protesters in Guinea-Bissau attacked a Chinese-run zircon mining site in the northwest of the country, setting fire to equipment. The protest was triggered by the authorities' failure to address complaints that the mining activity was damaging farms and harming the local environment. Several women and a village leader were arrested following the protest at Nhiquin, where Chinese companies have been operating since 2022. The interior minister confirmed that all the facilities at the site had been burned down.</p>

            <p>Home Plate BBQ, an American-style restaurant in Beijing, is reprinting menus to remove American beef due to the US-China trade war. The restaurant is switching to Australian beef as Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on top of existing 22% tariffs have made American beef unaffordable. The restaurant uses about 7 to 8 tonnes of brisket each month. Pork ribs will now be sourced from Canada. This situation reflects a broader trend in Beijing restaurants, where many are switching to Australian beef due to the high cost of American beef.</p>

The program's funding is expected to run out by the end of next year, potentially leading to a major loss of rental assistance and subsequent evictions. Congress could decide to allocate additional funds, but it faces challenges due to Republican efforts to cut federal spending. Advocates are lobbying for additional funding to prevent the disruption of housing for vulnerable populations.</p>
