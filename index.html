          <p>The White House has informed the Smithsonian Institution of a comprehensive review of its museums and exhibits to ensure content aligns with President Trump's directive to celebrate "American exceptionalism." This review aims to remove what the administration terms divisive or partisan narratives ahead of the nation's 250th anniversary. Eight major museums, including the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, must submit materials for evaluation. The move follows an executive order targeting the museums for allegedly promoting a "race-centered ideology," raising concerns about political influence over cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>While on a private family holiday in the United Kingdom, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held informal meetings with senior Conservative Party figures Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp. The meeting, which took place in the Cotswolds, was reportedly initiated by Vance's team. This follows an official meeting Vance had with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy to discuss international affairs earlier in his trip. The discussions with the Conservative shadow ministers, who hold similar policy positions on issues like immigration, highlight ongoing transatlantic political networking outside of formal diplomatic channels.</p>

          <p>The Texas state Senate has passed new Republican-drawn congressional maps, a key legislative priority that previously led House Democrats to flee the state to deny a quorum. The Senate achieved its necessary quorum after two Democrats remained on the floor, allowing the bill to pass 19-2. Critics have condemned the maps as an extreme partisan gerrymander designed to solidify Republican power. The legislation is now stalled as it cannot proceed without a vote in the House, where the Democratic boycott continues to prevent official business from taking place.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers are closely studying the electronic warfare tactics from the Ukraine conflict to gain critical lessons for their own defense capabilities. A recently published paper detailed an early phase of the war that involved extensive jamming of all major satellite navigation systems, including the U.S. GPS and China's Beidou. This event is being treated as the first major electronic warfare engagement between great powers, offering a valuable real-world case study. The analysis aims to identify vulnerabilities in global navigation systems and develop more robust countermeasures for potential future conflicts involving China.</p>

          <p>President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), E. J. Antoni, has previously proposed suspending the agency's influential monthly jobs report. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, questioned the report's accuracy and suggested relying solely on more precise, though less timely, quarterly data until methodological issues are resolved. His nomination comes after Trump fired the previous BLS commissioner, accusing her of rigging jobs data for political purposes. The move has sparked alarm among economists over the potential politicization and loss of integrity of crucial U.S. economic data.</p>

          <p>Officials in Juneau, Alaska, have urged some residents to evacuate as a glacial dam outburst flood begins from the Mendenhall Glacier.

The National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the Mendenhall River, which is expected to crest at a new record high, posing a significant threat to nearby homes. This phenomenon has become an annual summer concern for the community, with past floods causing catastrophic damage to property along the riverbanks.</p>

          <p>Illinois has enacted the "Sonya Massey Act," a new law creating stricter hiring standards for police officers across the state. Signed by Governor JB Pritzker, the legislation mandates that law enforcement agencies conduct more comprehensive background checks and review all prior employment records before making a job offer. The law is named for Sonya Massey, who was killed in 2024 by a deputy with a documented history of misconduct at previous agencies. The bipartisan measure aims to prevent problematic officers from moving between departments and to help rebuild community trust in law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A political analysis in The Atlantic argues that a core component of President Trump's strategy is to force his opponents into dilemmas with no good outcomes, thereby undermining democratic norms regardless of their response. The article uses the current debate over gerrymandering as an example, where Democrats must choose between upholding their principles of fair maps or fighting back with their own partisan redistricting. This approach was also seen when officials had to decide between defying a presidential order or executing a potentially harmful policy. This tactic effectively creates no-win scenarios that benefit Trump's agenda by making any form of resistance politically fraught.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon and the bank's chief economist, Jan Hatzius, over their analysis of his tariff policies. In a social media post, Trump suggested Solomon should replace Hatzius or "focus on being a DJ," referencing the CEO's side hobby. The rebuke followed a Goldman Sachs research note warning that American consumers will ultimately bear an increasing share of the costs from the new tariffs. Trump refuted this, claiming the tariffs are generating massive revenue for the U.S. Treasury and that foreign governments and companies are paying for them. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests this situation offers China a chance to build confidence with its neighbors by establishing transparent water-sharing mechanisms.

          <p>Danielle Spencer, best known for her role as the sharp-witted younger sister Dee Thomas on the 1970s sitcom "What's Happening!!," has passed away at the age of 60. A representative confirmed she died after a prolonged battle with cancer. Spencer's character was beloved for her deadpan delivery and famous catchphrase, "Ooh, I'm gonna tell mama." Despite a severe car accident during the show's run that caused lifelong health issues, she later pursued a career in veterinary medicine. Her co-star Haywood Nelson remembered her as a "brilliant, loving, positive, pragmatic warrior" and a cherished member of their cast family.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly instructed domestic companies to avoid using specific, less-advanced artificial intelligence chips from U.S. firms Nvidia and AMD for government and national security purposes. The warning applies to Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI380 chips, which were designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. This development comes shortly after the White House confirmed a deal where the chipmakers would give 15% of their China revenues to the U.S. government. The move signals China's continued push for technological self-sufficiency and deepens the ongoing tech rivalry between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The United States has filed criminal charges against Jimmy Cherizier, the notorious Haitian gang leader known as "Barbecue," for violating U.S. sanctions. The indictment alleges that Cherizier and a U.S. citizen, Bazile Richardson, solicited funds from the Haitian diaspora in the U.S. to buy firearms and finance the violent activities of his gang alliance, Viv Ansanm. Cherizier, who remains at large in Haiti, is accused of numerous human rights abuses, including a key role in the 2018 La Saline massacre. U.S. officials stated they will continue to pursue those who enable violence and instability in Haiti.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines' parent company saw its stock plunge by nearly 40% after it issued a warning about its ability to remain in business. In a quarterly report, the budget carrier stated there is "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a "going concern" for the next year, citing adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. The warning comes just months after the airline emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Despite restructuring efforts and cost-cutting measures, including pilot furloughs, the company emphasized a pressing need for more liquidity to sustain its operations.</p>

          <p>Tesla is actively hiring vehicle operators in New York City to test its "automated driving systems," despite not having applied for the necessary state or city permits to conduct such tests. A job posting seeks drivers in Queens for data collection, while city and state transportation officials confirmed that Tesla has not submitted any applications for autonomous vehicle testing. This approach contrasts with competitors like Waymo, which is currently undergoing the formal review process. The move highlights Tesla's aggressive strategy to advance its robotaxi ambitions, even if it means operating ahead of regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>England is officially experiencing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33°C (91.4°F) in several locations. The sustained period of hot, dry weather has led to what experts are calling "nationally significant" water shortages, impacting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. An amber heat-health alert is in effect for much of the country, and millions of people are under hosepipe bans to conserve water. While the heat is expected to ease briefly with potential thunderstorms, the recurring heatwaves are intensifying concerns about the long-term impacts of climate change on the UK's weather patterns and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. inflation rate holding steady, financial experts are analyzing the best strategies for individuals burdened by high-interest credit card debt. While stable consumer prices might seem to reduce financial pressure, many analysts argue that debt forgiveness or settlement remains a crucial tool. They emphasize that credit card interest rates are near historic highs, vastly outpacing inflation and causing debt to grow rapidly. Taking proactive steps to reduce this debt now, they suggest, allows individuals to build savings and financial stability before potential future economic shocks, such as the full impact of tariffs, are felt.

          <p>The Crystal Palace, the iconic restaurant and music venue in Bakersfield, California, founded by country music legend Buck Owens, has abruptly closed its doors. For 28 years, the venue was a temple for the "Bakersfield Sound" and hosted performances by nearly every major country star, from Willie Nelson to Taylor Swift. The foundation that owns the venue cited the lingering effects of the pandemic and the difficult economics of the restaurant business as reasons for the closure.

When asked about Newsom's opposition, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, "Bring it on, Gavin," asserting the administration is within its legal rights. The conflict stems from a federal plan to resolve antisemitism findings against the university by demanding over $1 billion and sweeping campus changes, which has frozen hundreds of research grants. Newsom has called the move "extortion" and a "political shakedown," setting the stage for a major legal battle between California and the federal government.</p>
