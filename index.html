          <h2>Biden's PSA Blood Test History Aligns with Medical Recommendations</h2>

          <p>According to a spokesperson, former President Joe Biden last underwent a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test in 2014, which aligns with current medical guidelines for men over 70. Current recommendations suggest men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of PSA testing with their doctor, while those 70 and older generally should not receive PSA-based screening due to the risk of false positives. After Biden announced he had an aggressive form of prostate cancer, former President Donald Trump questioned the timing of the announcement, but Biden's representatives clarified that doctors discovered a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical last week. A PSA screening is not a perfect test, as the risk of false positives increases with age, but some people with cancer might still have good PSA scores.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco soon after. The robotaxi service will initially include about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of FSD (Full Self-Driving) Unsupervised software. Musk has been promising fully self-driving cars for years, but Tesla does not yet offer a vehicle safe to use without human supervision. Musk stated that starting with a small number of vehicles is prudent to confirm everything is running smoothly before scaling up to thousands of vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued temporary restrictions on flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent technology outages, air traffic controller staffing shortages, and runway construction. The new restrictions will cap flights at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with continued limits on weekends through December, and then increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour until Oct. 25. United Airlines, which operates about 70 percent of flights at Newark, welcomed the restrictions. The FAA aims to relieve the inconvenience to travelers from excessive flight delays and has announced incentives to recruit and retain air traffic controllers to address nationwide staffing shortages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the construction of a "Golden Dome" missile defense system to protect the American homeland from missile attacks. The project, similar to Israel's Iron Dome, will receive $25 billion in initial funding and is expected to cost $175 billion overall, with a major phase completed in under three years. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein will oversee the project, which aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. Hegseth emphasized the system's importance in responding to growing threats from countries like Russia and China, while Guetlein highlighted the need to protect the American way of life from increasingly capable adversaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge support for a massive budget package, emphasizing the need for party unity and threatening to oust those who oppose the bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in securing enough votes due to divisions among conservatives, moderates, and those concerned about the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates resist cuts to the program, and Republicans from blue states demand adjustments to the SALT deduction. Trump insisted that Medicaid cuts would only target waste, fraud, and abuse, and urged Republicans to pass the bill, with Johnson working to address remaining concerns within the conference.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will permit the use of COVID vaccines for adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions this fall, but will require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders cited evidence suggesting uncertain benefits for younger individuals who have already been vaccinated or had COVID. The FDA's scientific advisers are set to meet to decide on the composition of the COVID vaccine to be made available in the fall. Some experts worry the new criteria are overly restrictive, while others agree with the agency's rationale but fear the restrictions will limit access for healthy Americans at high risk due to their jobs or other reasons.</p>

The company is attempting to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors can, but it is also wary of AI's potential for inaccuracies.

          <p>President Trump appears to have backed off from joining European efforts to impose new sanctions on Russia, signaling a shift towards prioritizing business deals with Moscow. After a call with President Putin, Trump indicated that Russia and Ukraine should resolve the conflict themselves, and he expressed a desire to normalize relations to facilitate trade. This move has created a rift with European allies who plan to proceed with sanctions. While existing sanctions and intelligence sharing remain, the change suggests a potential end to increased diplomatic pressure and financial restrictions from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te is facing increasing political stalemates both at home and abroad as he enters his second year in office. The breakthrough in US-China trade negotiations last week highlighted a sobering reality for the Lai administration, with even Washington willing to strike deals with Beijing that leave Taipei on the sidelines. Lai's efforts to strengthen Taiwan's military readiness have also met with a lukewarm response from the White House. Domestically, Lai faces an opposition-controlled legislature that has blocked key initiatives and labeled him a "dictator."</p>

          <p>Several teenagers are finding that nicotine pouches are a new, unregulated addiction. Some are using the pouches to get off of vapes, but it is just leading to another addiction, with some users taking up to 15 pouches a day. Experts say that the pouches are addictive and have harmful side effects. Some campaigners fear that the ban on disposable vapes could see more young people turning to the stronger nicotine pouches. Retailers say that they do not sell the pouches to under 18s, but the teenagers say that they have no problem buying them.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis has renewed questions about his health during his time in the White House, with some doctors surprised it wasn't detected earlier. A Biden aide stated that the former president's prior medical check for prostate cancer was more than a decade ago, in 2014. Republicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history at 81, was mentally and physically unfit for office. A new book details Biden's physical deterioration, and some claim that Biden had been ill with cancer for some time, without necessarily knowing it.</p>

The school, which operated from 1855 to 1957, was described by Hochul as a "place of nightmares" and "a site of sanctioned ethnic cleansing." The apology marked the first official visit by a New York governor to the traditional Seneca territories, where the school was located.

          <p>Venezuelans living in the U.S., particularly in Florida, are concerned about the potential loss of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) following a Supreme Court decision. This ruling immediately strips TPS from hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans, leading to fears of deportation back to Venezuela, which is mired in economic and political turmoil. Cecilia Gonzalez Herrera, a plaintiff challenging the order, and others with TPS expiring in September, may face immediate consequences such as the expiration of work permits and driver's licenses. While some Venezuelan-Americans who voted for Trump express remorse, Republican officials in Florida have been muted in their reaction.</p>

          <p>Members of the Trump administration have recently discussed suspending habeas corpus, a foundational principle protecting against unlawful detention. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem inaccurately described it as the president’s right to deport people, while others suggested the president could suspend it, a power reserved for Congress. Habeas corpus, dating back to Magna Carta, empowers courts to protect individual liberty by requiring proof of legal grounds for detention. The administration has challenged this limit, but the courts have consistently upheld the principle. The new administration is considering suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, arguing that illegal immigration constitutes an invasion.</p>
