          <h2>Global Study Reveals Widespread Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Livestock Waste</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:00:10 EDT</div>

          <p>A comprehensive US-China study has identified an alarming abundance and diversity of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) within the global livestock resistome. Published in Science Advances, this extensive research, spanning 14 years and 26 countries, developed a crucial framework to pinpoint high-risk hotspots where these genes could easily transfer from bacteria in animal waste to humans, such as E. coli. The findings highlight the critical need for targeted research and policy interventions to mitigate the escalating threat of antimicrobial resistance. This groundbreaking article underscores the significant public health implications stemming from agricultural practices and environmental contamination.</p>

          <p>President Trump has drastically reduced his deadline for Russian President Vladimir Putin to achieve a Ukraine ceasefire, shortening it from 50 days to just 10-12 days due to a lack of progress. Speaking from Scotland, Trump expressed deep disappointment over continued Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities, threatening significant secondary tariffs on Moscow's trade partners. Concurrently, he announced a "huge" new trade agreement with the European Union, which includes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., substantial EU investment in the U.S., and massive U.S. energy purchases. This article highlights Trump's assertive stance on both geopolitical conflicts and international trade during his recent trip.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla signed a substantial $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of semiconductors, as revealed in a regulatory filing and Musk's social media posts. The agreement, effective July 2025 through 2033, designates Samsung's new Texas fabrication plant to produce Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, a move Musk described as strategically vital. While Samsung's filing initially kept the counterparty secret, Musk's confirmation and hints of an even larger deal underscore the significant collaboration aimed at maximizing manufacturing efficiency. This article highlights a major development in the automotive and semiconductor industries.</p>

          <p>This deeply personal article by a wheelchair user illuminates the pervasive challenges disabled individuals face in finding safe and accessible housing, recounting experiences from being trapped in a high-rise during an evacuation to encountering discriminatory housing clauses. The author highlights how most homes and older buildings lack essential accessibility features, often requiring costly renovations or leaving disabled people unable to use basic rooms like bathrooms. This article underscores how historical exclusion and societal "fear of disability" perpetuate inaccessible architecture, leading to isolation and preventing full participation in community and family life.</p>
