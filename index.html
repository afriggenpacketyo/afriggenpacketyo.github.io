          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 6% increase after Elon Musk indicated he would dedicate more time to the company and President Trump suggested potential tariff reductions on China. This surge occurred despite Tesla reporting weaker-than-expected first-quarter results, including a 20% drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income. Musk also mentioned that he will be scaling back his work at the Department of Government Efficiency, which investors interpreted positively. The market reacted favorably to these developments, overlooking the disappointing earnings report.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, a former paddleboard firm owner, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding excursion in Wales in 2021. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead the tour in hazardous conditions. The group encountered dangerous conditions on the river, including a strong current and a weir, leading to the deaths of Paul O'Dwyer, Andrea Powell, Morgan Rogers, and Nicola Wheatley. The judge criticized Lloyd's "abysmal" approach to safety and her blatant disregard for the high risk of death.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price has been rising for a third consecutive day, heading towards $95,000, amidst a broader market rally. This surge follows President Trump's softened stance on China tariffs and reduced criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The cryptocurrency has recovered approximately half of its losses since Inauguration Day, hovering just below the flat line for the year. Market analysts suggest that the surge reflects investors capitalizing on a dip in an asset seen as a compelling option for portfolio diversification and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.

The strike, which began on March 11, is over plans to downgrade some refuse workers, potentially leading to pay cuts. The union has accused the city council of inconsistent communication during negotiations. The strike has led to a major incident declaration due to public health concerns, with waste accumulating in the city. Regular bin collections have reportedly resumed, but recycling and garden waste collections remain affected.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term as US president has been marked by a determination to disrupt established domestic and foreign policy norms, particularly through the imposition of steep tariffs. These actions have strained relations with America's closest allies, creating an opportunity for China to potentially expand its influence. With the Western alliance fractured, China may be able to overcome the diplomatic, economic, and military pressures it faced during the previous administration.
