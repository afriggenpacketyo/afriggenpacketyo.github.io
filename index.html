          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility has resulted in the deaths of at least three police officers. The blast occurred in the parking lot of the Special Enforcement Bureau, where sources indicate officers were handling an unexploded ordnance from a recent call when it detonated. The precise cause is under investigation by multiple agencies, including the ATF and DHS. The incident highlights the inherent dangers law enforcement bomb squads face daily when dealing with unstable explosive materials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is pushing back against reports of incinerated aid, stating that 59,000 metric tons of food assistance are actively being distributed globally. An official clarified that all food supplies expiring before October 2026 have already been programmed for delivery to crisis zones like Syria and Sudan, calling claims of widespread waste false. This response comes amid a broader restructuring of U.S. foreign aid policy and the dissolution of USAID, with critics raising concerns about the administration's management of humanitarian assistance.</p>

          <p>A new spending law has introduced a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many travelers with nonimmigrant visas, such as foreign students and temporary H-1B workers. According to the law, the fee may be reimbursed if visitors comply with their visa terms, like departing the U.S. on time, though the collection and reimbursement processes are not yet established. This new charge is part of broader changes that critics, like the American Immigration Council, argue will make legal pathways to the U.S. more difficult and expensive.</p>

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" extends previous tax cuts and introduces new ones, but a nonpartisan analysis shows its benefits are skewed towards the wealthy. The Tax Policy Center found that while the average household will save about $2,900, approximately 60% of the total tax breaks will go to the top 20% of earners. For instance, the highest-income households will see savings averaging over $12,500, representing a much larger percentage of their income compared to lower-income families.

          <p>Amid growing bipartisan pressure for transparency, President Trump has asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This directive follows a recent report about a letter with Trump's signature being found in Epstein's possession. While the move is a response to public demand, legal experts caution that grand jury secrecy is tightly protected, and critics argue the transcripts would represent only a small fraction of the total evidence.</p>

The report from reinsurance broker Gallagher Re indicates that billion-dollar storm events are becoming more frequent, suggesting that annual losses exceeding $100 billion is a "new market reality."

          <p>A new report about a message from Donald Trump in a 2003 "birthday book" for Jeffrey Epstein has renewed focus on their long and complicated relationship. This article traces their connection, which flourished in New York and Palm Beach social circles from the late 1980s until a reported falling-out in 2004 over a real estate dispute. While Trump once publicly praised Epstein, he has since tried to distance himself, and no victims have accused him of involvement in Epstein's sex crimes in court proceedings.</p>

The book argues that the princes were not murdered by their uncle, Richard III, as Shakespeare's play suggests, but in fact survived. Using a cold-case methodology, the "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly uncovered numerous "proofs of life" that challenge the conventional historical narrative.</p>
