          <p>China's jobless rate for the 16 to 24 age group, excluding students, registered a slight decrease to 17.7% in September, down from 18.9% in August, following a period marked by a record number of university graduations. Despite this marginal improvement, the youth unemployment rate remains persistently high, highlighting significant and ongoing challenges for young job seekers in the country. The article provides a personal account from computer science graduate Zhu Yiran, who has applied to numerous state-owned enterprises since September without success, underscoring the intense competition and difficulty in securing employment. This situation reflects broader economic pressures and the critical need for more effective job creation strategies for China's younger demographic.</p>

          <p>Following a Panorama undercover investigation, over 300 individuals have contacted the BBC with serious allegations of racism, corruption, and victim bullying by police forces across England. The investigation itself uncovered evidence of misogyny and officers celebrating excessive force at a London police station. Many women shared harrowing experiences of mistreatment when reporting domestic abuse and sexual violence, with some stating that reporting their sexual assault felt akin to being sexually assaulted again. In response to these latest allegations, the National Police Chiefs' Council has affirmed its commitment to fostering a culture based on integrity and trust, alongside improving vetting and misconduct procedures within the police force.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly nearing a trade agreement with the U.S., which could see Washington significantly cut tariffs on Indian exports, potentially from 50% to 15-16%. In return, New Delhi is considering scaling back its oil purchases from Russia and possibly increasing U.S. corn imports. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated assertions that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to reduce Russian oil imports, a contentious issue that previously led to additional U.S. tariffs. The article highlights ongoing negotiations to stabilize energy markets and boost bilateral trade, which reached a record $132.2 billion last fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has launched a sharp personal attack on NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, publicly questioning his intelligence and accusing him of attempting to undermine the space agency. This criticism arose after NASA indicated it would consider moon landers from companies other than SpaceX, which currently holds a $2.9 billion contract for the Artemis III mission but has faced significant delays and multiple Starship failures. Duffy responded by emphasizing that competition among innovators benefits America in the ongoing "second space race" against China. The article highlights the tension between SpaceX's ambitious timelines and NASA's broader strategic goals for lunar exploration.</p>

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has formally urged the Trump administration to halt the demolition of the White House East Wing until a thorough review of President Trump's proposed ballroom plans is completed. This nonprofit organization, chartered by Congress, voiced significant concern that the planned ballroom annex's substantial size would "overwhelm the White House itself," disrupting its carefully balanced classical design. Similar apprehensions have been raised by the Society of Architectural Historians and the American Institute of Architects, who stress the necessity for the new construction to harmonize with the existing architectural proportions. The administration, however, has dismissed these objections as "manufactured outrage."</p>

          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year increase in September, ending four months of decline, primarily driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped by 13.3%, with auto shipments particularly affected. This decline to the U.S. continues despite a trade deal clinched in July that reduced tariffs on Japanese exports. The article notes that while external demand is expected to recover, U.S.-China trade tensions cloud the outlook. Japan's new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's loose monetary policy stance is expected to weaken the yen, potentially benefiting exporters.</p>

          <h2>Gold and Silver Experience Significant Tumble, Halting Recent Rally</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold and silver prices saw their largest daily drops in years, with spot gold falling over 6% and silver over 8%, as a remarkable rally in precious metals paused. This decline is attributed to easing U.S.-China trade tensions, a stronger U.S. dollar, and overbought technical indicators. While some analysts suggest this is a necessary correction, others remain bullish, citing elevated inflation, low real interest rates, and geopolitical concerns as factors supporting gold. Wall Street analysts maintain optimistic long-term forecasts, with some predicting gold could reach $6,000 per ounce by 2026 or 2029. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles communities are grappling with surging copper wire theft, leaving many streetlights inoperable and raising safety concerns. The Sixth Street Bridge, for instance, remains dark after seven miles of wire were stolen, costing millions in repairs. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal. The bill requires buyers to verify seller identity and lawful ownership, makes certain public scrap metal illegal to possess, and increases penalties for recyclers, aiming to reduce the incentive for theft. The article highlights local efforts to fund streetlight maintenance and embrace solar lighting.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that while the U.S. currently leads in science and technology, its long-term dominance over China cannot be taken for granted, especially given China's clear edge in STEM education. The article suggests that U.S. policies, such as the Trump administration's crackdown on universities and immigration, contradict insights from Nobel laureates on fostering innovation. It also highlights how large tech corporations stifle competition by acquiring startups or lobbying regulators, which, according to mathematical modeling by Nobel winners Aghion and Howitt, ultimately undermines growth. This perspective emphasizes the need for the U.S. to re-evaluate its approach to maintain its technological lead.</p>

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy criticized Democrats, labeling the ongoing government shutdown impasse as the "Seinfeld shutdown" because it's "about nothing." McCarthy argued that Republicans are now advocating for a "clean" spending bill at existing levels, while Democrats are seeking extensions for health insurance subsidies and a rollback of Medicaid restrictions. He contrasted this with the 2013 shutdown, where Republicans pushed for policy changes. McCarthy suggested Democrats are struggling to find a message and are fearful of their rank-and-file members, highlighting the country's increased political division and the difficulty in assigning blame for the current stalemate.</p>
