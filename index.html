          <p>As debutants and the lowest-ranked team at Euro 2025, the Welsh women's national football team is relying on strong team unity and cultural identity to compete against formidable opponents. Coach Rhian Wilkinson emphasizes the importance of the "Welsh red vein" running through the squad, which includes players with Welsh heritage from abroad. The team has fostered a close-knit environment through activities like book clubs and yoga, aiming to overcome their underdog status. The tournament is seen as a pivotal moment for increasing the visibility and inspiring the next generation of female players in Wales.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Chinese model, identified by the surname Zhong, has been successfully rescued after being tricked into traveling to Myanmar for a fraudulent job. Zhong initially flew to Bangkok for what he believed was a magazine cover shoot, only to be taken across the border. He managed to alert his sister via a video call, who then raised the alarm with authorities in Thailand. The Chinese embassy confirmed his rescue, which was a collaborative effort, and issued a warning to its citizens about overseas "high-paying job" scams.</p>

          <p>A new short film titled "Final Finishers" shifts the focus from elite athletes to the everyday runners who complete the New York City Marathon long after sunset. The film, which premiered at the Tribeca Festival, celebrates the perseverance and personal stories of those at the back of the pack, arguing that their journeys are often more relatable and inspiring. It features individuals like Michael Ring, who ran the marathon after being paralyzed by an autoimmune condition. The film is part of a growing trend to recognize the achievements of all participants, not just the winners.</p>

          <p>Paul Stephenson, 57, has been sentenced to life in prison plus 92 years for a drunk driving incident that resulted in the death of U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Matt Anderson. The crash, which occurred at a gas station in August 2024, also injured Anderson's four children. Stephenson, who had a blood alcohol level 2.5 times the legal limit, was convicted of first-degree murder in what was his third DUI conviction.

The legislation's massive increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) also drew sharp criticism.

These cuts are expected to cause millions to lose health coverage and food assistance, and will likely lead to the closure of rural hospitals and nursing homes.

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed on or around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright orange glow and a loud bang reported by dozens of people in the Scottish Highlands. Using captured footage and trajectory calculations, UKMON has narrowed the potential landing area to a vast region between two lochs. The organization has appealed to hillwalkers to be on the lookout for the rare space rocks.</p>

          <p>A strike by French air traffic controllers has led to significant travel disruption, with about 40% of flights canceled at all Paris airports. The strike, which intensified on Friday, also affected other major French cities and flights passing through French airspace, impacting tens of thousands of passengers during the peak summer season. The unions are demanding better working conditions, citing insufficient staffing to handle the surge in air travel and salaries eroded by inflation. France's transport minister has called the timing of the strike, coinciding with the start of school holidays, "unacceptable."</p>

In a recent interview, Starmer defended his approach, describing himself as a pragmatist who is willing to change course based on new information, rather than an ideologue. He took responsibility for the recent turmoil surrounding the welfare U-turn, which created a £5 billion hole in his government's budget, admitting the process was not handled correctly.

Its cancellation has led to a steep decline in these shipments, with some estimates showing a 43% drop in May.

Prosecutors argued the woman was unable to consent, presenting photos of her passed out, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual.
