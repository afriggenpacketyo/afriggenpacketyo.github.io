          <p>An apparent Israeli military raid has struck the Holy Family Church in Gaza City, which was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem confirmed that two people were killed and several others were injured, including the parish priest. The Israel Defense Forces stated it is reviewing the incident and regrets any harm to civilians or religious sites, while Italy's Prime Minister condemned the attack on the civilian population. The church had been a refuge for both Christians and Muslims, including children with disabilities.</p>

          <p>Studies indicate a growing prevalence of smartphone addiction, which is linked to negative mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety, as well as physical issues such as sleep disturbances. Scientists suggest that overcoming this behavioral addiction requires a multi-faceted approach rather than a single quick fix. Recommended strategies include creating physical distance from the device, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. Experts also emphasize the importance of understanding the root causes of the addiction, which can sometimes be a coping mechanism for other mental health challenges, and suggest therapies like CBT.</p>

          <p>Russian customs and security services have intercepted a massive 1,800-pound shipment of cocaine, valued at over $153 million, hidden within banana containers. The discovery, described as Russia's largest bust from Latin America this year, was made following a tip from foreign counterparts about a South American criminal group's smuggling operation. The cocaine packages were reportedly disguised in briquettes with a luxury brand label. This incident is part of a growing trend where drug traffickers use Russia as a transit hub, often concealing narcotics in banana shipments.</p>

          <p>Auburn University men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl has addressed rumors that he might run for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, suggesting he may not pursue a political career. Pearl questioned whether he could have a greater impact as a senator compared to his current role as a coach, where he focuses on mentoring and educating young people. He expressed skepticism about his ability to effect change within Washington's dysfunctional political environment. A fervent supporter of Israel and former President Trump, Pearl's name was floated as a potential candidate to replace Sen. Tommy Tuberville.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed a rescission package to claw back $9 billion in federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and public broadcasting entities like NPR and PBS. The bill, a legislative priority for the Trump administration's efforts to reduce government spending, now moves to the House for a final vote. Democrats have criticized the measure, arguing it will harm Americans who depend on public media and damage the nation's global standing. A proposed $400 million cut to the PEPFAR global health program was removed to secure broader support.</p>

          <p>The United States has completed the construction of new naval facilities at Oyster Bay in the Philippines, intended to enhance the maintenance and repair capabilities for the Philippine military's small watercraft. The U.S. embassy has clarified that the site is not a military base, emphasizing that all U.S. military activities are conducted in full coordination with its ally. However, analysts suggest the development will directly strengthen the Philippine Navy's operational capacity in its territorial disputes with China. The move is also seen as potentially paving the way for shared use of naval facilities by U.S. forces in the future.</p>

          <p>The average cost for parents in Britain to place one child in a summer holiday club for the six-week break has risen to £1,076, according to new data from the charity Coram. Prices vary significantly by region, with some areas seeing hikes of up to 13% from last year, driven by high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run options. Many families struggle with the upfront costs, as government assistance for those on Universal Credit is paid in arrears. The situation is further complicated by a lack of available places, especially for older children and those with special needs.</p>

          <p>For decades, Russ Miller, known as the 'River Cowboy,' has dedicated himself to removing thousands of discarded tires from Kentucky's rivers. Miller's grassroots efforts began in the 1980s and led to the formation of the cleanup group Friends of Red River, which tackles the pervasive issue of illegal tire dumping. Each year, an estimated one million of Kentucky's four million waste tires are unaccounted for, often ending up in waterways. While state-level resolutions now acknowledge the problem, volunteers like Miller continue to perform the grueling work of extracting tires and other trash from the state's scenic rivers.</p>

          <p>At the direction of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans are preparing to redraw the state's congressional map in an effort to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This move is seen as risky, as it would require spreading Republican voters from safe districts into more competitive ones, potentially making them vulnerable in future elections. Critics argue the plan would further dilute the voting power of the state's growing non-white population, who already faced diminished influence after the 2021 redistricting. The effort comes as Democrats consider a legislative walkout to block the new maps.</p>

The unraveling is due to conflicts with his ultra-Orthodox and far-right partners over two key issues: military draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox community and the pursuit of a ceasefire deal in Gaza.

          <p>Germany's fertility rate fell to 1.35 children per woman in 2024, its lowest level in almost two decades, according to the Federal Statistical Office. This continued decline, which has been observed for years, raises long-term concerns about demographic shifts and their impact on the nation's pension and healthcare systems. The rate for women with German citizenship dropped to 1.23, a low not seen since 1996. While the birth rate among foreign women living in Germany was higher at 1.84, it also saw a decline, contributing to the overall downward trend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration appears to be shifting the Justice Department's focus away from prosecuting white-collar crime, unless it aligns with specific political narratives, such as those involving immigrants or Democratic opponents. Since Trump took office, the DOJ has paused enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and federal prosecutions for white-collar offenses have declined over 10% compared to last year. This approach is reflected in a DOJ memo that emphasizes avoiding burdens on businesses, leading to concerns that corporate corruption may face less scrutiny. Meanwhile, the administration has granted clemency to numerous convicted financial fraudsters.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's job market is continuing to weaken, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.7%, its highest point in four years. Concurrently, the annual rate of pay growth slowed to 5% in the three months to May, and the number of job vacancies has been in continuous decline for three years. Analysts suggest these indicators make an interest rate cut by the Bank of England next month more probable. The slowdown is partly attributed to a recent rise in employer national insurance contributions, which has reportedly discouraged firms from hiring new staff.</p>

This represents a significant escalation, with Israel intervening in an unfolding conflict between the Syrian army and Druze militias. Syria's interim government has accused Israel of attempting to sow division and create chaos within the country as it emerges from a long civil war.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is overhauling the federal student loan system, a move that consumer advocates warn could make monthly payments unmanageable for many borrowers. The Biden-era SAVE plan is now defunct, and a new bill phases out several other income-driven repayment options, leaving future borrowers with fewer choices. Under the new 'Repayment Assistance Plan,' or RAP, monthly payments are projected to be significantly higher than under previous plans. Critics argue this will increase the risk of default for borrowers who relied on more affordable payment structures. (not investment advice)</p>

This withdrawal highlights major challenges for the industry, such as the high cost of green hydrogen and the difficulty of competing with cheaper, conventionally produced steel on the global market.

          <p>Researchers have detailed the remarkable seed dispersal mechanism of the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber. The fruit builds up internal fluid pressure until a slight disturbance causes it to burst, launching its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour and distances of nearly 40 feet. Micro-CT scans and high-speed video revealed that the fruit orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle for maximum distance. The seeds are also coated in an incredibly strong adhesive, suggesting they are designed to stick to whatever they hit, potentially aiding further dispersal.</p>
