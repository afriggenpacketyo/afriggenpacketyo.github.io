          <p>Severe weather, including tornadoes and strong winds, swept across North Dakota, resulting in at least three fatalities in Cass County. The Cass County Sheriff's Office responded to reports of tornado damage in rural Enderlin, where storm chasers located two deceased individuals, with a third found shortly after. Governor Kelly Armstrong declared a statewide disaster and activated the State Emergency Operations Plan due to the widespread damage caused by the storms. The destructive thunderstorm event, a "derecho," brought wind gusts up to 106 mph and reports of nine tornadoes, along with heavy rain causing flash flooding and water rescues in Fargo.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Iran war has entered its second week, marked by further strikes on an Iranian nuclear research facility in Isfahan, with Iran warning the United States against military involvement. Israel has targeted centrifuge production sites and killed senior Iranian commanders, including one allegedly linked to the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack. Iran retaliated with drone and missile attacks, causing light injuries to some U.S. citizens, but Israeli defenses largely intercepted the barrages. As the conflict escalates, the U.S. is considering military intervention, while Israel continues its operations to eliminate Iran's nuclear program and also battles Hamas in Gaza, where recent strikes have resulted in numerous casualties.</p>

          <p>The UK recorded its hottest day of the year, reaching 33.2C, as a Met Office warning for thunderstorms took effect, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert is in place for England, with research suggesting a potential for nearly 600 heat-related deaths in England and Wales over four days. Train passengers in south London were evacuated due to a fault on a train, leading to delays and discomfort in the heat. Scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change, emphasizing the need to address warming to mitigate future impacts.</p>

The deployment's connection to Middle East tensions remains unclear, but the B-2 bombers are capable of carrying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a weapon potentially used against Iran's nuclear program. Experts are closely monitoring whether the bombers will move to a U.S.-British military base on Diego Garcia, considered an ideal location for operations in the Middle East. The move comes as Israel and Iran continue their conflict, with Israel claiming Iran is close to developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, known for his value investing approach, has been a net seller of stocks for ten consecutive quarters, accumulating a record level of cash at Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett's caution stems from high S&P 500 valuations, with the Shiller CAPE ratio reaching levels seen only twice before, suggesting expensive stock prices. This conservative stance may indicate a potential market correction or shift, as Buffett typically seeks undervalued opportunities. His recent moves suggest he may be positioning Berkshire Hathaway for future investment opportunities amidst market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
