          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, citing alleged problematic ties to China. The demand, made via social media, appears linked to concerns raised by Republican senators about Tan's investments in Chinese companies reportedly connected to the military. Intel's shares dropped following the president's unusual call for a private executive to step down. The company has been navigating a difficult turnaround plan while also receiving billions in U.S. government support to boost domestic chip manufacturing.</p>

In an interview, Huckabee emphasized it is not the role of the United States to dictate Israel's actions, though advice would be offered if requested. This comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated plans to take control of all of Gaza. Huckabee also commented on stalled ceasefire negotiations, blaming Hamas for their breakdown and reaffirming the U.S. position that the group must be defeated.</p>

          <p>Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana, has condemned the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for terminating nearly $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccine development. The decision, announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to shift funds toward what he termed "safer, broader vaccine platforms." Cassidy argued that the move undermines President Trump's health agenda and concedes important technology to China. The controversy highlights a growing rift within the Republican party over public health policy and vaccine technology.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, slightly lowering its storm prediction while still anticipating above-average activity. The new outlook projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine potentially becoming hurricanes. This adjustment reflects factors like a neutral El Niño phase and warmer ocean temperatures. Officials emphasize that despite the slight decrease in the forecast, communities in storm-prone areas should remain prepared as the peak of the season approaches in late summer.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller being the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi. Waller's odds surged after reports that President Trump's advisors favor his forward-looking approach to monetary policy. He has now overtaken previous front-runners Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. Waller, who was nominated to the Fed by Trump in 2020, recently dissented on the decision to hold rates steady, arguing the central bank's approach was "overly cautious." His potential nomination is seen by some as favorable for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article compares President Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner to Richard Nixon's actions in 1971. While Nixon was furious with BLS officials over jobs numbers and harbored anti-Semitic beliefs about them, he never directly fired the commissioner. The author, a former director of the Nixon Presidential Library, argues that Nixon operated with more restraint due to the political norms of his era. In contrast, Trump's public firing of the commissioner for producing numbers he disliked represents a more brazen and dangerous abuse of presidential authority.</p>

          <p>The political feud over Texas's congressional redistricting has escalated, with Republican Senator John Cornyn stating the FBI has agreed to help locate Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The Democrats left Texas to prevent a vote on a Republican-led plan that would create more GOP-leaning districts. Their absence denies the state legislature the necessary quorum to proceed. The situation grew more tense after a bomb threat was called into a hotel where some of the Democrats were staying in Illinois, highlighting the extreme measures surrounding the gerrymandering dispute.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order that will direct the Department of Labor to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) retirement plans. This move would open the door for investments like private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies to be included in defined contribution plans. The alternative asset industry has long advocated for this change, which could unlock trillions of dollars in retirement savings. However, the inclusion of these riskier, less transparent assets in mainstream retirement accounts also introduces new potential hazards for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

For investors seeking exposure without directly holding the assets, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust have become a popular and convenient option. However, the market is also seeing a rise in more complex products, such as leveraged ETFs, which offer amplified returns but come with significantly higher risk and are not suitable for long-term holding.
