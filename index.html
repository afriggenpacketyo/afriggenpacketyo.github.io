          <p>A Japanese court has ruled in favor of cabin crew members, ordering Jetstar Japan Co. to provide mandated breaks during flights and pay damages of 110,000 yen ($780) to each of the 35 plaintiffs. The lawsuit centered on the airline's violation of labor laws by not providing adequate rest periods for crew, leading to significant physical and psychological stress. The court rejected Jetstar Japan's claim that crew rests sufficed as breaks, emphasizing the need to protect the health and dignity of flight attendants for safe flights. The airline has expressed regret and filed an appeal.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin is demonstrating resilience, rising for a second day and testing key resistance levels around $88,000, while decoupling from the stock market's volatility. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin saw significant inflows, suggesting renewed investor interest despite broader economic uncertainties fueled by tariff announcements and Federal Reserve policy debates. Analysts note bitcoin's decreasing correlation with equities, indicating a potential shift in its role as a risk asset. However, low trading volumes suggest caution, with a significant catalyst needed to break above the $93,000 resistance level (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A top Beijing official, Xia Baolong, has strongly criticized U.S. tariffs on Hong Kong, claiming they are aimed at undermining the city's very survival, not just about trade. Xia highlighted that despite Hong Kong being a major source of the U.S. trade surplus, high tariffs have been imposed, which he deems "extremely arrogant and shameless." This rhetoric is seen by some observers as a rallying cry to Hong Kong officials and businesses to unite with Beijing in the ongoing trade conflict with the United States.</p>

The Trump administration insists that the "ball is in China's court," while Beijing's reluctance to reach out has seemingly fueled Trump's ire, leading to further restrictions on Chinese tech.</p>

          <p>Communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims in India's West Bengal state are being exploited for political gain, leading to violence over an amendment expanding government control over Muslim religious properties.

West Bengal is prone to political violence due to its history of social upheaval and mobilization for political control.

          <p>Bath & Body Works is well-positioned to navigate tariffs due to its domestic production, with 80% of its products made in the United States. This gives the company a key advantage over competitors who rely on imports, allowing them to maintain prices and profitability. The company's primary U.S. manufacturing facility, Beauty Park, enables quick response to consumer trends and minimizes the need for discounts. Analysts believe this strategic advantage will support projected sales growth.</p>

          <p>The Republican coalition, led by Donald Trump, maintains its cohesion through an alliance between traditional conservatives and national conservatives. While natcons prioritize wielding state power against their enemies, traditional conservatives focus on low taxes for the rich and decreased business regulation. This authoritarian-libertarian synthesis allows each faction to achieve its primary goals, despite tensions over issues like government spending and authoritarian tactics. Abandoning tax cuts for the wealthy would shatter this coalition, making it unlikely despite populist rhetoric.</p>

She emphasizes that relying solely on a 401(k) or IRA can be risky due to market volatility. This "just-in-case" fund should not be tied to the market, ensuring that retirees are not forced to sell investments at a loss to cover essential expenses. The average American household has saved approximately $333,000 for retirement, according to the Federal Reserve's 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances (not investment advice).</p>
