            <p>Before engaging in talks to acquire AI coding tool Windsurf, OpenAI explored buying Cursor, another AI code-writing startup. OpenAI reached out to Anysphere, the startup behind Cursor, multiple times but failed to gain traction. Cursor gained popularity for its coding assistance, drawing from Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, and was even preferred by some programmers over Microsoft's GitHub Copilot. OpenAI ultimately engaged in talks to acquire Windsurf for approximately $3 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will pursue the NHS if it fails to update its guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law.

Baroness Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, emphasized that single-sex services must be based on biological sex, but also recognized the rights of trans people, suggesting facilities like 'third spaces' for toilets.

The Monetary Policy Committee cited the need to strengthen the disinflation process and maintain a tight monetary stance until price stability is achieved.

While experts agree that diagnoses are increasing, they also attribute the rise to the expanding definition of autism. Kennedy emphasized the need to identify environmental toxins and other risk factors, pledging to follow the science regardless of current expectations.</p>

However, community-based maternal health organizations are providing culturally responsive care and support, offering 'bright spots' that can serve as blueprints for the rest of the country. These initiatives include culturally aligned healthcare providers, doulas, telehealth services, and tech innovations that empower Black women to make informed decisions about their care.</p>

            <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are warning that President Donald Trump's tariff-heavy trade agenda is quickly starting to resemble a "corrupt scheme to enrich administration officials and those loyal to them." The Trump administration's tumultuous rollout of a spate of new tariffs is "rife with opportunities to unduly influence President Trump and other administration officials," the Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter shared first with CNBC on Thursday. The letter, signed by 47 House and Senate members, asks Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to detail the administration's "plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for self-dealing."

            <p>Hundreds of Westminster insiders were added to, and then swiftly deleted from, a WhatsApp group set up by shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick to promote his London marathon run. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch revealed that she too had briefly been a member of the chat along with senior journalists, former cabinet members and other Tory MPs. Jenrick is not referring himself to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which investigates data breaches. A source said the ICO did not need to be involved because the contacts had been added to the group for "personal purposes" and the risk of malicious use was low.</p>

            <p>President Trump is exploring ways to detain U.S. citizens involved in criminal activity and send them to prisons in El Salvador, a move that some legal experts deem unconstitutional. Separately, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg ruled that the Trump administration 'demonstrated willful disregard' for a court order and is likely in criminal contempt. However, Americans' feeling gloomier about the economy hasn't stopped people from spending money. Retail sales jumped sharply last month as people raced to buy stuff ahead of Trump's steep new tariffs kicking in. (not investment advice)</p>

Crew members on board a research vessel in the South Atlantic Ocean recorded the video about 2,000 feet below the surface of waters around the South Sandwich Islands. The unprecedented footage of the elusive deep-sea creature came 100 years after it was initially identified and given a name. The squid caught on video in the South Atlantic was a juvenile and much smaller than a full-grown adult, with the research team placing its size at around 11 inches long.</p>

The court determined that the government's actions demonstrated a willful disregard for its Order. The judge gave the administration one week to submit a declaration explaining its plan to 'purge' the contempt finding, which means voluntarily obeying the court order by giving the deported people the opportunity to challenge their removal through proper legal proceedings.</p>
