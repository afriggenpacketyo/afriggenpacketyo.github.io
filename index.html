          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly condemned a reported Trump administration plan to send military forces to Chicago, labeling the potential action an "invasion." Pritzker stated his government has not been contacted about the plan and suggested the move is politically motivated, possibly to interfere with future elections, rather than to genuinely address crime. The White House responded by criticizing the city's crime rate and the governor's leadership, escalating the conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations amid global instability. As a leader of an economic powerhouse not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo could champion a form of "constructive pragmatism." This philosophy prioritizes cooperation over confrontation, potentially offering a corrective model for a dysfunctional international system. The article posits that his leadership could provide a practical road map for middle powers to navigate complex geopolitical tensions and foster a more stable world order.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights. The order seeks to bar federal agents from wearing masks, require them to display identifying information, and prohibits the Chicago Police Department from cooperating in federal actions that violate civil liberties. This preemptive measure underscores the city's firm opposition to federal intervention, with the mayor stating Chicago will use every available legal tool to resist what he described as potential harassment of its citizens.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant network outage on Saturday, with many reporting their phones were stuck in "SOS mode" for hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service and confirmed its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by DownDetector, peaked in the afternoon with nearly 23,000 complaints from coast to coast. While in SOS mode, phones can still make emergency calls by connecting to other available networks, but standard calling and data services were unavailable for affected users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a college football game against the University of Tennessee, a Syracuse defender's sudden injury drew sharp criticism from game announcers, who suggested it was a deliberate tactic to stop the clock. The incident occurred as Tennessee was rapidly advancing, with defender Demetres Samuels Jr. falling to the turf, which commentators Bob Wischusen and Louis Riddick called "suspicious" and "blatant." Although faking injuries is a controversial strategy to slow down an opponent's momentum, Samuels returned to the field shortly after, fueling speculation about the injury's authenticity in Tennessee's 45-26 victory.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. The ambitious, nearly two-and-a-half-hour film is a project del Toro has dreamed of making for decades, focusing on a more beautiful and newborn-like creature to explore themes of humanity and imperfection. Early reviews are divided, with some critics praising it as one of del Toro's finest works for its epic scale and artistry, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance and emotional voltage.</p>

          <p>Michael Paul Brown, the man suspected of killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been charged with four counts of murder. After the August 1 shooting, the 45-year-old former soldier evaded a massive week-long manhunt in the nearby mountains before being captured in an unoccupied structure. Authorities have not yet disclosed a motive for the killings of the bartender and three patrons, though relatives have stated Brown had a history of mental illness.

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has concluded that famed McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," likely murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but modern forensic analysis of exhumed remains and the crime scene suggests the scene was staged. Evidence indicates Pauline Pusser was shot outside their vehicle and that the sheriff's own gunshot wound was likely self-inflicted, contradicting his original account and aiming to bring closure to a case shrouded in legend for over 50 years.</p>

The layoffs are framed by the administration as a measure to reduce bureaucracy, but a group of employees who sued to prevent VOA's dismantling called the continued attacks on the agency "abhorrent" and vowed to continue their legal fight.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor and former Bridgewater strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his push to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could seriously damage the central bank's independence. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, leading to negative long-term economic consequences like higher inflation, weaker stock market performance, and a depreciated currency. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, she believes the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy.

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded Jack Grealish's performance, calling him "better than I thought" after the player provided two assists in a 3-2 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers. Since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been instrumental, registering multiple assists in consecutive games and demonstrating a creative edge. Despite his strong club form, Grealish was recently left out of the England squad, but Moyes believes the player is thriving with more game time and is successfully proving his quality, describing him as a "maverick" who makes a significant difference for the team.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to resign, accusing him of endangering public health through his anti-vaccine stance and promotion of conspiracy theories. In a New York Times op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy for launching a "war on science" and pointed to the recent firing of the CDC director as evidence of political interference. Sanders argued that Kennedy's actions are undermining trust in medicine and will make it harder for Americans to access lifesaving immunizations, potentially leading to the resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a similar injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing the practice constitutes a breach of planning law and creates public safety risks. However, councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne, among others, have stated they will press on with their legal challenges. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between central government policy on asylum accommodation and the concerns of local authorities.</p>

The beer infuses Astra's classic brew with the spicy and smoky flavor profile of the ketchup, creating a homage to Hamburg's street food culture. Only 2,000 liters of the special edition beer will be produced, leaving its potential for cult status uncertain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dealt a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration agenda by blocking the expanded use of expedited removal. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's policy of applying this streamlined deportation process to immigrants in the interior of the country, often without a court hearing, is unlawful. The ruling curtails the ability of authorities to quickly remove migrants who cannot prove they have been in the U.S. for over two years. The judge's opinion emphasized that the government's arguments threatened the due process rights of both noncitizens and citizens alike.</p>
