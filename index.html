          <p>British Petroleum (BP) has become the subject of takeover speculation following a tumultuous period. The company's 2020 strategic pivot towards renewable energy under former CEO Bernard Looney, followed by his abrupt resignation in 2023, created significant uncertainty. Underperformance of its shares compared to rivals and a subsequent strategic reset to refocus on oil and gas have failed to reassure investors, making the century-old energy giant a potential target for competitors like Shell, though Shell has denied any such plans.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is currently debating President Trump's major legislative proposal, which combines increased spending on border security and defense with cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Passed narrowly by the House, the bill is proceeding through the Senate via budget reconciliation, allowing Republicans to advance it without Democratic support. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office projects the legislation will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade, a figure that complicates its path forward as lawmakers face a July 4 deadline.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" ready to purchase TikTok, with their identities to be revealed within two weeks. This development occurs as the deadline for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest from the platform's U.S. operations approaches on September 17. The potential sale is a consequence of a 2024 law aimed at addressing national security concerns over the app's Chinese ownership. Any deal would likely require approval from both the U.S. and Chinese governments, adding complexity to the platform's uncertain future.</p>

The restriction will remain in place for 10 prefectures, including Fukushima, but the reopening of the market to other regions marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations, though imports will require new registration and certifications.</p>

          <p>In a high-profile Australian case, the jury has begun deliberating the fate of Erin Patterson, a woman accused of murdering three family members by serving them a beef Wellington containing toxic death cap mushrooms. The prosecution argues Patterson intentionally poisoned her in-laws and her husband's aunt at a family lunch in July 2023, then lied to cover her tracks. The defense contends it was a tragic accident and that Patterson panicked, leading her to lie to authorities. The jury must now decide if the act was deliberate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer has committed to increasing defense spending to five percent of national income by 2035, a move that places military funding as a top priority. This significant hike, driven partly by pressure from allies and a desire to appear strong on national security, has been funded at the expense of the overseas aid budget. The decision has created tension within the Labour Party, as other departments, particularly those overseeing welfare, face a painful budget squeeze and potential cuts to services.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Russia's failure to provide meaningful support to its ally Iran during recent attacks by Israel and the U.S. exposes its declining influence on the world stage. For years, Moscow and Tehran built a strategic alliance based on shared opposition to the West, but when Iran was attacked, Russia offered only platitudes instead of military aid. The author contends that Russia's preoccupation with its costly and draining war in Ukraine has hollowed out its military and crippled its credibility as a reliable international partner.</p>

          <p>Following China's decision to partially lift its ban on Japanese seafood, the Japanese government has announced its official response. Japan plans to strongly urge Beijing to remove the remaining import restrictions that still apply to products from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima. This diplomatic effort aims to fully restore market access for all Japanese seafood, which was halted nearly two years ago due to concerns over the release of treated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies have revealed that passengers in electric vehicles (EVs) may be more susceptible to motion sickness compared to those in traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this phenomenon to the unique characteristics of EVs, particularly their rapid acceleration and regenerative braking systems. The low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking, which recharges the battery, is identified as a key factor in provoking the queasiness and discomfort experienced by some passengers. This finding highlights an unexpected challenge in the transition to new energy transportation.</p>
