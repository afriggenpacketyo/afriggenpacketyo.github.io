        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by the end of the weekend, posing a significant threat to the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center predicts several days of heavy rainfall, with 8 to 14 inches expected in affected areas, potentially causing life-threatening flash flooding and numerous landslides. Currently located southwest of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and moving slowly, the storm is anticipated to undergo significant strengthening from late Friday, fueled by very warm waters. Despite its projected intensity, Melissa is not expected to have major impacts on the mainland United States, though a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning are in place for Jamaica and the southwestern peninsula of Haiti. This article highlights the serious risks for the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>Undefeated boxer Jaron "Boots" Ennis, boasting a 35-0 professional record, confidently aims to become boxing's next pound-for-pound best fighter after recently securing an interim WBA junior middleweight belt. The Philadelphia native attributes his comfort and success in the ring to his family's deep boxing roots, including his father and trainer, Derek "Bozy" Ennis, and his professional fighter brothers who paved his way. Ennis, who recently moved up to the 154-pound division, plans to challenge top contenders like Vergil Ortiz Jr. and become a multi-division champion. He embraces the immense pressure and expectations, believing his rigorous training and strong family support system will solidify his legacy in the sport.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines flights experienced a nationwide ground stop due to an "IT outage affecting operations," leading the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary halt. The airline apologized for the inconvenience, urging passengers scheduled to fly to verify their flight status before departing for the airport. This incident represents the second IT disruption for Alaska Airlines this year, with a previous outage in July halting flights for approximately three hours. Notably, flights originating from Seattle Tacoma International Airport were reported as unaffected by the technical issues, which primarily impacted other departure locations. The airline is actively working to resolve the system failure, with further updates anticipated as they restore full operational capacity.</p>

          <p>Dataland, slated to be the world's first museum dedicated to AI arts, is now scheduled to open in spring 2026 within the Frank Gehry-designed Grand L.A. complex in downtown Los Angeles. Media artist Refik Anadol, the museum's founder, recently offered a preview of the Infinity Room, one of its five immersive galleries. This unique space will combine Anadol's distinct swirling visuals with AI-generated scents, creating a multisensory experience powered by a proprietary Large Nature Model AI. The museum aims to transform architectural space into a living canvas, exploring "machine hallucinations" and data as a narrative material, pushing artistic boundaries.</p>

          <h2>Prolific UK 'Cowboy Builder' Defrauds Dozens Despite Extensive Criminal History.</h2>

          <p>Mark Killick, one of Britain's most prolific "cowboy builders," has received his fourth fraud conviction, having defrauded 37 victims of over £1.25 million. Despite a criminal record dating back to 1995 and legally changing his name twice, Killick continued operating in the building trade, using professional online presences and positive reviews to deceive customers. This case has prompted fresh calls for tighter regulations on convicted fraudsters and increased oversight within the building industry, with critics arguing the current system fails to protect victims. Criminology experts suggest a central register of fraudsters and extended license conditions could prevent such repeated offenses, as current laws allow easy reinvention.</p>

          <p>Jashanpreet Singh, a 21-year-old semi-truck driver, was arrested for driving under the influence after a deadly eight-vehicle collision on a Southern California freeway, which resulted in three fatalities and four injuries. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed Singh, an Indian national, entered the U.S. illegally in 2022. However, California transportation officials stated the federal government had approved his Employment Authorization Documents, enabling him to obtain a federal REAL ID and a commercial driver's license. This incident, alongside a similar fatal crash in Florida, has prompted a lawsuit against California and Washington, alleging failures to comply with federal safety and immigration-status requirements for commercial driver's licenses.</p>

This marks the eighth use of nitrogen gas for execution in the U.S., with previous instances involving visible writhing and prolonged breathing, raising significant concerns about the method's humaneness.

This pledge follows a summit where leaders, excluding Hungary, approved a 19th sanctions package against Russia. A major point of contention was leveraging hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian Central Bank assets as collateral for a substantial loan to Kyiv, a plan fraught with legal and financial complexities, especially for Belgium, which holds most of these funds.

The swift demolition, which commenced earlier this week, surprised many, particularly after previous assurances that the existing White House structure would remain untouched.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland, Kelly Hayes, has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff of California on mortgage fraud charges. This assessment comes despite President Trump's public calls for the criminal prosecution of Schiff, a staunch critic and lead prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, welcomed the news, stating that career prosecutors found the politically-motivated allegations baseless and unsupported. While the investigation is reportedly continuing, this initial finding suggests a significant lack of merit in the case, potentially marking an end to the politically charged probe against the Senator.</p>

          <p>A five-week shutdown of Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) factories, triggered by a cyberattack, caused a significant 27% slump in UK car production in September, marking the lowest output for that month since 1952. JLR, the UK's second-largest car producer, was forced to halt global manufacturing operations due to compromised IT systems. This cyberattack is estimated to cost £1.9 billion and is considered the most economically damaging cyber event in UK history, impacting approximately 5,000 businesses. While JLR production is now phasing back, the incident underscores severe vulnerabilities in critical industries and raises concerns about the UK's broader manufacturing competitiveness and resilience.</p>

MPs warn that achieving net zero requires a serious strategic approach to rapidly decarbonizing aviation, a sector where technological solutions like sustainable aviation fuel are not yet commercially scaled.
