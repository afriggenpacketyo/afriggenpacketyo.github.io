          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Remembered for his calm leadership during the 1970 lunar mission that famously turned a near-disaster into a safe return, Lovell was hailed as a national hero. He also played a crucial role in the Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis." His family and NASA celebrated his unshakeable optimism and significant contributions to the history of space exploration.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing growing concern that new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration could lead the U.S. economy into a period of stagflation, characterized by high inflation and low growth. The latest duties have raised the average tariff rate to its highest level since 1934, potentially forcing businesses to pass costs onto consumers and scale back hiring plans. While the White House has dismissed these worries as "panican paranoia," some analysts point to a weakening job market and rising prices as early indicators of this challenging economic scenario.

          <p>President Trump has directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington, D.C., following an attempted carjacking involving a former administration staffer. The initiative, led by the U.S. Park Police and involving over a dozen other federal agencies, aims to combat what the White House terms as violent crime. This move comes despite data showing a recent decline in violent crime in the district, aligning with a nationwide trend. Critics and local officials have questioned the necessity of the surge, which reignites Trump's long-standing threats to exert federal control over the city's governance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its mass deportation efforts by securing agreements with several nations to accept deportees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Rwanda recently signed a formal deal to take in 250 individuals, providing them with support like workforce training and healthcare. This follows similar, though less formal, arrangements with countries including Eswatini, South Sudan, Costa Rica, and Panama. These partnerships are a key part of the administration's strategy to address illegal immigration by finding destinations for deportees, including those convicted of serious crimes.</p>

Long, a former Republican congressman from Missouri, was confirmed in June amid the Trump administration's efforts to significantly reduce the agency's workforce. His brief tenure follows a period of leadership instability at the IRS, which has seen multiple interim commissioners. President Trump is expected to nominate Long for an ambassadorship, according to a White House official.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old boy is recovering after being attacked by a coyote during his sister's softball game at a park in Carson, California. The child, Enoch Palomar, sustained multiple bites and scratches requiring 20 stitches before his mother, Melissa Palomar, ran to his aid and scared the animal away. The incident was captured on video and has been reported to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife for investigation. Officials note that while coyotes typically avoid humans, they can become aggressive when conditioned to find food in populated areas.</p>

          <p>Despite a broad industry movement to phase out synthetic food dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 5, the whitening agent titanium dioxide remains prevalent in many products. While major food makers and dairy associations have pledged to remove numbered dyes, titanium dioxide is often excluded from these commitments due to its classification as a mineral-based "artificial color." The European Union banned the chemical in 2022 over potential health concerns, but U.S. companies are hesitant to abandon it, citing its unique effectiveness and the difficulty of finding suitable replacements. This leaves the additive in many common foods, from ice cream to salad dressings.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has firmly stated that there will be "no invasion of Mexico" following reports that President Trump secretly authorized U.S. military force against drug cartels. The directive reportedly provides a basis for operations against groups the U.S. has designated as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum emphasized that while her government was informed of the executive order, it does not permit U.S. military presence in Mexican territory, stressing a policy of collaboration and coordination over intervention.

          <p>Tonia Haddix, a Missouri woman featured in the HBO series "Chimp Crazy," has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. The charges stemmed from her false claim that Tonka, a chimpanzee actor from the movies "Buddy" and "George of the Jungle," had died. In reality, she was hiding the primate in her basement to prevent his court-ordered transfer to a sanctuary, following a lawsuit by PETA over mistreatment. Haddix pleaded guilty, admitting she lied to protect the chimp, but prosecutors noted her lack of remorse for her criminal conduct.</p>

          <p>As bankruptcy filings rise, it is important for individuals considering this form of debt relief to understand the strict eligibility criteria that can lead to disqualification. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, failing the means test by having an income above the state median is a primary barrier. Other disqualifying factors for both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 include having a recent bankruptcy discharge, failing to complete mandatory credit counseling, or engaging in fraudulent behavior such as hiding assets. If disqualified, alternative options like debt consolidation, settlement, or management programs may offer a path to financial stability.</p>

          <p>The Boar's Head plant in Jarratt, Virginia, which was shut down last year after being linked to a listeria outbreak that killed 10 people, is planning to reopen. The USDA has lifted its suspension, stating the facility is now in full compliance. However, an Associated Press investigation found that recent inspection reports from other Boar's Head plants in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that caused the initial outbreak. These findings, which include residue on equipment and blocked drains, raise new questions about the company's food safety culture and federal oversight.</p>

          <p>While much global attention on declining birth rates focuses on East Asia, Latin American nations like Chile are experiencing a similar demographic shift. The country's fertility rate is plummeting as a result of complex personal decisions influenced by economic instability, changing social norms, and evolving views on family and career. This article explores the root causes behind the trend in Chile's capital, Santiago, revealing how individual choices are collectively reshaping the nation's future. The phenomenon reflects a broader pattern of demographic transition occurring across many middle and high-income countries worldwide.</p>

In his letter, Tan defended his 40-year career, stating he has always operated with the highest ethical standards and is working with the White House to resolve the situation.

These identifications were made possible by advanced DNA testing technologies applied to remains recovered from the World Trade Center wreckage in 2001 and 2002.

The 2020 uprising, which saw widespread demonstrations and a violent state crackdown, has been effectively erased from public life, with independent media shuttered and thousands prosecuted for political reasons. Despite the regime's repression, Lukashenko has recently hinted at releasing political prisoners in exchange for concessions from the West, though experts believe the West has limited leverage to bring about significant change.</p>

His daughter argues that a swifter police response could have deterred the subsequent violence and is calling for the police watchdog to reinvestigate the case.

          <p>The relationship between the European Union and India is facing a test after the EU sanctioned an Indian refinery, Nayara Energy, for processing discounted Russian crude oil. This move is part of the EU's broader effort to cut off funding for Russia's war in Ukraine, but it complicates ongoing free trade negotiations between Brussels and New Delhi. However, experts suggest this single sanction is largely symbolic and that the greater pressure on India comes from potential U.S. tariffs. This dynamic could paradoxically strengthen India's interest in finalizing a trade agreement with the more predictable EU. (not investment advice)</p>
