          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day into night and creating dangerous conditions on major highways, according to this New York Times article. Visibility dropped to near-zero, prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings for the first time ever in Chicago. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Ill., was fueled by strong winds up to 70 mph lifting dust from exceptionally dry soil. This phenomenon, known as a haboob, is more common in the Middle East and hasn't significantly affected Chicago since the Dust Bowl era. The article highlights the unusual weather conditions and their impact on the region.</p>

          <p>Elton John has strongly criticized the government's plans regarding AI copyright laws, labeling them 'absolute losers' for considering exempting technology firms from copyright laws, as reported by the BBC. He feels 'incredibly betrayed' by the potential allowance of AI firms using artists' content without payment, deeming it 'theft'. The government's rejection of House of Lords proposals to enforce AI companies to disclose used material has sparked outrage. Sir Elton warns of the danger to young artists lacking resources to fight big tech firms and threatens legal action if the plans proceed.</p>

          <p>This Guardian article discusses the challenges in holding despots like Putin accountable in international courts, highlighting the establishment of a Special Tribunal for the Crime of Aggression against Ukraine. Despite backing from numerous countries, the article notes that Putin evades justice due to legal immunity and the rejection of international jurisdiction by autocratic allies and powerful states. The author argues that the erosion of international law is exacerbated by the ineffectiveness of the UN Security Council and the defiance of international norms by both authoritarian regimes and democratic states, exemplified by the Iraq invasion. The article calls for a renewed commitment to upholding international law to prevent moral confusion and societal collapse.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel's guest essay in The New York Times argues that President Trump and his family are brazenly profiting from his return to office through foreign deals, meme coins, and secretive crypto fund-raisers. The author contends that this behavior, while egregious, is not new, pointing to past administrations and officials who overlooked foreign influence in American politics. Examples include the Trump family's Executive Branch club, cryptocurrency business, and Jared Kushner's investments, as well as Hunter Biden's dealings during his father's vice presidency. The article calls for legislative measures to prevent politicians and their families from profiting from foreign influence and for future administrations to enforce existing anti-corruption laws.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards' guest essay in The New York Times compares the contrasting approaches to rail travel in Europe and the United States, noting Europe's revitalization of sleeper train networks and high-speed rail. The author argues that while Europe embraces rail as a climate-friendly alternative to short-haul flights, the United States is sleepwalking into a transport dead end by slashing funding for public infrastructure. Richards criticizes America's car-centric culture and its tendency to invest in unproven transportation projects rather than reliable rail systems. He advocates for revitalized railways as a means to connect communities, reduce car dependence, and rediscover the American dream.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, returned home on Saturday, facilitated by the U.N. refugee agency after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region, according to NPR. The majority of the refugees were women and children, and the repatriation aims to resettle 2,000 individuals. These refugees were among the hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide, with many expressing a deep connection to a homeland they had never known. The return is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, with over 101,000 refugees already repatriated.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times news analysis explores how President Trump's Middle East diplomacy is increasingly sidelining Israel and reshaping decades of foreign policy. Trump's actions, such as shaking hands with Syria’s new leader and promising to lift sanctions, contrast sharply with Israel's views. While the U.S. maintains its historic ties with Israel, Trump's focus on negotiating deals in Iran and Yemen, and cutting business deals with Gulf nations, signals a shift. The article highlights the implications of this shift for Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>With surveys showing that most British people now regret Brexit, the country’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, might have hoped for an easy ride over his cautious push to mend ties with the European Union. But well before the red carpet is rolled out for a meeting with the bloc’s leaders on Monday, political opponents had squashed that idea, according to this New York Times article. This article touches on the fact that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's meek messaging partly reflects a broader inability to communicate objectives.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a "groundbreaking" fibre-optic gyroscope that is stable across a large temperature range and can be used for navigation, according to the South China Morning Post. The team from the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University say the gyroscope could offer a more stable way to measure navigation for aircraft, ships and oil rigs. Traditional gyroscopes rely on moving mechanical components, but fibre-optic gyroscopes use the changing movement of light in optical fibres to operate.</p>
