          <p>BP announced second-quarter profits of $2.35 billion, significantly exceeding analyst expectations amid volatile energy prices. The strong performance aims to rebuild investor confidence after a period of underperformance compared to its peers. The British energy major also revealed its largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years off the coast of Brazil, providing a substantial boost as the company continues to focus on hydrocarbon exploration and production. This news comes as BP has been the subject of takeover speculation, though rival Shell has denied any intention of making an offer. (not investment advice)</p>

Health officials are urging residents and workers in the affected zip codes, especially those over 50 or with compromised immune systems, to seek immediate medical care if they experience flu-like symptoms. The disease, a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria found in warm water systems, is not transmissible from person to person and can be treated with antibiotics if diagnosed early.

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a drop in second-quarter revenues, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. Despite this, the company's adjusted net income of $24.5 billion surpassed analyst forecasts, and CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for a strong second half of 2025, anticipating a significant increase in oil demand. The results come as crude prices remain under pressure from an uncertain global economic outlook and U.S. tariffs.

          <p>A fast-moving vegetation fire, named the Rosa fire, ignited in the Santa Rosa Mountains of Riverside County, rapidly growing to 1,200 acres and was reported as 0% contained by Monday night. The blaze prompted mandatory evacuation orders for several rural communities, including Ribbonwood and Pinyon Pines, with emergency reception centers established for displaced residents and animals. Three hundred firefighting personnel, supported by engines, dozers, and helicopters, have been deployed to combat the fire. The cause of the fire, which started near Highway 74, is currently under investigation by Cal Fire.</p>

While an amber weather alert has ended, a yellow warning remains in place for some areas, and forecasters predict more unseasonable wind and rain later in the week.

          <p>Tennessee is set to execute Byron Black, a 69-year-old inmate, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind involving a person with a working implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Despite legal challenges and concerns from his attorneys that the device could cause unnecessary pain by shocking his heart during the lethal injection, Governor Bill Lee declined to grant a reprieve. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. The case has raised ethical questions for medical professionals and highlights ongoing debates surrounding capital punishment methods and inmate health conditions.</p>

          <p>With the new Fantasy Premier League season approaching, BBC Sport has compiled advice from FPL experts and last season's league winner to help managers succeed. Key strategies include planning transfers in blocks of fixtures rather than week-to-week, balancing premium players, and quickly rectifying mistakes. Experts also advise watching full matches to gain context beyond statistics, a method that last year's winner used to great effect by relying on gut instinct and the 'eye test' over data analysis. Other tips include prioritizing players who take penalties and set-pieces and not overspending on defensive options to allow for greater flexibility elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest as he faces trial for an alleged coup plot to overturn the 2022 election.

The case has attracted international attention, with the Trump administration condemning the judicial proceedings and imposing sanctions on Justice de Moraes. The decision intensifies the political polarization in Brazil, with Bolsonaro's supporters claiming persecution while critics see it as a necessary step to uphold democracy.</p>

A go-ahead two-out single by the Cardinals' Yohel Pozo in the ninth inning secured the victory for St. Louis. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Cardinals starter Sonny Gray, managing only a solo home run from Freddie Freeman over seven innings.

A key point of contention is whether to cap plastic production, a measure supported by nearly 100 countries but opposed by oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia.

The authors suggest this 'Gorbachev syndrome'—being admired abroad but unpopular at home—serves as a cautionary tale for democrats worldwide.

India also pointed out that both the EU and the U.S. continue their own trade with Russia. The statement comes after Trump accused India of profiting from discounted Russian oil and threatened to substantially raise tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the probe was a politically motivated conspiracy to undermine him. The order comes after the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, declassified a report and referred the matter to the Justice Department. It remains unclear what specific charges are being considered or who the potential targets of the grand jury investigation might be.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting map. By leaving, the Democrats broke the House's quorum, preventing any legislative business from proceeding. The House Speaker has issued warrants for their arrest, which would compel their return to the Capitol, though Texas law enforcement has no jurisdiction out of state. The Democrats, who traveled to Illinois and New York, argue the redistricting plan is an authoritarian effort to silence voters, while Republicans accuse them of dereliction of duty.</p>

          <p>Glass House Brands, a major California cannabis company, has announced a radical overhaul of its labor practices following a large-scale immigration raid on its facilities that led to one worker's death and over 360 detentions. The company has terminated its relationship with the farm labor contractors involved and hired a consulting firm led by a former ICE director to improve its employment eligibility verification. The raid, which federal officials claimed was targeting child exploitation, devastated the company's workforce. Glass House stated it is taking these steps to ensure such an event never happens again and has signed a new labor agreement with the Teamsters.</p>

Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, emphasizing their close strategic alignment. The advanced, stealthy warships are equipped with long-range missile capabilities. The first three frigates will be built in Japan, with the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia.

The project, a partnership between archaeologists and local cavers, aims to better understand the long history of human farming and land use on the fells.

The president contrasted the campaign with what he called 'woke' advertising from other brands. The stock rally is the latest development in a meme-driven surge for the company, which has been facing significant financial challenges, including a recent withdrawal of its full-year guidance due to slow sales.
