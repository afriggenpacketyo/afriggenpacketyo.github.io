          <h2>Rap Group Kneecap Apologizes After Controversial Remarks Spark Outrage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-29 03:52:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Irish rap group Kneecap has issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of a video showing a band member making inflammatory comments. The group rejects any suggestion that they would incite violence against any MP or individual and unequivocally stated that they do not support Hamas or Hezbollah. The controversy has led to calls for the group to be denied entry into the USA and Canada, as well as being dropped from music festivals. The Metropolitan Police are also looking at a video from November last year, where the footage appeared to show a band member shouting "up Hamas, up Hezbollah" at a performance in London.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a significant portion of British adults feel they lack control over key aspects of their lives, particularly their personal finances. The survey highlights that managing personal finances is a major concern for many, with a substantial number feeling their financial situation is "out of control". To address this, experts suggest focusing on achievable steps to reduce stress, such as utilizing smart meters to monitor and manage energy expenses. The research was commissioned by Smart Energy GB, which has teamed up with the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) and sports psychologist Dr Josie Perry, to show how you can feel a bit more confident and in control – as darts is a particular sport which requires incredible focus due to small targets and rowdy crowds.</p>

A task force of residents and business owners is overseeing the reconstruction, supported by over 2,000 volunteers and donations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars has announced a substantial cost-cutting plan due to a sharp decline in operating profit during the first quarter. The company attributes the downturn to reduced wholesale volume, adverse currency effects, and broader industry challenges. As part of the restructuring, Volvo plans to reduce investments and potentially implement redundancies across its global operations. The company is also sharpening its U.S. product line-up to focus on growth and explore how it could "better use" its existing manufacturing footprint in the coming years, in order to produce "more cars where they are sold."</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending the sugar tax to include milkshakes and pre-packaged lattes, potentially impacting a significant portion of the market. The proposed change aims to further reduce sugar consumption, particularly among children, and incentivize manufacturers to reformulate their products. While opponents argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families, proponents emphasize its potential to improve public health. The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is referencing Mao Zedong's essay "On Protracted War" as a source of inspiration amid ongoing trade disputes with the United States. The commentary suggests that Mao's strategies for enduring a long conflict can be applied to the current economic hostilities, encouraging the public to remain confident in eventual victory. This comes as trade tensions between the two countries escalate, with both sides imposing tariffs on each other's goods. The commentary said Mao’s essay, a commentary on China’s war against Japanese aggression , would encourage people to remain confident of eventual victory in the tariff war.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured victory in Canada's federal election, fueled by a backlash against President Trump's threats and policies. Carney, a newcomer to politics, successfully positioned himself as a leader capable of protecting Canada's economic sovereignty in the face of American pressure. While the Conservatives made significant gains, their focus on domestic issues was overshadowed by concerns over the relationship with the US. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, particularly in the oil-rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, where the Liberals struggled to gain support.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Party in Canada, led by Mark Carney, has won the federal election, marking a significant turnaround attributed to President Trump's threats to annex Canada and his tariff policies.

While domestic issues like affordability and immigration remained important, Trump's actions dominated the campaign and shaped voters' decisions. On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign, and in response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.</p>

Carney, who presented himself as an experienced leader during a time of crisis, warned that Trump is trying to break Canada. However, the close vote share between the Liberals and Conservatives indicates significant divisions within the country, posing a challenge for Carney as he navigates a potential trade war with the US.

          <p>A viral photograph of ultrarunner Sophie Power breastfeeding her infant son during a race has sparked significant changes in sports policies. The image highlighted the challenges faced by women and mothers in athletic competitions, leading to the implementation of pregnancy deferral policies at major events, including the London Marathon. Power's advocacy has been instrumental in creating more inclusive opportunities for women in sports. Now, many of the world's biggest events, including the London Marathon, have implemented pregnancy deferral policies and Power's work has been central to that change.</p>

The rookie pitcher struck out eight batters and navigated a bases-loaded situation in the first inning.

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party secured a victory in the Canadian election, largely due to President Trump's interference. Trump's badgering of Canada and taunts about making it the 51st US state backfired, leading to a reversal of fortune for the Liberal Party. Carney's focus on the threat posed by Trump resonated with voters, who prioritized economic and national sovereignty. This election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.</p>

Analysts attribute the underperformance to a high baseline from the previous year and unique pressures from the tariff war and industrial transition.
