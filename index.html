            <p>China is subtly shifting its non-interference policy in Africa by directly urging Rwanda to cease supporting the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo, reflecting Beijing's concern over its mining interests in the region. China's UN ambassador has voiced these concerns, marking a departure from its usual stance of abstaining from resolutions involving conflicts between key allies. While protecting its economic stakes, China aims to maintain positive relationships with both the DRC and Rwanda. China also voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution that unanimously condemned Rwanda’s role in the conflict. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>DHL Express has temporarily halted deliveries to American consumers for shipments exceeding $800 due to increased customs red tape following the introduction of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The changes have led to a surge in formal customs clearances, causing multi-day delays for affected shipments, though business-to-business deliveries will continue. The White House is also set to close a loophole on low-value packages from China and Hong Kong, impacting fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu, who have warned of price increases. These measures are aimed at addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain, though Beijing maintains that fentanyl is a "US problem". Optimism score: 50</p>

Emergency responders recovered the bodies of an adult female and a 12-year-old child after searching for occupants of two submerged vehicles. The flooding occurred as more than 30 million Americans were under alert for severe weather over the Easter weekend, with several states already experiencing tornadoes, hail, and damaging winds.

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman responsible for the 2019 El Paso Walmart shooting that killed 23 people, will plead guilty to capital murder charges and receive a life sentence without parole. This plea deal avoids the death penalty on the state charge, aligning with a previous federal sentence of 90 consecutive life sentences for hate crime and weapons charges. Crusius, motivated by racist ideology, confessed to targeting Mexicans in the attack. The decision to accept the plea deal was influenced by the victims' families' desire for closure, though some initially sought the death penalty. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>The article explores the ethical concerns surrounding the growing snail slime beauty industry, where snail mucus is used in serums and lotions for its supposed anti-aging properties. Despite industry assurances of humane treatment, the extraction methods, which sometimes involve acidic solutions or force, raise questions about animal welfare. The author notes a decline in revulsion towards snail slime and a rise in incuriosity about the industry's practices, even among those who are usually tender-hearted. The article suggests that potential tariffs on Korean beauty products might be a more effective deterrent than animal welfare concerns, as consumers seem willing to overlook the snails' suffering for the promise of youthful skin.

            <p>The article discusses Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life by demanding that Harvard University reorganize its governance and hire faculty to ensure viewpoint diversity. The author argues that this is a form of identity politics that undermines the principle of hiring the most qualified individuals. While acknowledging the lack of viewpoint diversity in universities, the author cautions against solutions that institutionalize political identities and make political beliefs criteria for admission and recruitment. The author suggests that fostering a richer culture of debate and encouraging freedom of expression are vital aims that cannot be remedied through state mandates or bureaucratic procedures.

            <p>Malaysian durian growers are poised to increase their market share in China, driven by Chinese consumers' growing preference for fresh, naturally ripened fruit. Durian exports from Malaysia to China have seen a significant increase this year, attributed to a consistent supply and improved logistics. Unlike Thailand and Vietnam, where pre-cutting is common, Malaysian durians are typically allowed to ripen naturally on the tree. This preference for naturally ripened durians is creating substantial opportunities for Malaysian growers. Optimism score: 80</p>

            <p>LogProstyle Inc., a Tokyo-based real estate company, is pursuing an unconventional strategy by listing on the NYSE American stock exchange before going public in Japan, with the goal of expanding its Japanese-style inns to the United States. The company, which operates traditional inns with tatami rooms primarily for foreign tourists, aims to collaborate with local partners and is considering locations such as Los Angeles and Seattle. CEO Yasuyuki Nozawa stated that the U.S. listing is intended to boost name recognition in the United States, targeting those seeking new experiences in hotels. The popularity of Japanese-style inns among tourists is growing, boosted by the depreciation of the yen. Optimism score: 85</p>

He warned that deviating from the net-zero goal would not only risk climate breakdown but also forfeit future clean energy jobs.
