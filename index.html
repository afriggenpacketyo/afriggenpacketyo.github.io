          <p>A high-ranking Russian military official, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, was killed in a car explosion in Balashikha, a suburb of Moscow, sparking a criminal investigation by Russian authorities. This incident is the most recent in a string of apparent assassinations targeting individuals perceived as opponents of Russia within its borders, occurring as cease-fire negotiations between Russia and Ukraine show little progress. The explosion happened on the same day that Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, met with President Putin at the Kremlin to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. (Optimism score should be low here as there is still conflict and people are dying).</p>

Santos has acknowledged responsibility for his actions, which led to his expulsion from Congress, but maintains that he is being unfairly targeted by prosecutors.

The government estimates that four deaths on UK roads last year were caused by cyclists, and the new legislation seeks to ensure that those who recklessly disregard the safety of others face the full force of the law.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of carnivorous caterpillar on Oahu, Hawaii, dubbed the "bone collector," which disguises itself by adorning its silk case with the remains of its prey. The caterpillar feeds on trapped insects in spiderwebs and uses their body parts to construct a protective case, possibly for camouflage. This behavior is considered unprecedented among caterpillars, and scientists believe it may help the caterpillar feast on the spider's ensnared meals without being detected. Conservation efforts are urged to protect this unique lineage, which dates back at least 6 million years.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the Chancellor-in-waiting, is experiencing low personal popularity despite his CDU's victory in the German election. Trust in Merz is declining, partly due to his perceived U-turns on key policy issues, such as cooperating with the far-right AfD and agreeing to debt brake reform. He also faces challenges related to his perceived misogyny and unpopularity in eastern Germany, contributing to the AfD's growing support.</p>
