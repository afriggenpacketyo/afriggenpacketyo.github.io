        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has levied substantial fines against Apple and Meta, totaling €700 million, for non-compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Apple faces a €500 million penalty for App Store violations, while Meta is fined €200 million for user data handling issues related to its 'consent or pay' model for cookies. Both companies are accused of implementing measures that reinforce user dependence on their platforms, hindering competition and user choice. The tech giants have expressed strong disagreement, with Meta accusing the EU of unfairly targeting American businesses, and Apple claiming to be unfairly targeted and forced to give away their technology for free. The fines come amid heightened economic tensions between the US and the EU. Optimism Score: 50</p>

The World Exposition in Osaka reached one million visitors within 11 days of opening, and a second melted fuel sample was retrieved from the crippled Fukushima reactor.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's National Health Commission (NHC) has refuted the US's renewed promotion of the Covid-19 'lab leak' theory, calling it baseless and politically motivated. The NHC spokesperson stated that increasing evidence suggests an earlier emergence of Covid-19 in the United States, urging the US to address its own issues and provide a responsible explanation to the international community. This rebuttal follows the Trump administration's update to its Covid-19 website, which alleges the virus originated from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, citing inadequate biosafety levels and a biological characteristic not found in nature. The NHC views this as a continuation of smearing China and politicizing scientific matters. Optimism Score: 60</p>
