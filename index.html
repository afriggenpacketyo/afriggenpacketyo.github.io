          <p>In Paterson, New Jersey, two bakery owners were violently attacked by a customer over a sandwich order from four years ago. The assailant, who remains unidentified and at large, alleged that an eggplant sandwich he was given instead of an egg sandwich had made him sick. Despite the owners' attempts to de-escalate the situation by offering a refund, the man pulled a knife, stabbing one brother in the chest and slashing the other's arm. Both victims were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, highlighting a disturbing pattern of severe violence in disputes over food service across the U.S.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has passed away at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, a period that marked a significant shift towards public transparency for the historically secretive organization. Rimington was the first MI5 chief to be publicly named upon her appointment, a move that required her and her family to relocate for security reasons after a newspaper published a photo of their home. Her trailblazing career is widely believed to have inspired the character of 'M,' played by Dame Judi Dench, in the James Bond film series.</p>

          <p>A political standoff is escalating in Texas as Democratic state lawmakers have fled to other states to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a new congressional map. In response, Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to invoke a legal opinion to remove the absent Democrats from office if they do not return. The proposed map, supported by President Trump, could create several new Republican-leaning districts and is being fiercely contested by Democrats who argue it would rig future elections. The Democratic lawmakers are holding events in states like New York and Illinois to rally support against the measure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway fell after the company reported a 4% decline in second-quarter operating earnings, disappointing investors. The drop was primarily attributed to a downturn in insurance underwriting results, which offset gains in other sectors like railroad and energy. The conglomerate also surprised markets with a significant $3.8 billion write-down on its Kraft Heinz stake and continued its trend of being a net seller of stocks without initiating any new share buybacks. This lack of investment activity has left some analysts concerned as the company's cash reserves remain near a record high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares for retailer American Eagle experienced a 20% surge following a social media post from President Donald Trump praising its new ad campaign with actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump lauded the campaign as the "'HOTTEST' ad out there," which immediately boosted the company's stock after a period of decline. The campaign, with the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism for its perceived double entendre. The incident highlights the significant and often unpredictable impact that political figures can have on brand marketing and stock market performance in the current cultural landscape.

The lawsuit, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, seeks to reinstate state-level electric vehicle mandates that were rescinded by Congress and President Trump. AmFree argues that California's regulations stifle commerce and that the congressional action to block them is not subject to judicial review. This legal battle represents a significant clash between state environmental authority and federal oversight, with major implications for the automotive and trucking industries nationwide.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans across the Midwest and Northeast are facing poor air quality as smoke from ongoing Canadian wildfires drifts south. Air quality alerts have been issued for numerous states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York, with cities like Detroit experiencing some of the worst air quality in the world. The Air Quality Index has reached "unhealthy" levels in many areas, posing a risk to sensitive groups such as children, the elderly, and individuals with respiratory conditions.

          <p>A teenage boy and girl have been given detention orders for the premeditated torture and killing of two kittens in a wooded area near a Ruislip golf course. The judge described the case as one of the most horrific instances of animal cruelty she had ever seen. Evidence revealed that the kittens were found mutilated with ropes attached, alongside tools like blowtorches and knives. Disturbingly, notes found on the boy's phone detailed fantasies of killing a person, suggesting the animal cruelty was an attempt to manage these urges. Both teenagers were banned from owning animals for life.</p>

          <p>Researchers have finally identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacterium, Vibrio pectenicida, which was found in the bodily fluid of infected sea stars, causing them to develop lesions and disintegrate. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star population declining by about 90%, leading to its classification as critically endangered. This discovery is crucial for developing conservation strategies, as the loss of these predators has allowed sea urchin populations to explode, destroying vital kelp forests.</p>

          <h2>Statistical Analysis Reveals Unusually Large Revisions in Recent U.S. Jobs Data</h2>

          <p>A detailed analysis of the U.S. jobs report data that led to the firing of the BLS commissioner reveals that the downward revisions for May and June were extraordinarily large by historical standards. The combined reduction of 258,000 jobs for the two months was the largest of its kind since at least 1979, excluding the volatile period at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, two-month combined estimates are revised slightly higher. This data-focused article provides context for the political controversy, showing that while revisions are normal, the magnitude of these specific changes was a significant statistical outlier, fueling the administration's claims.</p>

          <p>A 10-year-old girl, Ari Buchman, has died from her injuries, becoming the third child to perish after a summer camp sailboat collided with a barge in Biscayne Bay. The incident occurred when the sailboat, carrying five children and a camp counselor from the Miami Yacht Club, was struck and dragged under the barge. A 7-year-old and a 13-year-old also died from drowning in the crash. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading a thorough investigation into the tragedy, which will include participation from investigators from Argentina, the home nation of one of the victims, to determine the cause of the fatal collision.</p>

          <p>An analysis piece examines the potential career risks for actress Sydney Sweeney after her voter registration as a Republican was revealed and subsequently praised by President Donald Trump. While a celebrity endorsement can be valuable for a politician, the article argues that for a rising star like Sweeney, aligning with a divisive political figure can be a massive public relations gamble. Unlike established figures such as Taylor Swift, who have weathered political backlash, Sweeney's career is still in a formative stage that relies on broad appeal. The situation highlights the perilous nature of celebrity involvement in the current polarized American political discourse.</p>

          <p>The family of a British couple detained in Iran since January has learned they are being held separately in two of the country's most notorious prisons. Lindsay and Craig Foreman, who were on a world trip, were charged with espionage, which their family denies. After months of uncertainty, the UK government confirmed that Lindsay is in Qarchak Prison, a female-only facility known for its inhumane conditions, while Craig is in Fashafouyeh Prison, which also has reports of severe overcrowding and abuse. The family expressed grave fears for the couple's physical and mental well-being, noting that British officials reported the father appeared dishevelled and had lost significant weight.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congresswoman Nancy Mace has officially launched her campaign for governor of South Carolina, cementing her transformation from a moderate Republican to a staunch Trump loyalist. Once a critic of the former president, Mace now embraces the "super MAGA" label and features Trump's endorsement in her campaign announcement. Her platform focuses on a zero-tolerance approach to crime, eliminating the state income tax, and fighting against "woke ideology" in schools. Mace enters a crowded Republican primary where she will compete with other conservative candidates for the party's nomination in the heavily Republican state.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of activists are planning to protest in Westminster by holding signs supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. This action would be a direct challenge to the Terrorism Act, which now makes it an offense to show support for the group, with police warning that participants can expect to be arrested. The protest is being organized while the government's ban on Palestine Action is being challenged in the High Court. Organizers state the event is a peaceful exercise of democratic rights against an order they believe is a disproportionate interference with freedom of expression.</p>

He modifies the phones to make free calls anywhere in the U.S. or Canada using an internet connection, personally covering the minimal operating costs. Since installing the first phone outside a general store, the project has been a surprising success, providing a crucial communication link for residents, stranded drivers, and students. With Vermont set to ban cell phones in schools, Schlott has received requests to install more phones to ensure students have a way to contact their families.</p>

          <p>Rupert Matthews, the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Leicestershire and Rutland, has defected from the Conservative Party to Reform UK, giving the latter party its first-ever PCC. Announcing the switch alongside Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, Matthews stated that the "dark heart of wokeness" must be removed from the justice system and that establishment politicians have failed the country. The move has been criticized by local Conservatives, who argue that Matthews should call a by-election as he was elected on a Conservative platform. This defection consolidates Reform UK's growing influence at the local government level.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, financial experts are advising on who might benefit from purchasing an annuity this August. Annuities are most suitable for near-retirees who want to lock in currently high interest rates for a guaranteed income stream, and for risk-averse individuals who prioritize certainty over potential market growth. However, they are not recommended for everyone. Younger investors with long time horizons, individuals who may need access to their cash soon, and anyone carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid annuities, as they can be illiquid and may offer lower returns than other investment strategies.

          <p>President Trump and his top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, are defending the abrupt firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner by stoking baseless conspiracy theories about federal jobs data. Without evidence, they claimed that Friday's weak employment report was "rigged" by partisan federal employees to sabotage the president. Hassett argued that the only way to ensure reliable data is to replace agency leaders with people who have a "fresh set of eyes." This rhetoric attempts to undermine the credibility of any government data that does not align with the White House's political narrative, drawing parallels to previous efforts to sow distrust in election results.</p>

          <p>Nuremberg Zoo in Germany has confirmed it culled a group of Guinea baboons and fed some of the remains to its carnivores, a decision that has sparked public outcry and protests from animal rights groups. The zoo defended the action as a necessary last resort to manage chronic overcrowding in the baboon enclosure after attempts to rehome the animals failed. Officials explained that whole-animal feeding is beneficial for the dental health and natural behavior of predators like lions and tigers. Despite the scientific rationale, the culling has led to hundreds of criminal complaints and a planned protest camp outside the zoo.</p>
