          <p>A 42-year-old man is in custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people in what authorities are calling a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident occurred near the store's checkout area, with the suspect reportedly using a folding knife. Six of the victims are in critical condition, while five are in serious condition. Officials praised the swift response of citizens who helped apprehend the suspect and provide aid to the injured before first responders arrived on the scene.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's 27-month-long civil war. This new administration directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent fragmentation of the nation. The conflict, which began as a power struggle between two generals, has already displaced millions and pushed large parts of the population to the brink of famine, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The verdict concluded a highly publicized trial where the defense argued she acted in self-defense against an abusive partner, while the prosecution contended she killed him to win a bitter custody battle over their daughter. The complex case involved allegations of abuse, poisoning, and manipulation from both sides, ultimately leading to a conviction that carries a potential sentence of up to 30 years in prison.</p>

          <p>As fans prepare for high-stakes matches like the Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions that come with watching sports. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an elevated heart rate and a feeling of being on a rollercoaster. Experts advise managing these nerves by getting adequate rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release pent-up energy. They also emphasize reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience, regardless of the final outcome.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Experiences Unusually Cold and Foggy Summer</h2>

          <p>Contrary to typical summer weather, San Francisco is experiencing one of its coldest summers in decades, with daytime high temperatures struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray conditions to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual. This has allowed a low-pressure system to dominate, increasing coastal upwelling of cold ocean water and maintaining a persistent cloud cover. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the pattern is a notable departure from the norm for late July.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney has generated both backlash and praise online. The campaign, which promotes a line of jeans to raise money for a domestic violence charity, has been criticized by some for its suggestive tone, which they argue is inappropriate for the serious cause. However, other fans have defended the actress and praised the ad for moving away from "woke advertising." The brand is betting on Sweeney's star power to revive sales and views her as its biggest collaboration to date.</p>

          <p>Approximately 12,000 grocery workers for the Stater Bros. Markets chain in Southern California have voted to authorize a strike. The United Food and Commercial Workers union claims the company has engaged in illegal, union-busting tactics, including surveilling and discriminating against its members. While the vote does not trigger an immediate walkout, it empowers the union to call a strike if upcoming contract negotiations fail. The labor dispute follows the company's first-ever layoffs earlier this year, which it blamed on inflation.</p>

          <p>Veteran Israeli Arab affairs commentator Ehud Yaari has disclosed that he engaged in indirect communication with Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar after the October 7 attacks. The contact was reportedly initiated by Sinwar through a third-party mediator affiliated with Hamas. According to Yaari, Sinwar, who was deeply knowledgeable about Israeli society, used the channel to convey messages, including what he termed Hamas's "sense of despair." This revelation provides a rare glimpse into the mindset of the Hamas leader during the conflict before he was killed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has confirmed it is monitoring the Xue Long 2, a Chinese-flagged research icebreaker, which was detected operating off the coast of northern Alaska.

A long-range surveillance aircraft was dispatched to monitor the ship's activity. The incident occurs amid heightened vigilance over foreign vessel movements in the strategic Arctic region, with Canadian forces also tracking the ship earlier in the week.</p>
