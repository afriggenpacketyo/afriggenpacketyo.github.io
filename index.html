            <h2>Community Reacts with Anger and Sadness to Felling of Historic Oak Tree in Enfield</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 14:04:16 EDT</div>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The recent felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, London, has triggered widespread outrage among local residents, who viewed the tree as a symbol of comfort and historical significance, especially during the pandemic. Toby Carvery, the pub chain that felled the tree, claimed it was done due to health and safety concerns, citing advice that the tree was dead and posed a risk. However, residents dispute this assessment, noting the tree appeared healthy, and are demanding answers about the decision-making process and the future use of the felled wood. The incident has also ignited broader concerns about the preservation of green spaces and historical sites in the area, particularly in light of recent developments like Tottenham Hotspur's planned training ground in Whitewebbs Park.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" level of economic activity in the short term as businesses stockpile inventory and consumers accelerate purchases to avoid potential price increases. This preemptive buying, particularly in sectors like the auto industry, could inflate economic activity in April but lead to a slowdown by the summer as demand is exhausted. Goolsbee also notes uncertainty surrounding future tariff rates and their potential impact on businesses and consumers, citing the example of a novelty drinkware company holding products in China due to unaffordable tariff rates. Despite these short-term concerns, Goolsbee remains optimistic about the longer-term economic outlook, citing positive data on unemployment and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Despite a 30-hour "Easter truce" declared by Russian President Vladimir Putin, both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Ukrainian front lines were hit by numerous Russian assaults, while Russia's defense ministry stated it had repelled attempted Ukrainian assaults. Zelensky dismissed Putin's truce declaration as a PR exercise, accusing the Kremlin of trying to create a false impression of a ceasefire, while the Russian defense ministry insisted its troops had strictly observed the ceasefire. The announcement of the truce came shortly after US President Donald Trump threatened to reconsider brokering future peace talks.</p>

Berrios explained that he felt disrespected by Raleigh's actions, while Raleigh denied the accusations, stating he would want his pitchers to do the same if they suspected tipping. Blue Jays manager John Schneider acknowledged that sign stealing is a part of baseball, but supported his players sticking up for themselves.</p>

            <p>A leaked draft executive order reveals potential sweeping changes to the U.S. State Department under the Trump administration, including the closure of embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa and the consolidation of regional bureaus. The order also proposes eliminating offices focused on climate, women's issues, and human rights, and would overhaul the process for selecting diplomats, emphasizing alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. While the White House has not commented, Secretary of State Marco Rubio has dismissed the report as "fake news". The proposed changes aim to streamline operations, project American strength abroad, and align the department with an "America First Strategic Doctrine."</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen has criticized the El Salvadoran government's initial attempts to prevent him from visiting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador, and accused them of staging a photo opportunity during their meeting. Van Hollen emphasized that Abrego Garcia's deportation was an "administrative error" and that he is defending Abrego Garcia's constitutional rights, not the individual himself. He also refuted claims that Abrego Garcia is linked to MS-13, urging officials to present evidence in court, and stressed the importance of upholding due process for all individuals, regardless of their background. Abrego Garcia has since been transferred to a different facility.</p>

She highlighted the closure of research labs, layoffs of scientists and doctors, and the shutdown of clinical trials as direct consequences of these cuts. Healey asserted that the administration's actions are essentially inviting other countries, like China, to take advantage of American scientists and researchers.

Healey said that the effects on Harvard are damaging "American competitiveness", since a number of researchers are leaving the US for opportunities in other countries. Trump also called for its tax-exempt status to be revoked, a potentially illegal move, against the world-famous college in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She added: “I was in a hospital recently, Boston Children’s, where some of the sickest kids in the country receive care. Cuts to Boston Children’s and other hospitals are a direct result of Donald Trump’s actions, as these are part of a teaching hospital system.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the removal of any alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador, calling it "unprecedented" and wrong. Solicitor General John Sauer argued that the detainee plaintiffs have no standing to seek an injunction from the high court since the government has already paused their pending deportations and is allowing the legal process to play out. He noted no lower court has weighed in on the facts of the government's "notice" and "opportunity to appeal" process implemented in the wake of the SCOTUS order last month. Sauer also implored the justices to limit the sweeping overnight order to only a pause on AEA removals — not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members.</p>

Homan defended the administration's actions, arguing that under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which the administration invoked to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants including Abrego Garcia, due process rights are more limited. He also denied that any migrant is being labeled a gang member solely because of tattoos. The Supreme Court has upheld an order saying the administration must "facilitate" his return to the U.S.</p>

The White House has claimed Ábrego García was a member of the MS-13 gang though he has not been charged with any gang related crimes and the supreme court has ordered his return to the US be facilitated.

            <p>The film “Sinners,” a mashup of horror, music and vampires, scored a solid opening, topping the holiday box office with $45.6 million. The R-rated film starring Michael B. Jordan delighted critics and audiences who rewarded it with an “A” ranking on CinemaScore. Coming in second was “A Minecraft Movie,” which continued its strong performance in earning $41.3 million a three-week total of $344.6 million. “Sinners” also marks the latest triumph for the partnership of Jordan and Coogler.

            <p>Donald Trump favors an immigration policy that attracts wealthy individuals, viewing national belonging as a commodity. While many dislike the idea of selling citizenship, numerous countries, including the United States, offer residency in exchange for investment or donations. The current U.S. "golden-visa" scheme is seen as inefficient and underpriced, aligning with Trump's desire for a more transactional approach to immigration that benefits the economy.</p>

            <p>An Israeli investigation into the killings of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month found "professional failures" and will result in the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation said the Palestinians were killed due to an "operational misunderstanding" by Israeli forces, and that a separate incident 15 minutes later, when Israeli soldiers shot at a Palestinian U.N. vehicle, was a breach of orders. The findings asserted that six of those killed were Hamas members and said some of the others were originally misidentified as Hamas. Israel has accused Hamas of moving and hiding its fighters inside ambulances and emergency vehicles, as well as in hospitals and other civilian infrastructure, arguing that justifies strikes on them.</p>

            <p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said Sunday that his recent trip to El Salvador was not about defending Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident deported despite a court order, but about defending the Constitution. Van Hollen told ABC News' “This Week” co-anchor Jonathan Karl on Sunday. “And the Trump administration has admitted in court that he was wrongfully detained and wrongfully deported. My mission and my purpose is to make sure that we uphold the rule of law, because if we take it away from him, we do jeopardize it for everybody else.” Van Hollen also criticized the role of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, saying his government was “complicit in this illegal scheme with the Trump administration,” and called it a violation of international law to prevent any communication with a prisoner.</p>

The protest was in response to a Supreme Court ruling that biological sex defines a woman for the purposes of the Equality Act. The Met confirmed it is also dealing with a number of complaints from the public about signs and images shared on social media that were reportedly displayed at the protest yesterday and "action will be taken if there are signs displayed that breach of the law".</p>

            <p>US Senator Chris Van Hollen has reported that Kilmar Ábrego García, a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was "traumatized" by his experience in the Cecot mega-jail and has since been moved to a new prison. Van Hollen, who visited Ábrego García in El Salvador, emphasized the importance of due process and expressed frustration with the Trump administration's handling of the case. The Supreme Court has ordered the government to "facilitate" his return, but the White House has insisted he will not return to the US, accusing him of being a member of MS-13, a claim his family and attorneys deny.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are considering investing in a massive natural gas project in Alaska in an attempt to reach trade deals that would both satisfy demands from President Donald Trump and avoid high U.S. tariffs on their exports. Alaska has long sought to build an 800-mile pipeline crossing the state from the North Slope in the Arctic Circle to the Cook Inlet in the south, where gas would be cooled into liquid for export to Asia. The project, with a staggering price tag topping $40 billion, has been stuck on the drawing board for years.</p>

            <p>The CEO of Back Market, a marketplace for used and refurbished tech devices, says he's witnessed the sales jump firsthand. Back Market saw its sales triple over a single week in the wake of Trump's tariffs announcements, says Thibaud Hug de Larauze. Most smartphones and computers are manufactured in China, which currently faces a 145% total tariff rate on goods imported to the United States. Trump issued a temporary exemption for those products on April 11, but subsequently announced plans to introduce specific tariffs targeting electronics that could take effect as soon as May. Prolonged tariffs could cause a "huge uptick" in short-term sales of used and refurbished devices, especially smartphones, says Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities global head of technology research.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law. The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given "a reasonable time" to contest their pending removals. The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.</p>

A pair of RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian Ilyushin Il-20M "Coot-A" intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea on 15 April, while another two Typhoons intercepted an unknown aircraft leaving the Kaliningrad airspace on 17 April. The two intercepts, which took off from Malbork Air Base in Poland, were part of the UK's contribution to Nato's enhanced air policing. They were the RAF's first intercepts since aircraft arrived in the region to begin the defence of Nato's eastern flank, working alongside Sweden.</p>

            <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr.'s views on autism, particularly his promotion of discredited theories linking it to vaccines and environmental toxins, are raising concerns within the autistic community, especially given his potential influence in a Trump administration. Kennedy has previously made disparaging remarks about autistic individuals, claiming they will never contribute to society, and his promotion of unproven causes of autism is seen as dangerous and harmful. The article argues that Kennedy's stance reflects a broader trend of populists rejecting scientific consensus and promoting misinformation, potentially leading to detrimental policies affecting the care and understanding of autistic people.</p>

            <p>The article cautions against relying on unconventional economic indicators like the "lipstick index" or men's underwear sales to predict a recession, arguing that there is little empirical evidence to support their accuracy. It also notes that while traditional metrics like consumer sentiment, unemployment, and GDP are commonly used, they often contradict each other and fail to identify underlying problems that trigger economic downturns. The author advises focusing on real-time data from companies driving key economic components—consumers, capital, and labor—such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies, rather than relying on surveys or government data.</p>

            <p>Berlin's Immigration Office has told three European Union citizens and one American they are to be deported from Germany this week over alleged actions at protests against Israel's war in Gaza. The four demonstrators — two from Ireland, one from Poland and one from the United States — were served with orders last month, instructing them to leave Germany by April 21 or be deported. The Berlin Immigration Office says the deportation orders are connected to a protest at Berlin's Free University in October 2024. Those served with deportation orders say they have no information about charges.</p>
