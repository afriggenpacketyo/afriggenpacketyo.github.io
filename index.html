          <p>An Air China flight traveling from Hangzhou to Seoul made an emergency landing at Shanghai Pudong International Airport after a passenger's lithium battery caught fire. The battery, stored in carry-on luggage in an overhead compartment, spontaneously ignited during the flight. The airline's crew responded quickly to the situation, and the diversion was initiated as a safety precaution to ensure the well-being of all on board. No injuries were reported as a result of the incident, which highlights ongoing concerns about the risks of lithium batteries on commercial aircraft.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that the country is no longer bound by the restrictions imposed by the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal has officially expired. The agreement, which limited Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief, has been in jeopardy since the United States withdrew in 2018. Despite the declaration, Tehran expressed a commitment to diplomacy, though recent talks to revive the deal have stalled amid mutual accusations and the reinstatement of international sanctions by European powers.</p>

          <p>The article reports that anti-Israel activist groups, some associated with a "global intifada" movement, are integrating into the nationwide "No Kings" protests against President Trump. It suggests a strategic shift to link the Palestinian cause with domestic U.S. political issues, even after a recent ceasefire with Hamas. The article further alleges that these protest movements are part of a coordinated network of Democratic-affiliated, tax-exempt nonprofits, potentially funded by figures like George Soros, raising questions about the partisan nature of their activities and possible violations of nonprofit laws.</p>

          <p>The opening T20 match of England's winter tour in Christchurch was washed out by rain, preventing New Zealand from beginning their chase. Before the weather interruption, England had posted a score of 153-6, recovering from a difficult position of 81-5. All-rounder Sam Curran was instrumental in the recovery, scoring an unbeaten 49 from 35 balls to give his team a competitive total on a challenging pitch. The result is a frustrating start to the white-ball series, which serves as preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the "No Kings" movement are expecting millions of demonstrators to participate in nationwide marches protesting the policies of President Trump. The protests, framed as a stand against authoritarian behavior, cite concerns over immigration enforcement, cuts to education and environmental protections, and gerrymandering. In response, some Republican figures have labeled the event a "hate America rally," and the governors of Virginia and Texas have mobilized their states' National Guards as a precautionary measure, while organizers reiterate their commitment to peaceful demonstration.</p>

          <p>Relations between China and Canada appear to be improving following a meeting in Beijing between top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi and Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand. Wang stated that China is willing to restart dialogue at all levels and rebuild trust, calling Anand's visit a "fresh start" for the strained bilateral ties. This diplomatic engagement is viewed by analysts as a result of Ottawa's shift towards a more "pragmatic" approach. The meeting aims to advance the settlement of mutual concerns and guide the relationship back to a stable and sustainable path.</p>

The return of his remains, facilitated by the Red Cross, makes him the 10th deceased hostage to be repatriated, with Hamas blaming the difficulty of locating other bodies on the destruction from Israeli strikes.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he is giving up his royal titles, including the Duke of York, following intense pressure over his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, the prince said the continued accusations were distracting from the work of the Royal Family and that he was taking this step with the King's agreement. While he will remain a prince, he will no longer use the title or associated honors and has already stepped back from all public duties. The decision comes ahead of the posthumous publication of a memoir by Virginia Giuffre, who had accused him of sexual assault.</p>

In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test identified cancer in 62% of positive results, with more than half of those cancers found at an early, more treatable stage. The test works by detecting fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. While researchers are optimistic, further data is needed from larger trials, including an ongoing NHS study in England, to confirm if it reduces cancer mortality.</p>

          <p>Turkish Cypriots are voting for a new leader in an election that carries high stakes for the future of the divided island and the community's identity. The main contenders are the right-wing incumbent, Ersin Tatar, who supports a two-state solution backed by Turkey, and the left-wing Tufan Erhurman, who advocates for a federal solution in line with UN resolutions. The election is viewed as a referendum on whether to pursue deeper integration with Turkey or to work towards a reunified federal state within a European framework, also touching on concerns about the community's secular character.</p>

These companies report that offering guarantees of authenticity has directly boosted sales and customer confidence. This focus on verification is helping to legitimize a market projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Wales, had a large, cancerous kidney tumor discovered by chance after a minor mishap during a holiday weekend at Butlin's. After being playfully picked up by someone, she felt a "pop" and later went to the hospital suspecting a broken rib. A precautionary CT scan to check for internal damage revealed the 7cm tumor, which had produced only subtle symptoms that were easily attributed to other causes. She has since had her kidney removed and is now cancer-free, crediting the accidental injury with saving her life.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has drawn sharp criticism for comments linking large-scale deportations to what he termed a "problem in the cityscape." Opposition politicians and some members of his own party condemned the remarks as "racist" and "discriminatory," arguing that the vague wording unfairly targets immigrant communities and denies their sense of belonging in Germany. While supporters claimed he was referring to crime and individuals required to leave the country, critics argue the language fuels division. The government spokesperson attempted to downplay the comment, stating Merz was expressing support for new migration policies.</p>

The Finnish leader's comments came ahead of a White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.

The family had built a vast steel empire, Hahn'sche Werke, but were forced to sell it for a fraction of its value and flee Germany in 1938. Their personal assets, including properties and artworks, were signed over to a non-Jewish associate who never returned them. Easton's decade-long investigation has led to the successful restitution of some stolen artworks and has pieced together the story of a family devastated by the Holocaust.</p>
