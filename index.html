          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who escaped on May 25 by impersonating a corrections officer, was found approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit. Arkansas law enforcement officers and the U.S. Border Patrol located Hardin near Moccasin Creek, and he was taken into custody. The search involved helicopters, drones, and K9 units, with assistance from a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit from Texas, highlighting the extensive effort to apprehend him.

          <p>Former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Tom Rafferty, a Super Bowl champion, died at the age of 70 in Colorado after recently suffering a stroke. Rafferty played for the Cowboys from 1976 to 1989, protecting Hall of Fame quarterbacks Roger Staubach and Troy Aikman. He was a key part of the offensive line that helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XII in 1978 against the Denver Broncos. A particularly memorable moment in his career was a key block he delivered to help spring Tony Dorsett's record-setting 99-yard touchdown run in 1983. His legacy is remembered for his contributions to the Cowboys' success and his impact on the sport.</p>

          <p>Three Sonoma County residents have filed a lawsuit against the county, alleging that code enforcement is using drones to take aerial images of their homes without warrants. The ACLU is representing the residents, claiming the county has used drones over 700 times since 2019 to find code violations on private property. Residents cite privacy concerns and loss of enjoyment of their property due to the constant drone surveillance, with one selling his home after learning of the aerial photography. The lawsuit argues that the county's drone policy violates the California Constitution's right to privacy and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States continue to negotiate tariff issues, aiming to reach a trade agreement by mid-June, although common ground has not yet been found. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, stated that "further progress" was made after talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Japan seeks the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, including a 24 percent tariff (10 percent baseline plus 14 percent country-specific) and a 25 percent tariff on automobiles. Japan has proposed joint efforts in strengthening supply chains, cooperation in shipbuilding, increased imports of U.S. farm products, and simplified safety requirements for foreign-made cars.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines is canceling 14 flights a day through the end of July due to tariffs hindering its ability to accept delivery of new aircraft. The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring extra tariff-related costs, impacting Horizon Air, its regional subsidiary. These delayed aircraft, expected from Brazil, are subject to a 10% tariff since April. Delta Air Lines previously avoided tariffs by having new Airbus A350 airlines delivered from France to Japan before bringing them to the U.S., as aircraft not new upon arrival are not subject to tariffs. The carrier aims to minimize disruption by cutting routes with multiple flights.</p>

          <p>A juror in Harvey Weinstein's Manhattan retrial on sexual assault charges has complained to the judge about "playground stuff" by other jurors. The juror indicated that another juror had become the subject of a "bit of a shunning" during deliberations. The complaint raises concerns about the dynamics within the jury and whether they could affect the fairness of the trial.

          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges after a disastrous first quarter, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's escalating feud with President Donald Trump. Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill led to an online brawl, causing Tesla shares to plummet and wiping out billions in value. The rift could impact Tesla's regulatory environment, investigations, and government support, especially as the company seeks tariff exemptions for Chinese-made equipment. Tesla's stock was already underperforming due to increased competition and consumer backlash against Trump's political activities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ex-girlfriend of Sean "Diddy" Combs, testifying under the pseudonym "Jane", described feeling pressured to participate in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched.

Prosecutors charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, to which he pleaded not guilty.

          <p>The government is struggling to cut foreign aid spending on hotel bills for asylum seekers in the UK, with plans to spend £2.2bn of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, marginally less than the previous year. This money is primarily used to cover accommodation costs for asylum seekers. Foreign aid is intended to alleviate poverty overseas, but international rules allow some of it to be spent domestically on asylum seekers' support during their first year. The situation has led to cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities worldwide.</p>
