          <p>Analysts are raising concerns about the practicality and cost-effectiveness of the Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, intended to counter China's growing missile arsenal. The project, reportedly involving a partnership with SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril, aims to deploy hundreds of satellites to detect and track missiles, along with attack satellites to intercept them. Despite initial reports, Elon Musk has denied the accuracy of the article. Experts highlight the significant financial burden and complex technological challenges associated with realizing such a system, questioning its overall viability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's strict policies on immigration and border control are significantly impacting the U.S. tourism industry, leading to a substantial decline in overseas visitors. Data indicates a sharp drop in international arrivals, particularly from Western Europe and Canada, resulting in projected losses of billions of dollars. Concerns over safety and perceived antipathy towards foreigners are deterring travelers, affecting various sectors from hotels and entertainment to retail and transportation. The decline is expected to impact both Democratic and Republican states, with no region spared from the economic fallout.</p>

          <p>People suffering from motion sickness may be able to prevent their symptoms from developing just by listening to a minute of special sound, a Japanese research team said. The research found a sound at 100 hertz stimulates the inner ear and helps to reduce motion sickness by improving balance, the team said, while current preventive measures are largely limited to taking medicines. The findings offer a potential non-pharmaceutical approach to managing motion sickness, improving the quality of life for those affected.</p>
