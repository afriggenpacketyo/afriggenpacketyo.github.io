          <p>This in-depth article examines the historical policy decisions that led to Los Angeles becoming the epicenter of America's homelessness crisis. It argues that the issue is not inevitable but a direct result of decades of choices, starting with the halt of public housing construction in the 1950s. The narrative traces the impact of demolishing SRO hotels, restrictive zoning laws, the loss of manufacturing jobs, and deinstitutionalization without adequate community support. Ultimately, the article identifies a severe, long-term shortage of affordable housing as the fundamental driver of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Aix-Marseille University in France has received nearly 300 applications from American researchers for its "Safe Place for Science" program. The initiative was launched to provide "scientific asylum" for U.S. academics facing aggressive federal funding cuts, politicization of research, and other pressures from the Trump administration. The program is one of several international efforts to poach top talent from the U.S., raising concerns of a potential "brain drain" as researchers in various fields seek more stable and supportive academic environments abroad.</p>

          <p>A major manhunt in Idaho's Sawtooth National Forest for a fugitive father wanted for the murder of his three daughters has ended after a case of mistaken identity. The search for Travis Decker began after a family reported seeing a man who matched his description. After an extensive search involving multiple agencies, authorities located the individual, a cooperative hiker who simply resembled the fugitive. The U.S. Marshals Service is still offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to Decker's capture.</p>

          <p>For the first time, China has publicly revealed the production facilities for its fifth-generation stealth fighters, believed to be the J-35. The aircraft were seen in the background during a state television report that was focused on the upgraded J-15T carrier-based fighter. A test pilot discussed the technical challenges and advancements of the J-15T, which is designed for catapult-assisted launches. The brief appearance of the new stealth fighters suggests they are advancing in production and are expected to be deployed on China's newest aircraft carriers.</p>

          <p>The bishop of the Diocese of San Bernardino in California has issued a rare decree dispensing parishioners from their obligation to attend Mass due to "genuine fear of immigration enforcement actions." Bishop Alberto Rojas stated that such fear constitutes a grave inconvenience that could impede the spiritual well-being of the faithful. This unusual step highlights the heightened anxiety within immigrant communities following the Trump administration's revocation of policies that limited enforcement actions in sensitive locations like churches, and it has drawn criticism from officials like Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>The recent military conflict between Israel and Iran has dangerously escalated the precarious situation for the approximately 9,000 Jews still living in Iran. Following Israeli bombing raids, Iranian authorities have reportedly detained and interrogated several dozen Jewish citizens, warning them against contact with relatives abroad. This marks a departure from the tacit understanding that has allowed the community to survive under the Islamic Republic, which historically distinguished between its Jewish citizens and Zionism. The increased paranoia and menacing rhetoric from the regime have reawakened deep-seated fears within the community.</p>

          <p>A Houston-area pediatrician has issued a public apology after losing her job over a controversial social media post about the deadly Texas floods. Dr. Christina Propst wrote that she hoped voters in the Trump-supporting Kerr County would "get what they voted for," alluding to their support for politicians who deny climate change and have proposed cutting FEMA. The clinic where she worked terminated her employment, stating the comments did not reflect its values. Propst said her comment was made before the scale of the tragedy was known and expressed deep regret for the pain it caused.</p>

          <p>A trustee on Columbia University's board, Dr. Shoshana Shendelman, is publicly calling for the school to comply with the Trump administration's demands regarding Title VI and antisemitism on campus. In a letter, she criticized the university leadership's "lack of moral clarity" and its failure to protect Jewish students, which has led to legal and financial repercussions. The demand follows federal actions against the university, including the cancellation of grants, and the release of text messages from the acting president suggesting Shendelman's removal from the board.</p>

          <p>A report from the UK's Intelligence and Security Committee warns that the nation faces a "rising, persistent and unpredictable" threat from Iran. The inquiry highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings against dissidents and others on UK soil since early 2022. The committee accuses the government of focusing too much on "crisis management" and Iran's nuclear program at the expense of countering other threats like espionage and cyber attacks. It calls for a more strategic, long-term approach to handling the multifaceted danger posed by the Iranian state.</p>
