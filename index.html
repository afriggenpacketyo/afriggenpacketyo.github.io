          <p>A massive Russian strike on Kyiv resulted in at least nine deaths and dozens of injuries, prompting President Zelenskyy to cut short his South Africa trip and return to Ukraine. The attack involved cruise missiles, drones, and ballistic weapons, targeting residential areas and critical infrastructure. Zelenskyy emphasized the urgency for international awareness of the situation, highlighting the use of nearly 70 missiles and 150 attack drones. The strikes occurred amidst ongoing negotiations for a potential peace plan, complicated by accusations from President Trump that Zelenskyy is prolonging the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has curtailed his visit to South Africa to return to Kyiv following a deadly Russian strike on the capital. He announced his decision on Telegram, just hours after arriving in South Africa, and stated that Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha will take over his meetings to inform leaders about the situation in Ukraine. This decision follows South Africa's recent support of a UN resolution affirming Ukraine's sovereignty, a move that contrasts with its previously ambiguous stance on Russia's invasion.</p>

          <p>Norges Bank Investment Management, the worldâ€™s largest sovereign wealth fund, announced a first-quarter loss of $40 billion, attributing it to poor performance in the technology sector.

The fund's value decreased substantially due to adverse currency movements, as the Norwegian krone strengthened against major currencies. At the end of March, the fund was valued at 18.53 trillion kroner, with 70% of its investments in equities.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci, experienced a 6% drop after reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales, citing macroeconomic headwinds. Revenues fell 14% year-on-year, with Gucci sales declining 25%. The company attributed the overall weakness to a decline in sales in Asia, North America, and Europe. Kering's CEO acknowledged a "difficult start to the year" and emphasized the company's focus on executing action plans to strengthen the positioning of its brands.

          <p>Ofcom has finalized rules requiring tech firms to implement stricter measures to protect children online, including age checks and algorithm adjustments to filter harmful content. Platforms hosting pornography or content promoting self-harm must take robust action by July 25 or face significant fines. While Ofcom's boss Dame Melanie Dawes called it a "gamechanger," critics argue the restrictions don't go far enough. The rules, subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act, also require platforms to have a "named person accountable for children's safety."</p>

Additionally, there's an increase in the number of people unsure about their summer plans, attributed to recent tariffs and fears of a potential recession.

          <p>Sophie Lloyd, a magician who disguised herself as a man named Raymond Lloyd to gain entry into the then-male-only Magic Circle in 1991, is finally being granted membership. After being expelled when her deception was revealed, the Magic Circle has apologized and is presenting her with a membership certificate. Lloyd's initial infiltration was a protest against the society's exclusion of women. The Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated, with women making up only 5% of its members. The society says Miss Winstanley, the mastermind behind the stunt, will also be recognized at the event.</p>

          <p>Denise Fergus, the mother of murdered toddler James Bulger, is urging the government to pass a new law to clampdown on AI-generated videos of child murder victims. She highlighted the need for stronger measures to force platforms to remove harmful content, describing AI videos depicting her son as "absolutely disgusting". The government asserts that such videos are illegal under the Online Safety Act and should be removed.
