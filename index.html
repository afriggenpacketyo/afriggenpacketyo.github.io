          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been found guilty of the 1967 sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, UK. The case, considered one of the UK's oldest solved cold cases, remained unsolved for nearly six decades until modern DNA testing linked Headley to the crime. Investigators matched semen from a swab taken at the scene in 1967 to Headley, a previously convicted offender. Headley, who was in his 30s at the time of the murder, was also linked to the scene by a palm print.</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. This change will affect over 800,000 workers, with analysis suggesting it will disproportionately benefit women, Black, and Hispanic employees. The increases, driven by ballot measures and inflation adjustments, contrast with the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009. The average annual wage increase for full-time workers will range from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large technology companies, a move made just hours before the first payments were due. This decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump halted trade negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack" and threatening new tariffs. The 3% tax would have affected revenues of major U.S. tech firms like Google and Meta, and was projected to generate over C$2 billion in its first year. The reversal aims to restart crucial trade talks between the two nations, with a new agreement targeted by late July.</p>

          <p>Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) currently offer lower interest rates than products like credit cards, making them attractive borrowing options for homeowners. Experts note that HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's decisions, which makes them unpredictable, though rates are expected to see a slight decline later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates influenced by mortgage bond trading, making them more stable once locked in. Experts advise borrowers to consider their immediate needs and risk tolerance when choosing between the two options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A father and his young daughter were successfully rescued after the girl fell overboard the Disney Dream cruise ship and her father jumped into the water to save her. The incident occurred on Sunday as the ship was returning to Fort Lauderdale from a trip to the Bahamas. The ship's crew immediately launched a rescue operation, deploying a small boat to retrieve the pair from the ocean within minutes. Disney Cruise Line commended its crew for their swift and effective actions, which ensured the safe return of both guests and highlighted the effectiveness of their safety protocols.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing a second heatwave with temperatures forecast to exceed 34Â°C, an event scientists say is becoming more common due to climate change. While triggered by a "heat dome" of high pressure over Europe, experts are clear that the 1.36Â°C of human-caused global warming has inevitably intensified the heat. Historically, temperatures of 35Â°C were rare, occurring in about one in ten years in the latter 20th century, but have been seen in half the years since 2015. Scientists warn that such heatwaves will continue to worsen until greenhouse gas emissions are significantly reduced.</p>

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components, aiming to reduce reliance on the Chinese-dominated global market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in the first quarter of 2025. This shift is driven by growing cybersecurity concerns and Western pressure on China over its ties to Russia. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and sensors, areas where Taiwan's advanced tech industry can provide "non-red" alternatives.</p>

A 16-year-old is in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head, while a 17-year-old is stable after being shot in the leg. Earlier in the evening, in nearby Washington Square Park, six other people were injured after an individual deployed bear spray into a crowd; a suspect in that incident is in custody. The motives for the attacks are still under investigation, and the violence has cast a pall over the city's LGBTQ+ celebrations.</p>

The school district terminated her in 2021 after discovering posts on her TikTok account that officials characterized as homophobic, transphobic, and racist. Lower courts had ruled that the school's interest in preventing disruption outweighed her free speech rights, even though the posts predated her employment. MacRae argued this standard should not apply to pre-employment speech, but the high court's refusal to hear the case leaves the lower court's decision in place.</p>

In a letter to the Secretary of State, the group, American Families Against Cartel Terrorism, argues the designation would help keep Americans safe and provide justice for victims. An FTO label criminalizes providing support to the group and allows victims to sue for compensation.

Factors such as rising OPEC+ supply and a tempered outlook for global demand are expected to cap any major price rallies.

          <h2>Google Announces Fusion Energy Partnership with MIT Spinoff Commonwealth Fusion Systems</h2>

          <p>Google has entered into a partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), marking the tech giant's first major commercial commitment to fusion energy. As part of the deal, Google will purchase 200 megawatts of clean power from CFS's planned grid-scale fusion power plant, known as ARC, which is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Google has also increased its investment stake in the company, which was spun out of MIT. This move represents a significant long-term bet on the transformative potential of fusion to provide carbon-free electricity and meet global energy demands.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Novel Organism That Blurs the Line Between a Virus and Cellular Life</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 09:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers have identified a new type of organism, named â€˜Sukunaarchaeum mirabile,â€™ that challenges the traditional definitions of life. Discovered within the genome of marine plankton, this archaeal entity has an extremely small genome and appears to outsource most metabolic functions to a host, similar to a virus. However, unlike a virus, it contains the genes necessary to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA, which are essential for protein synthesis. This unique combination of traits places it in a gray area between a minimal cellular organism and a complex virus, potentially reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.</p>

          <p>Two Los Angeles County firefighters, David Walters and Erin Regan, will be honored with the Pat Tillman Award for Service at this year's ESPY Awards. Both are former elite athletes who were among the 7,500 emergency personnel responding to the devastating Southern California wildfires in January. Walters is an Olympic gold medalist swimmer, and Regan is a former professional soccer champion. The award, named for the late NFL player who enlisted in the Army, celebrates individuals with sports connections who have demonstrated a commitment to serving others and embodying Tillman's legacy of service.</p>
