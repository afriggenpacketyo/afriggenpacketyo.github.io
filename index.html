          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is utilizing a little-known federal law to compel the Trump administration's Justice Department to release its criminal investigation files on Jeffrey Epstein. Citing a rule that allows five members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to request such information, the senators have set an August 15 deadline. This move follows what they describe as the administration's broken promises to provide transparency regarding the case. The files are believed to contain significantly more information than the grand jury transcripts the DOJ has recently sought to unseal.</p>

          <p>A British brother and sister, aged 11 and 13, tragically drowned after getting into difficulty in the sea off a beach in Salou, Spain. Their father, who also entered the water to help, was rescued but the two children could not be revived despite emergency efforts. Local officials noted that while the beach is typically calm, sea conditions were rough, with a yellow flag warning in effect. The UK Foreign Office confirmed it is providing support to the family, who were on holiday in the popular tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off Russia's coast that triggered a tsunami, a wave of misinformation has spread online, including out-of-context videos and AI-generated fakes. DW Fact Check has debunked several viral claims, such as old footage of an earthquake in Bangkok being presented as new and a video of a South African storm being mislabeled as the tsunami. The article also addresses false claims about Oprah Winfrey blocking a road in Hawaii and clarifies that beached whales in Japan were likely unrelated to the seismic event, highlighting the prevalence of disinformation during major crises.</p>

          <p>Laura Dahlmeier, a celebrated German biathlete and two-time Olympic gold medalist, has died at age 31 following a climbing accident in Pakistan. She was struck by falling rocks while ascending Laila Peak in the Karakoram range, and rescue efforts were hampered by severe weather.

          <p>The U.S. rental market is experiencing a slowdown, with national apartment rents remaining flat in July and down 0.8% year-over-year. A massive influx of new apartment construction has pushed the national vacancy rate to a multi-year high of 7.1%, creating a more favorable market for renters. Formerly hot markets in the South, such as Austin, Texas, are seeing the most significant rent declines. This trend indicates that the supply of new units is still outpacing demand, a situation complicated by broader economic uncertainties affecting the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A structural reorganization at NATO headquarters, initiated by Secretary-General Mark Rutte, is drawing criticism from some former and current employees. They allege the changes are designed to appease the Trump administration by downgrading or reducing the visibility of programs related to 'wokeness,' such as Women, Peace and Security (WPS) and climate security. A senior NATO official denies this, stating the reforms are to improve efficiency in a more dangerous world, not to placate any single ally.

          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a significant rebound from the previous quarter's contraction. However, economists caution that this headline figure overstates the economy's underlying strength, as it was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports due to new tariffs. A more telling metric, final sales to private domestic purchasers, which excludes trade and government spending, grew at only a 1.2% rate, its weakest since late 2022. This suggests that while the top-line GDP number looks strong, domestic demand is actually slowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new form of geothermal energy, known as 'superhot geothermal,' is being developed to meet the immense power demands of artificial intelligence. This technology involves drilling miles deep to access extremely hot rocks, which can generate up to ten times more power per well than traditional geothermal methods. Startups like Quaise Energy are pioneering systems that can vaporize rock to reach these depths. This innovation could provide a consistent, clean power source for data centers and is receiving strong support from the Department of Energy as a solution for future energy needs.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old from Edinburgh has been sentenced to six years in jail for plotting a mass shooting at his school, inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. The court heard that Felix Winter, who was 15 and 16 when the offenses occurred, idolized the Columbine killers and detailed his violent plans in a journal. The teenager, who held pro-Nazi views and was in extensive contact with an extremist online group, was investigated after a photo of him in combat gear with an imitation gun caused panic. The judge noted he was progressing towards perpetrating the attack before being stopped.</p>
