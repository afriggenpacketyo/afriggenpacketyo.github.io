          <p>President Trump withdrew Dr. Janette Nesheiwat's nomination for U.S. Surgeon General and announced his intent to nominate Dr. Casey Means, an entrepreneur and wellness influencer favored by allies of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Nesheiwat's withdrawal followed scrutiny of her credentials and social media posts. Trump stated Nesheiwat would work with Kennedy in another capacity, while Means, co-author of 'Good Energy,' is expected to advance the 'Make America Healthy Again' agenda. Means earned degrees from Stanford before leaving her surgery residency and co-founded Levels, a digital health company focused on metabolic health.</p>

          <p>Dozens of pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied part of Columbia University's main library, renaming it 'the Basel Al-Araj Popular University,' in an attempt to revive last spring's protest movement. The protest, organized by Columbia University Apartheid Divest, aims to disrupt Columbia's profits and legitimacy due to its funding of imperialist violence. This action comes amid increased scrutiny from the Trump administration regarding the university's handling of antisemitism, leading to cuts in federal research funding. Demonstrators pushed past security, chanted slogans, and were later confronted by public safety officers, with the university stating that protesters would face consequences.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by former President Biden ordered the Trump administration to immediately resettle approximately 12,000 refugees into the U.S., partially blocking President Trump's executive order to halt refugee admissions. The judge, Jamal Whitehead, criticized the administration's attempt to reinterpret a judicial order and insisted on compliance with statutory and constitutional law. This ruling follows the Trump administration's argument that it should only process 160 refugees and its intent to appeal any order requiring the admission of thousands. The article also covers other political news including US-Iran nuclear talks, congressional actions on air traffic controller crisis, and an FBI child sex operation.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold interest rates steady for the third consecutive meeting, citing increased uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth. Despite acknowledging a solid labor market, policymakers noted heightened risks of both higher unemployment and inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the central bank's readiness to respond to economic developments but admitted uncertainty about the appropriate course of action. The Fed's cautious approach reflects concerns about the conflicting goals of maintaining a healthy labor market and stable inflation in the face of trade policy changes.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, including Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, and Lisa Murkowski, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressing concerns that budget cuts to the agency could negatively affect the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlighted that American Indians and Alaska Natives already face significant health disparities and rely on IHS for care. They urged Kennedy to ensure that IHS programs have adequate resources and staffing, especially given existing shortages in critical roles.

          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7th, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID at airport checkpoints for domestic flights, a security measure that has been delayed for over two decades.

The TSA is using secondary processes to verify the identity of travelers lacking compliant identification. Despite the new requirement, travelers can still apply for a Real ID or use alternative forms of identification like passports.

Concerns are raised about the logistics of distributing perishable food and whether the boxes will meet seniors' needs for shelf-stable items.

          <p>Las Vegas experienced its wettest May on record after a storm system delivered four consecutive days of rain, a rare occurrence for this time of year. The storms caused flooding in the Las Vegas area, including on the Strip, and a man was swept away by floodwaters in Henderson. The National Weather Service recorded 1.44 inches of rain at Harry Reid International Airport, surpassing the previous record set in 1969. A dust storm also occurred in Mohave County, Arizona, due to strong winds from the thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates, citing 'so much uncertainty' caused by President Trump's tariffs. The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, said that the economic consequences of Trump's tariffs made it unclear what action the bank should take next. The decision, which was the third consecutive without action, leaves the key lending rate around 4.3%. Powell also said that if Trump's tariff policies stay in place, they would likely lead to a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and a rise in unemployment.</p>
