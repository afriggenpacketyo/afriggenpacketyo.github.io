          <p>In The Hundred cricket tournament, Jonny Bairstow's impressive unbeaten 86 runs were not enough to secure a victory for Welsh Fire, who lost to London Spirit by eight runs. Despite a late surge from Bairstow, a top-order collapse ultimately cost his team the match. In a separate game, the Oval Invincibles achieved a dominant nine-wicket victory over the Manchester Originals, thanks to a powerful batting performance from Will Jacks and Tawanda Muyeye, maintaining their perfect start to the tournament.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy co-hosted a meeting of European and Ukrainian security officials to discuss the war in Ukraine. The talks, held near London, were reportedly called at the request of the U.S. and aimed to coordinate strategies ahead of the upcoming summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. The meeting underscores European allies' concerns that a bilateral U.S.-Russia deal could be made without Ukraine's direct involvement or consent.</p>

Initially portrayed as a romantic, idyllic paradise in the post-independence era, the region's cinematic image shifted dramatically with the rise of militancy in the late 1980s. Recent films, such as "The Kashmir Files" and "Article 370," are increasingly seen as aligning with government narratives, reflecting the changing political landscape and shaping public perception of the conflict-ridden territory.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of people participated in an anti-immigration protest in the English town of Nuneaton, which included a march through the town center. The demonstration was organized after a local council leader stated that two men charged with the sexual assault of a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers, a claim the BBC could not independently verify. The protest was largely peaceful, although one arrest was made, and a small group of counter-protesters was also present.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Hezbollah weapons depot in southern Lebanon has killed six Lebanese soldiers. The soldiers were inspecting the depot in the Tyre district as part of an effort to dismantle military infrastructure under a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement with Israel. The blast occurred while the unit was removing munitions and unexploded ordnance left over from the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, highlighting the ongoing dangers in the region.</p>

          <p>The Mediterranean Sea is facing a severe environmental crisis due to a combination of plastic pollution, industrial overfishing, and the impacts of climate change. Fishermen from Libya to Egypt report dwindling catches and nets filled with plastic waste, while fish populations are being decimated by destructive trawling practices. Despite new international commitments and national plans to protect the marine ecosystem, local fishermen and activists remain skeptical about whether these promises will be enough to reverse the damage.</p>

          <h2>A History of Modern Gerrymandering and the Republican 'REDMAP' Strategy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of how partisan gerrymandering has reshaped American politics, focusing on the Republican "REDMAP" project launched after 2008. The strategy involved targeting key state legislative races to gain control of the 2010 redistricting process, successfully creating durable legislative and congressional majorities for the GOP. The analysis explains how this, combined with a 2019 Supreme Court decision to not intervene in such cases, has entrenched lawmakers and fueled the current partisan redistricting arms race.</p>

          <p>In a strange diplomatic gesture, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous Soviet-era award to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff. The award, the Order of Lenin, was intended for the family of Michael Gloss, the 21-year-old son of a senior CIA official, who was killed last year while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. This development emerged as a summit between President Trump and Putin was confirmed, adding a bizarre and personal element to the high-stakes U.S.-Russia relationship.</p>

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has filed documents detailing a proposed point-based system to compensate survivors of clergy sexual abuse as part of its bankruptcy settlement. Claims will be assigned points based on the severity of the abuse, with an act like sexual assault receiving 75 points, while being shown pornography receives 10. The total value of the settlement is estimated between $180 million and $235 million, but many survivors and their attorneys are critical of the plan and may vote to reject it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has subpoenaed New York Attorney General Letitia James to testify about her civil fraud investigation into President Donald Trump. This move is seen by James's office as a "weaponization of the justice system" and political retribution for her successful lawsuit against the Trump Organization. The investigation into James is being led by a U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, escalating the political and legal battles between the Trump administration and its perceived adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official documents have revealed that a Royal Navy nuclear weapons base at Coulport, Scotland, leaked radioactive water into a nearby loch due to repeatedly bursting old pipes. The files, obtained after a six-year freedom of information battle, indicate that the navy failed to properly maintain its water pipe network, resulting in an "unnecessary radioactive waste" release. While the Ministry of Defence and environmental regulators maintain there was no unsafe release or significant risk, the issue was caused by "shortfalls in maintenance".</p>
