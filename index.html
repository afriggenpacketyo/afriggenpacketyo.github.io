          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a stay, temporarily pausing a lower court's decision that had blocked President Trump's tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will expedite its review of the case, which questions whether Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses challenging the tariffs, expressed disappointment but remains confident that the court will ultimately find the tariffs unlawful. The White House defended the administration's use of executive powers to address trade deficits and drug trafficking. Optimism remains cautious as the legal battle continues, with oral arguments scheduled for late July.</p>

          <p>Following two days of high-level talks in London, the United States and China have reached a framework agreement to implement the Geneva trade consensus. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement requires approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping before implementation. The Geneva agreement involves a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs added in April and a rollback of certain other measures. While the agreement signals a mutual commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, uncertainty remains regarding concrete agreements and substantive breakthroughs (not investment advice).</p>

The service will be geofenced, and employees will remotely monitor the fleet. Automotive safety advocates and anti-Musk activists are planning protests over safety concerns.</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime during school breaks to encourage children to spend less time on digital devices. The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that outdoor play in England has declined significantly due to various factors. The report calls for a national Play Strategy, updated planning policies, and government guidance to protect play in schools. The aim is to create more child-friendly communities and reverse the growing intolerance towards children playing outdoors.</p>
