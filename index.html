          <p>A former Department of Justice employee faces federal assault charges after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent in Washington, D.C. The confrontation occurred amidst heightened tensions over the President's deployment of National Guard troops and partial federal oversight of the city's police, a move justified by claims of rising crime that local data contradicts. Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the employee was fired, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy for disrespecting law enforcement. The article contrasts this swift action with the department's continued employment of a pardoned January 6 participant who had also verbally assaulted police officers.</p>

          <p>Target and Ulta Beauty have announced the end of their partnership, which established Ulta beauty shops within hundreds of Target stores, effective August 2026. This decision concludes a collaboration that began in 2021 and saw over 600 shop-in-shops open, a feature Target had promoted to drive store traffic and boost its beauty category sales. The termination of this popular deal is seen as a potential setback for Target, which has been facing challenges including declining sales, falling stock value, and reduced store traffic. Analysts suggest that operational issues at Target may have contributed to the dissolution of the successful partnership.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer is divesting its remaining shares in Coterra Energy, citing the company's inability to effectively navigate fluctuating crude oil and natural gas markets. The stock was initially held as a hedge against energy price spikes from geopolitical turmoil, but the company's strategy of shifting between oil and gas production has not been successful this year. The decision to sell at an approximate 8% loss is also influenced by lackluster commodity price dynamics and the potential for presidential actions to further depress oil prices, rendering the investment unviable in the current economic climate (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Los Angeles County attempted to compel City Councilman Curren Price's wife, Del Richardson, to testify before a grand jury convened in March as part of an ongoing corruption investigation. Price faces charges including embezzlement and conflict of interest, alleging he voted on measures that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm and improperly claimed medical benefits. Recently released documents from 2022 identify Richardson as a suspect in the case, though she was not ultimately charged. Price's defense attorney has filed a motion to dismiss the charges, questioning the legality and purpose of the secret grand jury proceedings.</p>

Authorities advise the public to remain calm and avoid handling snakes if encountered in the wild.

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has ended its controversial 'Visit Rwanda' sleeve sponsorship, citing a "strategic evolution" rather than human rights concerns. The club will instead focus on a youth academy partnership in Kigali, a move experts believe is a response to intense pressure from fans and media over Rwanda's human rights record and alleged role in the DR Congo conflict. Critics argue the change is a public relations maneuver, pointing out that Bayern signed a new deal with Emirates Airlines just days before this announcement. The decision highlights the ongoing ethical dilemmas football clubs face when partnering with nation-states for financial and strategic expansion.</p>

This narrow but significant reversal is partly attributed to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by a higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While more girls achieved at least an A grade overall due to higher entry numbers, the trend highlights a shift in subject choices, with business and economics also rising in popularity while humanities subjects decline.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Rebecca Solnit argues that the President's recent federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force is an act of staggering hypocrisy based on false claims about crime. The author draws a parallel to the January 6th Capitol riot, which she calls the most violent day in the city's modern history, also instigated by the President based on lies. The article contends that the move is part of a broader right-wing agenda against diverse, progressive cities and serves as a distraction from other issues, such as the President's association with Jeffrey Epstein.

This power does not extend to other cities like Chicago or Los Angeles, where governors control the National Guard.

In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on its meat-like appeal, launching more "indulgent" products, embracing a "meatier" brand identity, and standing by its genetically engineered heme ingredient for authentic flavor. These opposing bets on whether consumers prioritize "clean" ingredients or taste will shape the future of the stagnant plant-based market.</p>

The King and Queen, along with the Prime Minister, will attend a service of remembrance at the National Memorial Arboretum on Friday. The King's recorded message is expected to reflect on the broadcast made by his grandfather, King George VI, 80 years ago, and will honor the suffering of both soldiers and civilians.

          <h2>Wholesale Inflation Surges, Signaling Potential Price Hikes for Consumers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 12:59:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, rose 0.9% in July, marking its largest monthly increase in over three years and significantly outpacing economists' forecasts. This surge suggests that presidential tariffs on imported goods are beginning to translate into higher costs for businesses, which are likely to be passed on to consumers soon. The report complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, as the strong inflationary pressure could deter a rate cut previously anticipated after a cooler consumer price report. Experts believe businesses' ability to absorb tariff costs is waning, pointing toward broader inflation ahead (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine, ahead of their summit in Alaska. Trump suggested a subsequent meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could involve the leaders deciding how to "divvy things up," a phrase that may cause alarm in Kyiv as it implies potential land concessions. While European leaders were reportedly reassured that Trump would focus on securing a ceasefire, the U.S. president's comments highlight his transactional approach to the conflict. The summit is seen as a critical test of whether a diplomatic path to peace is viable.</p>

This move comes as Google awaits a judge's decision on remedies following a ruling that it holds a search monopoly, with the Department of Justice having previously called for the divestiture of Chrome. While the bid's seriousness is questioned by analysts, it underscores the challenges Google faces from both regulatory bodies and new AI-driven competitors.

          <p>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the popular weight-loss drug Mounjaro, is increasing its UK list price by as much as 170%, a move that will significantly raise costs for private patients. The suggested price for a month's supply of the highest dose will jump from £122 to £330, although the price paid by the NHS under a separate discounted agreement will not be affected. The company stated the increase aligns UK prices more consistently with other European countries, ensuring "fair global contributions to the cost of innovation." This decision is expected to impact many of the estimated 1.5 million people in the UK using weight-loss drugs.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, fell sharply after it announced that tariffs will negatively affect its profits in the upcoming fiscal year. The company projected that higher duties, including the end of the "de minimis" exemption for small-value imports, will cost it $160 million, leading to a full-year earnings forecast below analyst expectations. Despite the profit warning, Tapestry anticipates low single-digit revenue growth and noted that consumer demand has remained strong.

Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the company's core insurance business, which is directly impacted by the rising frequency of extreme weather events like floods and wildfires.

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point in nearly ten months, according to Freddie Mac. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declines, offering a measure of relief and increased purchasing power for prospective homebuyers in a housing market that has been stagnant due to high borrowing costs. The recent drop in rates is linked to a fall in the 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate. However, economists still expect mortgage rates to remain above 6% for the remainder of the year (not investment advice).</p>
