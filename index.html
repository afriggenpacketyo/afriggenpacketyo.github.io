          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to a new plant in Louisville, Kentucky, creating 800 American jobs. A company executive stated that while the move aligns with a long-term strategy to build products closer to consumers, the tariff environment under the Trump administration accelerated the decision. The new plant is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production. The company is hiring for roles in engineering, research and development, and supply chain management.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a comprehensive tax and immigration package, facing a marathon of amendment votes. Democrats have strongly opposed the 940-page bill, criticizing its cuts to Medicaid and SNAP and its tax benefits for the wealthy, while forcing procedural delays. Despite some Republican defections and infighting, including Senator Thom Tillis's decision not to seek reelection over the bill's contents, the legislation narrowly advanced. If passed, the bill will return to the House for another vote, where its fate remains uncertain due to a slim GOP majority.</p>

Musk also suggested he would form a new "America Party" if the legislation passes, marking a significant clash with President Trump, a former ally.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants allegedly associated with the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU argues the law is a wartime authority intended for major military conflicts, not for addressing gang activity, and that the administration has not proven an "invasion" has occurred. Conversely, government attorneys contend that the court lacks the power to overrule the president's determination of a national security threat. The administration claims the gang poses a significant danger, citing FBI assessments of potential assassinations in the U.S.</p>

This plea deal will spare him the death penalty, resulting instead in four consecutive life sentences without the possibility of appeal. The victimsâ€”Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapinâ€”were stabbed to death in their off-campus home. Kohberger, a criminology Ph.D. student at the time, was arrested after a lengthy manhunt, and his trial was scheduled to begin in August.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again. The decision came after Emmett paid $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment over unpaid compensation and health benefits owed to four writers from a collapsed 2019 television project. Emmett's former production company, Emmett/Furla Oasis, was responsible for the debt, but he stated he paid it personally because it was "the right thing to do." The resolution clears a significant hurdle for his current company, which is developing a film with Martin Scorsese.</p>

While analysts see it as a significant strategic asset, particularly in a potential conflict over Taiwan, major questions remain about its technological feasibility and overall cost.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's recent tariffs have not led to a significant surge in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies "front-loading" inventory by importing goods before the tariffs took effect, thus delaying price hikes for consumers. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing the initial costs and waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy before raising prices. The use of bonded warehouses and various tariff exemptions has also resulted in effective duty rates being lower than the officially announced figures. (not investment advice)</p>

The cuts are expected to lead to staff layoffs and a slowdown in faculty hiring, though the School of Medicine will manage its own separate budget reductions.

          <p>Authorities have identified 20-year-old Wess Roley as the suspect who allegedly ambushed and shot three firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, killing two and critically injuring the third. The Kootenai County Sheriff stated that Roley, who was found dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, is believed to have intentionally started the wildfire to lure first responders into the attack. Investigators found Roley's vehicle and believe he was living in it, but a motive for the ambush remains unknown. The suspect had minor prior encounters with law enforcement but no criminal history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Fourth of July celebrations may be affected by President Trump's trade policies, as tariffs on Chinese goods are impacting the fireworks industry. With over 95% of U.S. fireworks imported from China, a 30% tariff has created supply chain disruptions and is expected to lead to higher prices and reduced selection for consumers. Some importers had previously halted shipments when a potential 145% tariff was being considered, further straining inventory ahead of the peak sales season. Major vendors have indicated that while they will absorb some of the cost, price increases on many products are unavoidable.</p>

Turkish officials condemned the cartoon as an affront to religious sensitivities.

The decision follows a meeting between Trump and Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that sanctions were hindering his transitional government.

          <p>The Republican-led reconciliation bill contains significant changes to Medicaid that could cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate version of the bill would reduce federal spending on the program by $1 trillion, leading to 11.8 million people becoming uninsured by 2034. Key provisions include imposing new work requirements on many recipients and cutting provider taxes, which could force the closure of rural hospitals and health centers. Health policy experts warn these changes would disproportionately affect older adults, people with disabilities, and low-income families who rely on the program for essential care.

          <p>Russia unleashed its largest aerial bombardment on Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began, launching over 500 drones and missiles over a single weekend. The massive barrage targeted locations across the country, including regions in Western Ukraine that are far from the front lines and typically spared from such intense attacks. This significant escalation in Russian aggression has raised concerns about the scope and intensity of the ongoing conflict. The attacks caused widespread damage and placed immense pressure on Ukraine's air defense systems, marking a new phase in the war's aerial dimension.</p>

          <p>A gruesome discovery was made in the Mexican state of Sinaloa, where the bodies of 20 people were found on a highway bridge. Authorities reported that several of the victims were decapitated, with all showing signs of gunshot wounds. The killings are believed to be the result of an escalating turf war between rival factions of the Sinaloa drug cartel, which has intensified since the capture of co-founder Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada. The violent conflict between factions loyal to Zambada and those aligned with "El Chapo" Guzman's sons has led to a surge in brutal killings across the state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced its largest-ever healthcare fraud enforcement action, involving nearly 200 cases with intended losses of $14.6 billion. A central case involves a Pakistani national who allegedly orchestrated a $650 million scheme targeting an Arizona Medicaid program for Native Americans, billing for substance abuse services that were never provided. Officials stated these schemes steal directly from taxpayers and undermine the integrity of the healthcare system. The nationwide takedown targeted a wide range of fraudulent activities, from complex billing scams to kickback schemes that exploit vulnerable patient populations.</p>
