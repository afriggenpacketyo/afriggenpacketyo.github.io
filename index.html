Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump spoke on Sunday, agreeing to restart negotiations towards a July 21 deadline. The 3% tax would have applied retroactively to companies like Amazon and Google, and its cancellation is seen by some analysts as a significant concession. (not investment advice)</p>

The company has sued AI startup Anthropic for alleged unlawful data scraping, arguing for fair compensation for the commercial use of its data. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging AI for its own services, like the 'Reddit Answers' chatbot, to provide users with information sourced directly from its community discussions.

The guidelines, known as the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, are a vital resource for doctors managing patients with conditions like heart disease or lupus.

          <p>Homicide rates are falling significantly across the United States, with some analyses showing a drop of at least 14% in 2024. Researchers suggest a primary driver for both the initial spike in violence and its subsequent decline is the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruption of public services, schools, and community centers during the pandemic has been linked to the crime surge, while their recent restoration is credited with helping to lower violence. As local government employment and spending return to pre-pandemic levels, vital support systems for at-risk youth are being re-established, contributing to safer communities.</p>

          <p>Cancer survivors and patient advocates advise that providing effective support to a friend with cancer involves presence, listening, and making specific offers of help. Common mistakes include offering unsolicited advice, sharing stories of others who died from cancer, or disappearing out of fear of saying the wrong thing. Instead, experts recommend simply reaching out, asking if the person wants to talk, and then listening without judgment. Offering practical, specific help, like bringing a particular meal on a certain day, is more useful than a vague offer and helps combat the social isolation many patients experience.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has issued a new directive prioritizing denaturalization cases, which involve stripping citizenship from naturalized Americans who have committed specific crimes. According to a recent memo, the policy targets offenses such as national security violations and major fraud, giving federal attorneys wider discretion in pursuing these cases. Immigration law experts have raised constitutional concerns about the expanded effort, suggesting it could create a second class of citizenship and violate due process, as these cases are often pursued through civil litigation where defendants are not entitled to a government-provided attorney.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of tipping is undergoing a significant transformation, often dubbed 'tipflation,' driven by the proliferation of digital payment systems. Consumers are now frequently presented with pre-calculated tip suggestions of 15%, 20%, or 25% in places where tipping was not previously standard, such as fast-food counters. This shift, accelerated during the pandemic, creates social pressure and confusion for customers. Marketing experts note that the design of these interfaces often defaults to tipping, influencing consumer behavior and increasing transaction fees for payment technology companies, blurring the lines of traditional gratuity norms.</p>

However, conservative members of the ruling coalition, including Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, have urged caution.

          <p>A recent essay posits that the moral framework of the post-war world, defined by a universal condemnation of Adolf Hitler, is now eroding. For decades, Hitler has served as a fixed reference point for evil, reinforcing values like human rights and equality. However, the author argues this consensus is decaying, as seen in the fading taboo against far-right parties and the rise of identity politics that challenge older egalitarian ideals. The article warns that as the Second World War recedes from living memory, the values built in its aftermath are more fragile than we believe.</p>

The amended bill is now expected to save Â£2 billion annually instead of the original Â£5 billion.

          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has set his sights on winning the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat achieved by only a few wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old, who is sumo's 75th yokozuna, is the first new Japanese-born grand champion since 2017. His rapid rise to the sport's highest rank after just 13 tournaments has generated significant attention. Onosato hopes a strong performance in Nagoya will bring energy to his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.</p>

          <h2>Turkey's Main Opposition Party Faces Legal Challenge Threatening Its Leadership</h2>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), is facing a critical court case that could declare its recent party congress null and void. A ruling against the party would delegitimize its entire reform-minded leadership, including chairman Ozgur Ozel, who was elected in November 2023. The lawsuit was filed by the party's old guard, loyal to former leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu, who claim the election process was illegal. The verdict could plunge the CHP into chaos, potentially weakening its ability to challenge President Erdogan's government.</p>

          <p>A field of 288 golfers, including LIV tour members Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, and Graeme McDowell, are competing in final qualifying events across the UK for just 20 spots at The 153rd Open Championship. An intriguing storyline sees Poulter competing against his own son, Luke, at the same qualifying venue in Kent. For McDowell, qualifying would mean a chance to play another Open in his hometown of Royal Portrush. The high-stakes, 36-hole events represent the last chance for many to earn a place in golf's oldest major.</p>
