          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House counsel to investigate Joe Biden's mental state during his time as president, a move Biden dismisses as a distraction. Biden defended his decision-making abilities, asserting that he made all presidential decisions regarding pardons, executive orders, and legislation. The White House claims the investigation is focused on the circumstances surrounding Biden's executive actions during his final years in office. Biden responded, stating that the investigation is a tactic to divert attention from Republican legislative efforts that would cut essential programs to fund tax breaks for the wealthy.</p>

Martin, formerly of Southampton and Swansea City, expressed that he "won't make any promises" but emphasized the importance of securing early wins while fostering player development. A US-based consortium, including the investment arm of the San Francisco 49ers, recently completed a takeover of the club, marking a significant shift in ownership.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation banning travel to the US from nationals of 12 countries and imposing partial restrictions on seven additional countries, citing national security risks. The ban, set to take effect on Monday, includes exceptions for lawful permanent residents, immediate family members, and athletes traveling for major sporting events. The White House stated the restrictions are necessary to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors, referencing a recent attack in Boulder, Colorado. The order calls for periodic review and potential revisions, with reactions to the ban ranging from condemnation by Democrats and human rights groups to promises of cooperation from affected nations.</p>

          <p>A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a significant increase in cannabis use among individuals over 65, with nearly a 50% rise from 2021 to 2023. The article cautions against the misconception that marijuana is safer than alcohol or cigarettes, citing research indicating that THC can damage blood vessels similarly to cigarette smoke. Cannabis use can lead to cognitive decline, anxiety, and psychosis, especially problematic for seniors. The increasing potency of cannabis products and slower metabolism in older adults further exacerbate these risks.</p>

          <p>Louisiana has passed a new law criminalizing attempts to gain a child's trust with the intent to sexually abuse them, championed by a survivor of Catholic clergy molestation, his wife, and her father, a state lawmaker. The law targets offenders at least four years older than the victim and applies even if no abuse has occurred. This makes it illegal to pursue “an intimate relationship with a child under the age of 17 by means of seduction, emotional manipulation, threats, promises, coercion, enticement, isolation or extortion with the specific intent to commit a sex offense … against the minor”. Tim and Sarah Gioe, inspired by their experience with clergy abuse, pushed for the legislation after learning that existing laws were insufficient to prosecute grooming behavior.</p>

          <p>Embryo "adoption" is gaining traction as a Christian right alternative to IVF, which faces increasing scrutiny. These programs view embryos as "preborn" children and match them with mainly white Christian families. The practice is rooted in an evangelical view that cryopreservation disrupts "God's plan" for each embryo. While some see it as a "pro-life" option, critics argue that the Christian right may use embryo adoption to restrict IVF access, potentially harming fertility specialists and future parents.</p>

The company hopes the new console will sustain a rally in its shares, which have risen nearly five-fold since the original Switch was released in 2017. The Switch 2 aims to match the success of its predecessor, which sold over 152 million units.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move that could increase costs on various consumer goods. Experts anticipate higher prices for cars, sports equipment, canned goods, household appliances, and homes due to increased manufacturing costs. While some businesses may absorb the increased costs, others are likely to pass them on to consumers. The tariffs have won over some of the nation's largest steel makers, but economists warn of potential harm to industries reliant on these metals. (not investment advice)</p>

Senate Republicans face complications with a multi-trillion-dollar budget bill, criticized by Elon Musk as a "disgusting abomination." Musk's criticism has emboldened fiscal conservatives, while Republican leaders defend the bill as boosting the economy and cutting spending. The Congressional Budget Office reports the current bill would add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years.</p>

The proclamation also directs the secretary of state to consider revoking visas of foreign students already in the U.S. The move is justified by claims that Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has "extensive entanglements with foreign countries," and has discriminated in its admissions practices. This follows a previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program.</p>
