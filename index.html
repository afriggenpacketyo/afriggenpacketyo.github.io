          <p>Senator Ron Johnson is opposing President Trump's spending bill, arguing it doesn't sufficiently cut government waste and will backfire. Johnson believes spending should return to pre-pandemic levels, a much deeper cut than the House proposed. Despite pressure from Trump, Johnson remains steadfast, advocating for line-by-line cuts and emphasizing the country's grim fiscal situation. He criticizes the House's approach as mere rhetoric, pointing out the rising national debt and the need for serious spending reform (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump has bypassed California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to address immigration protests in Los Angeles County. This decision was made under a rarely used law, highlighting the escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement. The deployment follows clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators, particularly in Paramount and Compton, where a vehicle was set ablaze. The situation underscores the ongoing national debate surrounding immigration policy and federal-state relations. Optimism remains relatively low as the nation grapples with these complex issues.</p>

          <p>Colombian presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot twice in the head and once in the thigh during a campaign event in BogotÃ¡ and is in intensive care.

President Gustavo Petro condemned the attack, calling it a threat to democracy, and offered a reward for information about those behind it. The incident has evoked memories of Colombia's violent past and raised concerns about political stability in the country. The nation now focuses on Uribe's recovery.</p>

          <p>A U.S. deputy marshal in Arizona was briefly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after being misidentified as a suspect. The incident occurred at a federal building in Tucson, and the deputy marshal's identity was quickly verified by other law enforcement officers, leading to his release. This event highlights the pressure ICE agents are under to increase arrests, with the White House reportedly setting high arrest quotas. The administration appears to be shifting away from targeting suspected gang members to a more generalized detention of undocumented immigrants. The incident raises concerns about potential overreach in immigration enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Another series of unmarked graves containing the remains of 14 individuals from Greece's civil war era have been discovered in a park near Thessaloniki. The bodies belong to prisoners, alleged communists and sympathizers, who were executed between 1946 and 1953 at the nearby Yedi Kule castle. The remains were found jumbled and hastily buried, with torsos and heads separated. Relatives of the executed are seeking DNA tests to identify the bodies, reflecting the ongoing efforts to provide closure for families affected by the brutal conflict.

Concerns are rising about the pervasiveness of screens and the potential for technology to detract from the close-knit community and learning environment that small liberal arts colleges strive to create. The author suggests that Pomona could differentiate itself by formalizing experiments in tech-free spaces, such as dorms and dining halls. While acknowledging the importance of technological literacy, the author argues for a more balanced approach to technology on campus. The movement is growing.</p>
