          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have resulted in at least 43 fatalities, in what officials are calling a "mass casualty event." The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, catching many by surprise, including hundreds of children at a summer camp where over two dozen remain missing. Search and rescue operations are extensive, with over 850 people rescued, some from trees, as state and federal authorities coordinate a massive response to the disaster.</p>

          <p>England's national women's football team began their Euro 2025 title defense with a 2-1 loss to France. Pundits and players noted that the Lionesses were outplayed and "bullied" in the midfield for much of the game, only mounting a significant challenge in the final minutes. The defeat leaves the defending champions needing strong results in their remaining group matches against the Netherlands and Wales to advance to the knockout stages. Manager Sarina Wiegman acknowledged the team created its own problems through sloppiness in possession.</p>

          <p>Two American aid workers were injured at a food distribution site in southern Gaza, an attack their organization attributed to Hamas. The incident occurred as Israeli airstrikes reportedly killed 14 people, including a doctor and his children, in the Muwasi area. This violence unfolds amidst ongoing U.S.-led efforts to broker a 60-day ceasefire, to which Hamas has given a "positive" initial response but seeks further negotiations on implementation. The U.N. and other groups have criticized the aid system, which operates near Israeli military positions.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Donald Trump is strategically using unpredictability, a concept political scientists call the "Madman Theory," to influence global affairs. By appearing temperamentally capable of anything, he aims to coerce both allies and adversaries into making concessions, a tactic he believes is yielding results. This approach has led to significant policy shifts, such as increased defense spending from NATO allies, but its effectiveness against entrenched adversaries like Iran and Russia remains questionable. Critics worry this doctrine could undermine U.S. credibility and long-term diplomatic trust.</p>

While some users have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, others are penalized by its strict rules, including a property price cap of £450,000 that hasn't changed since 2017 despite rising house prices.

          <p>England's rugby team delivered a commanding second-half performance to defeat Argentina 35-12 in their first Test match in La Plata. After a tight first half, England scored three quick tries after the break, with Tom Roebuck scoring twice. Fly-half George Ford, earning his 100th cap, masterfully controlled the game, adding crucial points through a drop goal and penalties to stifle an Argentine comeback.

          <p>A new study conducted on women in Los Angeles has found a correlation between exposure to extreme heat and wildfire smoke and negative birth outcomes. This brief report highlights the growing body of evidence that environmental factors, exacerbated by climate change, can have direct and detrimental effects on maternal and fetal health. The findings suggest that pregnant individuals in affected areas may face increased risks, underscoring a need for greater public health awareness and protective measures during heatwaves and periods of poor air quality.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party, the "America Party," stating it will give Americans "back your freedom." The move follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a major spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. Musk suggested the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. This marks a significant political maneuver from the billionaire, who was previously a major donor to and adviser for the Trump administration.</p>

Several armed suspects, some reportedly wearing body armor, were taken into custody after a federal source said a group vandalized the facility and launched fireworks to lure law enforcement to the scene.</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has issued a formal warning to the Nottingham Islam Information Point and disqualified one of its trustees. The action was taken in response to an "inflammatory and divisive" sermon delivered by trustee Harun Abdur Rashid Holmes just days after the October 7 Hamas attacks. The sermon included language from a hadith that, without proper context, was deemed to incite hatred. The regulator found this amounted to mismanagement, stating that charities are expected to bring people together, not stoke division, especially during times of conflict.</p>

The National Weather Service had issued warnings for strong rip currents and high surf for coastal areas across Southern California through the holiday weekend.
