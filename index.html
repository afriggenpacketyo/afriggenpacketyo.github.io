          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a sharp decline, with U.S. stock futures also tumbling, due to investor anxiety over the potential economic repercussions of the Trump administration's latest tariffs.

Economists warn that these broad tariffs could lead to increased inflation, reduced consumer spending, and hindered economic growth. The article also notes differing opinions on whether the Trump administration will ease tariffs in the future, depending on trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Asian stock markets plummeted following President Trump's tariff announcements, with major indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo, and Hong Kong experiencing significant losses. The region is particularly sensitive to fears of a global trade war potentially triggering an economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. The tariffs are directly impacting Asian countries that manufacture a large portion of goods sold globally, with some analysts predicting a 45% chance of a U.S. recession in the next 12 months. The article highlights how countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh, heavily reliant on the U.S. export market, could be disproportionately affected.</p>

          <p>Investors are increasingly turning to safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc in response to market volatility caused by President Trump's recent tariff announcements. Analysts suggest that the yen is a particularly strong candidate due to its undervaluation and the potential narrowing of interest rate differentials with the U.S. The Swiss franc is also viewed as a solid hedge, though some uncertainty surrounds the Bank of Japan's rate hike path. Other potential hedges include bonds, gold, and even the Brazilian real, with the real considered less exposed to global trade. (not investment advice)

          <p>A new WHO report reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023. The report warns that the global target to reduce maternal deaths by 2030 will be missed due to stagnating progress. Leading health organizations caution that recent aid cuts by the US and UK governments risk reversing progress in maternal health, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and India. The report emphasizes the need for increased investment in skilled midwives, quality care, and political commitment to prevent these preventable deaths.</p>

          <p>Despite heightened trade tensions and President Trump's tariffs, China's central bank is signaling a preference for stability over devaluation of the yuan. While the People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily reference rate to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar, it remains above the critical 7.2 benchmark. Analysts interpret this as a deliberate effort to stabilize the currency rather than devalue it to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The recent earthquake in Myanmar has exacerbated the country's existing political turmoil, with the ruling military junta using the aftermath to consolidate control amid a civil war. While the junta has appealed for international aid, analysts believe a lasting ceasefire between the military and resistance forces is unlikely. The junta is expected to exploit the disaster to weaken resistance groups. The earthquake's devastation adds another layer of complexity to Myanmar's already fragile state.</p>

          <p>Despite efforts to normalize the situation in Gaza, moral outrage persists due to the ongoing violence and suffering. The author argues that the scale of the crisis defies inurement, with the illegality and disproportionality of Israel's campaign continuing to mount. Efforts to suppress dissent and silence critics are only highlighting the gravity of the situation and strengthening connections with Palestinians. The author suggests that a shadow government of accountability is emerging, driven by a desire to save lives and end the war.</p>
