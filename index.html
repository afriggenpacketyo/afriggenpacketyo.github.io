          <p>Hundreds of NIH scientists have signed the Bethesda Declaration, urging the NIH Director to safeguard biomedical research from political influence. They claim the Trump administration is prioritizing politics over academic freedom, leading to cutbacks in crucial research areas like COVID-19, health disparities, climate change, and gender-related medical issues. The scientists express concern over a "culture of fear and suppression" that discourages public criticism of the administration's policies. In response, the NIH Director acknowledged the dissent but defended the agency's policy directions, emphasizing the importance of respectful disagreement in science. The declaration underscores the tension between political agendas and the integrity of scientific research. Optimism is tempered by concerns about the politicization of science.</p>

          <p>Vantage Data Centers has successfully raised $820 million through an asset-backed securitization (ABS) deal, a first of its kind in Europe. The financing involves four data centers in Germany, with the funds primarily allocated to repay existing construction loans. The deal garnered significant investor interest, exceeding the amount raised and allowing for favorable pricing adjustments. This move comes amidst increasing demand for data centers, driven by the expansion of AI and cloud computing, particularly in key European markets like Frankfurt and Berlin. The European data center market is projected to grow substantially, with Vantage positioning itself to capitalize on this trend. The company's ability to secure this financing underscores investor confidence in the data center sector.</p>

The North East London Foundation NHS Trust (NELFT) was cleared of corporate manslaughter, and the ward manager, Benjamin Aninakwa, was cleared of gross negligence manslaughter, but both were convicted under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The family expressed their devastation and emphasized the need for kindness and diligence in mental health care, hoping the case will lead to improvements in the system.</p>

          <p>Experts in the field of autism research are expressing concern over Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s emphasis on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, arguing that genetics play a more significant role. Kennedy has launched a federal effort to investigate environmental factors, dismissing genetic research as a "dead end." However, scientists point to the identification of hundreds of genes associated with autism, suggesting that genetics are the most important driver of the condition's development. They fear that Kennedy's focus could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to promising new therapies for individuals with profound autism. The consensus among scientists is that autism is a complex disorder with multiple genetic factors, and that Kennedy's search for a single environmental cause is misguided.</p>

          <p>The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, warns that it cannot verify whether Iran's nuclear program is "entirely peaceful" due to Tehran's lack of cooperation. The IAEA has been denied access to nuclear sites and accuses Iran of sanitizing locations, impeding verification efforts. The agency is seeking explanations for the presence of enriched uranium particles found at three sites in 2020. This warning follows a report that Iran has significantly increased its stockpile of near-weapons-grade enriched uranium, bringing it closer to being able to create nuclear warheads. Tensions remain high as Iran rejects a US proposal regarding its nuclear program, and the situation raises concerns about nuclear proliferation.</p>

The provision to create these accounts has already passed the House as part of a larger budget bill and is now pending in the Senate. The program, previously known as "Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement" or "MAGA Accounts," aims to seed index fund accounts for US citizens born between 2025 and 2028.

          <p>Reform referendums in Italy, championed by center-left opposition groups and labor organizations, appear to have failed due to low voter turnout. With only about 30% of eligible voters participating, the referendums, which included measures to ease citizenship laws and improve workplace protections, did not reach the required 50% threshold to be legally binding. This outcome is considered a significant victory for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who actively opposed the measures and encouraged her supporters to boycott the ballot. The failure of the referendums underscores the challenges faced by opposition groups in mobilizing voters and advancing their agendas in the current political climate. The result strengthens the position of the current government.</p>

Braun said he had previously met Swift and thought they respected each other, but he knew she didn't get along with artists he managed, like Kanye West and Justin Bieber. He reconciled that the public reaction was out of his hands, sold the rights, and said he "can't worry about everyone's niece being mad at me." The incident taught him empathy and the realization that neither the praise he received nor the hate was deserved because people didn't know him.</p>

          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China met in London to address the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries. The US delegation sought confirmation that China would restore the flows of critical minerals. The talks follow a recent phone call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at averting a full-blown trade war. Diplomatic efforts have increased after weeks of heightened trade tensions and uncertainty following Trump's import tariffs. The meeting aims to move forward with the Geneva agreement, which temporarily slashed duties and facilitated talks, but has since faced accusations of violations from both sides.</p>

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially deadly sting, continue to spread across the United States, now found in more than a dozen states. These ants inject venom that can cause anaphylactic shock, particularly dangerous for those with allergies to bee and ant stings. Experts urge vigilance and recommend carrying an EpiPen for individuals at risk. These ants outcompete native species, disrupt seed dispersal, and negatively impact forest ecosystems. They are difficult to spot due to their small size and ability to hide in undisturbed areas, making them a persistent threat to both human health and the environment.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom plans to sue the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, calling the move "illegal and immoral." Newsom contends that the deployment, made without consulting him, violates state sovereignty. National Guard troops were deployed to downtown Los Angeles amid protests and clashes following immigration enforcement operations. Newsom has requested that the federal government rescind the deployment, arguing that there is "no need" for the National Guard. The legal challenge underscores the escalating conflict between California and the Trump administration over immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that Americans' inflation fears receded in May as President Trump eased some of his tariff threats. The survey showed a substantial dip in the one-year inflation outlook, along with decreases in the three-year and five-year forecasts. This shift coincides with Trump's decision to back off from universal tariffs and opt for a negotiating window. The survey results provide some positive news for the White House, which has been working to quell concerns about tariff-induced inflation. The survey also showed positive movement in employment, with fewer people expecting to lose their jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, leading to disapproval of the program. Views on the program's economic impact are mixed, with more believing it will weaken the economy.

          <p>Poland, a NATO member, has put its plans to purchase 32 Black Hawk helicopters on hold, citing the lessons learned from Russia's war in Ukraine. Polish military officials suggest that the conflict demonstrates that helicopters may not be the most effective weapons system to prioritize. The country is reevaluating its military needs, considering investments in drones, tanks, and communication equipment instead. This decision reflects a broader trend among Western countries to adapt their defense strategies in response to the evolving nature of modern warfare, particularly the vulnerability of helicopters in the face of advanced air defenses. The strategic shift emphasizes the need for a diversified and adaptable military force.</p>
