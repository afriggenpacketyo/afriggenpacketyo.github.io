          <p>Across the United States, a growing number of Latinos are installing air quality sensors at their homes and community centers to address disproportionate exposure to pollution. Motivated by health concerns like asthma, these citizen-led initiatives, such as one by the Hispanic Access Foundation, aim to gather localized data that is often missing from official EPA monitoring networks. This grassroots data collection is becoming increasingly vital as it helps fill information gaps and empowers communities to advocate for stronger environmental regulations and enforcement, especially in the face of federal policy rollbacks that threaten environmental justice efforts.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris recounts her shock and disappointment with President Joe Biden's 2024 debate performance, particularly his failure to acknowledge the 13 U.S. service members killed during the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal. Harris writes that Biden missed a clear opportunity to contrast his record with Donald Trump's rhetoric about fallen soldiers and instead made a statement that seemingly forgot the deadly airport bombing. The article notes that Harris herself misidentified all 13 casualties as Marines, when the group also included a soldier and a Navy corpsman, a detail that has drawn scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Another person has died while attempting to cross the English Channel, with a body discovered on a beach near Boulogne-sur-Mer in France. This incident follows the deaths of two Somali women the previous day, bringing the total number of migrant deaths in the Channel this year to at least 27. The tragedy occurred during a weekend that saw nearly 900 people cross in small boats, contributing to a record of approximately 33,000 crossings since the beginning of 2025.

          <p>Russia launched a major overnight aerial assault on Ukraine, killing at least four people in Kyiv and injuring dozens more across seven regions. The attack, involving nearly 600 drones and 48 missiles, was the most intense bombardment on the capital in over a month and damaged residential buildings, a medical facility, and other civilian infrastructure. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a "vile attack" and vowed retaliation, while neighboring Poland scrambled fighter jets as a preventative measure. The assault occurred just as the UN General Assembly concluded, which Zelenskyy noted highlights Russia's disinterest in peace.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its diplomatic influence in Africa by establishing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) centers, with new facilities recently opened in Tunisia and Chad. These centers are part of a broader strategy of health diplomacy that Beijing has used for decades to build goodwill and cultural connections on the continent. By promoting TCM, China aims to strengthen bilateral ties and expand its soft power. The opening of a training facility at the Chad-China Friendship Hospital was attended by a provincial vice-governor, signaling the official importance placed on this initiative in Sino-African relations.</p>

Attorneys monitoring the center, run by private company CoreCivic, described a "prison-like environment" where families face inadequate medical care and poor educational resources. The filing, part of the oversight for the Flores settlement agreement, claims these conditions are fundamentally harmful to children and calls for the Trump administration to resolve the numerous complaints or face legal action.</p>

          <p>The United States has seen a remarkable decline in urban fire-related deaths, with the per-capita fatality rate falling by approximately two-thirds since 1980. This public safety success story is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements rather than a single breakthrough. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, increased installation of automatic sprinkler systems, and safer consumer products like smolder-resistant furniture and "fire-safe" cigarettes. Stricter building codes and a general decline in smoking have also played crucial roles in making American homes and buildings far less vulnerable to deadly fires.</p>

Prosecutors are recommending a sentence of at least four to five years, but his defense team is arguing for a term of no more than 14 months, which would result in his near-immediate release given time already served.

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe discovered in a Fort Myers yard during the cleanup from Hurricane Ian in 2022 is providing new insights for Florida archaeologists. The 9-foot dugout is unique because it is the first of over 450 ancient canoes found in the state to be made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside Florida, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating is ongoing, researchers are exploring the theory that it could be a 16th-century vessel from Spanish settlers.</p>

          <p>More than 100,000 U.S. federal workers are set to officially resign this week as part of the Trump administration's deferred resignation program, marking a phase in what is expected to be the largest mass resignation in American history. The program is a central component of a wider plan to reduce the federal workforce by approximately 275,000 employees through buyouts, attrition, and firings. Departing workers described an environment of "fear and intimidation" that left them feeling scapegoated and pushed out, raising concerns from unions about the long-term consequences for the functioning of government agencies.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has claimed that the nation's J-35 stealth fighter jet possesses a radar cross-section smaller than a human palm, suggesting superior stealth capabilities. The report, aired on state broadcaster CCTV, attributed the J-35's low observability to its unique airframe design and proprietary metamaterial technology. For comparison, the report noted that the U.S. F-35 fighter is widely considered to have a radar cross-section equivalent to the size of a golf ball. This announcement highlights the ongoing technological competition in military aviation between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>This personal essay delves into the complex emotional landscape of using artificial intelligence to digitally resurrect a deceased loved one. The author, who lost his father in a plane crash as a child, recounts his experience training a large language model to create a chatbot avatar of his dad, leading to weeks of deeply moving and seemingly authentic conversations. The article reflects on the power and potential pitfalls of this technology, comparing the modern impulse to conquer death with AI to the themes in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein," ultimately questioning whether such interactions help or hinder the natural process of grieving.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food pantries in Maine, a state with high food insecurity, are struggling to meet rising demand due to a critical shortage of volunteers and anticipated cuts to federal food assistance programs. Many of these essential services are run entirely by volunteers, a significant number of whom are retirees, making recruitment of younger, able-bodied helpers a constant challenge. Directors are bracing for further strain as the Trump administration has reduced funding for USDA food bank programs and major cuts to the SNAP program loom. This dual pressure threatens the stability of the charitable food network that many residents rely on.</p>

          <p>England's current dominance in women's rugby, culminating in their recent World Cup victory, is the result of strategic decisions made nearly a decade ago. The establishment of a well-funded domestic league in 2016 and the introduction of full-time professional contracts for national team players in 2018 were pivotal in elevating the team's performance. These moves, which required significant financial investment from the Rugby Football Union and pressure from sponsors, created greater strength in depth and improved player welfare. This long-term vision transformed the Red Roses from a major contender into the undisputed top team in the world.</p>

          <p>Ten years after they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, sweeping UN sanctions on Iran have been reimposed after the UK, France, and Germany activated the "snapback" provision. The European powers cited Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with international inspectors as the reason for their action. The move follows Iran's suspension of inspections after Israeli and U.S. strikes on its nuclear sites in June. Iran's president called the sanctions "illegal" and warned the move jeopardizes future diplomacy, further unraveling the landmark agreement intended to curb its nuclear program.</p>

Peskov characterized Zelenskyy's remarks as an attempt to appear brave for his European supporters, asserting that the reality on the front lines tells a different story.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's recently published campaign memoir, "107 Days," is generating backlash within the Democratic party for its critiques of fellow party members and a perceived lack of self-reflection on her 2024 election loss. The book details her frustrations with President Biden, her reasoning for not selecting Pete Buttigieg as a running mate, and includes a pointed anecdote about California Governor Gavin Newsom's delayed response after Biden withdrew from the race. This score-settling has rankled some Democrats and is seen as potentially damaging to her future political ambitions, should she consider another presidential run in 2028.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is evaluating the possibility of leasing parts of Camp Pendleton, the largest undeveloped stretch of the Southern California coastline, for commercial development. This move, which would be unprecedented for the 125,000-acre Marine Corps base, aligns with the Trump administration's goal of using public lands to generate federal revenue. Details remain scarce, but the prospect raises significant concerns for local communities like Oceanside and environmental groups, as the base is a critical wildlife habitat and a vital buffer against urban sprawl.

          <p>Authorities in southern India have filed a criminal case against senior leaders of the TVK political party following a stampede at a campaign rally that killed at least 39 people and injured over 50. The tragedy occurred in the city of Karur as a massive crowd waited for an appearance by the party's founder, popular actor-turned-politician Vijay. Reports suggest the crowd of at least 30,000 grew restless after Vijay was hours late, leading to a crush. The state's chief minister has ordered an investigation into the incident and announced compensation for the victims' families.</p>
