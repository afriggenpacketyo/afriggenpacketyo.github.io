          <p>Amid geopolitical tensions and de-dollarization discussions, Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan. Businesses in Qatar are keen to leverage Hong Kong's yuan capabilities for trade and investment with China, indicating a shift away from the US dollar. This trend aligns with China's strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling. The increase in yuan-denominated trades and investments benefits Hong Kong's financial sector, creating more deals and opportunities amidst strengthening ties between China and oil-rich nations.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by Project N.O.L.A. in the search for New Orleans jail escapees has ignited controversy over privacy and constitutional rights. While authorities claim the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive, critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, express concerns about unchecked surveillance and potential racial bias. The New Orleans Police Department's partnership with Project N.O.L.A., which operates 200 facial recognition cameras, is under scrutiny for potentially violating city ordinances and raising accountability issues. The debate highlights the tension between utilizing technology for public safety and safeguarding individual liberties.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter as it approached for landing, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident raised concerns about air traffic control and safety near the airport, especially after a previous deadly midair collision. The Army attributed the lost contact to a temporary antenna issue and stated that the helicopter's location was continuously broadcast. However, federal air traffic controllers reportedly had conflicting data on the helicopter's location, leading to confusion. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before sharing it with them.</p>

The move reflects consumer interest in affordable alternatives due to rising prices, with the aim of increasing overall rice consumption.

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a 22-year-old inmate, was apprehended after escaping from a Louisiana parish jail for the second time. Johnson, who was awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, creating an opportunity for him and another inmate to open a back door. He was previously part of a group of four inmates who escaped in May 2024. Manpower shortages and inadequate staff training were cited as contributing factors to the previous escape. Johnson's capture comes as authorities continue to search for five inmates who escaped from a jail in New Orleans.</p>

The government is expected to begin procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution.

          <p>Billy Joel has cancelled his upcoming concert tour dates due to a recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advised Joel to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds. Joel had been scheduled to perform in several cities across the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., with special guests like Stevie Nicks and Rod Stewart. NPH is a condition where fluid builds up in the brain, causing pressure on brain tissue, and can be treated with a surgical procedure.</p>
