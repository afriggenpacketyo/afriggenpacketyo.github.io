Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for border policing, although the navy can be called upon if needed. The comments came as migrant crossings resumed after a week of bad weather and as the UK government proceeds with a "one in, one out" deportation deal with France to deter illegal migration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its third-party online marketplace involved relaxing its seller vetting processes, leading to the sale of counterfeit and potentially dangerous products. The report details how some sellers used stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create accounts, with shoppers receiving fake items instead of trusted brands. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly to compete with Amazon, creating a "Wild West" environment on the platform where trust and safety were compromised for growth.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has ignited a fierce national debate over free speech, leading to job losses and media suspensions. ABC's indefinite suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, following threats from the FCC Chairman over Kimmel's monologue, has become a central flashpoint. President Trump has intensified the situation by suggesting that broadcasters critical of him could lose their licenses. This has raised concerns among constitutional experts about the government using its power to weaponize speech and suppress criticism, blurring the lines between private employment and First Amendment protections.</p>

          <p>An appeals court has ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs, stating that Congress holds the power to set such duties. In response, Trump issued a frantic statement claiming the decision would “literally destroy the United States of America.” Critics argue this reaction is baseless, as the U.S. economy prospered long before these tariffs, which many economists believe have fueled inflation. Trump's hyperbolic language is seen as an attempt to pressure the Supreme Court, where he has appealed the ruling.</p>

          <p>American neo-fascist fight clubs, known as “active clubs,” are capitalizing on the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk to recruit new members. These groups are using his death as a rallying cry, framing it as evidence of an “anti-White” campaign and urging white men to join their movement for vengeance. Despite ideological differences with Kirk, these extremist organizations see his killing as a major inflection point to spread their radical message. This trend is viewed by global authorities as a significant and organized domestic terrorism threat emanating from far-right ideologies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues for the passage of "Connor's Law," which would codify the English language proficiency requirement for commercial motor vehicle drivers. The author cites the tragic death of 18-year-old Connor Dzion, who was killed by a truck driver unable to read English warning signs, as a key reason for stricter enforcement. The piece contends that the Obama administration weakened this safety rule and that while the Trump administration reinstated enforcement, a federal law is necessary to ensure consistent application across states and prevent similar preventable accidents.</p>

          <p>The relationship between the European Union and China has deteriorated significantly, contrary to earlier hopes for a diplomatic reset. An EU trade official noted that instead of a "charm offensive" from Beijing, relations have worsened due to China's actions on trade and its perceived support for Russia's war efforts. European businesses are expressing growing frustration, with a recent survey showing that very few of their applications for certain processes in China have been approved, leading to production stoppages and highlighting the failure of recent dialogue to yield tangible results.</p>

The Home Office successfully argued its case by tightening rules around human trafficking claims, allowing for the migrant's immediate removal. This marks a significant legal victory for the government's strategy to deter small boat crossings.

The figures exceed official forecasts and intensify pressure on the chancellor ahead of the upcoming Budget.

          <p>Washington D.C.'s delegate to Congress, 88-year-old Eleanor Holmes Norton, is facing a primary challenge from city council member Robert White, who argues the district needs its "strongest fighters" against interference from the Trump administration. The challenge comes amid growing concerns about Norton's ability to continue serving effectively, especially after President Trump's recent temporary federal takeover of the D.C. police. White's announcement follows a call from Norton's former chief of staff for her to retire after her current term, citing a need for energetic representation.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish governments have unveiled a new agreement to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles, which Ireland's deputy prime minister described as a "night and day improvement" over the current controversial Legacy Act. The new framework aims to provide "maximum truth, justice and accountability" by restoring inquests that were previously halted and establishing independent oversight bodies. This deal seeks to resolve the diplomatic rift caused by the 2023 Legacy Act, which was widely opposed by victims' groups and political parties in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <p>The United States is investing in a Zambian copper and cobalt facility in an effort to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency will provide a $1.4 million grant for a feasibility study to expand the Kazozu mine, which is operated by a subsidiary of a U.S.-based company. The project aims to secure a direct supply of these metals, essential for electric vehicle batteries and military equipment, for the U.S. and its allies, directly challenging China's near-monopoly on cobalt production and processing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a podcast discussion, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens and host Garry Kasparov explore the state of American democracy, arguing that the traditional left-right political divide is becoming obsolete. Stephens suggests that the country needs a new political realignment centered on a truly liberal party—one dedicated to free markets, free speech, and the rule of law, in opposition to both illiberal nationalism and socialism. He contends that such a party could only emerge from the collapse of one of the existing major parties, and that Democrats must shift towards the center to effectively counter the MAGA movement.</p>

          <p>California officials are warning financial assistance recipients about a fraudulent mobile app on the Apple App Store that mimics the state's official EBT management tool. The phony app, named “Ebt edge - food stamps,” attempts to scam users by charging weekly or lifetime access fees, whereas the legitimate state-sponsored “ebtEDGE” app is free. The state's Department of Social Services has alerted Apple to the fraudulent app, which requires users to input their EBT card information. Officials advise users to verify the app's logo and remember that the state never charges for EBT management services.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has overturned a $100,000 jury verdict against celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos in a legal malpractice lawsuit. The suit was filed by a youth basketball coach who alleged Geragos and disgraced attorney Michael Avenatti botched a potential settlement with Nike by engaging in an extortion scheme. Although the jury found Geragos had breached his duties, it also determined the coach was not substantially harmed, creating a legal contradiction. Both sides agreed to vacate the verdict, resulting in a judgment in favor of Geragos, who will not have to pay any damages.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old hiker has been released from the hospital after being attacked by a bear, likely a grizzly, on a remote trail in Yellowstone National Park. The man was hiking alone when he surprised the animal and sustained significant, though not life-threatening, injuries to his chest and arm while attempting to use bear spray. Park officials believe the bear was acting in self-defense after being startled and will not take any management action against it. The incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of wildlife encounters, although such attacks remain extremely rare.</p>

Despite widespread desire for testing, only half of the residents were able to access it, leading to significant anxiety and stress. The survey also highlighted a deep distrust among survivors toward conflicting information from public officials and the media. Many have had to seek and pay for private testing, which has found contaminants like lead, arsenic, and asbestos inside homes left standing.</p>

          <p>Grocery prices in the U.S. have surged 29% since February 2020, causing significant financial anxiety for many American households. The initial price hikes were driven by pandemic-related supply chain disruptions, followed by the war in Ukraine, avian flu, and now President Trump's tariffs on imported foods like coffee and bananas. Consumers are coping by changing their shopping habits, seeking sales, buying cheaper store brands, and in some cases, skipping meals. Despite political promises to lower costs, economists note that prices rarely decrease once they have risen, and current policies may continue to exert upward pressure.</p>
