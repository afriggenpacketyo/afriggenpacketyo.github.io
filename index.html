          <p>Chinese authorities have escalated an investigation into a kindergarten in Gansu province suspected of causing lead poisoning in children. The central government, including the State Council and national ministries, has joined the provincial task force to oversee the case. The issue was discovered when children were tested in another province, as local tests had shown no problems. Eight individuals, including the principal, have been detained on suspicion of using inedible, lead-based paint to color food for the students.</p>

          <h2>Malaysia Navigates Rising Tide of Religious Conservatism in Politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:38:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Malaysia is experiencing a significant political shift with the growing influence of Islamic-oriented parties, challenging Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration. The opposition Perikatan Nasional coalition, which includes the conservative Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), has gained substantial electoral ground, particularly among younger Malay voters. This "green wave" reflects a push for policies like stricter dress codes and Islamic criminal law, raising concerns about the nation's multi-ethnic and multi-religious identity. Analysts suggest this trend stems from disillusionment with mainstream parties and could lead to a more conservative society.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching highs of 33.1°C in England. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also recorded their warmest days of the year so far. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heat has prompted hosepipe bans and wildfire warnings, but the Met Office forecasts a cooldown with rain expected for most of the country early next week.</p>

          <p>A new study offers insights into the impact of China's dam-building on the Brahmaputra river, which flows into India. Contrary to fears that new dams could cause droughts downstream, data from two existing dams suggests the opposite may be true. The study found that since 2014, water flow during the dry season has significantly increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This research provides the first concrete evidence on the downstream effects, indicating that China's water management might be augmenting rather than diminishing water supply for India during critical periods.</p>

Araujo, who took a plea deal, testified against Abell, claiming he led the brutal beating.

          <p>Two individuals who were wrongly arrested and publicly accused of felling the historic Sycamore Gap tree have spoken about the intense harassment they faced. A former lumberjack, Walter Renwick, and a 16-year-old boy were targeted by online sleuths and media speculation after the iconic tree was cut down. Renwick described being recognized and ostracized in his community, while the teenager was subjected to vicious online abuse. Both were eventually cleared by police, who later convicted two other men for the crime, highlighting the damaging impact of trial by social media.</p>

          <p>Josue De Paula, a top prospect in the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, earned the Most Valuable Player award at the All-Star Futures Game with a game-winning three-run homerun. The 20-year-old left fielder's 416-foot blast secured a 4-2 victory for the National League team. De Paula, who is currently playing for the Class A Great Lakes affiliate, is highly ranked for his combination of power, speed, and plate discipline. His performance on the national stage was an emotional moment for the young player, who expressed his strong desire to become a long-term major leaguer for the Dodgers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's historic steel towns, such as Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, are facing increased economic pressure amid a long-term industry decline, now compounded by uncertainty over U.S. trade tariffs. While the UK was exempted from a recent tariff hike, the continued existence of a 25% tariff on steel exports to the U.S. has frayed nerves and reportedly cost orders. This comes as the industry grapples with high energy prices and plant closures, leading to significant job losses. The situation raises profound questions about the future of these communities and whether they can pivot to new industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel has publicly refuted rumors that he is considering resigning from his position. Speculation arose following reports of a "heated confrontation" with Attorney General Pam Bondi over the Justice Department's decision not to release more files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The decision angered some of President Trump's staunchest supporters. In a social media post, Patel dismissed the "conspiracy theories" and affirmed his commitment to serving the president, attempting to quell talk of a major rift between the DOJ and the FBI's leadership on the issue.</p>

          <p>The BBC was granted rare access to a major coltan mining site in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which is currently under the control of the M23 rebel group. The mine in Rubaya is a vital source for the mineral used in mobile phones and other electronics, with thousands of miners working daily under the rebels' supervision. The M23 claims it has brought security and organization to the site, though a UN report detailed how the group profits heavily from taxing the mineral. The visit comes amid a fragile peace process, with the region's vast mineral wealth a key factor in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival, largely attributed to its massive growth on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV ratings are improving, the show's official accounts have gained millions of followers, with short clips, recaps, and fan analysis driving online discourse. This shift in consumption allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to the daily hour-long episodes. Analysts and former contestants note this changes the viewing experience, as character narratives are compressed into bite-sized, context-lacking clips for a new generation of fans.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas Hill Country killed at least 129 people, including summer campers, and left dozens missing over a holiday weekend.

Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timing and effectiveness of their emergency warnings, with some survivors stating they received no alerts. The disaster has prompted a massive search and recovery operation and raised questions about the adequacy of flood preparedness in the region.</p>

          <p>Investigators are set to begin a two-year excavation at the site of a former church-run children's home in Tuam, Ireland, where the remains of hundreds of babies and toddlers are believed to be buried. The St Mary's home, which operated from 1925 to 1961, housed unmarried mothers and their children. An amateur historian, Catherine Corliss, uncovered death records for 796 children who died at the home but could find no corresponding burial records, leading to the discovery of human remains in a defunct sewage system in 2017. The excavation aims to recover and identify the remains, bringing closure to a dark chapter in Irish history.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose 30% tariffs on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. In letters to the leaders of both trading partners, President Trump cited persistent trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking. The move represents a significant escalation of the administration's trade policy, which has relied on tariffs to try and renegotiate global trade relationships. The EU and Mexico have both criticized the decision, with the EU stating it will take "proportionate countermeasures" if required. (not investment advice)</p>
