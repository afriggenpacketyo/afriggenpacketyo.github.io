          <p>Ad-tech company AppLovin saw its stock rise significantly after reporting second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations. The company's growth is largely attributed to its AI technology, which enhances ad targeting in mobile games. CEO Adam Foroughi also anticipates future growth stemming from the legal battle between Apple and Epic Games. The court's ruling against Apple's App Store policies could lead game developers to increase their advertising budgets, directly benefiting platforms like AppLovin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), is seeking a nearly $10 billion rate increase over the next four years, a proposal environmental groups claim would be the largest in U.S. history.

However, consumer advocates and environmental organizations criticize the move, arguing it will strain vulnerable households and disproportionately benefit company shareholders.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a 3-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account would yield higher returns on a $20,000 deposit amid a shifting interest rate environment. While a money market account might currently offer a slightly higher rate, its variable nature means earnings could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as expected. A 3-month CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return, making it a more predictable, albeit potentially marginally less profitable, option for savers seeking stability over a short term.

          <p>A U.S. envoy has publicly called for Panama to prevent a Chinese-linked company from continuing to operate key ports at the Panama Canal. The diplomat criticized Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, labeling it a "bad operator" and a "company of the Communist Party." This statement comes as the company's 25-year concession renewal faces legal challenges in Panama's Supreme Court over alleged constitutional and financial irregularities.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel intends to take full security control of the Gaza Strip to remove Hamas but does not wish to govern the territory permanently. In a Fox News interview, he said the goal is to "hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly." This announcement of a potential expansion of military operations comes amid strong international pressure on Israel to end the war due to the severe humanitarian crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is warning that hundreds of thousands of people trapped in the Sudanese city of El Fasher are facing starvation. The city, the last major urban center in the Darfur region not controlled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has been under siege for over a year. The conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese Armed Forces has blocked all humanitarian aid routes, forcing residents to eat animal fodder to survive and creating what the UN calls the world's largest humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to start planning for a new U.S. Census that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move revives a contentious issue from his first term, when his administration's attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court. The Constitution mandates an "actual enumeration" of all persons every ten years to determine the allocation of seats in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, alleging he is "highly conflicted" due to ties with China. The accusation appears to stem from a letter by Senator Tom Cotton, which raised concerns about Tan's investments in Chinese companies allegedly linked to the military. The unusual presidential intervention caused Intel's stock to fall and comes as the administration pressures the semiconductor industry to bolster domestic manufacturing and sever ties with China on advanced technology.
