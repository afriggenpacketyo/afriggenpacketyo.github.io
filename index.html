          <p>Former President Donald Trump claims that JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America discriminated against him by rejecting him as a customer, forcing him to use smaller banks for his finances. These allegations come as the White House is reportedly preparing an executive order to fine banks for "de-banking" clients based on their political affiliations. The banks involved have denied that their decisions are politically motivated, with some industry groups suggesting that vague regulatory pressures are the true cause of such account closures. The controversy highlights the growing tension between the financial industry and the Trump administration over this issue.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee, led by Republican James Comer, has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for depositions regarding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The committee also subpoenaed the Justice Department for its complete, unredacted files on the case, along with seeking testimony from a list of former and current high-ranking officials. This move follows the Trump administration's decision not to release additional federal files on Epstein, a choice that drew criticism from those who believe a "client list" of his associates has been concealed from the public.</p>

          <p>After President Trump fired the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner over a significant downward revision to recent job numbers, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a standard part of the process. Former BLS officials and economists note that initial reports are released with incomplete data to ensure timeliness and are routinely revised as more information becomes available. They assert that the revisions are a feature, not a failure, of the system and do not indicate political bias. The recent large revision is attributed to factors like the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies and late reporting from state and local governments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennessee has executed inmate Byron Black, aged 69, despite a legal battle over his implanted heart defibrillator. This marks what experts believe is the first execution of a person with a working implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Black's attorneys had argued that the device could deliver painful electric shocks to his heart during the lethal injection, potentially causing unnecessary suffering and a "grotesque spectacle." The state's courts ultimately rejected this claim, and the governor declined to grant a reprieve. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend, Angela Clay, and her two young daughters.</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation of partisan conflict, Texas Republicans have voted to authorize state law enforcement to locate and arrest Democratic legislators who fled the state. The Democrats' departure was a move to deny a quorum and block a vote on a contentious redistricting plan that would create five new Republican-leaning congressional seats. More than 50 Democrats traveled to Illinois to prevent the vote from proceeding. While the arrest warrants are only enforceable within Texas, the action underscores the intense national battle over electoral maps and political power ahead of the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

The case stems from a European Court of Justice ruling in favor of player Lassana Diarra, which found that certain FIFA rules illegally restricted player movement.

          <p>During a wide-ranging television interview, former President Donald Trump insulted Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas, referring to her as one of the party's "low-IQ people." He then went on a tangent, questioning if she was related to "the late, great Davy Crockett," the 19th-century politician and frontiersman. This is not the first time Trump has attacked Crockett, a vocal critic who has called the former president a "ridiculous tyrant." Crockett has never publicly claimed a relationship with Davy Crockett, and there is no evidence to suggest one exists.</p>

          <p>Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in the killing of four people in Tennessee, has been captured after a week on the run. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation announced his arrest in a wooded area in Jackson. Drummond is the prime suspect in the July 29 killings of Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend, whose bodies were found along a road in Lake County. The investigation began after the victims' infant was found abandoned in a car seat in a nearby yard. Drummond now faces four counts of first-degree murder and other charges.</p>

          <p>Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, reported quarterly earnings and revenue that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. The disappointing results were driven by declining same-store sales in the United States for both KFC and Pizza Hut, which fell by 5% each. Executives attributed the domestic struggles to increased competition and value messaging that failed to resonate with consumers. In contrast, Taco Bell continued to perform well, with same-store sales growing by 4%, although even this was slightly below analysts' higher projections for the chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new phone system at the Social Security Administration (SSA) is rerouting calls intended for local offices to other locations, often to staff who cannot directly resolve the caller's issue. While the SSA claims the goal is to reduce wait times, employees and union representatives report that the system creates delays because cases must be referred back to the original servicing office. Disability advocates warn this change is making it harder for people to get help and could undermine public confidence in the system. Employees state they cannot take direct action on cases outside their jurisdiction, creating a cumbersome process for beneficiaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by Scott Anderson, "King of Kings," challenges grand theories about the 1979 Iranian Revolution, arguing it was not a historical inevitability but a contingent event shaped by miscalculations and accidents. The book focuses on the hubris of the shah, who missed growing dissent, and the profound ignorance of the U.S. government, which was oblivious to the threats facing its key ally. Anderson's account suggests the revolutionary camp, led by Ayatollah Khomeini, won by outsmarting both the shah and his American backers. This perspective shifts the focus from deep cultural or religious causes to the specific actions and inactions of key players in the critical months leading to the revolution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has forcefully endorsed the controversial Texas redistricting plan, stating in an interview that Republicans are "entitled" to the five additional congressional seats the new map would create. His comments come as Texas Democrats have fled the state to prevent a vote on the plan, which they argue is a form of racial gerrymandering designed to suppress minority voters. Trump justified his position by citing his own electoral success in Texas and accused Democratic-led states of gerrymandering. His intervention adds presidential pressure to the already intense partisan battle over the state's electoral boundaries.</p>

          <p>The new congressional map proposed by Texas Republicans is facing strong opposition from voting rights advocates, who argue it unconstitutionally dilutes the power of Latino voters. Critics point out that the plan dismantles existing minority-opportunity districts, such as the one in Austin, and cracks communities of color to weaken their collective influence. Despite Latinos being the state's largest demographic, the map does not create new Latino-majority districts as advocates contend is required by the Voting Rights Act. The proposal is viewed as a calculated move to secure a GOP political advantage at the expense of fair minority representation.</p>

          <p>For individuals turning 70, purchasing an annuity can be a strategic move to secure a guaranteed retirement income stream, but it requires careful consideration. The decision depends on factors like personal health, family longevity, and overall financial situation. While buying an annuity later in life typically results in higher monthly payments, it also means the principal becomes illiquid. This article explores the trade-offs, noting that the ideal time to buy is often between 70 and 75, when retirees can command high payouts while still having a reasonable life expectancy to benefit from the investment.
