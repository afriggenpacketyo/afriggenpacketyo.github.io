          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are actively investigating media reports alleging that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection detail to gather personal information on his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. The claims suggest he provided an officer with her date of birth and social security number shortly before a photograph of their first meeting was published. This development follows Prince Andrew's recent decision to relinquish his royal titles amid ongoing scrutiny of his association with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. The allegations raise serious concerns about the potential misuse of taxpayer-funded security services for personal matters.</p>

          <p>A group of thieves conducted a brazen daytime robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing jewelry described as having "inestimable heritage and historical value." The perpetrators reportedly used a basket lift to access and force open a window, then smashed display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon to seize the items before escaping. The museum was forced to close immediately as French authorities launched a major investigation into the professionally executed heist. This incident highlights ongoing security challenges at major European cultural institutions, echoing previous high-profile museum thefts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched airstrikes and artillery fire into southern Gaza, stating the action was a response to Hamas firing on its soldiers, including with a rocket-propelled grenade. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action" against what he termed "terrorist targets," calling the incident a bold violation of the recent U.S.-brokered ceasefire. Hamas's military wing denied involvement in any clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the truce and stating it had lost contact with its groups in that area. The escalation tests the stability of the fragile peace agreement intended to end the prolonged conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a public warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas may be planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians within the Gaza Strip. The statement emphasized that such an act would represent a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement and could undermine recent progress made through mediation efforts. Hamas has rejected the claims as "false allegations," accusing Israel of supporting armed gangs in the region. The warning comes amid a tense period, following the recent execution of alleged collaborators by Hamas fighters.</p>

          <p>A commentary by Charles M. Blow highlights the severe crisis facing local news in the United States, with an average of two newspapers closing each week and over 3,200 vanishing since 2005. The decline has resulted in a 60% reduction in newsroom employees, creating "news deserts" and weakening the social fabric of communities. The article argues that local outlets provide essential "connective tissue," from accountability reporting to community announcements, which helps bridge partisan divides. The loss of these institutions is presented as a threat to both community cohesion and democratic health.</p>

In an interview, Johnson clarified that his criticism was aimed at the protesters' message, not the individuals, citing what he described as violent rhetoric and hateful messages seen in photos and videos from the demonstrations. When pressed on his comparison of protesters to the modern Democratic Party, he asserted that his comments were not directed at the entire party but pointed to a perceived rise of Marxism within its ranks.</p>

U.S. Customs and Border Protection cited concerns over illicit cross-border activity in the area as the reason for the change.

          <p>In a "60 Minutes" interview, Jared Kushner, a key architect of the Israel-Hamas peace deal, stated that the long-term success of the agreement hinges on establishing "a viable alternative" to Hamas for governing Gaza. He predicted that Hamas would continue to use violent tactics to reassert its control and that if a new governing structure is successful, Hamas will ultimately fail. Kushner's comments provide context to the ongoing fragility of the ceasefire, which has already been tested by clashes and U.S. warnings of further violence. The peace plan calls for an interim body of Palestinians and international experts to eventually run the territory.</p>

          <h2>Georgia Faces Unprecedented Electricity Demand Driven by AI Data Centers, Sparking Rate Hike Fears</h2>

          <p>Georgia is experiencing a historic surge in demand for electricity, primarily driven by the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. The state's main utility, Georgia Power, is requesting a massive increase in energy generation capacity, with about 80% of the new power intended for these facilities. This has sparked widespread concern among consumer advocates and environmental groups, who fear that residential customers will be forced to bear the cost through higher utility bills. Public hearings are scheduled to address the issue, which highlights a growing national conflict between technological expansion and its impact on public utilities and the environment.</p>

          <p>A Suzhou-based robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a massive surge in orders from U.S. clients rushing to make purchases before potential new tariffs take effect. The company, which produces components for humanoid robots, received over 1,000 new orders in a single week after President Trump threatened a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports. A company source noted that clients explicitly cited the tariff threat as the reason for the emergency purchases, forcing the firm's factories to work overtime. This illustrates the immediate market disruption caused by the administration's aggressive trade policy rhetoric.</p>

          <p>AI safety-focused startup Anthropic is facing challenges on two fronts: competing with the larger, well-funded OpenAI and navigating policy disagreements with the U.S. government. David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has publicly accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" to promote a restrictive regulatory agenda that he believes hinders American innovation against rivals like China. Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI staff with a mission to build safer AI, has advocated for more government oversight and opposed the administration's efforts to block state-level AI rules. This positions the two leading AI companies on opposite sides of the crucial debate over AI governance and regulation.</p>

          <p>As Medicare's open enrollment period begins, beneficiaries are encouraged to carefully review their health and prescription drug coverage for the upcoming year. Experts advise against simply letting current plans renew, as changes in provider networks, drug formularies, and costs could lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses. The article outlines the options available, such as switching between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage plans or changing Part D prescription plans. It also notes that the ongoing federal government shutdown could cause delays in accessing information, suggesting beneficiaries wait before finalizing their decisions.</p>

This move comes ahead of an EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting where Georgia's political situation will be discussed. Georgian officials have previously accused EU ambassadors of backing attempts to overthrow the government, following a disputed election and a crackdown on pro-EU opposition figures.</p>

Liu defended China's retaliatory fees on U.S. ships as a necessary measure to protect its own industry's interests.

          <p>The rapid rise in pickleball's popularity has been accompanied by a significant increase in related eye injuries, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that the incidence of injuries like corneal abrasions and lacerations has risen by hundreds of cases each year from 2021 to 2024, with adults over 50 being most affected. The study's authors call for the development of standardized eye protection guidelines for the sport, noting that protective eyewear can prevent up to 90% of such injuries. The findings serve as a public health warning for the nearly 20 million people now playing the sport.</p>

After being detained during a routine check-in, his family has mounted a legal challenge, arguing his detention is unconstitutional as there is no likelihood of removal. His case underscores the human element of immigration policy and the difficulties faced by stateless individuals.</p>
