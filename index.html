          <p>Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, stated that the United States is increasingly aware of Japan's economic importance after trade discussions with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa and U.S. officials agreed on the need to quickly conclude a trade deal, though securing major concessions for Japan seems unlikely. Prior to these talks, Prime Minister Ishiba and President Trump discussed the importance of productive negotiations, with Japan continuing to push for the removal of additional tariffs. Japan is seeking the elimination of tariffs on cars and auto parts, but is considering compromises to reach an early agreement.</p>

Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto mogul, posted a video of his White House tour, while another executive said the firm's founder had also been invited.

NPH is a brain condition where fluid builds up, disrupting brain functions and causing symptoms like trouble thinking and walking.

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited a debate over privacy and civil liberties. Authorities credit the technology with helping recapture one of the fugitives, but the New Orleans Police Department's use of facial recognition cameras run by a private organization has drawn scrutiny. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise concerns about the potential for misuse and bias in the technology. The New Orleans Police Department has stated that they have paused the use of automated alerts from the group.</p>

          <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council, weeks after President Trump replaced his national security adviser and gave Secretary of State Marco Rubio the powerful post. Some NSC staff are being reassigned, while others are being placed on administrative leave. Vice President Vance's national security adviser, Andy Baker, is taking a top role in the restructured NSC. The changes come after a series of upheavals at the NSC, including the firing of staffers and the accidental sharing of information with a reporter.</p>

Additionally, male hummingbirds' beaks grew pointier to compete for feeder access, and the birds expanded their range northward. The study underscores the impact of human activities on the evolution of species.</p>
