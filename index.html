          <p>Zarah Sultana, a suspended Member of Parliament, has announced her resignation from the UK's Labour Party to establish a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. Sultana, who was stripped of the Labour whip for opposing the two-child benefit cap, cited the current government's policies and Labour's failure to provide a meaningful alternative as her motivation. In her announcement, she accused the political establishment of enabling what she termed a "genocide" in Gaza and failing to address growing poverty and the cost of living crisis. The new party aims to unite independent MPs and activists to challenge what they describe as a broken political system.</p>

          <p>A deadly mass shooting in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and fourteen others wounded after gunmen in a dark vehicle opened fire on a crowd. The victims were gathered outside the Artis Lounge nightclub, where they had been attending an album release party for local rapper Mello Buckzz. Authorities have indicated the attack was targeted, with some of the victims, ranging in age from 21 to 32, being close to the rapper, who later posted tributes online. This violent incident has deeply shaken the community, and the nightclub, which has been shut down by the city, was also the site of a previous mass shooting in 2022.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Labor Market Surpasses Expectations with 147,000 Jobs Added in June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 16:33:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated surprising strength in June, adding 147,000 jobs and defying expectations of a more significant slowdown. This robust growth, primarily in the government and healthcare sectors, pushed the national unemployment rate down to 4.1%, a new low for the year. Despite the positive report, economists express caution for the second half of the year, citing potential negative impacts from President Trump's trade tariffs, which they believe could slow economic activity. The strong employment figures make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will maintain current interest rates rather than implementing anticipated cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed spending bill introduces several significant tax breaks that are scheduled to expire in 2028, at the end of his potential second term. Among these temporary provisions is a federal income tax exemption for tips and another for overtime pay, both with income phase-outs and deduction caps. The bill also includes a temporary deduction for interest paid on new auto loans for U.S.-assembled vehicles and establishes 'Trump accounts,' a new savings vehicle for children born between 2025 and 2028, seeded with a one-time $1,000 government deposit. While these changes are not permanent, they mirror the structure of the 2017 tax cuts, which were also extended before their sunset date.</p>

          <p>A Cessna aircraft carrying fifteen people for a skydiving trip crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in New Jersey, injuring everyone on board. The pilot reported engine trouble and attempted an emergency landing, but the plane overran the runway into a wooded area. Despite the severity of the crash, which officials described as a "big pile of metal," there were miraculously no fatalities, though three individuals remain in critical condition. The NTSB and FAA are investigating the incident, noting the same aircraft was involved in a previous landing accident in 2023.</p>

          <p>As California battles its largest wildfire of the year, this article provides a helpful glossary of essential terms used by officials and media to describe the situation. It defines concepts such as 'megafire,' which is a blaze burning over 100,000 acres, and explains that 'containment level' refers to the percentage of the fire's perimeter secured by firefighters. The article also clarifies the difference between an 'evacuation warning' (prepare to leave) and an 'evacuation order' (leave immediately). Understanding these terms, along with 'red flag warning' and 'prescribed burn,' is crucial for residents to accurately assess their risk during fire season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House has narrowly passed President Trump's signature domestic policy package, known as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill," in a 218-214 vote. The legislation, which now heads to the president's desk, includes trillions in tax cuts and increased immigration enforcement, offset by major cuts to Medicaid and other social programs. The passage followed a tense, delayed overnight session where Republican leadership, with pressure from Trump, successfully swayed several holdouts who were concerned about the bill's impact on the national deficit. Democrats were uniformly opposed, with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries delivering a record-breaking speech to condemn the bill's deep cuts to social safety nets.</p>

          <p>In a satirical take on the recent passage of the Republican spending bill, this article from The Atlantic imagines a conversation among America's Founding Fathers about the chaotic legislative process. James Madison and Alexander Hamilton are humorously depicted as being bewildered by the modern-day proceedings, including a 940-page bill with mystery provisions and record-long voting times held open to pressure holdouts. The piece lampoons the political maneuvering, such as special provisions for whalers to secure a vote and the House Speaker waiting for a member to drive back with a change of clothes. The satire critiques the departure from the Founders' intended system of careful deliberation and coequal branches of government.</p>

          <p>A new grand jury indictment against Barry Morphew reveals shocking details in the murder of his wife, Suzanne, whose remains were found in a shallow grave in September 2023. The indictment alleges her body was moved at least twice after her death, as forensic analysis suggests she did not decompose at the location where her bones were discovered. Furthermore, toxicologists found a mixture of tranquilizer chemicals used for wildlife in her bone marrow, a compound Barry Morphew admitted to using on deer. This evidence suggests her death was not immediate, supporting a theory that she was drugged before being killed, contradicting her husband's long-standing claims of innocence.</p>

The findings suggest that while the ministry's named lists are accurate, they likely under-report the total number of fatalities. The study confirms that women, children, and the elderly account for over half of the violent deaths, providing a grim demographic picture of the conflict's toll.</p>

          <p>The BBC has issued a formal apology after broadcasting a controversial Glastonbury festival performance by the rap-punk group Bob Vylan, during which the band led the crowd in a "Death to the IDF" chant. BBC Director-General Tim Davie expressed deep regret for the broadcast of what he called "offensive and deplorable behavior," specifically apologizing to Jewish colleagues and the community. In response to the backlash, which included a police investigation and the band's U.S. visa revocation, the broadcaster has announced new policies for future festival coverage, including keeping "high risk" acts off of live streams.</p>

          <p>The relationship between Russia and Azerbaijan has become severely strained following a violent police raid in Yekaterinburg that resulted in the death of two ethnic Azeri men. Azerbaijan condemned the raid as an "unacceptable act of violence" and retaliated by canceling Russian cultural events and arresting two Russian journalists in Baku. The Kremlin has downplayed the incident, but the situation has spiraled with reciprocal arrests of citizens in both countries. Analysts suggest this diplomatic crisis is exacerbating existing tensions, particularly since a 2024 incident where an Azerbaijani passenger plane was shot down over Russia, and signals Baku's increasingly assertive stance toward Moscow.</p>

          <p>A group of former diplomats is raising alarms over a plan by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to reorganize the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL). The plan would allegedly shutter most offices devoted to human rights, lay off up to 80% of its expert staff, and strip the bureau of its policy-making functions. Critics argue this move will effectively end America's commitment to promoting human rights globally, leaving no experts at the table during critical foreign policy debates. They warn that this will undermine decades of bipartisan work, imperil vulnerable populations, and send a dangerous message that the U.S. no longer views human rights as a priority.</p>

          <p>Following multi-million dollar settlements with Meta and X, President Trump's legal team is now in "productive discussions" with Google regarding his 2021 lawsuit against the company. Trump sued Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, alleging that YouTube illegally censored him by restricting his account after the January 6 Capitol attack. The case was previously on hold but has been revived after Elon Musk's X settled for $10 million, preventing an appellate court ruling. This leaves Google's Pichai in a difficult position: risk the president's ire by continuing a legal fight he might win, or follow other tech giants by settling the case, likely with a substantial donation to Trump's presidential library fund.</p>

This article details the personal story of a father whose 19-year-old son was shot and killed while attempting to retrieve a food box from a US-backed GHF distribution center located in a militarized zone. The situation is exacerbated by an Israeli blockade and intense fighting, forcing desperate people to risk their lives for basic necessities like flour. Despite claims from the GHF that its sites are safe, major charities have called for its closure, arguing it forces starving people into active combat areas.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. decision to pause a shipment of arms to Ukraine, including critical air defense missiles, is a significant blow to Kyiv and a clear signal of shifting priorities under the Trump administration. While the State Department described it as a one-off event, the move has deepened concerns in both Kyiv and European capitals about the long-term reliability of American support. This uncertainty is compelling European allies to increase their own production and investment in Ukraine's domestic defense industry to fill the potential gap. Analysts believe the pause is a political choice to placate Russia, forcing Ukraine and Europe to prepare for a future with less American military assistance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill" delivers a major victory for the fossil fuel industry while effectively dismantling federal support for solar and wind power. The new law mandates numerous new oil and gas lease sales on federal lands and waters, slashes royalty rates for producers, and enhances tax credits for using captured carbon to extract more oil. Conversely, it phases out long-standing investment and production tax credits that have been crucial for the growth of the renewable energy sector.

          <p>For the fifth consecutive week, average U.S. mortgage rates have fallen, with the 30-year fixed rate now at 6.67%, offering a slight reprieve for potential homebuyers. This downward trend may continue, as many experts anticipate the Federal Reserve could cut its benchmark interest rate in September, which would likely push mortgage rates even lower. In light of this, prospective buyers are advised to take immediate steps to prepare for a potentially more competitive market. Key actions include checking and improving their credit reports, researching and selecting an experienced real estate agent, and securing a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen their position when making an offer.

This article argues that such ambitious legislation often triggers a negative public reaction as voters learn more about its contents, particularly the cuts to social programs affecting millions.
