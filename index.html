            <h2>Defense Secretary Hegseth Reportedly Shared Yemen Strike Details in Second Signal Chat</h2>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is under scrutiny for allegedly sharing sensitive military information about a planned strike on Houthis in Yemen via a second Signal group chat. This chat, created on his personal phone, included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer, and reportedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets involved in the attack. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of Signal to determine if DoD policies were followed, which may complicate ongoing investigations into potential leaks from a previous chat. John Ullyot, former Pentagon spokesman, described the situation as a "meltdown" and questioned Hegseth's future in his role.</p>

            <p>A man is facing criticism on social media after describing his reaction to his Brazilian girlfriend's offer to cook chicken hearts. The man used the word 'icky' (possibly 'disgusting') to describe the idea of eating chicken hearts, leading to an argument where his girlfriend accused him of being disrespectful to her culture. While many commenters agreed that he wasn't obligated to try the dish, they criticized his phrasing and lack of sensitivity, suggesting he could have expressed his disinterest more diplomatically. The incident sparked a broader discussion about expressing personal food preferences while respecting cultural traditions.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," non-sexual unions driven by practical advantages and social pressures, are on the rise. Satsuki and Minato, a couple in their 30s, exemplify this trend, having entered into a friendship marriage three years ago to gain social security benefits and appease family expectations. A Tokyo-based agency has facilitated over 300 such marriages in the past decade, highlighting a growing acceptance of partnerships based on companionship rather than romance or sex. While these arrangements offer a solution for individuals who don't fit traditional marital norms, some experts view them as a "desperate measure" in a society where same-sex marriage is not recognized.</p>

            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" that was announced by Vladimir Putin, which has now expired. Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russian troops had violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times since the start of Sunday. Russia's defence ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Meanwhile, Donald Trump said that "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week", without giving further details. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and currently controls about 20% Ukraine's territory.</p>

            <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) steady, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This decision comes after China reported better-than-expected economic data, including a 5.4% GDP growth in the first quarter, providing the central bank with room to keep rates unchanged. The PBOC's move appears to be focused on stabilizing the yuan as tariffs imposed by the U.S. put pressure on the currency. Economists largely anticipated the PBOC's decision to hold rates steady.

White House officials defended the deportation efforts, labeling the detainees as "terrorist aliens," while Trump's advisor Stephen Miller shared Paredes' information on social media, alleging his gang affiliation and criminal charges.

            <p>A Texas man has been sentenced for trafficking vulnerable baby Mexican spider monkeys into San Diego for sale on Facebook. Sarmad Ghaled Dafar, 33, received four months in custody and home confinement for smuggling six primates, who were too young to be separated from their mothers. Officials intercepted three of the monkeys in 2023 and discovered Dafar's involvement through the smuggler's phone.

            <p>This opinion piece discusses the potential impact of Donald Trump's tariffs on China's economy, arguing that they may force China to address its economic weaknesses and become more self-reliant. The author suggests that China is preparing for a long-term economic conflict with the U.S., and that resolving domestic market fragmentation will be key to mitigating the impact of the tariffs. While the U.S. has restricted exports of semiconductors to China, it could capitalize on Chinese demand for other products, but this is unlikely due to Washington’s restrictions.</p>

            <p>Despite the British government's efforts to reform the childcare system with "free hours," many parents still struggle to find nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. The rollout of the scheme, which aims to provide 30 hours of free childcare per week for eligible working parents, faces hurdles such as increasing demand, staffing shortages, and funding challenges for private nurseries. While Labour proposes creating more school-based nurseries, the system remains heavily reliant on private providers, some of whom are threatening to withdraw due to rising costs and government restrictions.</p>

This reluctance can negatively impact men's health outcomes, with experts emphasizing the need to address these barriers and encourage men to seek preventative care and mental health support.

Cooper stated that the government will strengthen the law to better protect important memorials, while emphasizing the importance of freedom of speech and protest. The Metropolitan Police are investigating the incidents as criminal damage, and the Greater London Authority is working to remove the graffiti.</p>

The expedition will create geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, mapping dangerous areas and helping residents feel safer, which is key to the tourism industry that is a vital part of Santorini's economy.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an emergency appeal from the ACLU.

The White House and Stephen Miller responded, claiming the detainees were "foreign terrorists." The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old US citizen, was wrongfully detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days. Despite claiming to be a US citizen, Hermosillo was held and accused of entering the country illegally. His family provided his birth certificate and social security card, leading to his eventual release after a federal judge dismissed the case. This incident highlights concerns about wrongful detentions and the Trump administration's immigration policies, which have emboldened immigration officers to arrest and deport individuals.</p>

            <p>Brian Fennel, an American musician performing under the name SYML (Welsh for "simple"), is reclaiming his lost Welsh roots through his music. Adopted at birth, Fennel discovered his birth parents were Welsh and uses his artist name to honor his heritage. He explores themes of identity and grief in his "cinematic and melancholic" music, which he finds therapeutic. Despite not speaking Welsh or having visited Wales extensively, Fennel embraces his Welshness, viewing it as a significant part of his identity.</p>
