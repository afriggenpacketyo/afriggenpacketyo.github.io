            <p>President Trump is moving forward with significant tariffs on goods from various countries, sparking concerns about potential economic damage and widespread trade wars. Despite warnings and calls for reconsideration, the US president insists that "many" countries are seeking deals with Washington. Beijing has vowed to retaliate if Trump imposes additional tariffs, potentially raising the total tariff on Chinese imports to 104%. This action signals an escalation in global trade tensions and potential economic repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Leaders of the Foodbank of Southern California are facing a lawsuit alleging they misused over $11 million in state funds for personal enrichment, including trips to Las Vegas, home renovations, and luxury items.

            <p>Elon Musk and Peter Navarro, two key advisors to President Trump, are engaged in a public feud over Tesla's manufacturing practices. Navarro claimed Tesla is merely a car assembler relying on foreign-made parts, while Musk countered that Tesla has the most American-made cars. Fact-checkers confirm that Tesla is significantly more vertically integrated than most automakers, doing much of its manufacturing in-house. Government data supports Musk's claim that Tesla sources a high percentage of parts from the U.S. and Canada.</p>

            <p>A federal appeals panel has expressed concerns that a trial judge may have overstepped his authority by ordering the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to build more housing on its West Los Angeles campus. While the panel acknowledged the VA's failure to adequately serve veterans, they questioned the breadth of the judge's order. The case involves a complex class-action lawsuit challenging the VA's use of the land and its obligations to provide housing for disabled veterans. The panel is considering how to restrict the judge's powers while addressing the needs of veterans.</p>

            <p>Consumers in Canada and Denmark are boycotting American products in response to President Trump's tariffs and policies. Canadians are using apps to identify and purchase local alternatives, while Danes are canceling subscriptions to US streaming services. The movement is driven by frustration with Trump's actions and a desire to support local businesses. Economists suggest the long-term impact of the boycott may be limited, but it is currently boosting sales for many Canadian brands.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore the Associated Press's (AP) access to presidential events after the White House restricted the news agency due to a dispute over the term "Gulf of America". Judge Trevor McFadden ruled that the restriction violated the First Amendment. The AP had argued that the administration was infringing on press freedom by limiting access due to disagreements over language. The ruling has been welcomed by press organizations as a reaffirmation of the fundamental right of the press.</p>

            <p>Advocates are criticizing the State Department's decision to cut $1.3 billion in food aid, warning that it could be a "death sentence" for millions. The cuts affect programs in Afghanistan, Yemen, Somalia, Syria, and Lebanon, among others. The State Department claims that the majority of funding to the World Food Programme (WFP) remains active, but some programs were terminated due to concerns about misuse and support for terrorist groups. The WFP has expressed concerns about the potential impact on vulnerable populations facing extreme hunger.</p>
