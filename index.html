          <p>New files from the Jeffrey Epstein estate, released by Congressional Democrats, mention prominent figures including Elon Musk and Prince Andrew. The documents appear to show an invitation for Musk to Epstein's island in 2014 and a flight manifest from 2000 listing Prince Andrew as a passenger. Other notable individuals named include Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon, though the files do not imply they were aware of Epstein's criminal activities. These records are part of an ongoing effort to bring justice for survivors by shedding light on Epstein's connections to powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to withhold over $4 billion in foreign aid that Congress had previously approved. In a 6-3 decision, the court granted an emergency request to freeze a lower court's injunction that would have forced the administration to spend the funds. The majority opinion suggested that the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs outweighed the potential harm to the aid organizations suing the government. The dissenting justices argued the ruling allows the executive branch to override Congress's constitutional power of appropriation, impacting global development and democracy programs.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast station owners Sinclair and Nexstar have announced they will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" starting Friday, ending a multi-day preemption. The stations had stopped showing the program after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments, which also led Disney's ABC network to temporarily suspend the show. Both companies stated their decisions were made independently of government influence, despite an FCC chairman's comments raising questions about broadcast licenses. The move restores the late-night show to approximately 20% of the country where it had been unavailable, including in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>The New York City medical examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, the gunman responsible for killing four people in Midtown Manhattan in July, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the degenerative brain disease and asking for his brain to be studied. Investigators believe he was targeting the NFL headquarters located in the building, and his notes expressed anger at the league for allegedly concealing brain injury dangers. While experts caution against directly linking CTE to his actions, the finding highlights ongoing concerns about the long-term consequences of head injuries in sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.2 trillion, many Americans are exploring options beyond minimum payments to manage their finances. Two common approaches are debt relief programs and credit counseling, which operate differently. Debt relief programs, such as debt settlement, aim to reduce the total amount owed by negotiating with creditors, but this can negatively impact credit scores. In contrast, credit counseling focuses on creating a manageable debt management plan to repay the full amount over time, often with lower interest rates, which generally has a milder effect on credit. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, debt load, and risk tolerance.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice argued in a Supreme Court filing that President Trump firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook would not lead to a "financial market disaster." The administration is asking the high court to allow Cook's removal while her lawsuit against the president proceeds. Trump seeks to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud that predate her appointment, which she denies. Cook's lawyers contend that allowing the president to remove her on these grounds would undermine the Federal Reserve's independence and risk market chaos, while the DOJ maintains the president's removal power for such misfeasance is necessary.</p>

          <p>Ian Roberts, the superintendent of Iowa's largest school district, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on Friday. According to ICE, Roberts, originally from Guyana, was in the country illegally with a final order of removal and no work authorization. The agency stated that Roberts initially fled when approached and was later found in possession of a handgun and a knife. The Des Moines Public Schools board expressed shock, stating they were unaware of his immigration status and are awaiting more information before determining next steps for the district's leadership.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows How Debt Forgiveness Could Significantly Reduce a $20,000 Credit Card Balance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with a $20,000 credit card balance, pursuing debt forgiveness, or debt settlement, could lead to substantial savings. A successful negotiation could potentially reduce the owed amount by 30% to 50%, meaning a cardholder might pay between $10,000 and $14,000 to resolve the debt. This approach offers a much faster resolution compared to making minimum payments, which could take decades and accrue tens of thousands in interest at current rates. However, debt settlement can negatively impact one's credit score and may have tax implications on the forgiven amount.</p>

          <p>Mark Francis Ford, a 64-year-old former Roman Catholic priest who served in two Louisiana gubernatorial administrations, has been arrested on charges including first-degree sexual assault. The allegations stem from his time ministering to disabled children in New Orleans, with the accuser stating the abuse began around 2004 when he was 10 years old. The accuser, who has a degenerative spinal cord condition and is on the autism spectrum, reported the abuse to police in November. Ford was arrested in Indiana and is awaiting extradition to New Orleans to face multiple charges.</p>

          <p>Recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have had a minimal impact on the monthly payments for a new $20,000 home equity loan. Currently, a 10-year loan at an average rate of 8.34% would cost approximately $246 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be around $194 per month. These figures are only slightly lower than costs from earlier in the year, before the rate cuts. Despite the modest change, home equity loans remain an attractive borrowing option due to their fixed rates, which offer predictable payments compared to variable-rate HELOCs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new tariffs, including a 50% levy on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, citing national security concerns under Section 232 of a trade law. This justification has left many trade experts questioning how furniture and home fixtures could pose a threat to U.S. national security. The move bypasses Congress and expands the administration's use of the provision, which was previously applied to materials like steel and aluminum. Critics argue the rationale is becoming increasingly thin and that such actions create uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of remaining hostages could be imminent, stating "it's looking like we have a deal." His comments came shortly before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN General Assembly, where he firmly rejected the idea of a Palestinian state, calling it "sheer madness." The U.S. has reportedly circulated a peace proposal that includes a renewed dialogue for peaceful coexistence. Meanwhile, a new study revealed that international doctors in Gaza have treated injuries more severe than in other recent conflicts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to move 2026 World Cup matches out of U.S. host cities he considers "a little bit dangerous," appearing to target cities with Democratic leadership like Seattle and San Francisco. However, experts and officials involved in the planning say the president does not have the authority to relocate games, as FIFA oversees all tournament logistics. While moving matches is considered practically impossible due to existing contracts, the administration could create difficulties for disfavored cities by controlling the reimbursement of federal funds allocated for World Cup security, giving the White House leverage over expenditures.</p>

          <p>The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and legal observers, who describe it as a politically motivated abuse of power by the Trump administration. Critics point to the recent replacement of the U.S. attorney in the district where Comey was charged as evidence of political interference. They argue the move is part of President Trump's broader campaign to use the Justice Department for retribution against his political opponents. In contrast, President Trump and his allies have celebrated the indictment as a necessary step toward accountability.</p>

The lobster, a one-in-30-million genetic anomaly, was temporarily housed in a 20-gallon tank before being released back into the wild. The rescue was facilitated by the wildlife group Humane Long Island and the New York Aquarium, who helped return the crustacean to the Long Island Sound.

          <p>The UK Labour Party has readmitted former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum after they were suspended for a year. Their suspension followed a vote against the Conservative government's two-child benefit cap, which went against the Labour leadership's position at the time. Their reinstatement comes as the party appears to be softening its stance on the controversial policy, which limits welfare payments for families with more than two children. Upon her return, Begum criticized the party for suspending MPs who vote with their conscience, highlighting a persistent ideological divide within Labour.</p>
