          <p>Gary Lineker is expected to leave the BBC following a social media post deemed antisemitic. The former England striker had previously been suspended for impartiality issues related to government asylum policy criticism. The BBC has emphasized that its reputation is upheld by everyone, and mistakes have consequences. Lineker had announced his departure from Match of the Day but was slated to continue FA Cup and World Cup coverage, however BBC bosses considered Lineker's position untenable.</p>

The announcement follows extensive ground operations by the Israeli Defense Forces throughout Gaza, with strikes hitting various locations, including a hospital. Negotiators from Israel and Hamas continue to seek a ceasefire agreement in Qatar, although no breakthrough has been achieved, and the humanitarian situation remains dire.</p>

          <p>Federal and local agencies are investigating a crash involving a Mexican tall ship, the Cuauhtémoc, which collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two deaths and numerous injuries. The ship, carrying 277 people, lost power while departing the South Street Seaport for Iceland, causing it to drift backward and strike the bridge. Senator Schumer has questioned whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have played a role in the incident, citing potential dysfunction within the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service. The NTSB is dispatching a go-team to investigate, and officials have confirmed that the bridge's structural integrity remains intact, though a monitoring system was damaged.</p>

Mr. Biden's cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the Trump administration's policy granting refugee status to White South Africans, saying people should be "celebrating" the move. He argued that White South Africans are targeted for property confiscation and violence. He also said "there may be more coming soon." The South African government has denied claims of land confiscations and racially motivated discrimination, setting the stage for tensions during President Ramaphosa's upcoming visit to the White House.</p>
