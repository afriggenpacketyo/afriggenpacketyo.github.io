          <h2>Trump Shifts Blame for Economic Contraction to Biden, Citing Tariff Impact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a report indicating a 0.3% contraction in the U.S. economy during the first quarter, President Trump attributed the downturn to his predecessor's policies, despite having been in office for over two months of the measured period. He defended his tariff policies, predicting an economic boom once the "Biden overhang" is eliminated, while also urging patience. The GDP decline, driven by increased imports ahead of tariff implementation and reduced government spending, contradicts Trump's earlier claims of positive economic developments and is prompting concerns about the potential for a 'Trumpcession.' Trump previously credited himself for stock market gains during Biden's term, a claim disputed by former White House officials.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, has been released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order in Vermont, after being detained on April 16th. Mahdawi's attorneys argued that the Trump administration was attempting to deport him in retaliation for his leadership in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, infringing upon his First Amendment rights. Mahdawi has previously refuted allegations of antisemitism within the Columbia protests and stated that his compassion extends to both Palestinian and Jewish people, and that he had stepped back from protests before encampments formed on campus last year. A judge had previously issued an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.</p>

          <p>Three more Kneecap concerts in Germany have been canceled following the emergence of footage showing a band member seemingly calling for MPs to be killed, now under assessment by counter-terrorism police. The band's manager claims the cancellations are part of a "smear campaign" intended to silence artists speaking about Palestine, denying the band's remarks were a call to action. The band has apologized to the Amess and Cox families, stating they never intended to cause hurt. TV personality Sharon Osbourne has called for the band's US work visas to be revoked after their performance at the Coachella music festival in California.</p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes on Wednesday targeting "operatives" south of Damascus, claiming they attacked Druse civilians, amid escalating sectarian violence in Syria. The strikes follow clashes between pro-government fighters and Druse militiamen, sparked by an audio clip insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The violence has heightened fears among Syria’s diverse minorities about persecution under the new Islamist leadership that took power after overthrowing Bashar al-Assad in December. Israel, home to a substantial Druse community, has offered protection to Syrian Druse, although many have rejected the offer, and the Syrian government has promised to respond to attacks on its forces with an iron fist.</p>

          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop after the social media company chose not to provide second-quarter guidance, citing uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. The company expressed concerns that changing macro conditions could negatively impact advertising demand. Snap's finance chief noted that some advertisers are already feeling the effects of changes to the de minimis exemption, which allows shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. President Trump's evolving tariff policies have contributed to the unsettling backdrop for companies, and fears of a weakening economy have further fueled concerns about potential reductions in advertising spending.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter, declining at a 0.3 percent annual rate, largely due to increased imports and decreased government spending. While underlying economic indicators suggest solid growth, uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies and tariffs is expected to further slow economic activity. Consumers and businesses front-loaded purchases to avoid tariffs, and economists anticipate a slowdown in spending and investment in the coming months. Trump has blamed his predecessor for the economic downturn, but experts attribute it to the impact of his own policies on trade and consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths in the United States have fallen significantly, with a 26% decrease in 2024, marking a substantial improvement after a long-running crisis. Experts attribute the decline to factors such as the end of pandemic isolation, increased awareness of fentanyl risks, and expanded access to addiction treatments and naloxone. However, the Trump administration is considering budget cuts to opioid treatment programs, including those that supply Narcan, raising concerns about a potential reversal of progress. While the reasons for the decline are not fully understood, increased access to Narcan and public health campaigns are seen as key factors.</p>

          <p>A recent study has linked phthalates, chemicals commonly found in plastics, to an estimated 350,000 heart disease deaths globally in 2018, with researchers estimating that 13% of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds could be attributed to phthalate exposure. While experts agree that phthalates are harmful endocrine disrupters, they caution that the study relied on statistical modeling and assumptions, making it difficult to determine the exact number of deaths linked to these chemicals. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between phthalates and heart health, as well as the influence of other factors such as socioeconomic status and dietary habits.</p>

          <p>Foreign shareholders planning to attend Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha face new concerns due to heightened political tensions and President Trump's trade policies. Chinese investors, in particular, are wary of traveling to the U.S., citing a risk alert issued by China for tourists. Some shareholders from other countries have also decided to stay home due to concerns about customs issues. The annual gathering, traditionally a popular event for international investors, is seeing fewer third-party agencies organizing trips to Omaha this year.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to improve his public image by making unannounced visits to local bars in France, engaging in casual conversations with citizens about their concerns. Macron, often perceived as remote, aims to connect with the French people and address issues such as healthcare, jobs, and salaries. These visits are part of a broader effort to reassure the public amidst global uncertainties and strengthen his connection with voters, especially in areas where mainstream parties have faced rejection. While critics view the initiative as "authenticity in kit form," Macron's popularity has seen a recent surge, reflecting a renewed sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>The US economy experienced an unforeseen contraction of 0.3% in the first three months of President Trump's term, according to preliminary data, triggering a stock market decline. The downturn, attributed to increased imports and decreased consumer and government spending, has raised concerns about a potential US slowdown amid a global trade war. President Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the negative economic news, while economists attributed the downturn to a surge in imports as businesses and consumers stockpiled in anticipation of future Trump tariffs.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch has accused the government of failing to fulfill its promise to establish five local inquiries into grooming gangs, despite pledging to allocate £5 million for the purpose. Badenoch suggested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer was deliberately delaying the inquiries to protect Labour-run councils from scandal. The accusations arose during Prime Ministers Questions, where Badenoch repeatedly pressed Starmer for updates on the local inquiries. Starmer defended Labour's commitment to delivering truth and justice for victims of grooming gangs, citing his previous role in overseeing the first grooming gang prosecution.</p>
