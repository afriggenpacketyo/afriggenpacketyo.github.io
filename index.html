          <p>China's government has initiated a one-year program to subsidize interest on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. The plan, announced by the Ministry of Finance and other key financial bodies, will cover one percentage point of annual interest on qualifying loans, including those for cars and education. This policy is part of a larger strategy to unlock consumer spending potential, with the central government funding 90% of the subsidy costs. The effectiveness of the program will be evaluated for potential extension or expansion after its initial run concludes next August. (not investment advice)</p>

In his first at-bat, Bregman hit a two-run home run, becoming the first MLB player in over 60 years to homer in his first road plate appearance against a team with which he won at least two World Series titles. The Astros honored him with a video tribute, which was met with a standing ovation from the crowd. Despite Bregman's historic night, the Astros ultimately won the game, continuing a tight race in the league standings.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane later this week. The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, has already caused deadly flooding there, with at least eight fatalities reported. While early models suggest it will become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean, it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are monitoring its path, as there is still uncertainty about its long-term trajectory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 800 D.C. National Guard members and temporarily assumed control of the city's Metropolitan Police Department to address crime. This article details the legal framework allowing this federal action, noting the president's unique authority over the D.C. Guard. While Guard members are authorized to make arrests under Title 32, their current mission is primarily to support federal law enforcement agencies already active in the city. The move has drawn a mixed response, with D.C.'s mayor calling it "unsettling" while the police union has expressed support for the federal takeover.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's jailed former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested following allegations of stock manipulation, bribery, and meddling in political nominations. A court issued a detention warrant, citing the risk of evidence destruction after she denied all charges during a hearing. This marks the first time in the country's history that both a former president and first lady have been imprisoned. The charges against Kim include profiting from a stock price-rigging scheme and accepting luxury items as bribes, adding to a history of political scandals involving South Korean leaders.</p>

The offer, which Perplexity claims is backed by several investors, comes as the company competes in the burgeoning generative AI market. The DOJ's recommendation was part of the remedy phase of an antitrust lawsuit Google lost, with the agency arguing that a divestiture would level the playing field for search competitors. This ambitious bid highlights the aggressive strategies emerging from AI startups aiming to challenge established tech giants.</p>

          <p>While overall cancer survival rates have doubled in the last 50 years, a new study highlights a growing disparity between different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have a 10-year survival rate above 90%, thanks to advances in treatment and early detection. However, progress has been minimal for some of the deadliest cancers, such as pancreatic, oesophageal, stomach, and lung cancer, which still have survival rates below 20%. Researchers and health advocates are calling for a new government strategy focused on cutting wait times and investing in research for these harder-to-treat cancers.</p>

Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, follows with 25%, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, also an independent, trails at 7%. The poll reveals a generational divide, with Mamdani holding a large lead among younger voters while Cuomo performs better with those over 55.

          <p>Oklahoma Sooners quarterback John Mateer has responded to allegations of sports betting after screenshots of his Venmo transactions from 2022 surfaced online. The transactions included descriptions like "sports gambling," which is a violation of NCAA rules for student-athletes. In a public statement, Mateer denied ever betting on sports, explaining that the descriptions were merely "inside jokes" between friends and did not reflect the actual nature of the payments. Oklahoma Athletics stated it is aware of the situation and takes gambling allegations seriously, but noted it is unaware of any pending NCAA investigation into the matter.</p>

          <p>Residents in parts of Juneau, Alaska, are being urged to evacuate due to an imminent threat of major flooding from the Mendenhall River. The flood is caused by a "glacial outburst," where a lake dammed by glacial ice collapses, releasing massive amounts of water. This phenomenon, exacerbated by climate change, has caused significant damage in previous years, and forecasters predict this year's flood could surpass last year's record-breaking event. Although officials have installed miles of emergency barriers, a preemptive disaster declaration has been issued as the city braces for the potential inundation.</p>

          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) in the UK has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in sensitive and high-profile investigations. The change aims to increase transparency and combat misinformation that can spread rapidly on social media and pose a risk to public safety. This move follows several high-profile cases where public speculation about suspects' backgrounds led to unrest. While decisions will remain with individual forces, the guidance seeks to create a more consistent and fair approach to releasing information to the public.</p>

          <p>Approximately 100 protestors gathered in the English village of Charlbury for a "Dance against Vance" event to express their disapproval of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who is vacationing nearby.

The protest highlights local opposition to the vice president's political stances, turning his private holiday into a public political statement.

          <p>A report from the UK's Transport Committee has recommended piloting a free bus pass scheme for everyone under 22 in England to improve access to jobs and education. The report highlights that declining bus services and rising fares, which have outpaced inflation, create significant barriers for young people, particularly in rural areas. Drawing a parallel to Scotland, where under-22s already travel free, MPs argue the measure could help reverse a decade-long drop in bus usage. The proposal aims to address how limited and costly public transport can restrict opportunity and contribute to social exclusion for young people.</p>

          <p>The chief executive of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to power AI data centers with its small modular reactors (SMRs) could make it the UK's most valuable firm. The engineering giant has already signed deals with the UK and Czech governments to provide its nuclear technology for energy-intensive AI operations. This strategic pivot into SMRs, a technology in which Rolls-Royce has unique capabilities, represents a massive potential market. This ambitious vision has contributed to a ten-fold increase in the company's share price since Erginbilgic took over in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's automotive industry is at a critical point, with vehicle production in the first half of 2025 hitting its lowest level since 1953. Factory closures, high energy and labor costs, and the lingering effects of Brexit and the pandemic have contributed to this steep decline. Experts warn that the industry is losing its critical mass, which could have severe knock-on effects for regional economies and the national supply chain. While some new investments in electric vehicle production offer a glimmer of hope, there are serious doubts about whether the industry can recover its former scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has brokered a controversial deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% share of the revenue for the U.S. government. The agreement, intended to bypass existing export controls, has sparked bipartisan criticism from lawmakers who argue it compromises national security for financial gain. Legal experts also question the constitutionality of the arrangement, which functions like an export tax. While the White House defends the deal by noting the chips are less powerful, it sets a contentious precedent for U.S. tech and trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the right-wing Heritage Foundation, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), raising alarms among economists. The nomination comes shortly after Trump fired the previous commissioner following a disappointing jobs report. Antoni is a known critic of the traditionally nonpartisan agency and has suggested that the BLS could stop issuing its influential monthly jobs reports in favor of quarterly data. This has fueled concerns that the administration seeks to politicize economic data and undermine the integrity of the agency responsible for crucial economic reporting.</p>

The new charges claim Price also voted on city grants and motions that financially benefited agencies that were paying his wife's consulting firm hundreds of thousands of dollars.

It follows several unsuccessful rounds of talks and a deadline Trump set for a ceasefire. While the White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," Trump has suggested it is a "feel-out meeting," with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy not expected to attend in person but participating in virtual talks beforehand.</p>
