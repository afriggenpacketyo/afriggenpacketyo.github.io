          <p>An explosion at a law enforcement training facility in Monterey Park, California, has killed three deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The deceased were all members of the arson explosives detail, and the incident marks the department's largest single loss of life since 1857. While the cause is under investigation, sources suggest an explosive device, believed to be inert after being recovered from a callout, unexpectedly detonated. Sheriff Robert Luna described the deputies as "fantastic experts" and expressed profound grief over the tragic and devastating loss for the department and their families.</p>

          <h2>Trump Supporters Rally Behind President Over Epstein Files Following WSJ Report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After days of criticizing the Trump administration for not releasing more Jeffrey Epstein files, prominent MAGA figures have shifted to defending the president. This change in sentiment was prompted by a Wall Street Journal article about an alleged letter from Trump to Epstein, which Trump denies and is now suing over. Supporters who were previously critical are now unified against the media, viewing the president's subsequent call to release grand jury testimony as a significant victory. The article explores how this development has, for now, redirected supporter anger and reunited the base around a common adversary.</p>

          <h2>Biography Alleges Gwyneth Paltrow Felt Brad Pitt Lacked Sophistication During Their Relationship</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author Amy Odell claims that Gwyneth Paltrow had doubts about her relationship with Brad Pitt in the 1990s, believing she was "smarter, better educated, more sophisticated" than him. The book, "Gwyneth: The Biography," details how Paltrow allegedly felt Pitt's Missouri upbringing was a world away from her Manhattan background. The couple met in 1993 and were engaged before their split in 1997. The book excerpts highlight Paltrow's alleged early concerns that Pitt was not the right partner for her, despite his popularity with her family and friends.</p>

          <p>Following significant public and political pressure, President Trump has requested the Department of Justice to seek the release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein. The DOJ subsequently filed a motion to unseal the transcripts, citing public interest, while allowing for redactions to protect victim identities. This move comes as Trump also filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal over a report about a letter he allegedly sent to Epstein. The article notes that calls for transparency have come from both parties, framing the issue as a matter of government trust.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that Kyiv has formally proposed a new round of peace talks with Moscow, suggesting they be held next week to increase momentum toward a ceasefire. The proposal comes as Ukraine faced a significant overnight attack involving approximately 300 drones and 30 missiles, which caused at least one death and damaged infrastructure. In other developments, Ukraine evacuated 43 of its citizens from a Georgian holding site after they were deported by Russia, and Australia confirmed it is delivering 49 Abrams tanks as part of a military aid package.</p>

Workers had reportedly felt vibrations and were told to cover up cracks, and a safety officer had resigned in protest before the collapse.

          <p>Russia launched another major overnight air assault on Ukraine, striking ten different regions with over 340 drones and 35 missiles, resulting in at least three fatalities. In the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, two people were killed, while a woman died from her injuries after a residential building was hit in the southern port city of Odesa. President Zelenskyy stated that the attacks damaged critical infrastructure, including in the city of Sumy, and he reiterated the urgent need for enhanced air defense systems. Meanwhile, Russia claimed to have shot down over 70 Ukrainian drones targeting its own territory.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department, under Secretary Marco Rubio, has revoked the U.S. visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court judges and their families. This action is part of an escalating campaign to support former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for an alleged coup attempt. The move followed a police raid on Bolsonaro's home where he was fitted with an electronic tag. While President Trump's allies praised the decision, it has sparked outrage in Brazil, with President Lula calling it "arbitrary" and an affront to the nation's sovereignty, potentially backfiring by boosting Lula's nationalist support.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted weekly gains, buoyed by a combination of strong corporate earnings reports and encouraging inflation data. The June Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core inflation slightly cooler than expected, though high shelter costs remain a concern for the Federal Reserve. Producer price data also came in below expectations, suggesting wholesale inflation is manageable. While the market continues to anticipate interest rate cuts later this year, the impact of potential new tariffs on the European Union introduced some caution at the end of the week.

          <p>A federal filing shows that Elon Musk's brain-computer interface company, Neuralink, was registered as a "small disadvantaged business" (SDB) with the Small Business Administration. This designation is meant for companies controlled by "socially and economically disadvantaged" individuals and can provide preferential access to federal contracts. The filing was made in April, shortly before a funding round valued the company at $9 billion. A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box was checked erroneously and has since been corrected, and that the company never received any federal benefits from the designation.</p>

          <p>The article explores the potential legal, market, and economic chaos that would ensue if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Legal experts believe Trump lacks the authority to do so without "cause," a high legal bar that would likely trigger a protracted court battle reaching the Supreme Court. Such a move would create unprecedented uncertainty, potentially undermining the Fed's independence and credibility. Economists warn that political interference could lead to poor monetary policy, higher inflation, and increased market volatility, ultimately harming the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway claims that the worst career advice is to "follow your passion," arguing that such guidance typically comes from those who are already wealthy. Instead of pursuing a passion blindly, Galloway advises finding an intersection between what you are good at and what is lucrative. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on skills and opportunities, not just desire. This sentiment is echoed by other successful leaders who suggest focusing on one's strengths and what the market values to build a successful career.</p>

          <p>The article explores the comeback of tanning, arguing it has evolved from a simple beauty trend into an ideological statement, particularly within right-wing and alternative-health circles. It notes the pro-sun attitudes of figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his nominee for surgeon general, who frame sun exposure as natural while casting suspicion on sunscreen and public health warnings. This "new sun worship" aligns with a broader skepticism of mainstream science. The trend is also visible in pop culture, where deep tans are popular again despite well-known skin cancer risks.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced it is eliminating its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm, and will cut nearly 23% of its total workforce. The administration claims the move will save nearly $750 million and allow science to be better integrated into program offices. However, critics, including Democratic lawmakers and the EPA employees' union, have called the decision a "travesty" that will "devastate public health." The move is seen as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to downsize the federal workforce and sideline scientific research in environmental policymaking.</p>

          <p>After an amber weather warning for intense rain did not materialize as feared on Saturday morning, much of the UK remains under yellow alerts for rain and thunderstorms. The Met Office warns that these conditions could still lead to flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruption across all four nations. The threat is heightened because the ground, parched from a recent heatwave, is less able to absorb heavy rainfall. Further yellow alerts are in place for Sunday and have been extended into Monday for large parts of England and Scotland.</p>
