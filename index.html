          <p>Apple is set to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts keen to understand how the company plans to navigate the Trump administration's tariffs, particularly those impacting products made in China, which accounts for a large portion of Apple's revenue. Investors are also interested in Apple's sales performance in China amid rising economic rivalry. TD Cowen analysts estimate the tariffs could cost Apple 6% of its earnings per year, while others anticipate a potential revenue boost in the March quarter due to customers stocking up to avoid tariffs. The article says that Apple has not given formal guidance since 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy also announced an initiative to accelerate the development of new inoculations for COVID, bird flu, and seasonal flu using methods other than mRNA technology.

          <p>Following the ousting of National Security Advisor Mike Waltz after a Signal chat leak, speculation has begun regarding his potential replacement. Candidates include Steve Witkoff, Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East, who has been involved in negotiations with Russia and Iran; Richard Grenell, former ambassador to Germany; and Representative Elise Stefanik. The article explains that Witkoff's focus has been on securing a peace deal in Ukraine and negotiating with Iran, while Grenell previously served as ambassador to Germany and acting Director of National Intelligence. Stefanik, a staunch Trump ally, withdrew her name from consideration for U.N. ambassador to remain in Congress.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that semaglutide medications, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, could have benefits for patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a fatty liver condition linked to obesity and diabetes. The research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed that semaglutide treatment led to significant improvements in liver health among approximately 800 patients over 72 weeks. Dr. Celine Gounder notes that nearly two-thirds of participants experienced a reduction in liver inflammation, and over a third had reduced liver scarring. The article explains that this development is significant because there is currently no FDA-approved treatment for MASH.</p>

However, the agreement lacks a security guarantee, which Ukraine had sought to prevent future Russian aggression.

Roosevelt was elected to four. The Twenty-Second Amendment, ratified in 1951, formalized the two-term limit, but Trump's allies have suggested ways to circumvent it, such as running for vice president.

          <p>Federal forest officials began clearing thousands of acres of forest outside Bend, Oregon, where over 100 homeless people live in RVs and cars, a move an advocacy group calls "the largest eviction of a homeless camp in recent history." Residents faced a $5,000 fine and potential jail time if they remained after the deadline, prompting frantic efforts to repair broken-down vehicles. The sweep follows a Supreme Court ruling upholding a ban on homeless residents sleeping outdoors in Grants Pass. The article says that shelters are already at capacity, leaving many with nowhere to go.</p>

          <p>Publishers Clearing House (PCH) will issue over $18 million in refunds to nearly 282,000 consumers who were allegedly misled by the company's deceptive practices, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC alleged that PCH used "dark patterns" to trick customers into believing they needed to make a purchase to enter sweepstakes or increase their odds of winning. The article explains that the FTC also cited deceptive email subject lines suggesting official government documents. Only PCH customers who clicked on misleading emails and ordered a product are eligible for a refund.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump’s first 100 days have done more damage to American democracy than anything else since Reconstruction. The editorial asserts that Trump is attempting to create a presidency unconstrained by Congress or the courts, in which he and his appointees can override written law when they want to. The article identifies five pillars of American democracy under attack: separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people. The board calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's actions while acknowledging his legitimacy and the legality of some of his policies.</p>

While Microsoft has not explicitly attributed the increase to tariffs, industry experts suggest they are a contributing factor.

What marketing genius, for instance, could have predicted that “Maybe Happy Ending,” a jazz-infused rom-com about robots and mortality that originated in South Korea, and “Dead Outlaw,” a quirky jam-session of a show about a butterfingers bandit who was outshone by his more famous corpse, would be the most acclaimed musicals of this season?</p>
