          <p>The Department of Justice argued that a federal judge lacked the authority to order the return of two deportation flights to El Salvador.  The DOJ contends the oral directive was unenforceable and that the flights were outside US airspace when the written order was issued.  This legal dispute centers on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations.</p>
