PBS President Paula Kerger warned that defunding would disproportionately affect rural communities reliant on public broadcasting for essential services, including children's programming and emergency alerts.

          <p>Analysts suggest China faces significant hurdles in transitioning from a passive observer to a reliable mediator in the Middle East, especially concerning Syria. Despite Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani expressing interest in a long-term strategic partnership with China, Beijing confronts a "reputational crisis" due to its prior support for Bashar al-Assad. China's challenge lies in navigating a new Syrian government potentially influenced by groups identified as "terrorists" by the UN, complicating its diplomatic efforts.</p>
