Companies like Fiserv and Mastercard are integrating stablecoin technology, while firms such as SpaceX and ScaleAI already use them for global payments. Experts predict the stablecoin market, currently valued at $400 billion, could expand into a multi-trillion dollar industry as regulatory clarity improves and traditional banks enter the space.

          <p>Following recent military actions, an Israeli defense minister stated that while not all of Iran's enriched uranium was destroyed, Israel had attempted to assassinate Ayatollah Khamenei. In response, Iranian officials announced a re-evaluation of cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), citing the agency's failure to condemn the attacks on its nuclear facilities. Iran's foreign minister also denied that any new negotiations with the U.S. have been scheduled, asserting that future talks will be more difficult.

The incident highlights a broader issue under the Trump administration, where hundreds of U.S. citizens have been erroneously detained or deported by ICE.

          <p>Daniel Park, a 32-year-old man charged with providing material support to a terrorist, has died after jumping from a balcony at a federal detention center in Los Angeles. Park was accused of helping Guy Edward Bartkus obtain explosive materials used in the fatal bombing of a Palm Springs fertility clinic in May. Bartkus, who died in the blast, held "antinatalist" beliefs, an ideology authorities say Park shared. Park was arrested earlier this month upon being deported from Europe and was awaiting trial for his alleged role in the attack.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially launched his re-election campaign as an independent candidate, positioning himself as a pragmatic alternative to Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist who won the Democratic primary. Adams, who bypassed the primary amid a corruption scandal, is now courting Wall Street and business leaders who are wary of Mamdani's progressive policies. He framed the race as a choice between his "blue collar" focus on results and Mamdani's "silver spoon" ideology. The campaign is set to be a complex political battle, with former governor Andrew Cuomo's potential candidacy adding another layer of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>In a significant move toward deregulation, the Federal Reserve has proposed changes that would lower capital requirements for the largest U.S. banks. The proposal, championed by a Trump-appointed official, would adjust the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, allowing firms like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo to lend more freely. This is seen as the first step in a broader rollback of regulations implemented after the 2008 financial crisis. While proponents argue it will boost the economy, some Fed governors dissented, warning that reduced capital requirements could increase systemic risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After rising steadily since April, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may see a decline this summer, according to a recent analysis. The article identifies three key dates when rates could fall: the release of the June inflation report on July 15, and the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. A cooling inflation report or a formal rate cut by the Fed could lead lenders to lower their variable HELOC rates. While a July rate cut is uncertain, experts see a high probability of a reduction at the September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher fixed rates for 3- and 6-month terms, a high-yield savings account could potentially earn more over a 9-month period, assuming its variable rate remains steady. The choice depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate movements and their need for liquidity. Locking in a CD rate may be preferable if rates are expected to fall.
