          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new rules restricting press access within the Pentagon, requiring journalists to have official escorts to enter most areas of the building. This decision follows several leaks from the Department of Defense that have caused embarrassment to the administration. The Pentagon Press Association has criticized the move, calling it an attack on press freedom and the public's right to know about military operations. The new rules also involve issuing new credentials to members of the Pentagon press corps to prominently identify them as press representatives. This article emphasizes the tension between transparency and national security concerns within the Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>More and more young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' choosing to do the bare minimum at their jobs to prioritize personal time and work-life balance. This trend marks a shift from previous generations who prioritized hard work and company loyalty. A study found that nearly half of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to 'quiet quit.' This article explores the reasons behind this shift, including a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations.</p>
