          <p>The US Air Force is developing the F-47 sixth-generation fighter jet alongside collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) drones as part of the next-generation air dominance (NGAD) program, with full-scale models showcased at the Paris Air Show. Anduril Industries' YFQ-44 Fury drone is likely to be deployed in Indo-Pacific flashpoints, including the Taiwan Strait, according to a company official. Another full-scale model, General Atomics' YFQ-42A drone, is also part of the NGAD's Increment 1 package, indicating a significant investment in unmanned platforms for future air dominance. The program reflects a strategic focus on collaborative air combat capabilities in contested regions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the evolving capabilities of AI and its potential impact on the job market, arguing that AI's ability to reason is becoming less relevant as it increasingly automates tasks previously done by humans. The author anticipates job automation in the near future, including their own position, and notes that entry-level hiring in some professions is already contracting. While some optimists believe AI will create new jobs, the author highlights the risk of widespread skill obsolescence and the need for rapid adaptation. The piece critiques academic criticisms of AI that focus on its limitations in abstract reasoning, arguing that these criticisms are becoming irrelevant to the practical reality of AI's impact on employment.</p>

          <p>According to a national security expert, a U.S. attack on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility may not be effective, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs, because the exact depth and reinforcements of the facility are not fully known. Joe Cirincione suggests that while an attack could cripple Iran's nuclear weapons capability, it would not eliminate it, as Iran possesses the knowledge, experience, enriched uranium, and centrifuges to rebuild. The International Atomic Energy Agency has stated that Iran has breached its non-proliferation agreements, while Israel has attacked Iranian targets following claims that Iran could create a nuclear weapon quickly. Cirincione emphasizes that military strikes are not a solution and that diplomatic engagement is necessary.</p>

          <p>States are increasingly offering tax incentives to attract data centers, leading to a loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 37 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. Watchdog groups argue that these incentives are questionable because data centers don't create many jobs, and they require immense amounts of electricity. While some states claim the exemptions drive economic growth, others acknowledge that the lost revenue does not pay for itself.</p>

          <p>The article explores the experiences of Ukrainian prisoners of war returning from Russian captivity, highlighting the systematic torture and degrading treatment they endured. Some, like Vlad Zadorin, harbor deep resentment and seek accountability for war crimes, while others, like Yuriy Hulchuk, focus on moving forward and rebuilding their lives. Both men received compensation from the Ukrainian state, but they differ in their attitudes towards military service and their approach to healing from trauma. Zadorin now fights Russian disinformation, while Hulchuk plans to study in Germany, showcasing the diverse paths to recovery for those returning from captivity.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump can maintain control over the California National Guard in Los Angeles, blocking Governor Newsom's efforts to regain control. The decision pertains to enforcing federal immigration laws. Meanwhile, Trump will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. will strike Iran, amid concerns from supporters about betraying "America First" principles. European diplomats are meeting with Iran's foreign minister in Geneva to seek a diplomatic solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested that Israel will continue attacking Iran's nuclear sites even without U.S. involvement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are expressing concern that pandemic preparedness in the U.S. is "dramatically eroding" under the Trump administration, citing controversial dismissals of advisors, lackluster responses to outbreaks, and reduced public health resources. Issues include a lack of reliable information from officials, weakened virus monitoring systems, and public health cuts. The H5N1 outbreak is cited as an example of incomplete information and insufficient testing, with concerns raised about the accuracy of communications on measles. Reductions in the public health workforce and international monitoring programs further exacerbate the situation, with experts warning of preventable suffering and increased mortality.</p>

Hampton's time under Emma Hayes at Chelsea helped her mature, and her perseverance led to a recall to the national team and a spot in the Euros.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article challenges the notion that Gen Z is becoming a conservative generation, arguing that the youth vote shift in the 2024 election was likely a one-off event. While young adults voted for Trump at a higher rate than in 2020, they have not become more likely to identify as conservative or hold broadly conservative political opinions. Instead, Gen Z is more liberal than previous generations on most issues, with the exception of border security. The author suggests that Gen Z's dissatisfaction with the economy and a generalized pessimism may drive their voting patterns, rather than a fundamental ideological shift.</p>

          <p>MarÃ­a Corina Machado, a Venezuelan opposition leader, is seeking to attract international investment by highlighting the potential economic benefits of a democratic transition in Venezuela. At a presentation in Manhattan, Machado's team emphasized the "trillion-dollar opportunity" and the potential for high growth in sectors like tourism, real estate, and fossil fuels. While not directly addressing the challenge of ousting NicolÃ¡s Maduro's dictatorship, the message is aimed at persuading the Trump administration that supporting the opposition is not only a moral imperative but also a financially sound strategy.

          <p>The article discusses the challenges facing progressive politics and the expansion of the welfare state in the United States, noting that Democrats are not well-positioned to win full control of the federal government soon. It argues that while Democrats have developed grander ambitions for social spending, they have grown more averse to raising taxes on anyone but the super-rich, which is unsustainable. The author suggests that liberals may need to scale back their ambitions and advance progressive goals through regulatory policy. In the long term, Democrats must build the electoral power and political will necessary for raising taxes on the middle class to fund a comprehensive welfare state.</p>

The film traces the history of care in the U.S., from early 20th-century almshouses to the creation of Social Security and Medicare, noting that domestic workers were excluded from early benefits. The documentary also examines the intentional decision to exclude long-term care from Medicare and the unintended consequences of Medicaid's support for nursing homes.
