          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to claim his fourth Tour de France championship after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his overall lead. While Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever stage win with a bold solo attack, Pogačar finished securely within the main peloton. The final stage is traditionally a non-competitive, processional ride into Paris, meaning his victory is virtually assured barring any last-minute accidents, solidifying another dominant performance.</p>

          <p>Former NBC Cable President Tom Rogers, previously a self-described "raging bull" on Netflix, has revised his optimistic stance, expressing concerns over the streaming giant's long-term growth. He highlights increasing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube and a decline in per-viewer engagement time as significant headwinds. While acknowledging Netflix's strong earnings, Rogers suggests that these engagement trends and the rise of AI-powered amateur content could challenge its dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Harvard Expert Suggests 30-Second Mental Prep to Enhance Conversational Influence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve your influence and effectiveness. This brief moment of forethought allows you to consider topics, questions, and goals before your cognitive load increases during the actual interaction. By brainstorming beforehand, you can appear more prepared and considerate, stay more present while listening, and ultimately make the conversation more successful.</p>

          <p>A new Bankrate study ranking the best and worst states for retirement highlights the importance of weighing personal priorities against objective metrics like affordability, healthcare, and safety. The report identifies Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma as among the worst states, often due to poor scores in weather and healthcare access. However, the analysis stresses that personal preference, such as proximity to family, is crucial and that retirees should consider their needs in different phases of retirement, not just a single destination.</p>

The comment highlights a challenge many Americans face, where health coverage is tied to employment. Williams, who has been managing an autoimmune condition and other health issues, lost her WTA-provided insurance after her break from the sport, illustrating how even elite athletes can be affected by the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system.</p>

The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification, has overseen a crackdown on media and civil society, leading to job losses and human rights abuses. With the military leader sworn in for a five-year term and the nation's withdrawal from the ECOWAS bloc, prospects for a near-term return to civilian democratic rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>
