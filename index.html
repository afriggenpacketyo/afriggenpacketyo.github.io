          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a critical test vote on a massive tax and spending package championed by President Trump. The bill faces an uncertain future due to lingering disputes within the Republican party over provisions such as Medicaid cuts and the national debt ceiling. Despite pressure from the White House to pass the legislation by July 4th, several GOP senators remain publicly opposed or undecided, making the outcome of the procedural vote unpredictable. The legislation includes extensions of tax cuts alongside significant reductions in funding for social programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of the "big, beautiful bill" contains a complex mix of tax and spending measures with wide-ranging impacts. Key elements include extensions of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which primarily benefit upper-income families, and a controversial increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. The bill also scraps a contentious "revenge tax" on foreign investment, a move welcomed by Wall Street, but retains deep cuts to Medicaid, including new work requirements. Targeted provisions, such as a deduction for whale-hunting expenses, highlight the intense negotiations involved in crafting the legislation.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach on Long Island, New York. She suffered non-life-threatening lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. Experts believe the bite was from a juvenile sand tiger shark based on analysis of the injuries. Following the incident, authorities temporarily suspended swimming and conducted drone searches, though no sharks were spotted.

          <p>Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd has announced an unconventional plan for number one draft pick Cooper Flagg during the upcoming NBA Summer League. Despite being a natural forward, Flagg will be given opportunities to play as a point guard to challenge him and expand his skillset. Kidd, supported by team part-owner Mark Cuban, wants to see how the 18-year-old phenom reacts to being made "uncomfortable" by running the team's offense. The coach drew parallels to his experience developing Giannis Antetokounmpo, emphasizing that allowing young players to fail is part of the growth process.</p>

          <p>Meta is reportedly engaged in an aggressive campaign to poach top artificial intelligence talent from rivals like Google and OpenAI, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally leading the recruitment efforts. The company is offering lucrative compensation packages, some allegedly worth up to $100 million, to attract leading researchers and recent PhD graduates. This hands-on approach has created a buzz in Silicon Valley and drawn criticism from competitors, who view the compensation as excessive. The strategy is part of Meta's broader ambition to build a "superintelligence team" and establish dominance in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi confirmed that U.S. strikes caused "very serious" damage to Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. He expressed significant concern over the current lack of knowledge regarding the location and status of Iran's highly enriched uranium, as IAEA inspectors have been unable to return. Grossi emphasized that while Iran's program has suffered a major setback, the knowledge remains, and a lasting solution can only be achieved through diplomacy and renewed inspections. He is urging for a reconnection with Iranian officials to re-establish verification activities as soon as possible.</p>

Amid the ongoing violence, U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed hope for a ceasefire agreement, but a senior Hamas official stated that negotiations with Israel remain stalled.

          <p>The Trump administration's description of the recent U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites has evolved significantly over the past week, creating confusion about the mission's success. Initial claims by the President and defense officials that the facilities were "obliterated" were later contrasted by preliminary intelligence assessments suggesting a more limited setback of only a few months for Iran's program. As the week progressed, the administration's messaging appeared to shift, with officials downplaying the physical destruction and instead emphasizing that the strike successfully prompted a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.

These actions are part of a broader trend where ICE has ramped up enforcement, with a significant increase in the detention of individuals who have no criminal record.

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya, which left 19 people dead and hundreds injured, have intensified concerns about press freedom and freedom of expression in the country. Security forces were reported to have used live ammunition on demonstrators, and the government's communications authority attempted to ban live media coverage of the events, an order that was quickly revoked by judges. Journalists and activists report being targeted by authorities, with watchdog groups noting a pattern of the state cracking down on dissent.

          <p>Following the primary victory of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, Republican leaders are launching a strategy to portray the entire Democratic party as radical and out of touch. Top GOP figures, including President Trump, have labeled Mamdani a "communist" and are using his win to energize their base ahead of elections. In response, some Democrats have defended Mamdani and condemned what they describe as Islamophobic and racist attacks against him. The development highlights a new line of political attack as both parties navigate the influence of their progressive and moderate wings.</p>

England's chase faltered early, with the team collapsing to 113 all out, struggling particularly against India's spin bowlers.

He continued to build his position even as the stock's value fell, and he now uses options strategies like selling covered calls to generate income from his shares.

Now serving as Red Bull's head of global soccer, Klopp argues that the tournament adds to an already congested fixture calendar, leaving elite players with no real recovery time. His comments align with those of the global players' union, Fifpro, which has also raised alarms about the lack of sufficient off-season breaks for players.

Budapest's mayor supported the march by declaring it a municipal event, and it drew support from numerous European officials who attended in solidarity.

          <p>A civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the movie "Rust" against the film's producers, including Alec Baldwin, has been settled. The lawsuit alleged negligence and sought compensation for the emotional distress caused by the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. The terms of the settlement have not been disclosed. This civil case is separate from the criminal proceedings, which resulted in a conviction for involuntary manslaughter for the film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was paroled in May 2025.</p>
