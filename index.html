          <p>A ship has caught fire in the Gulf of Aden after being hit by an unknown projectile, according to the British military. The incident occurred off the coast of Yemen, a region where Houthi rebels have frequently targeted maritime traffic, although no group immediately claimed responsibility for this attack. Maritime security firm Ambrey reported that the vessel is a Cameroon-flagged tanker and that its crew was preparing to abandon ship amidst a search-and-rescue effort. This attack is the latest in a series that has disrupted global shipping through the vital Red Sea corridor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access for as long as possible to foster better mental health and future success. She recommends starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Twenge suggests two primary actions: first, proactively teach children about online privacy and the value of their time away from screens. Second, establish and enforce firm rules, such as using parental controls, banning phones from bedrooms overnight, and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone to build healthy habits.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) sponsored an awards ceremony where former University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas was honored, prompting the club to reaffirm its support for the LGBTQ+ community. At the Violet Visionary Awards, Thomas, a transgender woman, received the "Voice of Inspiration" award, a decision that has been central to the national debate on transgender athletes in sports. A spokesperson for an LAFC fan group spoke at the event, emphasizing that queer individuals have always been a part of the sports world as athletes and fans. The sponsorship and award have drawn both praise for inclusivity and criticism from figures like Riley Gaines.</p>

          <p>Michael Berkowitz, a former commodities trader, successfully launched the luxury coat brand Norwegian Wool from his Bronx apartment with an initial investment of $50,000 of his own money. He identified a market gap for stylish, high-performance wool coats suitable for cold winters, a niche that traditional Italian fashion houses and functional arctic-wear brands overlooked. After testing his first prototype in a supermarket's walk-in freezer, Berkowitz built a profitable company that now sells its products in over 100 stores, including Saks Fifth Avenue. The brand has gained a following among financiers, politicians, and celebrities, and was even featured in the HBO show "Succession."</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has mandated that airlines must input either 'M' or 'F' for a traveler's sex, even if their passport displays an 'X' gender marker, which became available in 2022. This policy change has caused concern and confusion among transgender and non-binary travelers, who fear it could lead to travel disruptions, increased scrutiny, and invasive searches at airport security. While the 'X' marker remains legally valid for travel documents, legal experts suggest the rule gives individual agents more leeway to act on personal biases. The CBP stated that a traveler's choice of sex is not a criterion for admission into the U.S.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett detailed his investment philosophy, categorizing assets into three types and explaining why he avoids investments like gold. He described the first category as currency-denominated assets like bonds, which he views as a bet on government stability that typically lose value over time. The second category, which includes gold, consists of non-productive assets that investors buy hoping someone else will pay more later, a speculation he compares to a chain of hope. Buffett stated his preference for the third category: productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate tangible value and returns, making their intrinsic worth independent of daily market fluctuations.

After undergoing extensive treatment including chemotherapy, a double mastectomy, and radiation, Coreno is now cancer-free and advocates for young women to be vigilant about their health.

          <p>A significant number of Gen Z women in the United States are identifying as "leftist" rather than "liberal," signaling a growing disillusionment with the Democratic party's centrism. This political shift is driven by a belief that urgent issues like reproductive rights, economic inequality, and climate change require more radical solutions than the current political establishment offers. This trend has created a notable gender divide within the generation, as Gen Z men's political views are more aligned with the national average. Many of these young women feel their safety and future are directly at stake, viewing politics not as a negotiation but as a necessary act of self-defense.</p>

Critics point to Troutman's past efforts to repeal a California law requiring the disclosure of chemicals in cleaning products as evidence that he will prioritize industry interests over public safety.

In an era of authoritarian threats, the article contends that sincere, idealistic belief in American institutions is not naive but a crucial tool to combat the nihilism that allows such movements to thrive. True resistance combines this belief with concrete, community-based action.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive guide for the millions of Americans acting as caregivers for ill or elderly adults, drawing on advice from nearly 600 people with firsthand experience. It offers practical wisdom on navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system, adjusting to the "new normal" of a caregiving life, and the critical importance of asking for and accepting help to avoid burnout. The guide emphasizes that true self-care for caregivers is not about luxuries but about setting boundaries and protecting one's own mental and physical health. It also addresses the challenge of navigating the changing relationship dynamics with the person receiving care.</p>

          <p>President Trump has responded to the idea of a tunnel connecting the U.S. and Russia under the Bering Strait, calling the concept "interesting." The proposal was floated by Russia's investment envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, who suggested a "Putin-Trump" rail tunnel and mentioned that a feasibility study began six months ago. When asked about the idea during a press conference, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who was with Trump, stated, "I'm not happy with this idea," which drew laughter. Dmitriev has since promoted the project on social media, even suggesting Elon Musk's Boring Company could reduce the construction costs.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Ministry has announced that it no longer considers itself bound by the restrictions of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the landmark nuclear deal officially expired. The agreement had placed caps on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. The deal has been in jeopardy since the U.S. withdrew in 2018, and recent efforts to revive it have stalled. The announcement follows a move by Britain, France, and Germany to trigger the reinstatement of international sanctions, citing Iran's significant violations of the accord, which has led Tehran to state it sees no reason to continue negotiations.</p>

          <p>Native American tribes in California's Owens Valley are intensifying their efforts to reclaim water rights from the city of Los Angeles, which has been pumping groundwater from the region for decades. Tribal leaders argue that the L.A. Department of Water and Power's extensive network of wells has desiccated their ancestral homeland, drying up springs and meadows and harming the local ecosystem. While the DWP maintains it manages the groundwater sustainably, the tribes assert that the pumping has transformed the "land of flowing water" into a parched landscape. The tribes are seeking the return of both land and water rights to restore their sovereign homelands.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent suggestion that he might send federal forces to San Francisco to address crime has been met with widespread derision and condemnation from local residents and political leaders. While acknowledging the city faces challenges with homelessness and urban decay, many San Franciscans view the idea as an unnecessary and alarming overreach of federal power. State and local officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and State Senator Scott Wiener, have labeled the proposal as petty political retaliation and a potential violation of federal law. The White House defended the idea, pointing to crime reductions in other cities where federal assistance was welcomed.</p>

          <p>A proposal to transition most traffic enforcement in Los Angeles from armed police to unarmed civilian workers is facing major bureaucratic delays, frustrating reform advocates. The initiative, first proposed after the 2020 racial justice protests, has seen little progress despite a city council directive last year for various departments to produce feasibility reports within three months. Over a year later, most of those studies remain incomplete, stalling any legislative action. While some city leaders express frustration with the slow pace, they also acknowledge a continued role for armed officers in high-risk situations like high-speed pursuits.</p>

While he will remain a prince, he will no longer use the Duke of York title and will cease his membership in the Order of the Garter.
