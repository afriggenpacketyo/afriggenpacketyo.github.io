          <p>The offshore yuan experienced a rise in value against the US dollar as reports of progress in US-China trade talks circulated, even though specific details remained undisclosed. China's central bank set the fixing rate for the onshore yuan at 7.2066 against the US dollar, reflecting market optimism fueled by expectations of constructive outcomes in the negotiations between the world's two largest economies. Both sides indicated substantial progress, with a joint statement anticipated soon, raising hopes for a reduction in tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains and increased recession risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The 'most favored nation' policy aims to ensure fair treatment for the U.S. and reduce healthcare costs, though it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would stifle innovation. The proposal, similar to one attempted during Trump's first term but blocked by courts, would impact certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B, potentially saving the government trillions, although the exact figure is unclear. The move targets pharmaceutical companies' lobbying efforts and aims to address the disparity between U.S. drug prices and those in other wealthy nations.</p>

Asian stocks saw gains following the meetings in Geneva, where U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted 'substantial progress.' Analysts anticipate that an initial agreement may involve a reduction in tariffs, which currently stand at levels high enough to effectively block trade between the two countries. Economists have warned that the ongoing trade war could significantly increase the possibility of an economic downturn, and the meetings raised hopes that trade barriers could eventually be lowered.</p>

The Ishiba government seeks to secure funds for child-rearing by cutting medical system costs, but faced backlash after proposing to increase the burden on high medical cost patients, leading to a freeze on the plan until after the upper house election.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced its intention to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The decision is also intended to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Trump confirmed Alexander's release in a post on Truth Social, calling it a 'step taken in good faith', with Hamas expressing its desire to reach a final agreement to end the war.</p>

Research has shown that Zepbound results in more weight loss than Wegovy, but Caremark chose to exclude it to lower drug prices for employers.

Sales of protein-enhanced foods are rising, with Mintel reporting an increase in food product launches making protein claims. While high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle, personal trainer Ethan Smith emphasizes whole foods as a superior source of protein, with Dr. Paul Morgan cautioning that many protein-advertised supermarket products are 'gimmicky' and may be ultra-processed.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial of two weight-loss drugs has shown Mounjaro is more effective than rival Wegovy. Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction, after 72 weeks of treatment, exceeded the 14% from Wegovy, according to the trial's findings. Researchers who led the trial said both drugs had a role, but Mounjaro may help those with the most weight to lose. Both drugs trick the brain into making you feel full so you eat less and instead burn fat stored in the body - but subtle differences in how they work to explain the difference in effectiveness.</p>
