          <p>Disney announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension following comments made by the host regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The network stated the suspension was to de-escalate a tense situation, deeming some remarks ill-timed. This decision came after discussions with Kimmel and significant public backlash over free speech concerns. The controversy had sparked nationwide debates and protests, with some affiliates initially refusing to air the show.</p>

          <p>Department of Homeland Security officials criticized Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker for allegedly failing to assist in responding to an anti-ICE protest in a Chicago suburb. DHS labeled the protesters "rioters" who obstructed law enforcement, threw objects, and assaulted officers, leading to 16 arrests. The agency claimed police under Pritzker's jurisdiction refused calls for assistance, a charge the governor's spokesperson denied.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order labeling Antifa a "domestic terrorist organization," directing officials to investigate and thwart its alleged illegal operations. The move's legal impact remains unclear, as Antifa is generally considered a decentralized movement rather than a singular organized group. The White House cited Antifa's "long history of terrorizing our communities" and linked it to recent violence, though no direct evidence connected the group to the Charlie Kirk assassination. Legal experts question the authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Experts are debunking the Trump administration's claims linking Tylenol to autism and promoting leucovorin as a treatment, citing flimsy scientific evidence. This article explains that the association between Tylenol and autism remains unclear, with major studies finding no link, and discouraging its use poses risks for pregnant individuals. The rise in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness and evolving diagnostic criteria, not environmental toxins or vaccines, as suggested by the administration. The scientific community expresses alarm over the administration's premature announcements, emphasizing the complexity of autism's causes.</p>

          <p>President Trump has introduced the "Trump Gold Card," a new pathway to permanent U.S. residency for wealthy foreigners, alongside restrictive H-1B visa changes. For a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," applicants can fast-track to EB-1 or EB-2 visas, historically reserved for individuals of "extraordinary" ability. This initiative, also hinting at a $5 million "Platinum Card," signals a shift towards a pay-to-play immigration model, emphasizing personal riches as a qualification. Critics note its departure from the EB-5 visa's focus on direct economic investment.</p>
