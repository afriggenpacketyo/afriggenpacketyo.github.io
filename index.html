President Trump invoked the D.C. Home Rule Act, temporarily placing the city's police department under federal control. On the first day of the operation, federal and local authorities made 23 arrests for offenses including homicide and weapons violations, signaling a significant federal intervention in local law enforcement.</p>

While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, early models show it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in the Cabo Verde islands, highlighting its potential danger as the Atlantic hurricane season enters its peak months.</p>

It explains that under Title 32, the D.C. Guard operates under presidential authority and has the power to make arrests, though the current mission is focused on support. The move is authorized by the Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control of the city's police force for up to 30 days during an emergency.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the former first lady of South Korea, has been arrested on multiple charges including stock manipulation and accepting bribes. Her detention marks the first time in the nation's history that a former president and his spouse are jailed simultaneously, as her husband, Yoon Suk Yeol, was previously detained over a failed martial law bid. The charges against Kim allege she profited from a price-rigging scheme and accepted luxury items in exchange for business favors.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that while overall cancer survival has doubled in 50 years, progress has been vastly uneven across different types of the disease. Cancers like melanoma now have high survival rates, but those for pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancer have seen little improvement, widening the gap between the best and worst outcomes. Experts are calling for a renewed focus on research and early detection for these deadlier cancers to address the disparity.</p>

          <p>A recent Siena Institute poll indicates Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is leading the New York City mayoral race with 44% support, a 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. The poll shows Mamdani with strong support from younger voters, while incumbent Mayor Eric Adams trails significantly with only 7% support. This political dynamic signals potential challenges for centrist Democrats in the upcoming November election.</p>

          <p>A report by a committee of UK Members of Parliament has recommended a pilot scheme to provide free bus travel for people under 22 in England. The proposal aims to address declining bus usage and rising fares, which are seen as significant barriers to education and employment for young people. Citing the success of a similar program already implemented in Scotland, the report argues that improved access to public transport is crucial for opportunity and economic growth.</p>
