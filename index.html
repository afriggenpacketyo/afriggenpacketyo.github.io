          <p>Cory Bowman, half-brother of Vice President Vance, secured a spot in Cincinnati's mayoral election after finishing second in the primary. Bowman, a co-pastor and coffee shop co-owner, entered the race inspired by Vance's inauguration and aims to focus on money management, public safety, infrastructure, and property taxes. While Vance endorsed Bowman, the candidate stresses his independence and commitment to Cincinnati's unique needs. Bowman faces an uphill battle in a Democratic stronghold, but emphasizes providing voters with a choice and focusing on local issues.</p>

          <p>Data storage firm Seagate plans to develop a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030 to meet the growing demands of data centers fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. The company's current top-of-the-line hard drive is 36 terabytes, and the new drive would triple that capacity. Seagate believes there is strong demand for such a drive and that this technology is key to delivering the storage capacity needed by the industry, as no other technology can currently meet the market's growth needs. Seagate has been positioning itself as an AI player in recent years, capitalizing on the rise of foundational models.</p>

Law enforcement confiscated significant quantities of fentanyl pills, powder, methamphetamine, cocaine, heroin, cash, and firearms. Officials highlighted the sophisticated nature of the drug distribution network and its devastating consequences, as fentanyl remains a leading cause of death for young adults in the United States.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts Ph.D. student, from a detention facility in Louisiana to Vermont. Ozturk was arrested after the Trump administration revoked her student visa, citing her involvement in associations that allegedly undermine U.S. foreign policy. The court's decision allows Ozturk to have better access to legal and medical services while challenging her detention, which her lawyers argue violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. The court emphasized that Ozturk's challenge to her detention can proceed separately from any potential deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans, led by Speaker Mike Johnson, are relying on a spending and tax cut package to revitalize their political standing after President Trump's overreach and economic self-immolation.

The extension provides little new benefit for voters, and economists warn that the tariffs' worst impacts will coincide with the bill's passage.

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India launched missile strikes into Pakistani-administered Kashmir and Pakistani territory, targeting what it claimed were militant infrastructure sites. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed retaliation, leading to heightened security measures and civil defense drills in India. The strikes followed a terrorist attack in Kashmir that killed 26 people, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, which India has blamed on Pakistan-backed militants. The U.S. has issued travel advisories, and international bodies are calling for restraint.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to deport migrants to Libya, despite the State Department's previous condemnation of the country's "life-threatening" prison conditions. Libya's provisional government has denied these reports. Human rights groups have condemned the plans, citing Libya's poor human rights record and harsh treatment of detainees, with reports of trafficking, torture, and sexual violence. This action comes as the administration expands its efforts to deport migrants to third-party countries, raising concerns about the safety and well-being of those being deported.</p>

While the name resonated with right-wing Hindu groups, some feminists have criticized its use, arguing that it reinforces patriarchal views of women as objects to be protected.</p>

This trend highlights a form of female power that is acceptable within conservative communities, but ultimately reinforces traditional gender roles.</p>
