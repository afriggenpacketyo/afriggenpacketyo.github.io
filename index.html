          <p>A 14-year-old girl has been sentenced to 15 years in detention after stabbing two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman in Carmarthenshire last April. The girl, who cannot be named due to her age, was found guilty of attempted murder in a second trial at Swansea Crown Court in February. Fiona Elias, Liz Hopkin, and a pupil were treated in hospital for stab wounds following the attack. The girl will serve at least half of the sentence in custody, marking a significant consequence for the violent incident within the school environment.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine from May 8 to May 11, coinciding with Russia's Victory Day celebrations marking the end of World War Two. The Kremlin stated the ceasefire is based on humanitarian considerations and expects Ukraine to reciprocate. While Russia expresses readiness for peace talks without preconditions, it warns of an "adequate and effective response" if Ukraine violates the truce. This announcement follows a similar, largely unsuccessful truce over Easter, amid ongoing conflict since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p>

          <p>Meta's ambitious AI strategy, spearheaded by Mark Zuckerberg, is under investor scrutiny as President Trump's tariff policies loom. Meta plans to invest heavily in AI infrastructure, potentially spending up to $65 billion this year, however, tariffs could increase costs. Analysts are closely monitoring Meta's LlamaCon event for signs of return on investment in AI, particularly regarding AI agents for customer interaction. Meta must demonstrate the business impact of its AI investments to justify the substantial costs and maintain investor confidence, especially as other tech giants also brace for potential economic slowdowns due to trade policies.</p>

          <p>Civil rights activists are calling for an independent investigation into the fatal shooting of Lorenz A., a 21-year-old Black man, by police in Oldenburg, Germany, sparking nationwide protests and raising concerns about systemic racism within German law enforcement. Authorities initially claimed Lorenz A. threatened officers with pepper spray and a knife, but later stated preliminary evidence suggests he did not threaten officers with a knife at the time of the shooting. The incident echoes cases of police violence in the United States and has led to calls for a national office to investigate police misconduct.</p>

          <p>A new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll indicates that President Donald Trump's job approval rating has reached the lowest point for any president in the past 80 years, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance. The poll highlights public disapproval of many of Trump's policies and widespread economic discontent, including significant fears of a recession. Despite these negative assessments, Trump still edges out the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to address the nation's key challenges. The poll also revealed concerns about Trump's expansion of executive power and potential non-compliance with federal court orders.</p>

          <p>Community colleges and businesses face uncertainty as the Trump administration rolls back support for electric vehicles (EVs), potentially impacting workforce development programs. Apprenticeship programs designed to train workers for new EV battery factories, like the Panasonic facility in Kansas, are now at risk. Trump's policies could reduce demand for EVs, putting these factories and related jobs in jeopardy. While some local leaders remain optimistic, the federal policy shift has created concerns about the long-term viability of these training initiatives.</p>

          <p>Despite controversial statements, many US evangelical leaders continue to support Donald Trump, citing his actions on issues like abortion, immigration, and Israel. They believe Trump has delivered on promises to "bring back Christianity" and prioritize Christian values. Evangelical leaders contrast Trump's actions with those of the Biden administration, particularly regarding issues like Transgender Day of Visibility. While some Christian leaders have criticized Trump's cuts to foreign aid programs, many evangelicals prioritize issues like abortion and control of the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Canada's election has been significantly influenced by President Trump's policies and the resignation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump's threats and tariffs shifted the election focus to defending against US aggression. The Liberal Party, under new leader Mark Carney, gained traction due to his experience in managing economic crises. The Conservative Party's association with Trump-like populism hindered their campaign. The election results will determine Canada's future relationship with the US and its approach to economic and national self-determination.</p>

          <p>Early-career scientists who received the NIH's MOSAIC grant, designed to foster diversity in biomedical research, fear the program's termination will harm their careers. The Trump administration defunded the grant as part of a broader effort to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Scientists worry the loss of funding and association with a diversity-focused grant may negatively impact their job prospects and future funding opportunities.

While the government has introduced laws to tackle child sexual abuse images generated by AI, Dame Rachel believes a total ban on nudifying apps is necessary to protect children.
