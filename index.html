          <h2>Trump Administration Requests Dismissal of Abortion Pill Lawsuit, Echoing Biden's Position</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:35:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal judge to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to restrict access to mifepristone, an abortion pill, aligning with the previous Biden administration's stance. The Justice Department argues the case, brought by conservative attorneys general from Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, lacks the legal standing to be heard in the Texas federal district court where it was filed. The lawsuit aims to reverse regulatory changes made by the FDA since 2016 that expanded access to mifepristone, including telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery. Abortion pills are now used in nearly two-thirds of abortions in the United States, particularly in states with abortion bans, so the outcome of this case is of extreme importance.</p>

          <p>Over 150 former state and federal judges have signed a letter condemning the Trump administration's escalating battles with the judiciary, particularly the arrest of Judge Hannah C. Dugan. Judge Dugan is accused of obstructing immigration agents by directing an undocumented immigrant to exit through a side door while agents waited to arrest him. The letter asserts that the arrest was an attempt to intimidate the judiciary, undermining the rule of law and public trust. The Wisconsin Supreme Court has suspended Judge Dugan while the case proceeds, and her lawyer states she will defend herself vigorously.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose steep tariffs on movies produced outside the United States has caused confusion and concern in Hollywood, though the motivation for this action is to bolster domestic film production. The idea emerged after a meeting with actor Jon Voight, who was recently appointed as a "special ambassador" to Hollywood. Industry representatives worry that tariffs could harm the industry, advocating instead for federal tax credits to incentivize domestic production. While the White House clarifies that no final decisions have been made, the proposal has spurred debate about the best way to support American film jobs.</p>

This criminal conspiracy, which allowed wealthy clients to evade U.S. tax obligations, occurred between 2010 and 2021 and violated a prior agreement from 2014.

This move follows Harvard's lawsuit challenging the government's decision to cut billions in research funding and represents an escalation in the administration's conflict with elite universities.

          <p>A new battle in China’s e-commerce war has erupted in the form of “instant commerce”, a combination of online shopping and extremely fast delivery, as technology giants Alibaba Group Holding JD.com and Meituan open a new phase of competition for consumers’ wallets. Chinese consumers are set to be spoiled by new services offering “instant satisfaction” while shopping on China’s leading e-commerce platforms. The service is an upgrade from the old food delivery model, as it covers a wider range of products, from fast fashion to everyday items.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the FDA's actions expanding access to mifepristone, echoing a request initially made by the Biden administration. Justice Department lawyers argue that the states pursuing the lawsuit should not be able to do so in that court. The lawsuit, filed by Missouri, Idaho, and Kansas, seeks to roll back changes that have made mifepristone more widely available, including allowing telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery. The administration argues that the states lack legal standing and waited too long to challenge the FDA's actions.</p>

          <p>Hollywood executives are scrambling to understand President Trump's call for 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S., a proposal that could dramatically alter the film industry. While some applaud Trump's intention to protect American jobs, others worry that tariffs will increase costs and harm the industry. The details of the plan remain unclear, and the White House has cautioned that no final decisions have been made. Industry leaders are seeking clarity on how the tariffs would be implemented and what types of movies would be affected.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 profit forecast, citing an expected $1.5 billion reduction in profit due to the Trump administration's tariff policies. While less affected than other automakers, Ford noted the potential for supply chain disruptions and retaliatory tariffs. The company also reported a sharp drop in profits for the first three months of the year, attributing it to lower vehicle sales and paused production at some factories. Ford's revenue declined 5 percent, and it narrowed its loss on electric vehicles.</p>
