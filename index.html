          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant drop, falling below $80,000, as financial markets reacted negatively to President Trump's newly imposed global tariffs, which have sparked fears of a global recession. The cryptocurrency market mirrored the broader market's downturn, with Ether and Solana also experiencing substantial losses. The price decline triggered a wave of liquidations as investors betting on Bitcoin's rise were forced to sell assets to cover losses. The overall market sentiment is uncertain, as the tariffs have widened the window of instability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology stocks experienced a volatile trading session as President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to global tariffs, intensifying concerns about the economic impact of a potential trade war. The Magnificent Seven stocks, including Nvidia, Apple, and Meta, saw fluctuations after briefly rallying on speculation of a possible delay in the tariffs, which the White House later denied. The technology sector is still reeling from a recent market selloff that erased over $1.8 trillion in market value from the Magnificent Seven. Investors remain wary about the long-term effects of the tariffs on the tech industry.</p>

          <p>During a European Rugby Champions Cup match in France, a parachutist became entangled on the stadium roof, prompting a rescue operation by firefighters. The parachutist, reportedly a French soldier, got stuck about 50 feet above the crowd, causing a delay in the match. Firefighters used a long ladder to safely rescue the man, who appeared unharmed, and the crowd cheered as he was brought down. The match was delayed for about 40 minutes, but Toulouse ultimately won the game.</p>

          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield climbed back above 4% despite concerns that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an economic slowdown. The increase in Treasury yields occurred even as traders raised their expectations for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates due to expectations of a weaker economy. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to lower Treasury yields to reduce borrowing costs. The tariffs, which have sparked fears of a global trade war, continue to cause market volatility.</p>

          <p>The article explores the difficulty in determining whether falling stock prices represent genuine bargains amidst the uncertainty created by President Trump's new tariffs. Traditional valuation methods, such as price-to-earnings ratios, become unreliable when earnings estimates are questionable due to tariffs and potential economic slowdown. Analysts have not yet fully recalibrated earnings estimates to account for the potential impact of the tariffs, making it challenging to assess whether a stock's price decline is steeper than the expected decline in earnings. The article advises investors to remain patient and avoid buying too soon, awaiting more clarity on retaliation from U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

They plan to file the challenge in the coming weeks, contending that Congress, not the president, has the power to regulate trade and impose taxes. The lawsuit will likely cite the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which does not explicitly mention tariffs. A prominent legal figure close to Trump believes there is a good chance the Supreme Court would find the tariffs unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's tariffs regime is dismantling a key pillar of American global power and isolating the country. While the U.S. once championed free trade, it is now erecting barriers, likely resulting in higher prices for American consumers and businesses. The author contends that this policy opens opportunities for other countries, like China, to position themselves as more responsible global leaders. The tariffs risk undermining American standing and prompting other countries to move forward without the U.S.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's swift and forceful response to President Trump's latest tariff measures demonstrates the country's preparedness and resilience in the face of escalating trade tensions. China's counterpunch was the result of intensive planning for this scenario and its reduced dependence on the American market since the initial trade war in 2018. Despite the current uncertainties, China remains open to negotiations but is also focusing on expanding domestic demand to mitigate the impact of the trade war on external demand.</p>

          <p>The UK government is relaxing electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in response to trade tariffs imposed by the US. While a ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect from 2030, manufacturers will have greater flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines for non-compliance. The government is also investing £2.3 billion in tax breaks for electric vehicle buyers and improvements to charging infrastructure. Smaller British firms like Aston Martin and McLaren will be allowed to keep selling petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline</p>

          <p>Exchanges implement halts in trading when stock prices and futures fall rapidly to allow a moment for cooler heads to prevail and avoid market crashes. Such moves usually take place during times of extreme market volatility. There are three circuit breaker levels based on percentage declines in the S&P 500, with progressively longer halts and ultimately a suspension of trading for the day if a 20% drop is reached. These circuit breakers are designed to prevent panic selling and maintain market stability.</p>
