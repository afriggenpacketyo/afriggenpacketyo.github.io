          <p>Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican, has initiated a discharge petition to compel a House vote on releasing Justice Department files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The move, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, aims to bypass House leadership, which has been accused of stalling on the issue. The petition requires 218 signatures to bring the bill to the floor for a vote, with proponents expressing confidence they have the necessary bipartisan support to force greater transparency on the controversial case and its high-profile connections.</p>

          <p>Lawmakers have returned to Washington with only 14 legislative days to prevent a government shutdown, as federal funding is set to expire at the end of the month. A contentious funding proposal for fiscal year 2026, which includes significant cuts to health and education programs, has already drawn sharp criticism from Democrats. Beyond the shutdown threat, Congress must also address debates over the deployment of the National Guard in D.C., the confirmation of presidential nominees, and the push to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 85 international climate experts has published a detailed critique of a recent Department of Energy report, labeling it as biased, error-filled, and scientifically unsound. The government report, authored by individuals selected by a former fossil fuel executive, controversially concluded that the economic damage from CO2-induced warming is less severe than believed. The expert review argues the DOE report misrepresents scientific literature and cherry-picks data to support a predetermined conclusion, undermining its credibility as a basis for policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Automaker Jaguar Land Rover has experienced a major disruption to its vehicle production and retail operations due to a significant cyberattack. The company proactively shut down its IT systems to mitigate the damage, sending workers home from its main UK plants in Halewood and Solihull. While the company stated there is no evidence that customer data was compromised, the attack has severely impacted its manufacturing capabilities at a key time for new vehicle registrations. The National Crime Agency is now investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy, Julian Guzman, was fatally shot in Houston while playing a "ding dong ditch" prank with his friends. Authorities have arrested and charged 42-year-old Gonzalo Leon Jr. with murder in connection with the incident. According to police, the suspect allegedly waited in his yard, followed the children as they ran away, and then opened fire, striking the boy in the back. The case highlights a tragic and violent outcome from a childhood prank, with investigators stating the circumstances do not support a self-defense claim.</p>

          <p>Argentine police are investigating the daughter and son-in-law of a deceased Nazi financial adviser after a stolen 17th-century painting was spotted in a real estate advertisement. The artwork, believed to be "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, was looted from a Dutch Jewish art dealer during World War II. After the painting was identified in the ad, it was removed from the property, and police searches have so far failed to locate it.

While stating Germany will not intervene directly, Merz confirmed he has discussed the matter with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, expressing hope for a reduction. Keller-Sutter acknowledged that as a non-EU member, Switzerland is ultimately responsible for resolving its own trade disputes. The high tariffs, imposed by the Trump administration, are affecting Swiss exports and creating economic pressure.</p>

          <p>The owner and a lead salesman of a Jacksonville, Florida, luxury car dealership have been arrested in connection with an alleged fraud scheme totaling nearly $1 million. According to investigators, Vladimir Rangelov and Igor Westerman are accused of accepting payments for high-end vehicles, including a McLaren and a Porsche, without ever transferring the titles to the buyers. The victims, some of whom wired hundreds of thousands of dollars, discovered the dealership had closed and filed for bankruptcy when they tried to follow up on their purchases.</p>

Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, described the decision as difficult but stated she will continue to find ways to serve her community after her term ends. Her retirement opens up a Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican, setting the stage for a competitive race as Democrats hope to make inroads and Republicans seek to hold the seat.

For Guehi, the outcome is mixed; while he missed a move to the Premier League champions, he retains a starting role in a World Cup year and can now control his own future as a highly sought-after free agent.</p>

By aligning against a perceived common Western bloc, Beijing and Moscow reinforce the very transatlantic and transpacific partnerships they seek to undermine, leaving the door open for a future U.S. administration to repair and reaffirm them.</p>
