          <p>The Las Vegas Aces secured a narrow 89-86 victory over the Phoenix Mercury in Game 1 of the WNBA finals, fueled by a late fourth-quarter surge and strong bench performance. MVP A’ja Wilson led the Aces, who overcame a significant deficit, while Phoenix's Satou Sabally fouled out at a critical moment. Off-court, the game was overshadowed by player unrest, with union vice-president Napheesa Collier accusing Commissioner Cathy Engelbert of dismissing concerns over pay and officiating. Engelbert acknowledged the need to rebuild trust as the collective bargaining agreement nears expiration, promising a transformative deal and a new committee for player input.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' legal team announced plans to appeal his over four-year prison sentence for prostitution-related charges, arguing that the judge unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted. Lead attorney Teny Geragos and appeal counsel Alexandra Shapiro contend the judge acted as a "13th juror" by focusing on domestic violence, despite Combs being found not guilty of sex trafficking. While acknowledging indefensible evidence like the Ventura assault video, the defense maintains Combs has taken responsibility for domestic violence, but that was not the crime he was convicted of. They argue the lengthy sentence hinders rehabilitation and that Combs has already suffered significant reputational and financial damage.</p>

          <p>Retained firefighters in the UK, on-call emergency responders, are still awaiting full pension entitlements despite decades of service and successful legal battles. Roger Dunton, 78, highlights the significant commitment of these firefighters who were initially denied pensions until recent years. Following a 2015 settlement and a European Court of Justice ruling, they can now claim pensions for their entire careers, dating back to 2000. However, administrative delays and complex calculations by funds like West Yorkshire Pension Fund are hindering payments, leaving many, including retirees like Malcolm Moss and Helen Phillips, frustrated and feeling "out on a limb."</p>

          <p>Authorities in Manchester are investigating the possibility that one of the two victims killed during Thursday's synagogue attack may have died from police gunfire. The perpetrator, a 35-year-old Syrian-born British citizen, drove into pedestrians and attacked with a knife before being shot dead by police. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Steve Watson described it as a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of the emergency response, as the attacker had no firearm. The incident, declared an act of terrorism, saw three others injured and three arrests made. Investigators are exploring potential Islamist ideology as a motive, noting the assailant's prior criminal history, including a recent sexual assault arrest.</p>

While Governor Stein expressed reservations about some aspects, including a last-minute amendment concerning firing squad executions, he emphasized the law's positive impact on public safety by alerting the judiciary to potential risks. The legislation aims to prevent similar tragedies by tightening pretrial release decisions and requiring more mental health evaluations.</p>

          <p>Hamas terrorists engaged in a deadly clash with members of the al-Mujaida clan, one of Gaza's largest families, attempting arrests over alleged cooperation with Israel. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of approximately 11 Hamas terrorists and at least five clan members, with bodies reportedly dragged through the streets. Reports indicate Hamas raided homes with IEDs and RPGs, and later attempted to kill injured clan members at Al-Nasser Hospital. A clan leader suggested IDF assistance in striking Hamas operatives, while the IDF reported killing 20 Hamas terrorists using children as human shields in a humanitarian zone. Six clan members are reportedly held by Hamas, facing potential execution.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom urged USC to reject President Trump's higher education compact, which demands conservative policy shifts in exchange for federal funding, threatening state funding cuts to any university that agrees. Newsom emphasized the importance of academic freedom, calling USC's deliberation a "false choice." The compact outlines requirements on admissions, diversity, free speech, and gender definitions. USC's interim President Beong-Soo Kim stated he would consult various stakeholders before deciding. Newsom's stance escalated the debate, with potential financial implications for universities, as the Trump administration continues to push its agenda in higher education, including ongoing negotiations with UCLA over an antisemitism investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering minting new one-dollar coins for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring President Donald Trump. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach reposted a draft design showing Trump's face and an image of him after a 2014 near-assassination attempt, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." A 2020 act allows for commemorative $1 coins for the semiquincentennial. However, existing provisions, like the 1866 Thayer Amendment, generally prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, and specifically former or current presidents on the $1 coin. Congress could provide an exception, as it did in 1926 for President Calvin Coolidge.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously accepted the deal, and following Hamas's statement, Trump urged Israel to halt bombing for safe hostage retrieval. Netanyahu's office confirmed preparations for the immediate implementation of the first phase, aligning with Trump's vision for a lasting peace. While Hamas's full commitment to laying down arms remains unclear, this marks a significant diplomatic breakthrough in the conflict.</p>

          <p>Victoria Cruises Line (VCL), which advertised an "affordable residential cruise" for a three-year global voyage, has left dozens of would-be passengers, including Australians Dennis and Taryna Wawn, without a ship or refunds. Despite collecting deposits, VCL does not own or lease the advertised vessel, having repeatedly postponed departure dates due to insufficient occupancy. Many customers sold homes and made significant life changes based on the promise. Consumer advocates like Adam Glezer describe it as a "nightmare." VCL denies scamming, citing administrative reasons for withheld refunds and threatening legal action against those who complain publicly, while company records reveal a complex web of shell businesses and unpaid taxes.</p>

          <p>UK electric vehicle (EV) sales reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicle (BEV) registrations growing by almost a third to 72,779. Plug-in hybrid sales also surged, collectively making up over half of all new car registrations. The Society of Motor Manufacturers (SMMT) attributes this growth to carmaker discounts, a wider model choice, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme. While businesses primarily drove BEV purchases, private buyer interest has increased, with zero-emission vehicles now accounting for over one in five new cars in 2025. This positive trend occurs despite broader economic challenges and cyberattacks affecting the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>A white Kansas sheriff’s deputy, Richard Fatherly, has been charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the July death of Charles Adair, a cuffed Black man. Newly released court records show Fatherly pressed his knee into Adair’s back for 86 seconds after Adair, who had a severely injured leg and schizophrenia, was returned to his cell. Adair, arrested for misdemeanor traffic warrants, had thrown himself from his wheelchair and was heard yelling "Help!" The autopsy listed the cause of death as "mechanical asphyxia." Adair's family attorneys, Ben Crump and Harry Daniels, demand public release of body camera video and question why Fatherly remains free.</p>

A spokesperson for PPE Medpro stated that £83 million of this sum was passed to other consortium firms, Loudwater Trade and Finance and Eric Beare Associates, and argues these partners should be pursued for the money. The company is entering administration with only £666,000 in assets, making full repayment unlikely.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing to offer unaccompanied migrant children, aged 14 and older, a one-time $2,500 stipend to voluntarily self-deport, excluding those from Mexico. A memo from the Department of Health and Human Services outlines this significant departure from traditional immigration policy, which usually requires legal consultation and judicial approval. Immigration lawyers and advocates, including the Acacia Center for Justice and Immigrant Defenders Law Center, express alarm, fearing it exploits vulnerable children and pressures them to waive legal rights, potentially exposing them to trafficking risks. Members of Congress also voiced concerns about the administration's broader efforts to remove immigrant children and its impact on family reunification.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs was sentenced to 50 months in prison for prostitution-related offenses, appearing visibly stunned despite his pleas for mercy and claims of being a changed man. The judge, Arun Subramanian, was unmoved by defense arguments citing Combs' devotion to family, childhood trauma, and painkiller addiction, instead emphasizing the long-term abuse inflicted on victims. Combs' conviction stemmed from forcing girlfriends into "freak-offs" involving male prostitutes, though he was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking and racketeering charges. The sentence, less than prosecutors sought but more than the defense requested, will see him serve approximately three more years, marking a significant, albeit controversial, accountability moment.</p>

Dogan, who admitted telling Pelicot his wife "looked dead" but denied realizing she would be unconscious, is appealing both his conviction and sentence. The case, which sparked nationwide conversations on consent and gender violence, will be judged by a public jury, with Pelicot attending to fulfill her responsibility to other victims.</p>

The developer of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, criticized the move as political capitulation and a suppression of protected speech, likening it to Apple's own crowdsourcing features for traffic.

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals widespread apprehension among Americans, who overwhelmingly deem political violence unacceptable yet anticipate its increase in coming years. This sentiment transcends partisan lines, though older Americans are particularly likely to decry such violence. The poll highlights a growing pessimism about political unity, contrasting with a generally positive view of people getting along outside of politics. A majority feel American culture doesn't respect them, and fewer than half are comfortable expressing political views publicly, fearing negative repercussions like insults or employment problems. This reflects a deepening political polarization and a decline in civility, with most believing the tone of politics has worsened.</p>

They called for independent investigations, condemning the actions as reckless and arrogant.
