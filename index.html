          <p>Russia announced it had forced Ukrainian troops out of the Kursk region, claiming the liberation of the village of Gornal, with the help of North Korean soldiers, but Ukraine denied the withdrawal, stating its troops are still holding positions and conducting operations in the region. President Zelenskyy met with President Trump, French President Macron, and British Prime Minister Starmer at the Vatican, where he and Trump discussed a potential ceasefire and lasting peace. Trump then cast doubt on Putin's willingness to negotiate and threatened further sanctions. </p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione pleaded not guilty to federal murder and stalking charges in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The DOJ is seeking the death penalty, marking the first time since President Trump vowed to resume federal executions, with the trial likely to start in 2026. Mangione's lawyer alleges prosecutors eavesdropped on a private phone call between her and Mangione, while prosecutors claim Mangione poses a future danger and took steps to evade law enforcement after the murder. Mangione is accused of ambushing Thompson outside a hotel in December 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David F. Sandberg's "Until Dawn," based on the PlayStation game, is a meta-horror film set in a remote cabin, blending horror tropes with video game elements like time loops and multiple lives.

          <p>Analyst Craig Moffett suggests moving iPhone assembly to India won't solve tariff problems, as components still come from China. Moffett questions how Apple can lower costs since the supply chain remains anchored in China and faces resistance. He cut his Apple price target to $141 from $184, implying a 33% drop, and notes carriers won't cushion tariff blows. Moffett also believes backlash against Apple in China over U.S. tariffs will hurt iPhone sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The phrase can teach children to doubt their feelings, suppress emotions to seek acceptance, and rewire their stress response. Instead of dismissing emotions, parents should offer support and help children identify and regulate their feelings, fostering emotional safety and resilience.</p>
