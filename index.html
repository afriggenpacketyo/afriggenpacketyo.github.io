          <h2>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ends Bond Eligibility for Many Detainees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 13:23:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has significantly altered its immigration detention policy, effectively ending bond hearing eligibility for many noncitizens facing deportation who entered the U.S. illegally. By reinterpreting a 1990s law, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) now mandates detention for this group, whose only release option is now parole granted by ICE itself, not an immigration judge. This change expands a policy previously limited to recent border-crossers and those with certain criminal convictions, potentially leading to the prolonged detention of hundreds of thousands of individuals who have lived in the U.S. for years. The move is part of a broader crackdown on immigration, supported by increased funding for detention facilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC and production company Banijay have confirmed that MasterChef presenter John Torode's contract will not be renewed after an independent investigation upheld an allegation of him using an "extremely offensive racist term." While Torode stated he has no memory of the 2018 or 2019 incident and does not believe it occurred, he acknowledged that any racial language is unacceptable. The decision follows the recent dismissal of his co-host, Gregg Wallace, over separate allegations, placing the popular cooking show's future in question. BBC Director General Tim Davie emphasized the seriousness of the finding, stating the organization will not tolerate racist language of any kind.</p>

          <p>Leicester City has appointed Marti Cifuentes as their new manager on a three-year contract, replacing Ruud van Nistelrooy just before the start of the new season. The 43-year-old Spaniard joins the club after their immediate relegation from the Premier League, with the primary expectation being a swift return to the top flight. Cifuentes is known for his work at Queens Park Rangers, where he successfully guided the team away from relegation threats in the Championship. Leicester's leadership expressed confidence that his modern and progressive football philosophy is an excellent fit for the club's future ambitions.</p>

          <p>Jewish community leaders and activists are voicing significant concern over the potential election of socialist Zohran Mamdani as New York City's mayor, warning it could trigger a "mass exodus" of Jewish residents. These fears are fueled by rising antisemitism and Mamdani's political stances, including his refusal to condemn the phrase "Globalize the intifada" and his sponsorship of a bill that could restrict funding to Israeli organizations. Critics argue this bill, titled "Not on Our Dime!," effectively targets major Jewish organizations connected to Israel. Despite Mamdani's denials of antisemitism, advocates worry his election would exacerbate an already precarious situation for the city's large Jewish population.</p>

          <p>It has been revealed that the UK government secretly relocated 4,500 Afghans to Britain following a major data breach in 2022 where an official mistakenly leaked the personal details of nearly 19,000 applicants. The existence of the leak and the subsequent £400 million resettlement scheme were concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which has now been lifted by a High Court judge. The leaked data contained sensitive information that could have placed individuals at risk from the Taliban. Defence Secretary John Healey has issued a sincere apology for the "serious departmental error," confirming that those affected were only informed of the breach this week.</p>

          <p>The Enmanji Teriyaki Barbecue in Sebastopol, California, recently celebrated its 70th anniversary, an event rooted in community healing and cross-cultural friendship. The annual gathering, hosted by the Enmanji Buddhist Temple, is famous for its secret-recipe teriyaki chicken and draws thousands of visitors. The event's history is deeply connected to the post-WWII era, when local non-Japanese residents protected the temple from vandalism after Japanese Americans were sent to internment camps. This act of solidarity fostered a strong community bond that has endured for decades, turning the barbecue into a powerful symbol of acceptance and shared history.</p>

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later suggested the agreement involves Indonesia dropping its tariffs on American goods. This announcement follows a similar pattern to a recent deal declared with Vietnam, which was also initially vague and reportedly surprised Vietnamese officials.

Despite being in a healthy relationship now and having undergone therapy, he struggles to forgive himself for his cruel behavior during that time.

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index revealed that the annual inflation rate rose to 2.7% in June, a slight increase from the previous month. While falling gasoline prices provided some relief, this was counteracted by higher costs for groceries and housing. Economists suggest that the full inflationary impact of the Trump administration's tariffs has not yet been realized, with expectations that consumer prices will rise further as businesses can no longer absorb the increased import duties. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy categories, registered a 2.9% increase, indicating persistent underlying price pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced it will soon restart exports of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, pending license approvals from the U.S. Commerce Department. The news, which caused AMD's stock to climb 7%, follows a similar announcement from competitor Nvidia and comes after industry leaders urged the Trump administration to loosen export controls. These controls were initially implemented over national security concerns and had forced companies to develop specialized, compliant chips for the Chinese market. An AMD spokesperson praised the administration's progress in trade negotiations and its commitment to maintaining U.S. leadership in AI technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative James Comer, the Kentucky Republican spearheading an investigation into former President Joe Biden's use of an autopen, has reportedly used a digital signature on official correspondence for the same inquiry. An analysis by NBC News found that numerous letters and subpoena notices sent by Comer's committee appeared to bear a digitally inserted signature. The finding complicates the Republican-led investigation, which is based on President Trump's claims that Biden was not in control of his administration and that the autopen was used without his knowledge. A spokesperson for Comer's committee stated that using a digital signature is common practice and that all legally binding subpoenas are signed by hand.</p>

Prominent supporters are now accusing the administration of a cover-up, creating a rare instance where a significant portion of Trump's base is openly defying his directive to drop the issue.
