        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's hinted reprieve from auto tariffs is complicated by an upcoming 25% auto parts tariff, potentially raising vehicle costs even if assembled in the U.S. Relocating production lines is a complex, multi-year process involving significant planning, construction, and infrastructure development. Automotive executives emphasize that localization of new models takes years, not months, and requires substantial investment. Automakers are lobbying against the tariffs, but the fastest way to increase U.S. production is by utilizing existing facilities with established supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

Concerns include hormone-treated beef imports and pedestrian/cyclist safety rules for cars, areas where U.S. officials have long sought concessions.

          <p>The European Union fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros for violating the bloc's digital competition rules. Apple was fined 500 million euros for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. Meta Platforms was fined 200 million euros for forcing Facebook and Instagram users to choose between personalized ads or paying to avoid them. Both companies indicated they would appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Nerys Bethan Lloyd, the owner of a paddleboard firm, has been sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison after four people died during a paddleboarding tour she led. The victims, including Lloyd's co-instructor, died in "extremely hazardous conditions" on the Western Cleddau river in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Lloyd pleaded guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, as she was unqualified to lead the tour and demonstrated an "abysmal" approach to safety.</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Dropping Tariffs on Chinese Imports</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump is considering reducing tariffs on some Chinese imports to between 50 and 65 per cent. Such cuts would substantially reduce the tariffs that Trump set at 145 per cent earlier this month. While no final decisions have been made, several options are under review, including a tiered system that would distinguish between strategic and non-strategic goods. (not investment advice)</p>
