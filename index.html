          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has issued an urgent call for more air-defense systems from Western allies to protect against intensified Russian attacks ahead of winter. The appeal comes as recent overnight strikes involving over 100 drones and numerous bombs killed at least two people and injured others in cities like Zaporizhzhia. In a related development, an Italian court approved the extradition to Germany of a Ukrainian national suspected of involvement in the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage. Meanwhile, Poland's president has called for NATO to strengthen its deterrence following a Russian drone incursion.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that a trade agreement with China is likely to be finalized before a November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs. He noted that recent talks have become increasingly productive and that China now appears to see a deal as possible. The administration aims to reduce the significant trade deficit with China, which was nearly $300 billion in 2024 but is on pace to decline this year. The goal, according to Bessent, is to achieve a more balanced and fair trade relationship between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 16-year-old student responsible for a shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado had reportedly shared neo-Nazi and white supremacist content online prior to the attack. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the shooter's TikTok accounts contained extremist symbolism, and he showed interest in past mass shootings like Columbine. The FBI was reportedly tipped off about his online activities in July, months before he shot two classmates and then took his own life. The incident has renewed concerns about the role of the internet in radicalizing young people toward violence.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that commercial terms have been agreed upon, and Presidents Trump and Xi are expected to speak to finalize the arrangement.

This shift could be seen in the ongoing trade war, where another tariff moratorium is in place, and in stalled efforts to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.

However, President Trump issued a "national interest waiver," preventing the imposition of sanctions and preserving U.S. aid and security cooperation.

          <p>Workers are increasingly "hugging" their jobs, with the rate of voluntary departures falling to its lowest sustained level since 2016. This trend is attributed to a cooling job market, where job growth has weakened and the pace of hiring has slowed, making employees hesitant to leave their current roles. Career experts advise that while staying put can feel safer, workers should avoid complacency and actively seek internal growth opportunities, such as promotions or new skills, a practice known as "pivoting in place."

          <p>Nurses in California are raising alarms about an increased presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in hospitals, stating it creates a fearful environment and interferes with medical care. The trend follows a Trump administration executive order that overturned the "sensitive locations" policy, which had limited immigration enforcement in healthcare facilities. Nurses report that agents can be disruptive, block access to patients, and violate privacy laws, which may deter immigrants from seeking necessary medical treatment. The National Nurses United union says these encounters create an unsafe environment for patients and staff alike.</p>

          <p>Luckin Coffee, the chain that surpassed Starbucks as the largest in China, is now expanding into the U.S. market with several locations opened in New York City. The company operates with a cashier-less model, requiring customers to order through a mobile app where they are frequently offered significant discounts. This strategy focuses on building brand awareness and capturing market share, even if initial stores operate at a loss, which contrasts with Starbucks' focus on store-level profitability. Luckin's expansion comes after it recovered from a major accounting fraud scandal in 2020 that led to its delisting from the Nasdaq.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical overview of Zionism, framing it as a 19th-century nationalist movement similar to others that emerged in Europe from the collapse of old empires. It traces the movement's origins to the first Zionist Congress in 1897, highlighting the diversity of early Zionist thought on issues like religion, statehood, and political strategy. The author notes that, like many nationalist projects, early Zionism often failed to adequately consider the existing Arab population in Palestine, a tendency that has had lasting consequences. The piece argues against using "Zionist" as a simple pejorative, emphasizing the movement's complex and contested history.</p>

          <p>France flanker Axelle Berthoumieu has been suspended for 12 matches after admitting to biting an Irish opponent, Aoife Wafer, during a Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final. The incident, which was not penalized on the field, was reviewed after the match following a citing. While Berthoumieu admitted the act was worthy of a red card, she is appealing the length of the suspension. The French team is also appealing a separate three-game ban for its captain, Manaé Feleu, for a dangerous tackle, potentially leaving them without two key players for the remainder of the tournament.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has publicly endorsed a mass "doxing" campaign aimed at identifying and harassing individuals perceived to be insufficiently mourning the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While guest-hosting Kirk's podcast, Vance encouraged listeners to "call them out" and even contact their employers. This comes as numerous people have already been fired for their comments on Kirk's death, and an anonymous website has been collecting tens of thousands of submissions targeting critics. The administration has vowed to use government resources to dismantle what it calls a "vast domestic terrorist network" it baselessly blames for the killing.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has directed the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to launch a new investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to three separate courts. The case involves a neo-Nazi informant, "Agent X," who was protected by MI5 while he coerced and attacked his girlfriend. MI5 had falsely claimed to courts that it had not confirmed the agent's status to the BBC, a claim later disproven by recordings. Previous internal MI5 inquiries, which blamed the errors on mistakes, were rejected by the courts as having "serious procedural deficiencies," prompting the new, independent investigation.</p>

Her move follows the defection of Danny Kruger, the first sitting Tory MP to switch to Reform, signaling growing pressure on the Conservative party from the right. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch responded by stating her party is focused on the economy, while Reform is distracted by "Westminster bubble issues."</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has announced promising results from a late-stage trial of its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide. The once-weekly injection helped patients achieve an average weight loss of 11.8% over 68 weeks, significantly more than a placebo. The drug, a long-acting amylin analogue, works differently than existing GLP-1 treatments like Wegovy and may offer a more tolerable side-effect profile. These findings are a positive step in the company's search for a next-generation blockbuster weight-loss drug to complement its highly successful but supply-constrained current offerings.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, progressive groups are expressing fear of a new "McCarthy era" as President Trump and his allies call for government investigations into their activities.

A letter from House Freedom Caucus members has already requested a select committee to investigate the "radical left's assault on America."

The concept, she argues, has often been weaponized as a political slogan to advance partisan goals.
