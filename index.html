          <p>New media reports allege that Prince Andrew attempted to use his police protection to gather personal information on his accuser, Virginia Giuffre, in 2011. These claims surface as King Charles III faces calls to strip Andrew of his "prince" title, following Andrew's decision to relinquish his other royal and military honors. The renewed pressure comes as a posthumous memoir by Ms. Giuffre is set to be published, likely bringing further attention to his connection with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew has consistently denied all allegations made against him.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of "murder" and violating his country's sovereignty after an American strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters. Petro stated the vessel was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure when it was hit, and he is demanding an explanation from the U.S. government. The incident is part of a series of recent U.S. strikes in the Caribbean targeting what President Trump has described as "drug-carrying submarines." This particular strike reportedly killed two people, with survivors from Ecuador and Colombia being taken into U.S. custody.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it has "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an "imminent" attack on Palestinian civilians within Gaza, which would be a severe violation of the current ceasefire agreement. Washington has informed other guarantors of the peace deal and warned that measures would be taken to protect Gaza's population if the attack proceeds. Hamas has rejected the U.S. statement as false. This development adds tension to the fragile ceasefire, which has seen the release of living hostages and the ongoing return of the remains of deceased hostages from Hamas to Israel.</p>

Emergency services were dispatched to extinguish the blaze at a workshop within the facility, and no employee injuries were reported from the incident. This attack is part of Ukraine's escalating strategy to strike Russian energy infrastructure, aiming to disrupt fuel supplies and impact Moscow's economic resources for the war. The governor noted that this was not the first attempted drone attack on industrial facilities in the region.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators participated in "No Kings" protests in major cities across the United States, including New York, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles, to voice opposition to President Donald Trump's policies. Protesters expressed concerns over what they see as an expansion of presidential power and a threat to American democracy, holding signs with slogans like "Democracy not Monarchy." Organizers described the events as peaceful, despite some states mobilizing the National Guard in advance. Several prominent Democratic politicians joined the rallies, emphasizing their support for the demonstrations as a fundamental expression of democratic values.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has accused the United States of conducting a sustained campaign of cyberattacks against its National Time Service Center. The center, based in Xian, is critical for providing precise timing services for China's essential infrastructure, including communications, finance, and defense sectors. The ministry characterized the cyberattacks as "long-term, highly covert" operations that utilized "state-level cyberespionage tools." The U.S. embassy in China has not yet responded to the allegations, which represent another point of friction in the technological and security rivalry between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Despite significant summer spending, Liverpool is experiencing a dip in form, with recent analysis suggesting the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid has had a larger impact than anticipated. The article details how the team is missing his unique on-ball quality, particularly his ability to bypass high presses with long passes and his proficiency with his weaker foot. His absence has disrupted Liverpool's build-up play, forcing tactical compromises like using midfielder Florian Wirtz in deeper roles. The team's rate of switching play has also decreased significantly, making it harder to break down organized defensive blocks.</p>

          <p>While numerous global companies like Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce have recently announced job cuts and cited the integration of artificial intelligence, some critics argue AI is being used as a "good excuse." Fabian Stephany, an assistant professor at the Oxford Internet Institute, suggests that firms may be "scapegoating" the technology to justify downsizing that is actually due to other factors, such as overhiring during the pandemic. This narrative allows companies to appear innovative while masking less favorable business realities. Recent labor market data from the U.S. has not yet shown widespread job disruption from AI.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to wane in long-term relationships after the initial passionate phase, a phenomenon driven by hormonal changes. According to psychologist Andrea Seiferth, as relationships mature, the bonding hormone oxytocin becomes more prominent, which can dampen sex drive hormones. Research also highlights a discrepancy between physical and psychological arousal, particularly in heterosexual women, which can be influenced by societal messaging and a lack of prioritization of female pleasure. Experts emphasize that open communication, mutual affection, and prioritizing intimacy are key for couples to navigate these changes and maintain a satisfying sexual connection.</p>

The rapid pace of human-driven climate change is far exceeding the natural ability of trees to adapt through migration.

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen has reasserted his presence in the Formula 1 championship fight after a dominant performance at the United States Grand Prix, winning the sprint race and securing pole position. His success was compounded by a first-corner collision between McLaren teammates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, which took both out of the sprint. The incident and Verstappen's subsequent point gain have significantly tightened the drivers' championship standings. McLaren, who previously seemed comfortable, now faces a "brutal" climax to the season as they try to fend off the resurgent four-time world champion.</p>

          <p>As part of the ongoing ceasefire agreement, Hamas has handed over the remains of two more deceased individuals believed to be hostages held in Gaza, according to the Israeli military. The coffins were transferred to the Red Cross and are being sent to Israel for formal identification at the National Center of Forensic Medicine. This transfer is a key component of the U.S.-brokered deal, which also saw the release of 20 living hostages in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The process of returning all 28 deceased hostages has been slow, creating tension around the agreement's implementation.</p>
