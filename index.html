          <p>China's Foreign Ministry confirmed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to attend a military parade in Beijing. This significant event, commemorating Japan's surrender in World War II, aims to showcase solidarity among China, Russia, and North Korea, while signaling resistance to US-led alliances in Asia. Analysts suggest Kim Jong Un's visit seeks to elevate his global stature and secure powerful allies amidst ongoing international sanctions on Pyongyang. For Putin, the attendance offers an opportunity to mitigate Russia's increasing international isolation following its invasion of Ukraine. The gathering underscores deepening military and economic ties that are reshaping regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a significant 56% surge in revenue, reaching $46.7 billion for the second quarter, primarily driven by robust demand for its sophisticated AI chips from major tech firms like Meta and OpenAI. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the ongoing "AI race" and the company's crucial role in AI infrastructure, projecting further revenue growth. Despite this boom, Nvidia continues to navigate geopolitical challenges, including US-China trade tensions and export restrictions on its high-end chips. The company is actively lobbying the US government to approve sales of its next-generation Blackwell chips to China, a critical market, while China concurrently fosters domestic competition in the chip sector.

          <p>European markets are poised for a higher open as investors assess Nvidia's latest earnings report, which indicated continued strong sales growth in the artificial intelligence sector. While Nvidia's overall revenue surpassed expectations, a slight miss in data center revenue and concerns over future China sales led to a dip in after-hours trading. Beyond tech, French spirits giant Pernod Ricard reported a sales decline due to weak consumer sentiment in China and US tariff uncertainties. Additionally, new data revealed a 7.4% rise in EU car registrations for July, with Chinese EV maker BYD experiencing significant growth while Tesla's European registrations declined.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a proposed rule to cap the length of stay for international students in the US to four years, a significant departure from the previous "duration of status" policy. The Department of Homeland Security stated this measure aims to curb "visa abuse" and enhance oversight of foreign individuals, accusing some of becoming "forever students." Critics, including NAFSA: Association of International Educators, warn that this change could deter international enrollment, potentially harming US colleges financially and impacting American innovation and global competitiveness. The proposal also suggests limiting foreign journalists' initial admission periods.</p>

          <p>A tragic shooting at a Catholic school in Minneapolis resulted in the deaths of two children, aged eight and ten, and injuries to seventeen others, including fourteen children. The attacker, 23-year-old Robin Westman, died at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, with the FBI investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime targeting Catholics. Police found three firearms and a smoke bomb, along with a manifesto published on YouTube. This senseless attack has deeply traumatized the community, prompting calls for action beyond "thoughts and prayers" from local officials.</p>

          <h2>Taylor Swift's Engagement Highlights Phenomenon of Parasocial Relationships</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>News of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked widespread emotional reactions among fans, prompting a discussion on "parasocial relationships"—one-sided connections where individuals feel intimacy with a celebrity who doesn't know them. Psychologists describe this as "my friend who doesn't know me," fueled by the increased availability of personal details through social media and reality shows. While these relationships can offer a sense of connection and community, experts caution that they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. Such bonds, though entertaining, lack the "nutritional content" of genuine human interaction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK, benefiting from an import tax exemption, more than doubled last year to £3 billion, largely driven by e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This surge has prompted the UK government to review the rules that allow goods worth £135 or less to avoid customs duties. UK business owners and industry groups are advocating for swifter action, arguing that the exemption undercuts domestic retailers and potentially exposes consumers to unregulated products. Similar exemptions have already been ended or revised in the US and EU, highlighting a global trend in trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom warned that Donald Trump is "gravely serious" about seeking a third presidential term, in violation of the US Constitution, urging Americans to acknowledge his disregard for democratic norms.

This public disclosure of a private conversation, unusual for a sitting governor, underscores Newsom's combative stance against Trump.

Analysts suggest Reform is on track for a major electoral breakthrough, potentially taking seats on regional lists, which were key for the Tories in previous elections.

          <p>Tensions are escalating between China and the Philippines at the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, with a Philippine resupply deadline looming. Philippine Navy officials reported sighting a Chinese tugboat near the grounded BRP Sierra Madre, while Chinese coastguard ships intercepted Philippine vessels heading towards the shoal. This marks a return to heightened tensions after a period of relative coexistence, as both nations assert claims in the South China Sea. The incident underscores the ongoing geopolitical friction in the region, raising concerns about potential confrontations over territorial sovereignty.</p>

He utilized a wider array of pitches, recording nine strikeouts and generating 14 swings-and-misses, his most all year. His dominant outing demonstrates his ability to work deep into games, a crucial development for his potential postseason role and the team's championship aspirations.</p>

          <p>USC has offered a multi-year extension to Notre Dame to continue their century-old football rivalry, expressing hope for a deal soon. This follows public concern over the potential end of the series, with Notre Dame preferring a long-term commitment. USC's initial reluctance stemmed from uncertainties regarding the College Football Playoff format and the demands of its new Big Ten travel schedule. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, as USC seeks to balance its schedule while preserving this important tradition for its fans and program.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record, with one million hectares burned across the EU so far this year, equivalent to half the land area of Wales. Spain and Portugal are particularly hard-hit, with over 684,000 hectares scorched on the Iberian Peninsula, linked directly to climate change. The fires have released record levels of CO2 and impacted protected areas and major routes. Experts warn that increased heat and drier vegetation, coupled with rural depopulation and abandoned agricultural land, are making future fires more frequent and severe, straining firefighting resources and long-term ecosystem stability.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is moving detainees from a controversial state-run immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz,' following a federal judge's order to dismantle parts of the facility. DHS attributed the relocation to an 'activist judge' and vowed to continue its mass deportation efforts. The facility, part of the Trump administration's push to expand detention capacity, faced allegations of inhumane conditions, including lack of water and limited legal access. The judge's ruling halted new construction and transfers, siding with environmental activists who argued the facility skirted federal laws.</p>
