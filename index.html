          <p>A series of severe storms, including tornadoes, swept across the Heartland and East Coast, resulting in at least 23 deaths across several states and leaving over 600,000 customers without power. Kentucky reported 14 deaths, Missouri seven, and Virginia two, with officials expecting the death toll to rise as rescue operations continue. The storms spawned at least 26 tornadoes in states like Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and Illinois, and even one in New Jersey, accompanied by softball-sized hail in some areas. Fifteen states reported storm damage from hail, winds, and tornadoes, stretching from Missouri to Michigan and out to New Jersey, as the severe weather system continues to track through the East-Central United States from Arkansas to Virginia.</p>

          <p>Aberdeen defender Jack MacKenzie was injured after being struck by an object, believed to be a seat, thrown by his own team's fans during a pitch invasion following Aberdeen's defeat to Dundee United in the Scottish Premiership. MacKenzie, an unused substitute, was on the pitch when Dundee United supporters invaded the playing surface after their team secured a victory, denying Aberdeen fourth place. The Aberdeen manager, Jimmy Thelin, described MacKenzie's injury as quite bad and unacceptable, emphasizing that such incidents should not occur to football players performing their job. An investigation into the incident is underway to determine the exact circumstances and prevent similar occurrences in the future.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Proposed Budget Bill Aims to Provide Tax Relief for Seniors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 10:38:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith argues that President Trump's budget bill, utilizing the budget reconciliation process, will provide significant tax relief for American seniors. The bill includes a $4,000 tax deduction for Americans aged 65 or older with incomes below $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for joint filers, effectively eliminating Social Security taxes for low-income and middle-income seniors. While direct changes to Social Security are prohibited under reconciliation rules, this deduction aims to provide comparable relief on yearly tax returns, ensuring seniors receive much-needed tax relief. The White House has endorsed the plan, highlighting it as a fulfillment of promises to seniors who have faced economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Mediators are urgently trying to salvage stalled cease-fire talks as Israel mobilizes forces for a deeper advance into Gaza, despite weeks of threats by Israeli leaders. The Israeli military has begun mobilizing its forces in preparation to advance farther into Gaza, seize more land and displace more civilians, adding that it was already conducting intense airstrikes ahead of the planned offensive. Despite intense overnight airstrikes that reportedly killed over 140 people, there are no immediate signs of a large-scale ground invasion, with Israeli and Hamas negotiators still engaged in indirect talks in Qatar. Hamas officials report a new round of negotiations in Doha, while Israel links Hamas's return to talks to the announcement of the new Israeli operation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East underscores his transactional and malleable approach to foreign policy, according to panelists on Washington Week With The Atlantic. The trip involved re-altering dynamics by recognizing Syria’s new government, announcing the lifting of sanctions, and moving closer to a deal with Iran that mirrors his previous stance. Peter Baker noted that this approach is not always predictable, marking a shift from even just a week ago, and that Trump's actions reinforce his unique approach to international relations.</p>
