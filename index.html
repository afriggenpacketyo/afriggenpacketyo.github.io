          <p>Mary Earps, the England goalkeeper, has announced her retirement from international football, effective immediately, after 53 senior appearances over eight years. Earps played a key role in England's Euro 2022 victory and their journey to the 2023 Women's World Cup final. However, having recently lost her place to Hannah Hampton, the 32-year-old will not participate in England's Euro 2025 campaign. Her retirement marks the end of an era for the Lionesses, as they prepare for future tournaments without their experienced goalkeeper.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging the U.S. to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to facilitate peace talks aimed at ending the three-year conflict in Ukraine, amid ongoing drone attacks from both sides. Zelenskyy criticized Russia's increasingly frequent and large-scale strikes, asserting they lack military logic and reflect Putin's choice to continue the war. He called for stronger sanctions from the U.S. and Europe to compel Russia to cease fire and respect diplomatic efforts, while framing Putin as the primary obstacle to a peace agreement as Kyiv navigates a challenging relationship with the Trump administration. Russia is preparing a memorandum setting out its negotiating position.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ministers in the UK government are considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that while the policy has pushed people into poverty, reversing it would be expensive. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of its child poverty strategy. Phillipson emphasized that a Labour government would never have introduced the cap and that the "cost of inaction" on child poverty is incredibly high.</p>

          <p>Following an incident in Liverpool where a car rammed into a crowd, injuring dozens, police promptly released details about the driver being a 53-year-old white British man. This swift disclosure aimed to counteract the spread of false rumors that had previously occurred after other violent episodes in Britain. In a prior incident in Southport, false reports about the assailant being an undocumented Muslim migrant led to riots, prompting criticism of restrictions on police communication. The Merseyside Police, responding to both incidents, seemed aware of the need to balance legal responsibilities with preventing public disorder, as unsubstantiated theories circulated online.</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, are speaking out against a proposal by Republican lawmakers to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They argue that dismantling this watchdog, created after the Enron and WorldCom scandals, would increase the risk of corporate disasters by removing a crucial layer of independent oversight. The P.C.A.O.B. was established to ensure high-quality audits and protect investors by independently overseeing public company audits, and its removal would shift responsibilities to the S.E.C., potentially compromising its effectiveness. The authors argue that the P.C.A.O.B.'s independence from the S.E.C. is its greatest strength.</p>

          <p>This article discusses President Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office, describing it as a "gilded rococo hellscape" and analyzing the implications of his design choices. The author, Emily Keegin, argues that Trump's aesthetic is deeply American, reflecting a desire for both royalty and revolution. She connects the Rococo style to periods of economic prosperity and uncertainty, suggesting that it represents a longing for the perceived stability of the past. Keegin concludes that Trump's Rococo style is a performance of wealth, aligning with a broader American fascination with opulence and excess.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how Corporate America's shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives has resulted in the elimination of thousands of jobs. The anti-DEI "political climate" has caused employers to retreat from anything related to "diversity," impacting DEI specialists who were once in high demand. Companies like Verizon have ended DEI policies, and data analysis reveals that over 2,600 DEI-related jobs have been cut since early 2023. This retreat disproportionately affects women and people of color, who held a significant percentage of DEI roles, and has created a challenging job market for those with experience in the field.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Communications Minister Solly Malatsi stated that the proposed draft policy recognizing alternatives to Black ownership requirements is not specifically designed for Elon Musk's Starlink. The minister emphasized that transformation remains a priority and a non-negotiable aspect for the country's aspirations. The draft policy, which recognizes "equity equivalent" investment programs, aims to encourage companies like Starlink to operate in South Africa, while complying with the Electronic Communications Act, which mandates foreign-owned communications companies to sell 30% of their equity to historically-disadvantaged groups.</p>

Pyongyang's foreign ministry slammed the plan as "the height of self-righteousness [and] arrogance", state media reported. The defense system, which President Donald Trump plans to unveil by the end of his term, is aimed at countering "next-generation" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.

          <p>Japan is implementing a revised scheme to release government stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb soaring prices. Twenty companies have applied to purchase a combined 110,000 tons of rice, equivalent to over 30 percent of the planned release. This move aims to address the doubling of average rice prices at supermarkets despite previous government efforts to lower prices. The government is also considering revising eligibility criteria to include smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with supermarket giant Aeon Co. planning to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms.</p>

European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment where Tesla currently has no offerings, and the investors are questioning Musk's dedication to Tesla because of his time advising Trump and his role leading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.</p>
