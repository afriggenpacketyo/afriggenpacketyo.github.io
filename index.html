          <h2>Targeted Cancer Drugs Poised to Potentially Replace Chemotherapy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is making significant strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a class of targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in ADCs, designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. While traditional chemotherapy affects both types of cells, ADCs aim for precision, and some companies believe ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. Challenges remain, such as preventing premature release of the chemotherapy payload and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target, but the industry is working to overcome these issues with next-generation ADCs and combination regimens.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz has announced its commitment to removing FD&C artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027, affecting brands like Crystal Light, Kool-Aid, MiO, Jell-O, and Jet-Puffed. This decision aligns with a broader initiative driven by pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Department of Health and Human Services, led by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to reduce artificial additives in food. The FDA plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes, replacing them with natural alternatives, following a previous ban on Red No. 3 due to its carcinogenic effects observed in laboratory animals. Kraft Heinz has already made over 1,000 recipe changes in the last five years to improve product nutrition, with most products using natural or no colors.</p>

          <p>Despite promising a large deportation program, President Donald Trump's administration has not matched the deportation numbers of President Barack Obama. Obama's strategy involved increasing penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement to target immigrants with criminal records. Trump faces challenges in replicating this strategy due to decreased border apprehensions and increased opposition from liberal jurisdictions. Trump has attempted workplace immigration raids and mobilized federal resources, but these efforts have not reached Obama's deportation pace, and he has expressed reservations about deporting farmworkers and hotel workers.</p>

Two children, aged seven and nine, were also taken to the hospital as a precaution, though they were not believed to have been inside the property at the time of the explosion.

The White House clarified that the agreement was with the UK and that its details were similar to one signed in May. Trump stated he needed to return to the White House to address "very important" issues, and he cautioned Iranians to evacuate Tehran.</p>

          <p>President Trump departed from the G7 summit early to address the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, following a warning on social media for Iranians to evacuate Tehran. In Minnesota, Vance Boelter faces federal and state murder charges for allegedly killing a state lawmaker and her spouse, and wounding another lawmaker and his wife. Police apprehended Boelter in rural Minnesota, recovering six guns from the scene, and officials believe he would have continued his rampage if he had not been forced to flee. Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family have reached a $7.4 billion settlement with all 50 states and U.S. territories over the company's improper marketing of opioids.</p>

          <p>Experts are casting doubt on the Trump Organization's claim that its proposed $499 gold Trump phone can be manufactured entirely from American components. One industry analyst stated that it would be "virtually impossible" to build the handset in the United States. Questions have also been raised about the ethics of this venture, with concerns about potential conflicts of interest and whether the business will attract customers seeking to influence Trump. The Trump family has not specified which company would manufacture the phone in the United States, and technology experts argue that it is unlikely to be feasible to manufacture smartphones from scratch in the US currently.</p>

By partnering with companies like Foxconn, Apple transferred technology and know-how, trained millions of Chinese workers, and invested billions in China's industrial base. This transformation allowed China to jump from low-end manufacturing to producing cutting-edge tech, but it has also created a dependence for Apple on Chinese production and raised concerns about America's national security and technological competitiveness. The shift has been described as a geopolitical event, akin to supercharging the economy of a major adversary.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of its government bond-buying reduction beyond next year, while maintaining its interest rates, citing trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concern about the outlook for Japan's economy, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes, which he said pose downside risks for both growth and prices. The BOJ will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026, down from the current 400 billion yen, with the total amount of purchases declining to about 2 trillion yen monthly in early 2027.

          <p>President Trump has stated that he seeks a "real end" to Iran's nuclear program, requiring Tehran to abandon it entirely, rather than just a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. He clarified that he was not looking for a ceasefire, but for Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions completely. Trump predicted that Israel would continue its barrage on Iran and mentioned he would be monitoring developments in the Middle East from the White House Situation Room. He also addressed potential threats to U.S. interests, warning Iran against targeting U.S. troops.</p>

The restructuring plan, which requires court approval, includes the closure of a distribution center in Darton, South Yorkshire, and its national distribution center in Bilston, West Midlands. The company is also seeking rent reductions from landlords, which could result in an additional 70 store closures in the future. Poundland currently has 792 stores and employs around 16,000 people.</p>

Gardeners argue that the hikes will disproportionately affect low-income residents and undermine the accessibility of the gardens.

          <p>A review of Jonathan Gould's new Talking Heads biography, "Burning Down the House," finds that it lacks the depth and illumination that fans would expect from a biography of such an important band. The book is described as lumpy, full of redundant stories, and unnecessary detours that provide little insight. The author's negative view of many key players in the New York punk scene and lack of participation from the band members contribute to the book's shortcomings, and it ultimately fails to fill the lacuna in Talking Heads biographies.</p>
