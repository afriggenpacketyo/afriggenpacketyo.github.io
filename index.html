          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including U.S. miner Albemarle, surged after Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) suspended production at its Yichun Project mine in China. The mine, which accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025, halted operations after its permit expired. The suspension tightens an already constrained global market, with investors anticipating higher lithium prices due to the reduced supply. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production upon approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., placing the city's police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard. He framed the move as a necessary action to combat what he described as rampant crime, bloodshed, and squalor, appointing Attorney General Pam Bondi to command the police force. The administration also plans to remove homeless encampments from public parks and spaces as part of the initiative. This action follows an executive order to make the capital safer, though D.C. crime statistics show a year-over-year decrease in overall and violent crime.</p>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the federal government 15% of the revenue from their artificial intelligence chip sales to China. This agreement was a condition for receiving export licenses for specific high-performance chips, including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308. President Trump confirmed the deal, stating he negotiated the terms directly with Nvidia's CEO to benefit the country. The move comes after the White House restricted sales of these advanced chips to China, citing national security concerns and the need to maintain a competitive edge in AI technology.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin rallied to over $119,000, approaching its all-time high, while Ether surged to its highest level since December 2021. This cryptocurrency market upswing has been largely attributed to increased buying during Asian trading hours, fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. Analysts suggest that the growing national debt acts as a tailwind for hard assets like Bitcoin and gold, pushing prices higher. The rally also boosted crypto-related stocks, with companies like Coinbase and Galaxy Digital seeing significant gains as investor sentiment remains bullish. (not investment advice)</p>

For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which has drawn thousands of new visitors and spurred activity in the remaining retail stores. This strategy focuses on creating community hubs and experiential destinations, which in turn drives 'cross-shopping' to the traditional retailers that remain.

This threatens to cripple public defense, leading to attorney shortages and potential denials of due process, as lawyers may be forced to turn down cases.

          <p>A 25-year-old tourist from New York, identified as Kevin Mares, was fatally shot in the La Perla neighborhood of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Mares was visiting the island with friends to attend a Bad Bunny concert when he was caught in the crossfire of an argument at a local nightspot. Police believe he was an innocent bystander when a shooter opened fire, also injuring two local residents. The incident occurred despite a municipal code restricting alcohol sales hours. This event highlights ongoing, though isolated, violence in a community that has otherwise become safer and more welcoming to tourists in recent years.</p>

          <p>Shares of enterprise AI company C3 AI dropped over 20% after it released disappointing preliminary first-quarter revenue estimates and announced a sales organization restructuring. CEO Thomas Siebel labeled the sales results 'completely unacceptable,' attributing the poor performance to the disruptive effects of the reorganization and his own ongoing health issues. In July, Siebel disclosed an autoimmune disease diagnosis and announced the company was searching for his successor. The company now expects a significantly wider operating loss compared to the previous year, though Siebel expressed confidence in the company's future.</p>

          <p>Experts are advising on the best placement for savings, comparing certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). HYSAs are recommended for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are suggested for those aiming to maximize interest returns and lock in current high rates, as they provide a fixed return for a set term. With interest rates on savings products expected to fall, CDs can protect against future rate drops, though they come with early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a move interpreted as a deterrent signal to the United States, the Chinese military has released rare footage of its DF-100 cruise missile. The video, part of a People's Liberation Army documentary, shows a rocket force brigade conducting a launch exercise and is one of the few times the weapon has been publicly shown since its 2019 debut. Previous appearances of the missile had it obscured, making technical analysis difficult. State media outlets widely shared the clip, confirming the missile's identity and highlighting the military's operational readiness under simulated enemy jamming conditions.</p>

          <p>A new study in the journal JAMA shows that the number of abortions in the U.S. rose after the repeal of Roe v. Wade, driven largely by medication abortions provided via telehealth. The telemedicine service Aid Access shipped nearly 120,000 packs of abortion pills between July 2023 and August 2024, with the majority going to residents in states with abortion bans. The research found that provision rates were significantly higher in poorer counties and in states with restrictive laws, highlighting how 'shield laws' in protective states are enabling access. This practice is currently being tested in court.</p>

          <p>The AA has described the UK government's planned overhaul of driving laws as having a 'major oversight' for not including graduated licenses for new and young motorists. While the government is proposing changes like compulsory eye tests for older drivers, it has no current plans to introduce restrictions for new drivers, such as limiting peer-age passengers. A government minister expressed concerns that such measures could 'unfairly discriminate' against young people. However, safety advocates argue these limits are needed, as government figures show young drivers are disproportionately involved in fatal road collisions.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in the Community Shield highlighted both the promise of their new signings and potential defensive frailties. New attackers Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz showed encouraging signs, with Ekitiké scoring, but the team appeared defensively open, a recurring theme in their pre-season matches. The team is adapting to a new 4-2-3-1 formation, and the absence of key midfielders likely contributed to the defensive instability. While the new system offers exciting offensive possibilities, the analysis in this article suggests Liverpool may face some teething troubles and defensive vulnerabilities early in the season.</p>

          <p>Psychologists and pediatricians are increasingly advocating for a simple but powerful technology rule for children: no screens in the bedroom, ever. This guidance is aimed at protecting sleep, as screens at night are known to delay bedtime and worsen sleep quality, which can negatively impact mental health and academic performance. Experts also suggest this rule helps 'future-proof' children by teaching them a healthier relationship with technology. Using devices in communal areas makes online activity less private, encourages better decision-making, and can foster family conversations about the digital world, counteracting technology's isolating nature.</p>
