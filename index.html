This strategic partnership focuses heavily on artificial intelligence infrastructure, supporting Meta's development of its Llama models and AI integration across its platforms. The deal represents a major win for Google Cloud as it competes with rivals Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure for large-scale enterprise contracts. Despite being competitors in the online advertising market, Meta's extensive infrastructure needs have led it to partner with major cloud providers, including Google. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following encouragement from President Trump, Missouri is poised to redraw its congressional districts to create a more favorable map for the Republican Party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The proposed changes aim to shift the state's U.S. House delegation from a 6-2 Republican majority to a 7-1 split, likely targeting the district of Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver. This move is part of a broader national trend of partisan redistricting, with states like Texas and California also engaging in similar efforts. State Republican leaders have expressed strong support for the new map, which could be addressed during a September legislative session.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited the U.S. Park Police facility in Washington D.C. to meet with federal law enforcement and National Guard members involved in his administration's anti-crime surge in the capital. During the visit, he delivered food and praised the results of the operation, claiming it has made the city significantly safer. This deployment, which Trump described as a potential model for other U.S. cities, has drawn criticism from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser, who argue it is politically motivated and unnecessary given recent crime statistics. Despite Trump's claims of patrolling with officers, he returned to the White House after the facility visit.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has issued a deeply fractured and complex ruling regarding the Trump administration's cancellation of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants. The decision creates a confusing jurisdictional path for researchers seeking to challenge the cancellations, which were tied to executive orders targeting DEI, gender identity, and COVID-19 research. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's controlling opinion suggests that while the legality of the overall policy can be challenged in a district court, the actual recovery of funds must be pursued in the Court of Federal Claims. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, in dissent, criticized the ruling as convoluted jurisprudence designed to favor the administration.</p>

          <p>A member of the National Guard deployed in Washington, D.C. as part of President Trump's anti-crime initiative received a traffic ticket for running a red light. The infraction occurred after the military transport vehicle collided with a civilian car in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. The civilian driver sustained minor injuries and had to be extricated from their vehicle by the fire department.

          <p>Powerful waves from Hurricane Erin are threatening to collapse at least two beachfront homes in Rodanthe, North Carolina, an area that has already seen nearly a dozen houses fall into the Atlantic since 2020. The National Park Service notes that these homes are built on land that is increasingly susceptible to erosion and rising sea levels, with some parts of the Outer Banks losing up to 15 feet of beachfront annually. While the hurricane exacerbates the immediate danger, experts say the barrier islands are inherently dynamic and ill-suited for permanent development. The ongoing erosion poses a continuous threat to coastal properties in the region.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in the previous month but still slightly above economists' expectations. The moderation was largely driven by an easing in rice price inflation, which had previously surged past 100%. The "core-core" inflation rate, a key metric for the Bank of Japan that also strips out energy prices, remained steady at 3.4%. This data follows the central bank's recent upward revision of its inflation forecasts and comes as the nation's economy shows modest growth, though trade figures have been sluggish.

If approved by voters in a special election, the measure would temporarily sideline the state's independent redistricting commission.

The guidance also aims to restrict health claims that are not supported by scientific evidence, a practice that critics say misleads parents. This move follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients.

          <p>President Trump's recent commitment to provide U.S. "security guarantees" to Ukraine, a significant shift from his previous isolationist stance, is being openly undermined by Russia. Despite a meeting with European leaders that seemed to signal a change in U.S. policy, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has repeatedly stated that the presence of any foreign troops in Ukraine is "completely unacceptable." This public defiance from Moscow complicates the diplomatic landscape and makes a potential peace deal more difficult to achieve. The article suggests that Russia's carefully worded dismissals are aimed more at European leaders than Trump, but ultimately weaken the U.S. president's position.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies, earning a split in their four-game series and maintaining a narrow one-game lead in their division. The win was powered by a rebounding offense and a solid start from pitcher Clayton Kershaw. The team now heads into a critical three-game series against the second-place San Diego Padres, who have been gaining ground in the standings. While the Dodgers swept the Padres in their last series, the division lead has shrunk significantly from six games in early July, setting the stage for a high-stakes weekend matchup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York appellate court has thrown out the nearly half-a-billion-dollar penalty imposed on President Donald Trump in his civil fraud trial, deeming the fine excessive. While the court upheld the underlying ruling that Trump is liable for fraudulently inflating the value of his assets, it concluded the massive financial penalty was likely unconstitutional. The New York Attorney General's Office, which brought the case, plans to appeal the decision on the fine to the state's highest court. Non-monetary penalties, such as a three-year ban on Trump serving as a company director in New York, were left in place by the ruling.</p>

Governor Ron DeSantis defended the action on social media, stating the state will not allow its roads to be used for political purposes. This incident is part of a broader move by the state's transportation agency to remove such crosswalks, citing federal guidance against political statements on public roads.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration permission to proceed with canceling National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants related to diversity, gender identity, and other specified topics. In a 5-4 decision, the court lifted a lower court's injunction that had required the NIH to restore funding for hundreds of canceled projects. The administration argued that the grants did not align with its policy objectives, following a presidential directive to end DEI-related federal funding. The underlying legal challenge from numerous states and research groups will continue, but the funding halt can take effect immediately.</p>

Captured in 1953, Ahn spent over 42 years in a South Korean prison for refusing to renounce his communist ideology and has lived near the border since his release. Despite his age and poor health, he remains a staunch believer in the North Korean regime's propaganda, viewing the U.S. military presence in the South as a form of colonial rule preventing Korean reunification.

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law in an effort to curb "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, often loss-making business practices that have plagued sectors like the solar panel industry. The revision, currently open for public feedback, aims to create a more sustainable market equilibrium by regulating aggressive price slashing. A solar panel manufacturer in Zhejiang province noted that severe overcapacity has led to purely price-based competition, causing substantial industry-wide losses. The move by regulators to address this issue has already led to a recent rebound in product prices in some sectors. (not investment advice)</p>
