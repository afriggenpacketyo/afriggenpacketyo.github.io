          <p>China's private manufacturing activity unexpectedly returned to growth in August, with the RatingDog Purchasing Managers' Index reaching 50.5, its fastest expansion in five months. This positive shift, driven by rising new orders and a recovery in export business, surpassed economist estimates. However, the official manufacturing PMI for August still indicated a fifth consecutive month of contraction. This article highlights the resilience of external demand despite tariffs, although domestic demand remains soft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD dropped almost 8% after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a 30% decrease in its second-quarter net profits compared to the previous year. This significant profit slump occurred despite a 14% increase in revenue, driven by expanding overseas sales. The company attributed the profit decline to intense price competition and excessive marketing within China's domestic EV market, which has exerted an adverse impact on the industry's development.

          <p>Actress and comedian Rosie O’Donnell issued a public apology for falsely asserting that the Minneapolis Catholic church school shooter was a Republican, MAGA supporter, and white supremacist. Her initial emotional statement, made after a tragic attack that killed two children, was later retracted as she admitted to a lack of due diligence. The FBI subsequently revealed the shooter's manifesto expressed anti-Catholic, anti-religious, and antisemitic ideologies, contradicting O'Donnell's initial assumptions and sparking further online criticism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report suggests that Australia's impending social media ban for individuals under 16, set to begin in December, can be effective, though various age verification technologies present inherent risks. The policy aims to curb harmful online impacts, with platforms facing substantial fines for non-compliance. While identity document verification offers high accuracy, it raises privacy concerns, and facial assessment technology has accuracy limitations for the target age group. Experts recommend a layered approach, yet some advocates worry about isolating children or pushing them to less regulated online spaces.</p>

          <h2>UK Faces Vegetable Shortages Amidst Prolonged Drought and Heatwaves</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK officials and farmers are raising alarms over significant shortages of staple vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, attributed to a prolonged drought and above-average warmth. Record-breaking heatwaves and severely reduced precipitation, particularly in England, have cut yields by over 50%. While immediate empty shelves are not guaranteed, concerns about water supplies are serious if dry conditions persist. The Met Office links these events to human-influenced climate change, emphasizing the urgent need for climate adaptation measures.</p>

Pritzker argued such a move could be part of a strategy to influence or control future elections. The White House, however, rejected Pritzker's accusations, attributing Chicago's high crime rate to his leadership and issuing a stern warning that federal intervention would occur if the situation is not rectified.</p>
