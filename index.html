          <p>Wu Yiquan, a 1.8-meter-tall AI researcher from China, has gained media attention for his exceptional skills on the basketball court. He recently scored 22 points in a provincial league qualifier, showcasing his talent as a defender. In an interview, Wu drew parallels between his work in scientific research and his passion for basketball, highlighting the importance of real-time adaptation and unpredictability in both fields. His story captures a unique blend of intellectual and athletic achievement.</p>

          <p>A recent Fox News poll indicates that American voters' support for deportation policies varies significantly based on the circumstances of the immigrants in question. While a majority favors deporting undocumented immigrants charged with crimes, there is a sharp partisan divide on deporting all undocumented individuals, with Republicans showing much stronger support for the measure. The survey also highlights that concerns about immigration's impact have shifted over time, with a greater focus now on crime compared to fifteen years ago, though overburdening government programs remains the top concern.</p>

          <p>A tragic collision between a barge and a sailboat in Biscayne Bay, near Miami Beach, has resulted in the deaths of two children. The sailboat, part of a youth summer sailing program, was carrying five children and one adult counselor when it was struck and submerged. All six occupants were thrown into the water, leading to a large-scale rescue operation. Two other children remain in critical condition, while the U.S. Coast Guard has launched an investigation into the fatal incident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has officially accepted the donation of a luxury jet from Qatar for presidential use, under an agreement that specifies the gift is unconditional. The memorandum of understanding allows the Air Force to begin retrofitting the aircraft, a process with classified costs that some lawmakers estimate could reach $1 billion. The deal has raised concerns about the use of taxpayer funds, especially as the agreement does not stipulate the plane's future after the current president leaves office.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking, has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her legal team argues that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made with her late associate, Jeffrey Epstein, should have protected her from being charged. This legal move comes as Maxwell is reportedly in discussions with the Justice Department about potentially cooperating with the government. The appeal centers on whether Epstein's plea deal in Florida provided immunity to his potential co-conspirators in other federal districts.</p>

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a lawsuit against unidentified online merchants for allegedly selling counterfeit, Trump-branded products on platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay. The complaint accuses these sellers of offering "inferior imitations" of official merchandise, including hats, shirts, and mugs, without proper licensing. The company is seeking a court order to stop the use of its trademarks and compel the online marketplaces to remove the counterfeit goods and close the associated seller accounts. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing battle against knockoff products on major e-commerce sites.</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which offer up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, are set to expire on September 30. This policy change, part of the "Big Beautiful Bill," reverses a key Biden-era climate initiative and is expected to impact the EV market. Auto dealers and industry analysts anticipate a short-term surge in sales as consumers rush to take advantage of the incentive before the deadline. However, the elimination of the credit is projected to slow the growth of EV adoption in the long run.</p>

It details how this rule can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the income stream offered by an annuity. By comparing an annuity's payout rate to a 4% withdrawal, retirees can assess whether the guaranteed income and longevity protection of an annuity is a worthwhile trade-off for the liquidity of a traditional portfolio. The article suggests a hybrid approach, using both strategies to balance security with flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Investors are watching for signs of progress, but the company's stock performance has lagged since Niccol took over. The scale of Starbucks, with nearly 40,000 stores, makes implementing changes a much larger and more expensive undertaking than at Chipotle.</p>
