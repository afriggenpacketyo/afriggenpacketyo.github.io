          <h2>Harvard Files Lawsuit Against Trump Administration Over Funding Freeze</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 08:10:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful actions in freezing billions of dollars in federal funding. Harvard President Alan Garber stated the lawsuit was a response to the administration's initial freeze of $2.2 billion and subsequent intention to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. The lawsuit asserts that the administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights and threatened academic independence. The Trump administration claims Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access taxpayer funds, while Harvard argues the funding halt will impede critical scientific and medical research.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers, led by Professor Wang Chao, have successfully factored a 90-bit RSA integer using a D-Wave Advantage quantum computer, marking a significant advancement in quantum cryptology. This achievement raises concerns about the potential for quantum computers to break even the most secure encryption, posing a threat to personal privacy and data security. Scientists worldwide are racing to develop post-quantum cryptography to counter this looming threat. RSA encryption, widely used for securing digital communications, relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers.</p>

Wilshere, previously a first-team coach, will be assisted by Tony Roberts and Nick Stanley. Norwich currently sits 14th in the Championship, having conceded a high number of goals despite a strong attacking record.</p>

          <p>The US Education Department will resume collecting on defaulted student loans, potentially affecting millions of borrowers, marking an end to the leniency period that began during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Advocates criticize the decision, citing borrower confusion and economic chaos.
