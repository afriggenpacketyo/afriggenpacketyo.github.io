          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has publicly apologized after misidentifying a team of charity rowers off the coast of Norfolk as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. After alerting authorities, it was revealed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. The rowers, which included a former Royal Marine, found the situation amusing. In response to the mix-up, Lowe pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, while still maintaining his stance on deporting illegal immigrants.</p>

          <p>Amidst a chikungunya fever outbreak in southern China, health experts are cautioning that broad efforts to eliminate all mosquitoes may be ineffective. The viral disease, which causes fever and severe joint pain, is primarily transmitted by specific Aedes mosquito species. Jin Dongyan, a biomedical science professor, argues that authorities penalizing businesses for mosquito breeding sites are likely missing the target, as most local mosquitoes do not carry the virus. The outbreak has been exacerbated by a combination of heat, humidity, and rain creating ideal breeding conditions for the disease vectors.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Buddhist monks, joined by nuns and laypeople, gathered in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to pray for peace and honor soldiers killed in recent border clashes with Thailand. The ceremony was organized to show support for a ceasefire that ended five days of fighting and to appeal for peaceful coexistence between the neighboring Buddhist nations. The conflict, which displaced over 260,000 people, was part of a decades-old territorial dispute. While a ceasefire is in effect, tensions remain as the underlying issues are unresolved and captured soldiers have not yet been released.</p>

          <p>French firefighters have successfully brought a giant wildfire in the southern Aude region under control after it burned for several days. The blaze, the largest in the area in decades, consumed over 17,000 hectares (42,000 acres), resulting in one death, 13 injuries, and the destruction of dozens of homes. While the fire is contained, approximately 2,000 firefighters remain on site to manage hotspots, and the area will not be declared fully extinguished for several more days. The region is bracing for another heatwave, prompting the national railway to cancel some train services as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an independent member of parliament in New South Wales, Australia, has resigned from his seat moments before a scheduled vote to expel him. Ward was recently convicted of sexually assaulting a political staffer in 2015 and abusing an 18-year-old in 2013, and is currently jailed while awaiting sentencing. He had initially refused to resign and launched an unsuccessful legal challenge to stop the expulsion vote. His resignation avoids him becoming the first lawmaker to be formally expelled from the state's lower house in over a century for unworthy conduct.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," who are over 80 years old but possess the memory capabilities of people decades younger. While healthy brains naturally shrink and slow with age, the brains of SuperAgers shrink at a significantly slower rate, allowing them to resist the cognitive decline often associated with aging, including Alzheimer's disease. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program have been investigating this phenomenon for over two decades. Their work aims to uncover the secrets behind this resilience to better understand and potentially combat dementia.</p>

          <p>Cultural critics and producers discuss the pervasive issue of smartphone addiction, noting that over half of American adults feel they spend too much time on their devices. Studies show that a phone's mere presence can diminish cognitive capacity, even when it is silent and face down. In response, some people, particularly young adults, are turning to simpler "dumbphones" or older models like BlackBerrys to escape addictive design and constant notifications. The conversation suggests that overcoming phone dependency requires more than just willpower, advocating for creating intentional time away from screens and fostering real-world connections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a $48 billion trade deficit it claims is evidence of unfair practices. A significant portion of this imbalance is attributed to Switzerland's massive gold refining industry, which processes billions of dollars worth of gold annually. Swiss officials and economists argue that including the full value of gold distorts the trade data, as refiners only earn a small fee for processing the metal. The high tariff, which affects luxury goods like watches and chocolate, is expected to damage the Swiss economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a military plan to take control of Gaza City, marking a significant escalation in the 23-month-long war. The decision outlines an eventual military occupation of the entire territory, which has already seen at least 61,000 Palestinians killed. The move has drawn sharp criticism from international leaders and humanitarian organizations, who warn it will worsen the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and lead to more bloodshed. The plan also faces domestic opposition from families of hostages who fear military action will endanger their loved ones and from critics who see it as a futile occupation.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, has been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to attack Maryland's power grid. Prosecutors detailed his plan with a co-conspirator to use sniper attacks on electrical substations around Baltimore to cause a societal collapse. The judge condemned Russell's racist ideology, stating he was the "intellectual horsepower" behind the plot to create a white supremacist utopia. This was not Russell's first conviction; he previously pleaded guilty to explosives charges after a double homicide at his apartment in 2017.</p>

          <p>A leaked internal report accuses His Majesty's Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS) of a cover-up regarding a long-standing IT bug that caused legal evidence to be lost, overwritten, or hidden. The flaw in the case-management software, used in civil, family, and tribunal courts, may have led judges to make rulings based on incomplete information. Whistleblowers and the report itself indicate that management was aware of the data corruption issues for years but failed to act or inform judges, fearing reputational damage.

          <p>The iconic French bottled water brand Perrier is embroiled in a scandal after it was revealed the company used illicit filtration methods, a practice that could strip it of its "natural mineral water" designation. An investigation found that Nestlé, Perrier's parent company, and other producers treated water due to contamination concerns, violating EU laws that require such water to be unaltered. The affair has been dubbed France's "Water-gate," with allegations of a government cover-up to protect the strategic industry. The European Commission is now set to rule on the matter, which could fundamentally change Perrier's branding.</p>
