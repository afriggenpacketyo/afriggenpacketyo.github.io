          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 19:54:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as the "largest Deal ever." The agreement reportedly includes reciprocal 15% tariffs on Japanese exports to the U.S. and a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States. Key provisions of the deal involve Japan opening its markets to American cars, trucks, rice, and other agricultural products. The announcement follows a period of tense negotiations and comes after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's coalition lost its majority in a recent election, potentially weakening Japan's negotiating stance.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports a dramatic increase in the arrests of undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions during the Trump administration. The agency's data shows significant spikes in arrests across multiple states, with increases of 290% in Maryland and 470% in Virginia. These arrests have targeted individuals convicted of serious crimes, including murder and sexual assault. The enforcement push has occurred alongside a reported 830% increase in attacks on ICE personnel, which officials attribute to heightened rhetoric from some elected officials against the agency's mission.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced plans to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, to determine what she knows about the sex trafficking case. The move comes as the Trump administration faces pressure from its own supporters to release more information. Concurrently, a House subcommittee voted to subpoena Maxwell for a deposition, signaling congressional interest in her testimony. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed discussions with the government, stating she will "always testify truthfully." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Epstein's crimes.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary heavy metal vocalist who gained fame as the frontman for the pioneering band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. His family confirmed his death but did not provide a specific cause, though he had publicly battled Parkinson's disease and other health issues for years. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's career spanned over five decades, from the groundbreaking, sludgy rock of Black Sabbath to a highly successful solo career. He was a two-time Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee and later became a beloved television personality on the reality show "The Osbournes."</p>

The piece points to the recent reassignments or firings of several high-ranking female officers, including the first female head of the U.S. Naval Academy and the first female Chief of Naval Operations. The author connects these actions to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's previously stated views against what he calls "social engineering" in the armed forces.

          <p>Following England's 2-1 ODI series defeat to India, former legendary bowler Katherine Sciver-Brunt publicly questioned the mindset and attitude of some current players. Sciver-Brunt, who is married to the team's captain, suggested some players look "lazy" and seem "scared to fail," contrasting it with her own passionate, "life and death" approach to the game. In response, current captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and coach Charlotte Edwards defended the team's commitment and professionalism. They suggested that a player's outward appearance doesn't always reflect their internal drive and effort.</p>

Khanna admitted to purchasing stolen converters from a network of thieves across multiple states and then selling them to a metal refinery. The refinery would extract the valuable precious metals—platinum, palladium, and rhodium—contained within the devices. The large-scale criminal enterprise was exposed following a routine traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during a period of surging catalytic converter thefts across the country.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board's final report on the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., husband of former Rep. Mary Peltola, identified several contributing factors. The investigation found the aircraft was overweight for takeoff with a load of moose meat and that a set of moose antlers affixed to a wing strut created significant drag. These factors, combined with downdrafts and turbulent conditions, likely resulted in the plane having insufficient power to maneuver over the terrain in the remote Alaskan area. Peltola was the sole occupant of the Piper Super Cub aircraft.</p>

          <p>Researchers with the shark-tracking group OCEARCH have detected a massive great white shark, nicknamed "Contender," swimming approximately 50 miles off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Weighing an estimated 1,653 pounds and measuring nearly 14 feet long, Contender is believed to be the largest white shark ever tagged in the western North Atlantic. The adult male was first tagged off the coast of Georgia in January and has since been tracked along the U.S. East Coast. The data collected from his tag over the next five years will provide valuable insights into the species' migration patterns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural and scientific agency, for the second time. The State Department cited the organization's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and its "anti-Israel rhetoric" as reasons for the departure, which will take effect at the end of 2026. The U.S. had previously left UNESCO in 2018 under Trump but rejoined in 2023 under the Biden administration. UNESCO's director-general expressed disappointment, noting the decision could negatively impact American communities seeking World Heritage status for cultural and natural sites.</p>

          <p>A new federal law has established the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), a new income-driven repayment option for student loan borrowers, set to be available by July 2026. This plan will calculate monthly payments as a percentage of a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10%, with a minimum payment of $10. The legislation will also phase out several existing repayment plans, making RAP one of only two options for new borrowers. While the plan offers a small subsidy for those not paying down principal, it extends the loan forgiveness timeline to 30 years. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion generated through acquisitions and IPOs during the same period.
