The plan, intended to protect the EU's steel industry, has sparked panic in the automotive sector, which fears inflationary pressures and higher costs. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association argued the measures are excessive and will negatively impact market prices, calling for a more balanced approach to protect both steel producers and consumers.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the demand for AI computing has risen "substantially" in the last six months, driven by the evolution of AI from simple queries to complex reasoning. He noted that as AI models become more powerful, their use cases expand, creating exponential growth in both capability and demand for Nvidia's advanced GPUs like Blackwell. Huang described this trend as the beginning of a new industrial revolution, also highlighting that China is rapidly building out the energy infrastructure needed to support AI development.

          <p>Researchers have identified a new, increasingly common side effect associated with popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The drugs can cause abnormal patterns of uptake in oncologic FDG PET-CT scans, which could lead to misinterpretation by doctors, incorrect cancer staging, and delays in treatment. Experts advise that imaging professionals should carefully document a patient's medication history to avoid these diagnostic errors and ensure proper care.</p>

          <p>In a post on his Truth Social platform, former President Donald Trump stated that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker "should be in jail." The comment appears to be a reaction to their opposition to increased federal immigration enforcement in Chicago, including Mayor Johnson's executive order barring federal agencies from using city property for such operations. The statement comes amid heightened tensions and protests surrounding the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz" in the area.</p>

          <p>Polling data indicates a significant shift in American public opinion regarding Israel, fueled by the ongoing war in Gaza. A majority of Americans now hold a negative view of Israel, with increasing sympathy for the Palestinian cause, a trend particularly pronounced among Democrats and younger voters. This change is beginning to influence political discourse, with more politicians openly criticizing Israeli actions, and could have long-term implications for U.S. foreign policy and the influence of pro-Israel lobby groups like AIPAC.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Tony Blair's Proposed Gaza Plan Reflects a Pattern of Imperial Intervention</h2>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a 20-point plan for Gaza reportedly drafted by Tony Blair and Donald Trump, framing it as the latest example of Blair's market-driven, interventionist foreign policy. The plan envisions turning the territory into a "special economic zone" overseen by an international board, a concept the author argues prioritizes business interests and foreign capital over political solutions and Palestinian self-determination. The author suggests the proposal reflects a fusion of Blair's faith in free enterprise and Trump's transactional approach to politics, continuing a destructive legacy in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The recent collapse of the French government underscores a deep-seated national conflict over economic policy, as France faces a large debt burden and intense competition from the U.S. and China. Unpopular budget proposals, including the removal of public holidays to boost productivity, have sparked widespread discontent, pitting the need for fiscal health against the country's highly valued social model. This standoff reflects a broader European debate on whether nations can maintain their traditional work-life balance and social protections while remaining competitive on the global stage.

          <p>A new analysis by the Animal Welfare Institute reveals that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has increasingly issued warnings instead of taking meaningful enforcement actions, like fines, against businesses that violate the Animal Welfare Act. This trend allows facilities with severe instances of animal neglect, such as puppy mills and research labs, to continue operating without significant penalty. Critics argue that weak enforcement, exacerbated by understaffing and a recent Supreme Court decision, means that for many violators, small fines are merely a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent.</p>

          <p>As overall mortgage demand weakens, a growing share of borrowers are turning to adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates. With the average rate for a 5/1 ARM nearly a full percentage point below that of a 30-year fixed-rate loan, the popularity of these riskier products is rising. While ARMs can offer initial savings, they expose borrowers to the risk of higher payments in the future when the fixed-rate period ends and the rate adjusts to market conditions.

          <p>Financial advisors point to Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs) as a highly effective, yet often overlooked, tax-saving strategy for retirees. Individuals aged 70½ and older can directly transfer up to $108,000 from their IRA to a charity, and this amount is excluded from their adjusted gross income, which is more beneficial than a standard deduction. This move not only fulfills philanthropic goals but also helps satisfy Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) without increasing taxable income, which can prevent higher Medicare premiums.
