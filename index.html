          <p>University of Virginia President James E. Ryan has resigned in response to pressure from the Trump administration's investigation into the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. The Justice Department accused the university of simply rebranding these programs and threatened the loss of federal funding, which sources described as a "nuclear bomb" for the administration. Ryan stated he could not fight the federal government at the expense of employees, researchers, and students who rely on that funding. This action represents a significant escalation in the administration's campaign to reshape higher education and dismantle DEI efforts at major American universities.</p>

Council President Rachel Miller stated the initiative aims to promote safety and inclusion for immigrant communities in the face of the Trump administration's enforcement operations.

          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling it was an unconstitutional violation of the First and Fifth Amendments. The order sought to punish the firm, which represented Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News, by restricting its access to federal buildings and targeting its clients and employee security clearances. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan described the order as a "shocking abuse of power" based on a "personal vendetta." This decision marks the fourth time a federal court has invalidated one of Trump's executive orders aimed at law firms he perceives as political enemies.</p>

The UN has criticized the GHF's system as "inherently unsafe," as the distribution points are located within Israeli military zones.

Edelman cites the evolution of crypto into a mainstream asset and the resolution of earlier questions about government bans and institutional adoption as reasons for his shift. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-to-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating higher-return assets like crypto. He points to Bitcoin's lack of correlation with traditional assets as a way to improve portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an immediate termination of all trade discussions with Canada in retaliation for Ottawa's new digital services tax, which targets large technology companies. In a social media post, Trump called the tax an "egregious" and "blatant attack" on the United States, vowing to inform Canada of new tariffs within a week. The move jeopardizes a trade relationship worth over $760 billion annually and comes as Canada prepares to collect the first payments from the tax, which retroactively affects U.S. tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta. The announcement caused a brief downturn in stock markets, which had reached record highs earlier in the day.</p>

The Prime Minister agreed that stricter benefit criteria would only apply to new claimants, a move that pacified some but was criticized by others as merely "tinkering with a broken bill." Critics, including Work and Pensions Select Committee Chair Debbie Abrahams, argue the changes don't address fundamental concerns for future claimants.

Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone called another destructive fire season "inevitable," urging residents to prepare for the worst. Officials emphasized that the landscape is covered in dried vegetation that can serve as potent kindling for fast-spreading brush fires once the Santa Ana winds return.

According to the Economic Policy Institute, these raises will provide an average annual wage boost ranging from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.

The ruling diminishes privacy arguments, stating that the social stigma around pornography does not exempt the industry from valid regulation.

The administration is now threatening to re-deport him to a third country, a move his lawyers argue is an attempt to avoid a loss in court.</p>

          <p>Most of England is under heat health alerts as the country prepares for its second heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to reach into the 30s Celsius. An amber alert, the second-highest level, is active for London and southern regions, indicating that the heat could affect the entire population and various health services. Forecasters predict Monday could be the hottest day of the year so far, potentially reaching 35Â°C (95Â°F) and setting a record for the start of the Wimbledon tennis tournament. The heat is attributed to a combination of factors, including hot air from the U.S. and the Azores, strong sunshine, and high pressure.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's second offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, an improved bid worth up to Â£62.5 million, has been rejected. The initial bid of Â£45 million plus add-ons was also turned down earlier this month. Brentford is reportedly seeking a higher guaranteed fee for the 25-year-old Cameroon international, who scored 20 goals last season. Manchester United is looking to strengthen its attack, having already signed another forward, but may face competition for Mbeumo from other clubs, including Tottenham. Mbeumo is expected to miss about a month of the upcoming season due to his participation in the Africa Cup of Nations.</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court rulings have significantly strengthened Donald Trump's presidency, removing judicial guardrails that previously checked his executive authority. A key decision curbed the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against his policies, a move Trump hailed as a "monumental victory for the constitution." This comes after the court, which includes three Trump appointees, granted former presidents presumptive immunity for official acts, effectively shielding him from prosecution. Critics argue that while there is a debate over judicial power, in the context of Trump's actions against other democratic institutions, these rulings concentrate too much power in an already assertive executive branch.</p>

          <p>A new study by the Pew Charitable Trusts reveals that approximately 56 million American workers, or about half of the private-sector workforce, do not have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k). This lack of access presents a major barrier to building wealth for retirement, as research shows individuals are 15 times more likely to save when contributions are automatically deducted from their paychecks. The findings highlight a growing retirement crisis, with many workers forced to prioritize immediate expenses over long-term savings. This leaves millions potentially reliant solely on a Social Security system that faces its own long-term funding challenges.</p>

          <p>The proliferation of artificial intelligence is beginning to disrupt the job market for computer-science majors, as AI tools prove capable of handling many entry-level coding tasks. Tech executives have noted that AI makes senior engineers more productive, reducing the need for junior employees and potentially breaking the bottom rung of the career ladder across various industries. This shift is causing uncertainty for students and prompting universities to adapt their curricula to teach both fundamental skills and how to use AI tools effectively. The trend suggests that durable, human-centric skills may become more valuable than pre-professional training in an ever-changing job market.</p>

In contrast, "M3gan 2.0" builds upon its predecessor with a larger scale and significantly more humor, though it leans less on horror.

          <p>The dissenting opinions from the Supreme Court's three liberal justices reveal deep concerns about the court's recent rightward shift and its implications for American democracy. In a dissent read from the bench, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that "no right is safe" after the conservative majority limited the power of lower courts to block executive orders. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described that same ruling as an "existential threat to the rule of law." These potent dissents highlight the profound ideological divisions on the court and signal the liberal wing's alarm over what they see as the erosion of legal protections and the rise of authoritarianism.</p>

The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as other states and countries lure productions away with more generous incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom had called for the expansion to keep the industry competitive. A related bill aims to broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the rebate percentage, making California's program more comparable to those in states like Georgia, with the goal of bringing production back home.</p>

Instead, the events indicate Trump views military force as a tool to gain leverage for negotiations, preferring to make deals with existing leaders rather than toppling them.
