          <p>Labour MP Dan Norris, representing North East Somerset and Hanham, has been arrested on suspicion of rape, child sex offences, child abduction, and misconduct in public office. Avon and Somerset Police confirmed the arrest of a man in his 60s following a referral regarding alleged non-recent child sex offences dating back to the 2000s, as well as an alleged rape in the 2020s. Norris, who was elected in 2024 after previously serving in Parliament, has been released on conditional bail as the investigation continues. The Labour Party has immediately suspended Norris, meaning he will not be able to sit as a Labour MP in the Commons while the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Zoo is celebrating the arrival of four Galapagos tortoise hatchlings, a first in its 150-year history, born to Mommy and Abrazzo, the zoo's oldest residents at nearly 100 years old. These critically endangered tortoises are being kept behind the scenes in the Reptile and Amphibian House, where they are eating and growing appropriately. Mommy is considered one of the most genetically valuable Galapagos tortoises in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' species survival plan and the oldest first-time mom of her species. The zoo plans a public debut of the hatchlings on April 23, with a naming contest to follow.</p>

          <p>The IRS is planning to cut up to 25% of its workforce, beginning with the agency's Office of Civil Rights and Compliance, according to an internal email. This reduction is aimed at increasing efficiency and effectiveness, resulting in staffing cuts across multiple offices and job categories, and the civil rights office will be effectively shuttered. The agency will offer early retirement incentives as part of the phased implementation, and concerns are rising that these layoffs could cause delays during tax season. The Trump administration says workforce changes will not affect staff directly working to process tax returns.</p>

State officials argue that the federal Department of Education lacks the authority to make such demands, asserting that no federal or state laws prohibit DEI principles. They also claim the administration's position is an abrupt shift from previous statements supporting diversity and inclusion.

          <p>Donald Trump's announcement of punitive tariffs on imports has triggered market instability and poses significant challenges for Keir Starmer's government in the UK. The potential for a global recession raises strategic concerns, especially as the UK already faces fiscal challenges and growth targets. Starmer's government must navigate trade negotiations with the US while prioritizing a stronger trading relationship with the EU to build economic resilience. The situation demands that Labour approach fiscal decisions with progressive values, ensuring those with the broadest shoulders bear a greater share of the burden.</p>

Though less overtly misogynistic than figures like Andrew Tate, Hall's content subtly reinforces conservative gender philosophies, placing men at the center of the universe and relegating women to secondary roles.</p>

          <p>Economists are challenging the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions and inflates the rates. The formula, which uses the trade deficit divided by exports and then halved, assumes a lower elasticity of import prices than is realistic. According to experts, adjusting the elasticity would result in significantly lower tariff rates, with most countries at the baseline 10% established by the administration. This raises concerns about the accuracy and justification of the imposed tariffs.</p>

          <p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has dismissed Shahram Dabiri, his vice president of parliamentary affairs, for taking a "lavish" trip to Antarctica with his wife during Nowruz, the Persian new year. The president's office deemed the trip "unjustifiable and unacceptable given the ongoing economic challenges" in Iran. The incident sparked public outrage after a photo of Dabiri and his wife in front of the MV Plancius, bound for Antarctica, circulated widely on social media. Pezeshkian emphasized that government officials should adhere to the principle of simplicity amid economic pressures.</p>

          <p>As President Trump's tariffs are expected to increase prices for everyday items, experts are cautioning consumers against going into debt to beat the "tariff effect." While stocking up on some items may seem logical, it's important to consider long-term financial situations and avoid panic buying. With many Americans already dealing with debt, financial analysts recommend taking a measured approach and prioritizing financial stability. Experts do not anticipate any shortages and emphasize that the supply chain is in much better shape than during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has cautioned that Republicans risk a "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if President Trump's tariffs lead to a recession. Cruz expressed concern that the tariffs, if maintained and met with global retaliation, could trigger a trade war, damaging the U.S. economy. He warned that a recession could result in a Democrat-controlled House and potentially the Senate. Despite his concerns, Cruz offered an olive branch to the administration, hoping for a successful outcome with lower tariffs both abroad and domestically.</p>

The Israeli military maintains that it took steps to minimize harm to civilians and has accused Hamas of using civilian infrastructure for military purposes. The strikes come amid increased Israeli military operations in Gaza and evacuation orders for residents.</p>

          <p>With the number of foster carers declining, empty nesters are being encouraged to consider fostering, with those who have made the move emphasizing the value they can bring. Parents who began fostering after their children left home highlight the opportunity to provide a loving and secure home to children in need. The Fostering Network, however, cautions that government action falls short of what's needed to recruit and retain carers. Minister for Children and Families Janet Daby urges anyone interested to contact their local council to learn more.</p>

          <p>Michigan has joined 18 other states in filing a lawsuit against President Trump's election order, arguing that it unconstitutionally infringes on states' authority to run their own elections. The lawsuit challenges key aspects of the order, including requirements for documentary proof of citizenship when registering to vote and the demand that all mail ballots be received by Election Day. State attorneys general contend that the order is antidemocratic and un-American. The White House maintains that the proof-of-citizenship requirements are common sense and essential to the constitutional republic.</p>

          <h2>Trump Tariff Formula Misrepresents Global Trade Economics, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-05 12:40:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic experts are questioning the validity of the tariff formula used by the Trump administration, claiming that it misrepresents global trade economics. The formula, which calculates tariffs based on the trade deficit and import figures, does not align with modern definitions of trade deficits. Experts argue that trade deficits are determined by financial markets, not solely by import demand and manufacturing. The formula is unlikely to achieve the administration's desired outcomes and could lead to unintended consequences.</p>

In his daily walks around the city, he keeps an eye out for interesting juxtapositions or humorous framings: a pigeon balancing on a ghostly tree; a cloud caught in a net; statues miraculously coming to life. “At the root it’s about seeing, but maintaining the right state of mind is also everything. I’m hoping the photos will connect with others, and, with each individual, take on personal narratives.”</p>
