          <p>President Trump stated on social media that Apple will face a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. if they are not manufactured domestically, causing Apple's shares to decline in premarket trading. Currently, Apple primarily produces iPhones in China, but has been shifting some production to India due to friendlier trade relations with the U.S. This announcement follows ongoing trade tensions and could significantly impact Apple's manufacturing strategy and costs, potentially affecting consumer prices and the company's profitability.

          <p>The Chinese government condemned the Trump administration's decision to ban international students from enrolling at Harvard, stating it would damage America's international standing. The move, prompted by accusations of Harvard fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, has caused panic among incoming foreign students. In response, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has extended an open invitation to affected students, offering streamlined admission procedures and academic support.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has strongly criticized the leaders of the UK, France, and Canada, accusing them of siding with Hamas following their condemnation of Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza. Netanyahu specifically targeted Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Mark Carney, stating they effectively want Hamas to remain in power. This criticism comes after the three countries denounced Israel's actions as disproportionate and described the humanitarian situation as intolerable. The UK has suspended talks over a possible trade deal due to concerns about aid access to Gaza.</p>

The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were allegedly targeted by Rodriguez, who shouted "free, free Palestine" during his arrest. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and an act of terrorism, with authorities noting that the suspect legally purchased the firearm in Illinois in 2020.

Gates emphasized the importance of timeliness in philanthropy, driven by a responsibility to address contemporary needs and opportunities, especially as government funding for global aid decreases.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to help cover costs associated with plant closures and other restructuring initiatives. The struggling automaker may also book an additional 60 billion yen in restructuring costs this fiscal year as it pushes ahead with its revamp plans.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields have eased slightly but remain high as investors evaluate the potential impact of President Trump's tax bill on the economy. The bill, which has passed the House but not the Senate, is projected to add nearly $4 trillion to the fiscal deficit, raising concerns about the sustainability of U.S. debt. Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating has amplified these fears, with analysts suggesting that the large deficit could lead to increased bond supply and potential inflation, making fixed-income investments less attractive.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., primarily affecting Latin American countries that rely heavily on these funds. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the plan, arguing that the U.S. cannot tax people twice when they are already paying taxes. The tax, intended to curb illegal migration, could significantly reduce the flow of money to countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, where remittances constitute a large share of GDP. Critics warn that the tax may drive transfers into informal channels and alienate Latino voters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to revoke Harvard University's eligibility to enroll international students has created further instability for foreign students. This move would force over 6,000 students to transfer or lose their legal status, adding to existing challenges like visa revocations and bureaucratic hurdles. Education advocates warn that these actions will harm U.S. universities and the broader economy, as international students contribute significantly through tuition and research. Harvard is challenging the decision, and some students are considering backup plans amid the uncertainty.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard University are facing uncertainty after the Trump administration moved to stop Harvard from enrolling international students. The decision affects approximately 6,800 international students, who make up more than 27% of the university's enrollment. Students express concerns about their ability to graduate or continue their studies in the U.S., with some considering alternative options. The move has been criticized as a crackdown on higher education and a politicization of education, particularly targeting students from China.</p>

While the price cap will be lower, there are cheaper deals being offered for fixed deals, which usually last a year, by some suppliers. The drop in energy bills in July reflects a fall in the international price of wholesale gas. Prices remain high, and some continue to struggle with the cost of energy.</p>

Despite states and cities enacting new policies like banning chokeholds and mandating body cameras, killings by police officers have actually risen. The article points to a lack of comprehensive legislative action and a shift in public sentiment towards prioritizing crime reduction over reform. Racial disparities in police killings persist, highlighting deeper systemic issues beyond policy tweaks.</p>
