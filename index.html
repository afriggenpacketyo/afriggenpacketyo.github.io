        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung is increasing its U.S. smartphone market share, narrowing the gap with Apple, primarily driven by its innovative foldable phones like the Z Fold 7. While Apple still leads, its market share saw a quarterly decline, contrasting with Samsung's surge, which is also supported by a wider range of price points. Analysts note that Apple is expected to respond with its own foldable iPhone in the coming years to compete in this emerging high-end market segment. The trend highlights a renewed competition focused on form factor innovation, similar to the large-screen rivalry a decade ago.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has forced an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, ordering both the airline and the union into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike, which had grounded hundreds of flights and affected over 100,000 travelers, stemmed from a contract dispute over wages and unpaid work. While government officials cited economic risks for the intervention, the union accused them of violating workers' constitutional right to strike. Full service restoration may take several days, continuing disruptions for passengers.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the Atlantic season's first hurricane, reaching Category 5 strength with 160 mph winds. Currently located north of the Leeward Islands, the storm is forecast to track between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. While a direct landfall on the mainland is not expected, Erin will likely generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the coast from August 20 to 27. Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are also expected to receive heavy rain, which could lead to flash flooding and mudslides.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's new signing, Tijjani Reijnders, made a spectacular Premier League debut, contributing a goal and an assist in a dominant 4-0 victory over Wolves. The 27-year-old Dutch midfielder's performance earned high praise from manager Pep Guardiola, who hailed him as a "top signing" for the club's future. Reijnders' box-to-box energy and creative passing were instrumental in the win, signaling a strong start for City's campaign. The decisive victory suggests City is aiming to rebound strongly from a disappointing previous season.</p>

          <p>Greg Iles, the acclaimed author known for his suspenseful novels set in Mississippi, including the "Natchez Burning" trilogy, has passed away at the age of 65. His death on Friday was attributed to a long battle with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer he was diagnosed with in 1996 but kept private until recently. Iles was celebrated for his masterful storytelling that explored complex themes of race and class in the American South. He was also a musician, performing with the literary rock band the Rock Bottom Remainders alongside authors like Stephen King.</p>

In a letter to senior ministers, they highlighted the "decimated" healthcare system in Gaza and the imminent risk of death for many children. The MPs are working with Médecins Sans Frontières to facilitate the evacuations, which they insist should be based solely on clinical need.

          <p>Six prominent Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, have sent an open letter to President Trump urging him to reconsider a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI chips to China. The agreement permits the sales in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% cut of the revenue. The senators argue that this arrangement trades away a critical U.S. technological advantage and could bolster China's military capabilities, posing a serious national security risk. The White House dismissed the concerns, while reports suggest China is already mandating its tech firms to avoid U.S. chips.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump is reported to have hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addressed the plight of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and transferred to Russia during the war. This act of personal diplomacy highlights an issue that the International Criminal Court has classified as a war crime, for which Putin faces an arrest warrant. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's attention to what they describe as a state-sponsored campaign of child trafficking.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed the week near record highs, fueled by investor optimism regarding a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. A cooler-than-expected consumer price index report early in the week bolstered expectations for monetary easing, though a subsequent report on wholesale inflation tempered some of the gains. Despite mixed inflation signals, market odds for a rate cut remain high. Several major companies, including Goldman Sachs, Nvidia, and Meta, also hit all-time stock price highs during the week's trading sessions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is tightening the requirements for legal immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship by expanding the definition of "good moral character." U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has instructed officers to conduct a "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal background check. This new policy will place greater emphasis on positive contributions like community involvement and stable employment, while also increasing scrutiny of negative factors, including actions that are lawful but deemed inconsistent with civic responsibility, such as habitual traffic infractions. Critics argue the move is designed to create more grounds for denial and discourage applications.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, Arizona, an architectural startup is converting old shipping containers into sustainable and rapidly deployable housing units for the city's homeless population. The "X-WING" shelters, designed by architect Brian Stark, are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units, which can be built in just one week and are topped with solar panels, offer a cost-effective and environmentally friendly approach to tackling the housing crisis. The project aims to provide residents with a safe, private space to stabilize their lives.</p>
