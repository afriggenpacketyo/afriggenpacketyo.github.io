          <h2>Shedeur Sanders' NFL Draft Stock Plummets After Three Rounds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being touted as a potential first-round pick, Shedeur Sanders, son of Deion Sanders, went undrafted through the first three rounds of the NFL Draft, a historically unusual slide for a quarterback prospect of his caliber. Concerns about his high sack rate, arm strength, and adaptability to a coach other than his father may have contributed to his fall. The draft day was further complicated by a prank call during a livestream, adding insult to injury. Some anonymous NFL coaches have criticized his attitude and performance, while others, including Donald Trump, have voiced support. Optimism remains for Sanders as he awaits day three of the draft, expressing gratitude despite the setbacks.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors by fabricating his backstory and misusing campaign funds. Santos expressed remorse in court, but the judge emphasized his lack of genuine remorse. The sentence reflects accountability for his crimes, which included stealing personal identities and financial information, lying to the Federal Election Commission, and falsely claiming unemployment benefits. Santos will also have to pay over $575,000 in restitution and forfeiture.</p>

          <p>In Canada's Alberta province, discussions about national unity and potential separation from Canada have gained momentum, fueled by concerns over Liberal rule and comparisons to the United States. Some Albertans express interest in either greater autonomy within Canada or even joining the US, driven by cultural similarities and economic interests. While outright separation remains unlikely, the sentiment reflects a broader sense of western alienation, with many feeling overlooked by politicians in Ottawa. The upcoming federal election and the policies of the next prime minister will significantly impact Alberta's relationship with the rest of Canada.</p>

Poilievre, known for his confrontational style, advocates for a low-tax, small government approach.

Trump views the tariff talks with Japan as a priority and a test case for other countries seeking relief from U.S. tariffs.

          <p>The Justice Department has revoked a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, now allowing authorities to use subpoenas and compel testimony from reporters. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the need to stop federal government employees from intentionally leaking sensitive information to the media. The DOJ's policy allows for subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to get information and testimony from journalists, with approval from DOJ leadership and advance notice to journalists. This marks a shift back to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations.</p>

The new sequence will be three numerals followed by three letters and one numeral (e.g., "000AAA0"). The state is running out of its 1980s-era sequence earlier than expected, partly due to an increase in new car registrations driven by fears of price hikes related to the Trump administration's tariffs. Despite the initial surge, overall new vehicle registrations are projected to decrease slightly for the year.</p>
