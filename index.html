        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of people in Spain, Portugal, and parts of France experienced power outages due to a "severe disruption" in the European electrical system. The Spanish government convened an emergency crisis meeting, and Red Eléctrica, the Spanish electricity grid operator, worked to restore power. Airports faced delays, and the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended. Electricity was restored in some regions within hours, but authorities continued investigating the cause of the disruption and urged people to stay home to avoid circulation. The outage caused widespread disruptions, affecting transportation, communication, and daily life across the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. Optimism is tempered as the full scope of the disruption is still being assessed.</p>

          <p>A Senate report alleges that Elon Musk used his influence to help his companies avoid over $2 billion in legal liabilities. The report claims that Musk's companies faced numerous regulatory actions totaling billions of dollars in potential liability before the Trump administration. Democrats accuse Musk of using his influence to evade oversight and derail investigations, while the White House rejects these claims. The report has prompted inquiries into the separation of Musk's government work from federal probes, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Apollo Global Management predicts a recession this summer due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The firm's chief economist, Torsten Slok, presented a timeline showing potential impacts like empty shelves and trucking layoffs. The administration has paused some tariffs but increased duties on China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the tariff standoff is "unsustainable." The analysis suggests that consumers could start noticing trade-related shortages next month, leading to layoffs and a recession in the summer of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

The booking photos do not bear the names of the individuals in the photos, but a White House X account posted photos that included names. The administration is highlighting its aggressive immigration enforcement measures to mark Mr. Trump's nearly 100 days as president. The White House has been criticized for its handling of some migrant arrests and deportations, particularly after invoking wartime authorities to deport immigrants suspected of being gang members to an El Salvador prison without due process.</p>

          <p>Starbucks' expansion in China is faltering due to fierce local competition, consumer belt-tightening, and rising anti-American sentiment fueled by the intensifying trade war. China revenue has declined significantly despite new store openings, and same-store sales have fallen for four consecutive quarters. Chinese consumers are increasingly favoring local brands like Luckin Coffee, which offer cheaper deals. Analysts suggest Starbucks should either pull back, leave China altogether, or find a Chinese business partner to reclaim its premium brand identity. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long SBUX.)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have seen the worst stock market performance for the start of a president's term since the 1970s. The S&P 500's 7.9% drop is the second worst first 100-day performance since Richard Nixon's second term. Investors initially showed confidence following Trump's election, but the market has since declined due to concerns about his aggressive trade policies and potential for recession. The market experienced a significant drop following Trump's 'reciprocal' tariff announcement, causing investor anxiety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors have continued to withdraw money from ESG (environmental, social, and governance) funds in early 2025, driven by an 'intensifying' backlash fueled by President Trump's 'anti-climate agenda' and policies targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion. ESG funds allow investors to align their investments with values like climate change or corporate diversity. The exodus in Q1 marked the 10th consecutive quarter of outflows. The continued loss of appetite among US investors for sustainable funds can be partly attributed to an anti-ESG backlash, which has intensified since the return of President Trump to the White House.</p>

The bank’s analysis suggests that there has been a marked cessation of foreign investor inflow into U.S. bond and equity markets over the last two months, which could present a challenge to the U.S. dollar, given the country’s twin deficits.

          <p>As Canadians vote today in a national election dominated by Donald Trump and tariffs, POTUS this morning once again urged the Great North to join America, and oddly put himself on the ballot. Trump took to his Truth Social Monday to urge Canadians to give up their sovereignty. With the resignation of longtime Trump foil Justin Trudeau earlier this year and global banker Mark Carney taking on the PM job, the double-digit tariffs and annexation huffing and puffing flipped what looked like a slam dunk win for the Conservatives and their Trump-lite leader Pierre Poilievre into a surge of national unity and a likely fourth consecutive term for the once politically DOA Liberals.</p>

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Rep. Mike Levin, D-Calif., sent a letter on Monday, signed by a group of 23 other Democrats, to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, calling for a commitment from all senior White House and executive branch employees to "expeditiously" transmit all reports related to their securities transactions since the start of Trump's term to the Office of Government Ethics, requesting, too, that all of this mandatory reporting be made public.</p>
