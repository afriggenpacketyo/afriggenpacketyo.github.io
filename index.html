          <p>A UN commission of inquiry has concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, citing acts like killing, causing serious harm, and preventing births. The report, which also accuses Israeli leaders of incitement, has been vehemently rejected by Israel as "distorted and false." The findings contribute to growing international condemnation of Israel's military conduct, which Israel defends as necessary for self-defense and the release of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit, an event Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government hopes will provide a distraction from its domestic challenges. Starmer is facing low approval ratings and internal party dissent, making the pageantry and potential for new trade deals with the U.S. particularly timely. The visit will feature royal ceremonies and bilateral meetings focused on strengthening the "special relationship," particularly concerning technology, energy, and trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to mitigate diplomatic and economic fallout following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai and LG battery plant in Georgia. The raid, which resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, prompted backlash from South Korea and raised fears it could deter foreign investment in U.S. manufacturing. President Trump has since stated that skilled foreign workers are welcome to train the domestic workforce, and officials are reportedly establishing a new visa working group with Seoul to address concerns.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated a $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times, accusing the newspaper of defamation and libel. In a social media post, Trump labeled the publication a "mouthpiece" for the Democratic party and alleged it has published false statements about him and his business. This legal action follows a series of similar defamation suits Trump has filed against other media organizations, including a recent threat against the Times for its reporting on a note linked to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data and the government's "triple lock" commitment. This policy ensures the pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. The expected increase would raise the new flat-rate state pension by over £500 a year, though concerns are growing that rising payments combined with frozen tax thresholds will pull more pensioners into paying income tax.

          <h2>Mao Zedong's Rhetoric Inspired Naming of China's Ballistic Missiles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The names of many of China's missiles, including the "Dongfeng" (East Wind) series, were inspired by the words of Mao Zedong. The name "Dongfeng" originates from a 1957 speech in which Mao declared, "Either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind," symbolizing the struggle between communism and capitalism. This reflects a tradition of embedding political and historical significance into the nomenclature of the country's military hardware.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are considering how to best utilize two-way star Shohei Ohtani's pitching abilities in the upcoming playoffs, with a hybrid starter-reliever role remaining a possibility. While the team plans to use him primarily as a starting pitcher, officials acknowledge that unforeseen circumstances in October could see him used out of the bullpen in high-leverage situations. This strategic flexibility is complicated by MLB's two-way player rules, which would cause the Dodgers to lose their designated hitter if Ohtani enters a game as a reliever.</p>
