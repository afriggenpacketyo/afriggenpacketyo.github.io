The article also mentions that Wall Street has raised concerns about Meta's heavy spending, especially with the potential impact of President Trump's new tariffs on the cost of devices.

          <p>The first 100 days of the Trump administration have been marked by significant financial market volatility, triggered by the chaotic rollout of sweeping tariffs. The S&P 500 experienced its worst start to a presidential term since 1974, with over $6.5 trillion wiped from public companies' value. The announcement of tariffs on April 2 caused a sharp market downturn, comparable to the sell-offs during the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis. While the market has since stabilized, investors remain concerned about the potential impact of tariffs on economic growth and the stability of the U.S. financial system. The article also mentions that investors rushed to protect their portfolios from further losses.</p>

          <p>President Trump's relationship with Vladimir Putin continues to be a subject of scrutiny, with questions arising about whether Trump will ever truly stand up to the Russian leader. Despite some recent displays of anger towards Moscow, Trump has often sided with Putin and pursued policies that benefit Russia. The article explores potential actions Trump could take to pressure Putin, including sanctions and increased weapons shipments to Ukraine, but notes the lack of consensus within the administration. Trump's history with Putin and his willingness to appease Russian demands raise concerns about the future of U.S.-Russia relations.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has appointed Hussein al-Sheikh as deputy to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, paving the way for a generational change.

          <p>A new analysis by Zillow reveals that starter homes now cost $1 million or more in 233 U.S. cities, nearly triple the number from five years ago. This trend, driven by a longstanding housing shortage and rising home prices, has spread beyond high-cost metro areas. The pressure on first-time buyers has been building for years, exacerbated by rising mortgage rates, insurance premiums, and homeowners association fees. As a result, the median age of a first-time buyer has reached a record high, while their share of home purchases has fallen to an all-time low.</p>
