          <h2>Met Police Chief Expresses Concern Over Planned Palestine Action Protest</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief has voiced his concerns about a planned protest in London in support of Palestine Action, following an incident where activists broke into RAF Brize Norton. Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley described Palestine Action as an "organised extremist criminal group" and expressed frustration that the Met lacks the legal power to prevent the protest before the group is officially proscribed. The protest is supported by 35 groups and will be subject to Public Order Act conditions, limiting its time and location to prevent disruption. Some welcome the move to ban Palestine Action while others, including Amnesty International UK, are deeply concerned at the use of counter-terrorism powers to target protests.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, resulted in at least five deaths and multiple injuries, with emergency crews working to rescue people trapped in a collapsed apartment building. The attack also caused damage to residential areas, hospitals, and sports infrastructure across Kyiv, with the most severe impact in the Shevchenkivskyi district. This strike follows a previous attack on Kyiv last week that killed 28 people, prompting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to call it one of the war's biggest bombardments. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Putin had no plans to speak again with Mr. Trump in the wake of the U.S. strikes on Iran.</p>

          <p>Representative Jim Himes, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, characterized President Trump's strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities as a "massive gamble." Himes expressed concern that the strikes were undertaken without Congressional approval and cautioned against premature celebration, citing historical precedents of U.S. military interventions in the Middle East. He outlined a worst-case scenario involving potential Iranian retaliation and the continued development of nuclear weapons.

          <p>Iran's parliament has reportedly approved a measure to potentially block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transit, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts suggest this move could alienate Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. The decision now rests with Iran's national security council, raising concerns about higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions. Analysts suggest that Iran risks significant self-inflicted harm by disrupting oil flows, potentially provoking a strong response and endangering its own oil infrastructure (not investment advice).</p>

The trial has presented text messages between Diddy's exes and KK, suggesting her deep involvement in the situation.

          <p>Ukraine reports that at least seven people were killed in overnight Russian strikes on Kyiv, with over 350 drones and 16 missiles launched at Ukrainian territory. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the attacks included 159 Russian-Iranian Shahed drones and preliminary reports indicate the use of ballistic weapons from North Korea. Ukrainian defense forces repelled the air attack, but the strikes caused significant damage and casualties. The attacks reportedly began on Sunday evening and targeted the city of Kyiv.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are set to pledge increased defense spending at their annual summit, driven by pressure from the U.S. to reach 5% of GDP. This target includes 3.5% for "pure" defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, such as cyber warfare capabilities and intelligence. While some members support this goal, others struggle to meet the existing 2% threshold, leading to potential clashes over the specifics of the pledges. The summit is considered crucial given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the destabilizing effects of the Middle East war on the global economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite being the most sanctioned nation on Earth since its invasion of Ukraine, Russia's economy has shown remarkable resilience.

However, challenges such as high inflation, rising interest rates, and worker shortages are emerging, leading to concerns about stagnation.
