          <p>The tightening New Jersey governor's race is drawing national attention, with the state's Latino voters emerging as a potentially decisive demographic. Following former President Trump's inroads with this group in 2024, both Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are heavily courting their support. While recent polling indicates Latino voter dissatisfaction with the national economy and Trump's performance, key issues like inflation and overall turnout will be critical in shaping the election's final outcome.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to continue cutting interest rates, financial experts are advising savers on the current landscape for certificates of deposit (CDs). Although the peak rates seen in recent years are no longer available, short-term CDs still offer significantly higher returns than traditional savings accounts, with some rates currently above 4%. The article suggests that savers interested in locking in these elevated rates should act proactively, as further Fed actions will likely cause returns on savings vehicles to decline.

          <p>Senators Adam Schiff and Tim Kaine are compelling a Senate vote on a war powers resolution aimed at limiting President Trump's authority to order military strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels. This action follows recent U.S. attacks on boats allegedly linked to a Venezuelan gang, which resulted in 21 fatalities and sparked constitutional concerns. The senators argue the strikes are illegal without congressional authorization and risk escalating into a wider conflict, though the resolution faces significant opposition from Republicans.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has announced a multi-billion dollar deal to supply AI graphics processing units (GPUs) to OpenAI, positioning itself as a serious competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip market. This agreement marks a significant step for AMD, which has been a distant second to Nvidia's near-monopoly on AI data center hardware. The partnership is seen as a crucial development for the industry, introducing much-needed competition and signaling that AMD's technology can meet the demands of large-scale AI deployments.

          <p>Former U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings argues that the decline in American student test scores, which began before the pandemic, is linked to a retreat from the accountability measures of No Child Left Behind. In an interview, she contends that relaxing testing requirements and consequences for failure has led to lower expectations and stagnant achievement. Spellings advocates for a return to standardized testing as a critical tool to diagnose problems, ensure educational equity, and reverse the downward trend in student performance.</p>

          <p>Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to repeal a law that allowed for a fast-tracked path to citizenship for immigrants who were deemed exceptionally well-integrated. The measure, introduced by the previous government, reduced the residency requirement from five years to three for qualified applicants. The repeal was a key campaign promise of the current ruling coalition, which argues that a German passport should be the final step of integration, not the beginning, a move critics say sends a negative signal to skilled immigrants.</p>

          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's persistent public attacks on James Comey could provide the former FBI director's defense team with a strong basis for a vindictive or selective prosecution claim. The president's comments, combined with the controversial appointment of a former Trump lawyer to lead the prosecutor's office, may undermine the case's legitimacy. These factors, along with reports of internal dissent among career prosecutors about bringing charges, will likely be central to Comey's motion to have the indictment dismissed.</p>
