        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is closely examining the legality of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify broad tariffs on U.S. trading partners. During arguments, judges expressed skepticism, noting the law doesn't mention tariffs and that the administration's interpretation could grant the president unbounded authority to alter congressionally set trade frameworks. The case, brought by several states and small businesses, represents a major legal challenge to the administration's economic policy, with the outcome likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court.

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with a long-held plan to build a new, large ballroom at the White House, with construction slated to begin in September. The project, estimated to cost $200 million, will be located in the East Wing and is designed to seat 650 guests, significantly larger than the current East Room. According to the White House, the cost will be covered by President Trump himself along with other private donors, fulfilling his desire for a grander event space than the tents often used for state dinners.</p>

This prevents them from owing more than the property is worth if the loan balance has grown past the home's value, providing financial predictability and a more manageable option for retaining a family asset.

          <p>Consumers may soon face higher prices for European wine, whisky, and other spirits as new U.S. tariffs are set to take effect on August 1.

Trade groups are lobbying for exemptions, warning that the tariffs will harm both European exporters and U.S. businesses, including restaurants that rely heavily on wine sales.
