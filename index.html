            <p>Officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo have corrected earlier reports regarding a fire on a motorized wooden boat. While initial reports suggested 148 fatalities, the updated figure stands at 33 deaths. Approximately 195 individuals survived the incident, with 22 receiving treatment for burn injuries at Wangata General Hospital. Authorities believe cooking activities onboard the overcrowded vessel ignited the blaze near Mbandaka, highlighting the risks of boat travel in the region due to limited infrastructure and safety measures.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has attributed the deaths of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month to an "operational misunderstanding." The investigation by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) cited a series of failures, also noting that the killing of a UN worker shortly after was deemed "a breach of orders during a combat setting." The deputy commander of the involved unit has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report. The incident occurred on March 23 near Rafah, involving a convoy of Palestinian Red Crescent Society ambulances, a UN car, and a fire truck.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans detained in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This order prevents their removal from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice, following an appeal from the ACLU. The ACLU argued that these individuals were at risk of being sent to a dangerous foreign prison without due process. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, claiming the court's intervention was premature. The White House maintains those detained are "foreign terrorists."</p>

            <p>Former Trump administration "Border Czar" Tom Homan defended the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, asserting he is an MS-13 member and a threat to public safety. Homan claimed the administration acted correctly in removing a violent gang member from the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return for a trial. Homan stated that the Trump administration lacks the authority to bring Abrego Garcia back, as he is now under El Salvador's jurisdiction. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.</p>

On April 17th, another pair of Typhoons intercepted an unknown aircraft leaving Kaliningrad airspace. These intercepts, part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, represent the RAF's first since arriving in the region to defend NATO's eastern flank alongside Sweden.</p>

Evangelical leaders emphasize that the phrase is a Christian expression of worship and cannot be used to spread antisemitism, reminding that there is no Christianity without Judaism.

            <p>Many rely on quirky metrics or government data to predict recessions, but these are often unreliable.

By monitoring these key players, one can gain a more accurate understanding of the economy's trajectory than by relying on sensationalized or outdated indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The author recounts a first date 30 years ago where she told a strange lie about driving a Land Rover. She reflects on the prevalence of dishonesty in dating and how it can stem from insecurity. While acknowledging that some dating lies are harmful, she argues that others are attempts at politeness or wishful thinking. Ultimately, the author's date found out about the lie years later but it didn't affect their relationship, suggesting that sometimes, honesty isn't always the best policy.</p>
