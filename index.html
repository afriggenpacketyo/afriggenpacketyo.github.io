          <p>Toyota's global sales experienced a 10% increase year-over-year in April, according to Kyodo News. This rise occurred amidst concerns about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The sales figures reflect strong demand in key markets, potentially driven by consumers anticipating higher prices due to the tariffs. Toyota's performance suggests resilience in the face of looming trade challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Due to raging wildfires, over 17,000 people are being evacuated in Manitoba, Canada, prompting the provincial government to declare a province-wide state of emergency. Premier Wab Kinew described this as the largest evacuation in "living memory" and has requested military assistance from Prime Minister Mark Carney. The evacuations include residents of Flin Flon and several remote Indigenous communities, with most evacuees being transported to Winnipeg. Wildfires in Alberta have also led to temporary shutdowns of oil and gas production, and the worst wildfire season in Canadian history occurred in 2023.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department is also revising visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong, causing anxiety on university campuses. This move comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, reminiscent of the first Trump administration's actions in 2020, which banned Chinese citizens with ties to military universities. Critics argue that this policy betrays American values and weakens U.S. leadership in science and innovation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which were unilaterally imposed on numerous countries to address trade imbalances. The court ruled that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize the president to levy universal duties on imports without congressional approval. Dow futures rose on the news, but the Trump administration has appealed the ruling. The White House argues that foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment has created a national emergency that has harmed American communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the 12-year sentence of Imaad Zuberi, a major political donor convicted of obstructing an investigation into Trump's 2017 inaugural committee and falsifying records related to lobbying work for Sri Lanka. Zuberi, who donated over $1.1 million to committees associated with Trump and the Republican Party, had previously been a supporter of the Democratic Party. The commutation was one of several made by Trump, including the commutation of Larry Hoover's sentence and the pardon of former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is contemplating sanctions on Israeli ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich due to concerns over the suffering of civilians in Gaza. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has been considering this proposal, initially floated by David Cameron, for months, but the recent shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some officials to hesitate. Britain is likely to assess whether Israel allows increased aid to Gaza before making a decision, and officials are also ambivalent about recognizing an independent Palestinian state. The debate has highlighted differences between the Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street.</p>

The trial has revealed a picture of Joshlin's troubled life and her mother's struggle with substance abuse, and the community remains shocked by the events.

          <p>Despite legal guarantees at national and EU levels, racial segregation persists in Slovakia's schools, with over 60% of Roma children attending schools where they are in the majority. Roma children are often separated into "Roma schools" or "Roma classes" with lower academic expectations and higher drop-out rates, and are frequently placed in schools for children with mental disabilities. While the Slovak government has introduced reforms, including a legal definition of segregation, these measures often reinforce the very segregation they claim to address.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. will "aggressively" revoke visas from Chinese students with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department will also enhance scrutiny for future applicants. This move could affect many of the approximately 280,000 Chinese students in the U.S. and strain the bilateral relationship, particularly amid trade tensions. This action is seen as another blow to the American higher education system, which relies on international students.</p>

          <p>An unsealed FBI intelligence memo offers insights into why the bureau believes some Venezuelan government officials are likely responsible for the actions of the gang Tren de Aragua in the United States. The memo states that some Venezuelan officials facilitate the migration of gang members to the U.S. to undermine public safety, but other intelligence agencies disagree with the FBI's assessment. The submission of the memo opens the door to greater scrutiny of the basis for Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.</p>
