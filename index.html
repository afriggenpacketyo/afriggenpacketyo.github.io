The dispute highlights a significant leadership upheaval at the CDC, following the departure of several other top health officials.

The company's data center business remains central to the global AI buildout, with its CFO anticipating $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Despite a slight miss in data center revenue estimates, net income increased significantly, and Nvidia's board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article proposes that focusing on China's fundamental needs, rather than its perceived wants, could help de-escalate the US-China rivalry. It argues that Beijing's foreign policy is largely driven by domestic stability, economic growth, and food and energy security, which are crucial for the Communist Party's legitimacy. The article suggests that understanding these constraints, such as the push for indigenous innovation and diversified energy, offers crucial leverage in international diplomacy. This perspective aims to reframe how the world interprets China's global behavior.</p>

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its most recent quarter, yet maintained its full-year forecast, citing ongoing tariff uncertainties. The retailer experienced a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, its highest growth in three years, driven by strong performance in mobile phones and video gaming. However, weaker sales in appliances and home theaters partially offset these gains. The article notes that while the company is confident about the year's second half, potential tariff impacts necessitate a cautious outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the University of Chicago reveals that climate-driven wildfires, exemplified by Canada's record-breaking season, are reversing decades of clean air progress in North America. The article highlights that particulate pollution, now exacerbated by these fires, remains the leading external threat to human life expectancy, comparable to smoking. Significant increases in particulate concentrations have been observed across Canada and several US states.
