          <p>Several decorated military veterans in the U.S. Congress have expressed outrage over reports of fellow veterans being arrested or injured by federal agents during protests. The incidents, including some outside an ICE facility in Chicago, have involved physical altercations and charges like assault and disorderly conduct. Lawmakers like Senator Tammy Duckworth and Representative Jason Crow are condemning the use of what they describe as excessive force against individuals peacefully exercising their right to protest, arguing the administration's justifications lack factual support. This situation has heightened concerns about government overreach and the treatment of those who have served the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Chinese loans have financed major infrastructure projects in Angola, including the construction of entire new cities like Nova Cidade de Kilamba, analysts remain cautious about the long-term costs. The city, built by Chinese companies through an oil-for-infrastructure deal, initially struggled with high prices and low occupancy until the Angolan government intervened to make it more accessible. This model highlights China's significant role in African development post-civil war. However, it also raises concerns about the sustainability of the debt incurred and the actual benefits for the local population.</p>

          <p>England achieved a decisive 65-run victory against New Zealand in their second T20 match, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. The win was powered by a formidable batting partnership between Phil Salt, who scored 85, and captain Harry Brook, who added a destructive 78. Their efforts propelled England to a total of 236-4, the highest T20 international score at Christchurch's Hagley Oval. New Zealand's chase fell short as they were bowled out for 171, with England's Adil Rashid taking four wickets.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Nottingham Forest is reportedly in advanced discussions to hire Sean Dyche as its new manager. The move follows the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou after a 3-0 defeat to Chelsea left the team in 18th place in the league table. Dyche, the former manager of Everton and Burnley, has emerged as the leading candidate for the position. The club hopes to finalize the appointment quickly to address its poor start to the season, having won only one of its first eight league games.</p>

          <p>A detailed report outlines the brazen daytime robbery at the Louvre Museum, where thieves stole priceless French crown jewels. The perpetrators used a vehicle-mounted lift to access a first-floor gallery, cut through glass, and made off with eight valuable items in a swift operation. The museum remained closed as a large-scale police investigation was launched, with authorities analyzing CCTV footage to track the suspects who fled on scooters. This article breaks down the methods used, the specific items stolen, and the security vulnerabilities that may have contributed to the heist's success.</p>

          <p>In her posthumously published memoir, "Nobody's Girl," Virginia Giuffre recounts her harrowing experiences within Jeffrey Epstein's circle, expressing fears that she might "die a sex slave." The book details sadistic abuse by Epstein and reiterates her allegations of having sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions, claims he has consistently denied. The memoir's release places further scrutiny on the Prince, who previously reached a financial settlement with Ms. Giuffre and has since stepped back from his royal duties. The contents describe a web of powerful individuals involved in the abuse of young women.</p>

This represents a significant shift in the government's rhetoric, openly acknowledging the economic downsides of the trade agreement.

          <p>This opinion article presents a deeply pessimistic view of modern England, arguing that the nation's traditional culture and values have been eroded and lost. The author describes a recent visit where historical sites felt like relics of a dead civilization, citing a terror attack, pro-Palestinian protests, and what is described as a rise in antisemitism as evidence of decline. The piece contends that mass immigration has imported conflicting values and that the government is failing to defend British identity. The author concludes by presenting England's situation as a cautionary tale for the United States, suggesting America is on a similar path.</p>

          <p>A report from the Office of Inspector General for Health and Human Services reveals that private insurers running Medicare Advantage and Medicaid plans often list mental health professionals who are not actually available to patients. These "ghost networks" include practitioners who are retired, not accepting new patients, or do not have contracts with the plans, creating significant barriers to care. The investigation found that 55% of listed mental health professionals in Medicare Advantage plans were not providing care to members. This misrepresentation means taxpayers are not receiving the value of the services they fund and vulnerable patients struggle to find necessary mental healthcare.</p>

          <p>Following a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump has signaled a significant shift in his approach to the war, suggesting Ukraine should accept Russia's terms. Trump reportedly advised Zelenskyy to cede the Donbas region to end the conflict, warning that Russian President Putin would otherwise "destroy" Ukraine. The meeting was described as a "shouting match," and Trump later publicly stated that the fighting should stop at the current battle lines.

          <p>A new study has found that revised medical advice from 2015, which recommends introducing peanut products to infants as early as four months, has successfully prevented an estimated 60,000 cases of peanut allergies. This guidance reversed decades of previous recommendations to delay feeding allergenic foods to young children. Research published in the journal Pediatrics analyzed health records and found a significant decline in peanut allergy diagnoses among young children after the guidelines were implemented. The findings provide real-world evidence that early introduction is an effective public health strategy for reducing the prevalence of this life-threatening allergy.</p>

          <p>Early sales data indicates that Apple's new iPhone 17 is selling better than its predecessor, with a 14% increase in sales across the U.S. and China during its initial launch period. According to market analyst firm Counterpoint, the standard iPhone 17 model is seeing particularly high demand, attributed to its improved display, increased storage, and the upgraded A19 chip. In China, sales of the base model have nearly doubled compared to the iPhone 16. The high-end iPhone 17 Pro Max is also reportedly experiencing strong demand, especially in the United States.</p>

          <p>Amid economic challenges across the European Union, Poland has consistently demonstrated robust growth, positioning itself as a hidden success story. With a GDP growth rate of nearly 3% in 2024, it significantly outpaced larger economies like Germany and France, a trend expected to continue. Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland's economy has doubled, driven by strong domestic consumption, a well-educated workforce, and effective use of EU infrastructure funding. Despite political divisions and fiscal pressures from increased welfare and defense spending, the country's dynamic performance has made it a model of successful economic integration.

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside the U.S. could severely impact the global film industry, with Britain's sector facing a particularly heavy blow. The UK film and TV industry contributes significantly to the economy but is heavily dependent on investment from U.S. studios, which accounted for 65% of production spending last year. Industry leaders and politicians express concern that such a tariff would cripple British filmmaking, which already faces challenges from post-pandemic recovery and streaming competition. The threat has prompted calls for the UK government to address the issue in trade discussions with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Satellite imagery reveals the construction of a new airstrip on Zuqar Island in the Red Sea, a strategic location off the coast of Yemen. The project is likely being undertaken by forces allied against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, possibly with support from the United Arab Emirates, which has funded similar projects in the region. The airstrip could enhance aerial surveillance and support efforts to counter Houthi smuggling activities, particularly of weapons. This development comes as anti-Houthi forces have recently increased interdictions of cargo bound for the rebels, who continue to attack international shipping.</p>

          <p>Following reports of potentially avoidable harm to babies and mothers, the UK Health Secretary has announced an independent inquiry into "repeated failures" at the maternity units of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. A BBC investigation had previously revealed that dozens of deaths over the past five years may have been preventable. The inquiry aims to understand what went "catastrophically wrong" at the trust, where inspectors recently highlighted a "blame culture" and downgraded the services to "inadequate." Bereaved families who campaigned for the investigation hope it will provide answers and lead to accountability and lasting improvements.</p>

          <p>Centrist senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential runoff election, defeating former right-wing president Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga. Preliminary results show Paz securing 54% of the vote, marking a significant political shift after two decades of rule by the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Paz's victory was fueled by voter frustration with a severe economic crisis, including a U.S. dollar shortage and soaring inflation. His campaign, bolstered by a popular anti-corruption running mate, appealed to voters who were disillusioned with the ruling party but wary of his rival's more radical free-market proposals.</p>

The policy grants planning permission in rural areas for zero-carbon buildings, provided residents can generate income from the land and be self-sufficient in energy and water. The couple's life, from their food sources to their transportation, will be monitored for five years to ensure compliance. Their project, built using reclaimed materials and trees from their own forest, aims to challenge perceptions of sustainable living.</p>

          <p>A growing number of aspiring medical students from the UK are opting to study in Eastern European countries like Bulgaria due to a strict cap on university places at home. Despite the UK government's goal to train more doctors, intense competition for limited spots means many qualified applicants are rejected. Universities in cities like Plovdiv offer English-language medical degrees that are recognized by the UK's General Medical Council, attracting a large contingent of British students. This trend highlights the challenges within the UK's medical education system and the globalized nature of professional training.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has estimated that it loses approximately £45.5 million in revenue each year due to passengers traveling without a valid ticket. According to data released following a Freedom of Information request, the rate of ticketless travel on its network is about 3.9%. The rail operator, which serves London and several southern English counties, stated its revenue protection teams are focused on deterring fare evasion. While the company claims the rate is at its lowest level ever, the figure highlights a significant financial challenge for the rail industry.</p>
