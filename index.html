          <p>Across the United States, demonstrators participated in "Hands Off" rallies to voice their opposition to the Trump administration and Elon Musk's involvement in federal policies. These protests, numbering over 1,300, addressed a range of issues from cuts to education and healthcare to concerns about Social Security and veterans' benefits. Participants expressed frustration over perceived threats to human rights and democracy, with many feeling compelled to take action due to emerging concerns. Veterans also participated, viewing their involvement as a continuation of their oath to protect Americans from both foreign and domestic threats.</p>

          <p>The United States has revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and is preventing new arrivals, citing South Sudan's failure to accept its nationals being deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that this action was necessary because the South Sudanese government was "taking advantage of the United States." This measure, the first of its kind since Donald Trump's return to the White House, underscores the administration's strict stance on immigration and deportation. The decision comes amid growing concerns about political tensions and potential civil war in South Sudan.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing to launch a consultation for its men's health strategy, addressing the fact that men are more likely to die prematurely than women. Factors contributing to this include higher rates of smoking, alcohol and drug use, and reluctance to engage with health services. Experts emphasize the need to address societal expectations of men and the impact of deprivation, advocating for interventions like paid time off for health checks and accessible services in blue-collar workplaces. The strategy also aims to improve mental health support for men, who are disproportionately affected by suicide.</p>

          <p>A woman died from cervical cancer after the NHS misreported her screening results, leading to a settlement with her family. Two tests, conducted four years apart, were incorrectly reported as negative, denying her the opportunity for early treatment.

          <p>Mark Cuban, Dallas Mavericks minority owner, weighed in on the debate surrounding transgender athletes in women's sports, suggesting that trans inclusion should not be "pushed down people's throats." He proposed allowing individual athletes or teams to decide whether they want to compete against transgender athletes. Cuban, while a supporter of Democratic politicians, aligns with a growing number of left-leaning figures who have expressed reservations about the Democratic Party's stance on trans athlete inclusion. Recent polls indicate that a majority of Americans, including many Democrats, believe transgender athletes should not compete in women's sports.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports is being criticized as a move away from globalization, with potentially messy consequences. Experts argue that these "reciprocal" tariffs, calculated based on trade deficits, disregard fundamental economic principles and could harm American consumers and businesses. The move has sparked concerns about a global trade war, with the potential for retaliatory measures and new alliances that exclude the US. While some hope these policies will bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, others warn of increased inflation and a possible recession.</p>

Protestors carried signs expressing opposition to Trump's policies and Elon Musk's involvement in government. The protests aimed to signal widespread opposition to the administration's actions and inspire others to take action.</p>

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump that was publicly criticized by the president, says her business is "in danger of not recovering." Trump called the portrait "truly the worst" and claimed it was "purposefully distorted." Boardman says she feels her intentions, integrity, and abilities have been "called into question" and that the criticism has negatively impacted her business of over 41 years. The portrait has been removed from Colorado's State Capitol following the president's comments.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has acknowledged that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza, but alleges some were linked to Hamas. The army initially claimed that troops opened fire because the convoy approached "suspiciously" in darkness without headlights or flashing lights. Video footage, however, shows the vehicles were clearly marked and had their lights on. The IDF insists at least six of the medics were linked to Hamas, but has not provided evidence, promising a "thorough examination" of the incident.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student activist facing deportation, has accused the university of suppressing student dissent over Israel's war in Gaza and laying "the groundwork for my abduction." Khalil, a green-card holder, is being detained under a provision that permits the deportation of non-citizens considered a threat to US foreign policy. He alleges that Columbia has bowed to pressure from Congress to crack down on antisemitism and broadly categorized anti-Israel sentiment as hate speech. Khalil urges students to continue their protest efforts and reclaim the university.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has placed an attorney on indefinite paid leave after he struggled to defend the government's position in a case involving a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The government is seeking to appeal a judge's order to facilitate the return of the deported man. In the hearing, the attorney was unable to answer questions about the authority under which the man was seized and deported, leading to his suspension for "failure to zealously advocate" for the government's interests.</p>
