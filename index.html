        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's opposition candidate Lee Jae-myung secured a decisive victory in the presidential election, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, whose term was marred by political turmoil and impeachment. Lee's win reflects a public rejection of the ruling People Power Party (PPP), which was implicated in Yoon's controversial martial law order. Lee aims to prioritize restoring South Korea's democracy and uniting a polarized nation. He faces immediate challenges, including navigating trade negotiations with the U.S. and addressing pending legal trials, but his victory signals a potential shift towards greater stability in South Korean politics. The political climate remains tense, with a strong base of Yoon supporters likely to challenge Lee's efforts at reconciliation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, both prominent cybersecurity firms, are valued differently by Wall Street due to their growth potential and business models. CrowdStrike's higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio reflects investor expectations of faster growth, driven by its software subscription model, which yields higher margins. Palo Alto Networks, with a mix of hardware and software, is seen as a more cyclical investment, resulting in a lower P/E ratio. Despite both stocks being expensive by PEG ratio standards, their leadership positions in the cybersecurity sector justify a premium. Jim Cramer holds both companies in his portfolio, viewing them as long-term investments in a mission-critical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy is contemplating renaming several naval ships, including the USNS Harvey Milk, named after the gay rights leader and Navy veteran. This proposal aligns with the Trump administration's aim to "reestablish the warrior culture" within the military. The documents obtained by CBS News also list other vessels, including the USNS Thurgood Marshall and USNS Harriet Tubman, as being considered for renaming. This decision has sparked controversy, with Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi criticizing the move as a "shameful, vindictive erasure" of those who fought for equality. The renaming of naval ships is rare, especially after they have entered service, making this consideration particularly noteworthy.</p>

Musk expressed disappointment with the bill's impact on the deficit and the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded by stating that President Trump is aware of Musk's stance, but maintains his support for the bill. Several Republican senators, including Rand Paul and Ron Johnson, echoed Musk's concerns, calling for improvements to the legislation.

          <p>The White House is defending President Trump's endorsed "big, beautiful bill" after Elon Musk, who recently left his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), criticized it as a "disgusting abomination." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the president is aware of Musk's opposition but remains committed to the bill. Musk had previously expressed disappointment with the bill, arguing that it undermines the cost-cutting efforts of his DOGE team. Despite Musk's criticism, Trump emphasized the need to secure votes for the bill, highlighting the importance of bipartisan support. The bill has faced opposition from some Republicans due to concerns about spending cuts and the rising national debt.</p>

Baritone Quinn Kelsey delivers a gripping performance as Rigoletto, supported by James Conlon's conducting, which brings humanity to the character's anger. Despite some shortcomings in the set design, the strength of the cast and Conlon's direction save the production, marking a step forward for L.A. Opera's interpretation of the opera.</p>

          <p>Five police officers were killed in an ambush by an armed group in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, near the border with Guatemala. The officers were on patrol in the town of Frontera Comalapa when they were attacked, and their patrol vehicle was set on fire. The local Security Secretariat has deployed over 1,000 officers to secure the area and arrested a suspect found near the crime scene with an AK-47 rifle. Chiapas has been experiencing a turf war between the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco New Generation cartel, making it a major smuggling hub for drugs and migrants.</p>

          <p>With forecasts predicting above-normal temperatures this summer, Americans are expected to increase their air conditioner usage, leading to higher electricity bills. Home electricity bills are projected to reach a 12-year high, impacting lower-income households the most. Experts recommend using fans, regularly changing AC filters, and setting AC temperatures between 70°F and 78°F to conserve energy. Additional tips include using indoor plants for shade, keeping curtains closed, and unplugging unused appliances. Utility companies and state governments offer programs and financial assistance to help manage energy costs, and long-term investments like improved insulation and smart thermostats can provide lasting savings.</p>

Cooper initiated the review in January, asking all police forces in England and Wales to re-evaluate historic gang exploitation cases where 'No Further Action' was taken.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from obtaining work permits, potentially altering long-standing U.S. immigration policy. The proposed rule would suspend the issuance of new work permits until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, a timeframe deemed difficult to meet given current backlogs. Even if the processing average is achieved, asylum-seekers would be required to wait one year after filing their application to be eligible for a work permit. Advocates argue that the change could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and drive them to work illegally. The Department of Homeland Security stated it is exploring options to protect national security and increase program integrity.</p>

The BBC proved that an MI5 officer had confirmed the agent's status while trying to dissuade the investigation.

The bill proposes "bone-breaking sanctions" on Putin and a 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian oil, potentially targeting China and India. While the bill's fate depends on Trump's approval, his recent criticism of Putin has emboldened some Republicans to speak out on the conflict, with Graham leading the charge.</p>
