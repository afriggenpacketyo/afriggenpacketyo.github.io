          <p>An arrest has been made in the double homicide of "American Idol" music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Tom Deluca. The couple was found shot to death in their Encino, California home during a wellness check conducted by the Los Angeles Police Department. While police have not yet officially identified the victims, a spokesperson for "American Idol" confirmed their passing and mourned the loss of Kaye, who had been with the show since 2009. The investigation is ongoing, and authorities have not released details about the suspect or a potential motive.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, about half of the total deployed. The troops were federalized over a month ago to respond to protests, a move contested by Governor Gavin Newsom who sued the administration, calling it an illegal power grab. The Pentagon stated the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding," but Newsom is calling for the remaining troops to be returned to state control, arguing they are being used as "political pawns." The deployment was initially justified to protect federal immigration agents and property amid protests.</p>

          <p>A method used by some bartenders to discreetly inform patrons they will no longer be served alcohol has generated a viral debate online. The practice involves handing customers a small printed card stating they have been "cut off" and should leave quietly, a technique intended to avoid public embarrassment. While some social media users and bar staff praise the discreetness, others criticize the approach as potentially confrontational or insufficient, arguing it fails to ensure the intoxicated person gets home safely. The debate highlights differing opinions on responsibility and communication in serving alcohol.</p>

          <p>TV chef Si King, one half of the Hairy Bikers, has made his first visit to the site of the felled Sycamore Gap tree, an event he described as a "personal" and "mindless" act of vandalism. King, who is from the region, had avoided the site since the iconic tree was illegally cut down in September 2023, stating he was too angry and overwhelmed. In a BBC documentary, he described the tree as a "sentinel of time" and a special place he would have visited to reflect on the recent death of his co-star and friend, Dave Myers. The visit highlighted the deep emotional connection many people had to the landmark.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Michael Bernard Bell for the 1993 murders of two people outside a bar in what was an attempted revenge killing. This marks the 26th execution in the United States this year, a figure that already surpasses the total for all of 2024 and is the highest annual count since 2018. Bell's execution is the eighth in Florida in 2025, making it the most active state in carrying out capital punishment this year. The U.S. Supreme Court denied a final request to stay the execution, which was based on arguments of newly discovered evidence.</p>

          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. Commissioned by the Health Secretary, the review also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns and high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The review found that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to confusion and inconsistent use within the NHS.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL) and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), has reintroduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill known as the DIGNITY Act. The legislation proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also aims to increase border security funding, reform the asylum system, and protect sensitive locations like schools from enforcement actions. This reintroduction occurs as the Trump administration's mass deportation program faces legal and public challenges.</p>

The project will address the toll that the internal hot and humid conditions have taken on the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure. The extensive makeover involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing rusted ironwork, and temporarily relocating 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to upgrade the heating systems to make the iconic Victorian glasshouse a net-zero emissions building.</p>

Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family has fought for a retrial, arguing his actions were a patriotic effort to restore democracy, not a self-serving coup. For decades, Kim has been a polarizing figure, viewed as either a traitor or a hero who ended 18 years of authoritarian rule. The retrial, granted based on evidence of torture during the original investigation, revisits a pivotal moment in South Korean history and forces a re-examination of both Kim's motives and Park's legacy.</p>

          <h2>LAPD Officer-Involved Shootings Rise Sharply in 2025</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department has seen a significant increase in officer-involved shootings this year, with 25 incidents so far nearly matching the total for all of 2024. This represents the highest number of shootings by this point in the year since 2018, occurring even as the city's overall violent crime rate has been dropping. LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell attributed the rise in part to more encounters with armed suspects, including those with replica firearms. The trend, which includes a recent cluster of four shootings in two weeks, has been called "troubling" by an oversight official.</p>

          <p>At an energy and AI summit in Pittsburgh, Westinghouse's interim CEO informed President Trump of the company's plan to build 10 new large AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States. The company aims to begin construction by 2030, with each reactor capable of powering over 750,000 homes. This major infrastructure plan aligns with the Trump administration's goal to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The announcement comes after the only two new U.S. reactors built in the last 30 years, also Westinghouse AP1000s, were completed years behind schedule and billions over budget.

          <p>'Andor' showrunner Tony Gilroy described working on the 'Star Wars' prequel series as the 'seminal creative experience' of his life following the show's 14 Emmy nominations. The critically acclaimed political spy thriller was recognized in major categories, including outstanding drama series, writing, and directing. In an interview, Gilroy reflected on the show's success and the 'spooky' experience of seeing real-world political events parallel the show's depiction of a rising rebellion against an authoritarian empire. He expressed pride in the team's work and the sense of community built during the production of the series.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration is actively dismantling the federal government's ability to respond to disasters, with FEMA's recent struggles in Texas serving as a key example. The article points to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's previous statement about "eliminating FEMA" and the administration's broader actions, such as cutting climate change research and canceling infrastructure grant programs. The critique asserts that the administration is gutting disaster preparedness without investing in the state and local capabilities needed to fill the void, potentially leaving Americans more vulnerable to extreme weather events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is signaling a significant policy shift toward Russia by working with NATO allies to send more advanced weaponry to Ukraine, including 17 additional Patriot missile systems. The move follows President Trump's increased frustration with Vladimir Putin and a threat of severe sanctions if Russia does not negotiate an end to the war. A Pentagon official confirmed that previously paused U.S. armaments, including Patriot and Hellfire missiles, are now flowing into Ukraine. This increased military support is seen by officials like Senator Richard Blumenthal as a 'remarkable shift' designed to increase pressure on Moscow.</p>

Musallet was visiting family and was killed while trying to protect their farm from attackers; another Palestinian man was also killed in the incident. His family condemned what they see as U.S. government indifference to the murder of one of its citizens.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has inadvertently breached parliamentary rules by failing to declare gifts within the required 28-day period, a parliamentary watchdog has concluded. Reeves had referred herself for investigation after realizing that tickets she received from the National Theatre were registered on the list for government ministers but not on the separate register for Members of Parliament. The standards commissioner noted the breach was inadvertent but stated it should have been avoided. Reeves apologized, accepted the finding, and said she has put new procedures in place to prevent future errors.</p>

          <p>A man from Florida has filed a lawsuit against Harrah’s Cherokee Casino in North Carolina, alleging the establishment withheld his winnings of over $500,000 and then banned him for life. The plaintiff, Emmanuel Kromah, claims he placed a $143,000 bet that the Boston Celtics would win the NBA Championship. When he went to collect his payout after their victory, he was allegedly escorted out by security instead. While the casino eventually paid him 10 days later, they also issued a lifetime ban from all their properties, prompting Kromah to sue for damages.</p>

          <p>UK counter-terrorism police have issued a warning that hostile states like Russia, Iran, and China are increasingly recruiting vulnerable individuals, including teenagers and petty criminals, to act as proxies on British soil. This activity, which can involve sabotage and targeted violence, now constitutes about 20% of their workload, a five-fold increase since 2018. Commanders urged parents and teachers to be vigilant for signs of manipulation, as young people might be lured online with money without understanding the severe implications. The warning follows a recent case where criminals were convicted in an arson attack ordered by Russia's Wagner group.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the situation in Afghanistan has improved, but the court's ruling provides a one-week pause while it considers the case. Advocacy groups praised the decision, stating that TPS is a vital lifeline for Afghans who fled the Taliban, and that ending it would be a betrayal. The White House criticized the ruling as judicial overreach, asserting that TPS was never meant to be a permanent program.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of catastrophic flash flooding in Texas, authorities in Kerr County are planning to drain at least one flood-swollen lake along the Guadalupe River. The search continues for approximately 100 people who are still missing after the July 4th disaster. Officials believe that debris, and potentially the remains of some of the missing, were washed into the dammed reservoirs. Dive teams and sonar have already found large objects, such as trailers, buried under feet of water, indicating the scale of the challenge. This complex effort is seen as a necessary step to locate the missing.</p>
