          <p>While clearing their yard, a couple in New Orleans unearthed a marble slab that was later identified as a 1,900-year-old Roman tombstone. The relic, dedicated to a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus, is believed to have been missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, since it was destroyed during World War II. After consulting with university experts, the couple turned the artifact over to the FBI's art crime team to facilitate its repatriation. The discovery has prompted an investigation into how the ancient grave marker traveled from Italy to a Louisiana backyard, with speculation that it may have been taken by a soldier after the war.</p>

          <p>UEFA has announced its opposition to domestic league matches being played abroad but has permitted two games to proceed on an "exceptional basis," a decision critics are calling a turning point for European soccer. A La Liga match between Barcelona and Villarreal will be held in Miami, while a Serie A game between Milan and Como will take place in Perth, Australia. The move follows a lawsuit from promoter Relevent Sports, which challenged FIFA's rules against such games. Opponents, including Real Madrid and fan associations, argue this decision compromises the integrity of domestic competitions and sets a dangerous precedent, prioritizing revenue over sporting tradition and fan accessibility.</p>

          <p>As Israel marks the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas-led attack, there is a glimmer of hope for an end to the ensuing two-year war that has devastated Gaza. The conflict has resulted in over 67,000 Palestinian deaths and widespread destruction, leaving the population facing famine amid Israeli border controls. Despite the grim milestone, ongoing peace talks mediated by the U.S. and Arab nations are pushing both Israeli and Hamas leaders toward a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal. For civilians on both sides, the anniversary is a somber reflection on immense loss, but also a moment of desperate hope for lasting peace and rebuilding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's push to deploy the National Guard to cities like Chicago and Portland is facing legal battles, as states argue the administration is overstepping its authority. The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block the deployment, contending that the circumstances do not meet the legal requirements under Title 10, a rarely used statute that allows the president to federalize the Guard. Legal experts note this move tests the limits of presidential power, as domestic deployment typically requires state consent, except in extreme cases of insurrection. While a judge in Oregon temporarily blocked a similar deployment, a judge in Illinois has allowed the administration more time to respond.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly canceled a series of long-running federal surveys, known as the high school longitudinal studies, which have collected data on students for over 50 years. This data has been instrumental for researchers and policymakers in understanding educational trends, from the benefits of career training to the impact of early algebra on college completion. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) terminated the multimillion-dollar contracts, halting follow-up surveys with students who graduated after the Great Recession and those who were in middle school during the pandemic. Critics, including former education officials and researchers, warn that this will create a significant gap in understanding student progress and educational effectiveness in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Hopi Tribe in Arizona faces a significant setback after the Trump administration terminated the Solar for All program, which had approved a $25 million grant to connect approximately 600 homes to solar power. For decades, many tribal members have lived without reliable electricity, and this project offered a path toward energy independence and economic stability after the 2019 closure of a nearby coal plant decimated the tribe's revenue. The cancellation, part of the administration's broader rollback of the Inflation Reduction Act, leaves the tribe with drastically reduced funding, forcing them to make difficult decisions about which few homes will receive power. The Hopi plan to sue the administration to reinstate the funds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding a Colorado law that prohibits licensed therapists from practicing conversion therapy on minors. The case places the free speech rights of therapists against state regulations designed to protect LGBTQ youth from a practice widely discredited by major medical organizations. These groups, including the American Medical Association, have found that the therapy is ineffective and leads to depression and suicidal thoughts. The challenge is brought by a Colorado therapist, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, who argues that the ban infringes on her ability to provide talk therapy from a specific viewpoint, constituting discrimination.</p>

          <p>Conservative politician Robert Jenrick is defending comments in which he described the Handsworth area of Birmingham as one of the "worst-integrated" places he had visited and the closest he'd seen to a "slum" in the UK. In a leaked recording, Jenrick stated he wants to live in a country where people are properly integrated rather than living parallel lives. Despite criticism from local MPs and the former Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, who called the remarks incorrect, Jenrick stood by his words, stating he will not shy away from discussing what he calls major failures of integration in the country. His party leader, Kemi Badenoch, suggested he was likely making an observation about his visit.</p>

Under the proposal, the power to set sentencing policy would be transferred directly to government ministers, a move intended to ensure sentences align with the party's tougher stance on crime. The announcement follows a public dispute between the current Labour government and the council, which has already led to legislation giving the justice secretary veto power over new guidelines.</p>

A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, known as the perigee, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon is the full moon that falls closest to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers. Skywatchers can look forward to two more supermoons this year, occurring on November 5th and December 4th, offering more opportunities to observe the amplified lunar spectacle.</p>

          <p>Shares of real estate company Opendoor Technologies have soared by 400% in 2025, with much of the gain occurring after the appointment of new CEO Kaz Nejatian. The company, which operates a large-scale house-flipping business, has historically struggled with profitability. Nejatian, a former Shopify executive, plans to leverage artificial intelligence to cut costs and improve the company's home-buying and selling decisions, a strategy that has generated significant investor excitement. While there is potential for this AI-driven overhaul to succeed, its success is not guaranteed, presenting a considerable risk for the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu retired from her first-round match against American Ann Li at the Wuhan Open in China, citing dizziness. Raducanu was trailing 6-1, 4-1 and appeared to be struggling with the hot and humid conditions, which had earlier caused the suspension of play on all outdoor courts. After falling behind by a double break in the second set, she called for a trainer, who took her blood pressure and temperature on the court. Shortly after the medical timeout, Raducanu decided to withdraw from the match, ending her run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Two years into the Gaza war, polls reveal a profound loss of faith and empathy between Israelis and Palestinians, posing a significant challenge to long-term reconciliation. Recent surveys show a majority of Israeli Jews believe there are no innocent people in Gaza, while Palestinians express deep skepticism that Israel would honor a peace deal. Experts like Khalil Shikaki and Corey Gil-Shuster note an "almost complete dehumanization" between the two societies, which complicates any potential peace process. While the current U.S.-led peace plan offers a framework, overcoming the deeply ingrained mutual distrust will require strong leadership and a credible, sustained diplomatic effort.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on students not to participate in pro-Palestinian protests scheduled for the second anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel. Citing a rise in antisemitism, Starmer described holding protests on the anniversary as "un-British" and disrespectful, stating that some have used such events as a "despicable excuse to attack British Jews." The warning comes amid heightened security for Jewish communities following a recent synagogue attack in Manchester. University leaders have also urged students to consider the timing of the protests, while reminding them that expressing support for a terrorist organization is a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>The Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, ravaged by a decade of conflict, is viewed by military analysts as a crucial gateway for Russia's broader ambitions rather than an end goal. Despite devastating losses and the displacement of millions, Ukrainian forces remain determined to defend the territory, where the most active stretch of the front line currently lies. Analysts believe Russia is focused on Donetsk because its terrain is more favorable for offensive operations compared to other regions like Kherson or Zaporizhzhia. For Ukraine, holding Donetsk is not just about defending a region but preventing Russia from gaining a permanent launchpad to threaten the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>France has been plunged into further political turmoil after Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned just 27 days into his term, citing an inability to form a functional government. The crisis stems from France's fragmented parliament, where President Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance lacks a majority, forcing reliance on unstable coalitions. In a surprise move, Macron has given Lecornu 48 hours to conduct final discussions with rival parties to find a breakthrough. If this fails, Macron faces difficult choices: appoint a sixth prime minister in under two years, potentially from an opposition party, or call another snap election, which could benefit Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party.</p>

          <p>While indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt offer the most promising chance for peace in two years, several major obstacles remain in the U.S.-proposed 20-point plan. Key areas of contention include the structure and timing of the hostage release, as Hamas may be unwilling to give up its only leverage without firm guarantees. Furthermore, the plan's requirement for Hamas to disarm is a long-standing point of refusal for the group. Disagreements also persist over the future governance of Gaza and the timeline for a full Israeli military withdrawal, with the vague language in the current framework leaving significant room for dispute.</p>

          <p>The resignation of French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu marks a new and distinct phase in the country's ongoing political crisis. Unlike previous government collapses caused by opposition no-confidence votes, Lecornu's downfall was triggered by the withdrawal of support from his own center-right allies, Les Republicains. This fracturing of President Macron's fragile governing coalition signals a realignment among parties as they position themselves for the 2027 presidential election. The breakdown demonstrates the failure of French political parties to adapt to a fragmented parliament and work in broad coalitions, leaving the nation in a state of persistent instability with no clear path forward.</p>

This upgrade comes despite escalating trade tensions with the United States, which have seen tariffs on Chinese goods more than double this year. China's export growth, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe, has helped offset a domestic slowdown caused by a slump in the real estate sector and weak consumer spending. However, the World Bank expects China's growth to slow to 4.2% in 2026 as export momentum fades. (not investment advice)</p>

Democratic candidates generally support the measure as a necessary political maneuver, while Republican and Green Party opponents condemn it as a corrupt and unconstitutional power grab that violates the will of voters, who previously established an independent redistricting commission.
