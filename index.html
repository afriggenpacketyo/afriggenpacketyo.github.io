          <p>A vehicle deliberately drove into a crowd of people waiting outside the Vermont Hollywood nightclub in Los Angeles, injuring 30 individuals, with at least seven reported in critical condition. The Nissan Versa also struck a taco truck and a valet stand before stopping. Authorities have launched a major police investigation into the incident, noting that one victim was also discovered with a gunshot wound, though the connection remains unclear. Witnesses described a chaotic scene, with bystanders rushing to help the numerous injured before emergency services arrived.</p>

          <p>A provision in a major bill recently passed by Congress has ignited a fierce partisan debate over Medicaid. The new rule requires able-bodied, childless adults aged 18 to 64 to work at least 80 hours a month to receive benefits. Republicans argue this promotes self-sufficiency and preserves the program as a safety net, not a permanent dependency. Democrats counter that such requirements are insulting, create burdensome administrative costs, and have historically led to people losing coverage without increasing employment, citing past examples in Arkansas and Georgia.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the elimination of its Office of Research and Development (ORD), the agency's primary scientific arm, and is proceeding with thousands of layoffs. The administration states the move will save nearly $750 million and better focus scientific efforts within program offices. Critics, including congressional Democrats and union leaders, have condemned the decision, arguing that dismantling the ORD will devastate public health protections and have generational impacts. The agency's total staffing is set to be reduced by nearly 23%, a loss of over 3,700 employees since the start of the administration.</p>

          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, raising concerns about potential flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions across all four nations. While a more severe amber warning for London and the southeast did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized alerts remain active. The recent heatwave has left the ground dry and less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the flood risk. The Met Office forecasts that the unsettled and wet weather pattern will continue into the early part of the next week.</p>

          <p>Spanish football club Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has expressed a desire for a new challenge. The proposed deal is structured as an initial loan with an option to buy, which would be a significant financial relief for Manchester United due to Rashford's high salary. The 27-year-old player spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa and is currently training separately from the main squad. This potential transfer comes after Barcelona's previous target, Nico Williams, signed a new long-term contract with Athletic Bilbao.</p>

          <p>A month after U.S. airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, the full extent of the damage and the associated safety risks remain unclear. The operation, which used powerful "bunker buster" bombs, aimed to disrupt Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities, which had been expanded after the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal. While the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported no increase in regional radiation, experts warn of chemical dangers from potential uranium hexafluoride gas leaks. The fate of Iran's existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium is also a significant concern for international observers.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved a presidential request to rescind $9 billion in previously allocated federal funds, impacting areas like foreign aid and public broadcasting. This move is being analyzed as a potential test case for fundamentally changing how the government appropriates money. Historically, budgets required a bipartisan 60-vote majority in the Senate, but a rescission request can pass with just 51 votes. This successful use of a partisan process could signal a move away from bipartisan budgeting, which would dramatically alter how the federal government has been funded for years.

However, financial experts caution that net worth can be a misleading metric, as it provides only a snapshot of one's financial position and doesn't account for cash flow or lifestyle goals. They advise that true financial comfort is achieved when money management aligns with personal values, such as security or freedom. Rather than fixating on a single number, experts recommend focusing on making progress toward goals and understanding what one truly wants from their money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of deadly floods in Texas, a summer camp for youth with disabilities has managed to reopen thanks to a massive volunteer cleanup effort. Camp Camp, located 30 miles downstream from where another camp suffered tragic losses, was covered in debris that destroyed its waterfront and amenities. A real estate agent's social media plea for help brought hundreds of volunteers who hauled supplies and operated machinery to clear the 55-acre property. The rapid rehabilitation of the camp, which serves over 800 campers annually, has been described as a miraculous display of community spirit.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed a lump in her groin was a pulled muscle from working out was later diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread throughout her body. Despite being in excellent physical shape and having no other symptoms, scans revealed cancer lesions on her lungs and brain. This type of melanoma is unusual as it presented without a visible skin mole. After undergoing an aggressive and difficult treatment combining radiation and immunotherapy, which caused severe side effects, her cancer is now in remission, and her doctors consider her a "Stage IV miracle."</p>

          <p>A strategic dialogue mechanism established 25 years ago has been credited with fostering a "leapfrog development" in China-Africa relations, significantly increasing cooperation and edging out other global powers. Since the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) was created, trade has surged nearly 30-fold, and Chinese investment has grown almost 100-fold. This economic partnership is mirrored by closer security ties, with China now training thousands of African military officers annually and becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article critiques a New York City mayoral candidate's proposal to create city-owned grocery stores focused on low prices. The author argues the plan is undermined by the candidate's other political commitments, which would inevitably raise costs. For example, championing a near-doubled minimum wage, expanded worker benefits, and socially conscious food procurement practices would conflict directly with the goal of being cheaper than the private sector. The piece suggests that without clarifying how these trade-offs would be resolved, the promise of a more efficient public option for groceries is not credible.</p>

          <p>At 46 years old, legendary boxer Manny Pacquiao is returning to the ring after a four-year absence to challenge 30-year-old WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios. Pacquiao insists his passion for the sport remains strong and that his disciplined training will overcome the age difference. If he wins, he would become the second-oldest champion in boxing history and the only active champion in the Hall of Fame. The fight is seen as a major test against a younger, prime opponent, with critics questioning the decision to grant an immediate title shot after such a long layoff.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece laments the U.S. Army's decision to significantly scale back its Military Working Equid program, putting 141 of its 236 ceremonial horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. While these animals have not served in combat for decades, the author argues they are a vital, living connection to American military heritage, particularly in their role in funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery. The presence of the horses is described as an eloquent and stately symbol of respect for fallen soldiers. The article notes that while the move saves money, it diminishes a unique piece of Army culture.</p>

          <p>In a historic shift, the U.S. has moved away from its hands-off approach to cryptocurrency by passing its first major crypto legislation, the GENIUS Act, which has now been signed into law. The bill establishes new rules for stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market, and is seen by supporters as a major step toward cementing American dominance in financial technology. Another bill, the CLARITY Act, also passed the House and aims to give a smaller agency more policing power over the sector. Critics, however, fear these industry-backed laws will lead to weaker regulation of a risky financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>
