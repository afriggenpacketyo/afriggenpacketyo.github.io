According to DHS officials, the suspect, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, resisted arrest and attempted to drive his vehicle into the agents, striking and dragging one officer. The agent, fearing for his life, discharged his firearm, fatally wounding the suspect. The injured agent was hospitalized with severe injuries but is in stable condition, while the incident is now under federal investigation.</p>

          <p>The Florida Department of Education has announced it will investigate any educators who posted celebratory or inappropriate comments on social media regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The state's Education Commissioner stated that such "vile, sanctionable behavior" violates the higher standards to which teachers are held. Governor Ron DeSantis supported the move, emphasizing that celebrating the murder is unacceptable, especially from educators who serve students and families.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from historian Jill Lepore's new book, "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," frames the founding document as a dynamic explosion of ideas rather than a static relic.

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a lower court's ruling and permit the immediate firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration seeks her removal before a crucial meeting next week on interest rates, citing allegations that she misrepresented her primary residence on mortgage documents. Critics view the move as an attempt to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence and exert political influence over monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has convicted former President Jair Bolsonaro on charges related to his attempts to overturn his 2022 reelection loss, sentencing him to over 27 years in prison. This opinion article draws parallels between Bolsonaro's actions and those of U.S. President Donald Trump, including claims of election fraud and encouraging supporters to protest. The author suggests that Brazil's ability to hold a former leader judicially accountable serves as a powerful example of democratic accountability.</p>
