        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing criticism for significantly increasing the rent on a property she owns just weeks after the previous tenants' contract ended. The tenants were reportedly given four months' notice, and the property was re-listed with a £700 monthly rent increase after it failed to sell. This action has drawn scrutiny as it appears to conflict with the spirit of the government's upcoming Renters Rights Bill, which aims to protect tenants, leading to calls for her resignation from political opponents.</p>

However, the policy lacks crucial details, leaving the industry uncertain about its full impact and who qualifies for exemptions.

The strong performance was primarily driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund investment arm, bolstered by the performance of public companies like Grab and private investments. This positive result comes as the company continues its significant spending on artificial intelligence, including a major investment in OpenAI and the pending acquisition of Ampere Computing.

The group is accused of planning to violently overthrow the German government. The arrests followed raids involving 300 investigators across three states, targeting six people alleged to have participated in weapons training to prepare for an armed assault on the German parliament. These actions are part of an ongoing investigation into the extremist group, whose key leaders were arrested in late 2022.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor has lowered its full-year operating profit forecast by 600 billion yen, attributing the revision to the financial impact of U.S. auto tariffs. Despite reporting record global sales and a June-quarter operating profit that beat estimates, the company's earnings were significantly weighed down by these new import taxes. The Japanese automaker noted that the tariffs, which came into effect in April, have pressured profits and forced price adjustments to maintain market share in the competitive U.S. market.

          <p>This weekend, Jen Pawol is set to break a significant barrier in professional sports by becoming the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball game. The 48-year-old, who has officiated in minor league baseball since 2016 and worked spring training games, will join the umpiring crew for the series between the Miami Marlins and the Atlanta Braves. Her debut follows in the footsteps of other female officials who were pioneers in prominent men's leagues like the NFL and NBA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, a high-performance sports car, has the highest theft rate in the United States, 39 times the average for all vehicles, according to a new report. The Highway Loss Data Institute found that expensive, powerful vehicles and pickup trucks dominate the list of the 20 most-stolen models. The Camaro's vulnerability is heightened by an on-board data port that thieves can exploit, while electric vehicles were among the least stolen, likely due to being parked in garages and having advanced tracking technology.</p>

          <p>A new coffee-table book of photographs from the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum by famed fashion photographer Juergen Teller is drawing sharp criticism. This article argues that the iPhone-shot images are bland, unremarkable, and fail to add any new understanding to the historical site. The author condemns the project as a detached and narcissistic vanity project, particularly citing a moment where Teller focuses on his own surname in a book of victims' names, arguing it fails to meet the profound responsibility required when representing the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>A massive and deadly wildfire is raging in the Corbieres hills of southwestern France, described by the Prime Minister as a "catastrophe of unprecedented scale." The blaze, the largest in the region since 1949, has burned through 16,000 hectares, killed one person, injured at least 13, and forced the evacuation of villages and campsites. Over 2,100 firefighters, supported by aircraft and military personnel, are battling the flames, with unfavorable weather conditions expected to hamper their efforts.</p>

While Japanese giants like Tokyo Electron saw their shares fall, major players like Samsung and TSMC, who have made significant investments in US manufacturing, saw their stock prices rise. This divergence highlights the potential market impact of the policy, which exempts companies "building in the United States," likely benefiting large, multinational firms while creating uncertainty for others in the region.

          <p>A major new study from Harvard Medical School suggests that lithium, a metal commonly used to treat mood disorders, may play a critical role in brain health and protection against Alzheimer's disease. Researchers found that lithium is naturally required by the body's cells and that depleting it in mice accelerated brain changes associated with Alzheimer's. Maintaining normal lithium levels, however, protected their brains, suggesting a potential pathway for new treatments, though scientists caution against self-supplementation until human trials are conducted.</p>

In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security used an image from an upcoming "South Park" episode mocking the agency, prompting a satirical response from the show's creators, highlighting the politicized and controversial nature of the recruitment campaign.</p>
