          <p>Israel and Iran are engaged in a high-stakes conflict that could reshape the Middle East, with both countries facing significant internal pressures. Iran's regime, weakened domestically, feels compelled to retaliate against Israeli strikes to maintain its power, while Israel views Iran as a major threat to its survival, particularly concerning its nuclear capabilities. Israel seeks U.S. support to neutralize this threat and potentially influence regime change in Tehran, believing it needs to guarantee its national survival.

Tensions have escalated since Israel launched an attack against Iran, targeting its nuclear program, leading to retaliatory missile fire between the two nations.

          <p>Despite ongoing conflicts, including fighting in Gaza, airstrikes in Lebanon, and strikes within Iran, Israel's economy has demonstrated surprising resilience. The country's finances are strained by increased military spending and the mobilization of reservists, but the high-tech sector continues to thrive. To compensate for the financial burden, the government has increased taxes, including the value-added tax (VAT). While industries like tourism and manufacturing have suffered, the overall labor market remains tight, and investors appear optimistic, anticipating a resolution to the conflicts and the elimination of Iran's nuclear threat (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Smugglers operating along the French coast are using "taxi boats" to pick up migrants waiting in the sea, circumventing increased police patrols. These boats launch from hidden locations and collect paying customers who wait in waist-deep water, often including women and children. French police are struggling to intervene due to operational rules that prioritize safety and prevent intervention that could lead to drownings. The French government plans to revise these rules to allow police to intercept migrant dinghies closer to the shoreline, but some officers fear legal repercussions if they intervene and cause harm.</p>

This new warranty replaces Ram's current five-year or 60,000-mile warranty, which is standard for full-size pickup trucks.

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The amendment passed 379-137, with supporters arguing it was cruel to prosecute women for having abortions, particularly those who are vulnerable. Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions up to 24 weeks, but the new measure aims to remove the threat of prosecution for women who obtain abortion pills and terminate their own pregnancies, especially in cases beyond the legal limit. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measure, arguing it would lead to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.</p>

          <p>The number of foreign visitors to Japan in May reached 3.7 million, a record for the month, marking a 21.5% increase from the previous year. South Korea topped the list with 825,800 visitors, followed by China with 789,900, and India saw a record monthly high of 43,000 visitors. The Japan National Tourism Organization noted that travel demand remains strong due to school holidays and increased visitors from China, the Philippines, and the United States. Despite the overall surge, Hong Kong saw a decline in visitors, possibly due to concerns about a Japanese manga predicting a major disaster.</p>

          <p>A recent article explores why men, particularly straight men, are often perceived as poor gossips, despite research showing they engage in gossip at similar rates to women. The article suggests that men's reluctance to engage in "messy" or emotional storytelling stems from cultural expectations and a fear of appearing unmanly. The author discusses how gossip can be a valuable social tool for building intimacy and connection, highlighting the potential for men to improve their social skills by embracing gossip. It argues that men's inability to share secrets contributes to the male loneliness epidemic, suggesting that learning to gossip could foster deeper friendships.</p>

One example is the inclusion of cubic zirconia in lapel pins to classify them as jewelry instead of festive articles, avoiding a 14% tariff.
