            <p>Rosie O'Donnell has developed a surprising friendship with Lyle Menendez, one of the brothers convicted of murdering their parents in 1996. O'Donnell says that Lyle began contacting her regularly from prison, leading her to feel safe enough to trust and love a straight man for the first time in her life. Their connection started during the Menendez brothers' trial, when O'Donnell publicly supported their defense, claiming abuse by their parents. O'Donnell has since visited Lyle in prison and even adopted a service dog trained by inmates for her autistic son, inspiring her to create a documentary about the program.</p>

            <p>Researchers in China have created a new oil-absorbing material from sphagnum moss, offering a potentially cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for cleaning up oil spills. The modified moss exhibits superior oil absorption capacity and water repellent properties compared to conventional bio-based absorbents like cotton and fruit peels. This innovation addresses the urgent need for efficient oil spill cleanup methods, which can have devastating environmental and economic consequences. The moss is chemically treated to alter its properties, making it a promising tool for mitigating the impact of oil spills.</p>

            <p>President Trump's changing tariff policies are creating panic buying and paralysis among consumers, who are struggling to keep up with the rapid shifts. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices and potential shortages. While some consumers are stocking up on essentials, others are delaying purchases or opting for cheaper alternatives. Economists predict that these tariffs could significantly impact the US economy, potentially leading to slower growth and higher unemployment.</p>

            <p>Corporations are increasingly employing surveillance technology to monitor employees, signaling a shift towards harsher workplace practices after a brief period of pseudo-benevolence. This trend, coupled with mass layoffs and benefit cuts, represents a 'mask-off' moment for companies prioritizing profits over employee well-being. However, Gen Z workers are resisting this 'grind' culture, prioritizing work-life balance and seeking companies that offer secure contracts and ample benefits. The article suggests that while corporate surveillance may define the present, its limitations will lead to less productive and unhappy employees.</p>

This trend coincides with a move away from comfortable 'athleisure' wear and towards more brash, moneyed glamour, indicating a complex relationship between fashion, politics, and personal identity.</p>

However, analysts warn that the campaign could deepen political divisions and instability amid external pressures from Beijing.

            <p>President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from the new tariffs, including the 125% levies imposed on Chinese imports. The move comes after concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases, as many gadgets are made in China. Exemptions are backdated to April 5 and include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. Some estimates suggested iPhone prices in the US could have tripled if the costs were passed on to consumers.</p>
