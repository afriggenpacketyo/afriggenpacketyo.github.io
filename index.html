          <p>A powerful storm system swept across the upper Midwest, resulting in at least three deaths in North Dakota and widespread damage across northern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. The storm brought tornadic activity, large hail, and strong wind gusts, with wind speeds reaching over 100 mph in some areas. In Bemidji, Minnesota, the storm caused flash flooding, downed trees, and building damage, leading to a state of emergency and the opening of a convention center for displaced residents. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources also reported significant damage to Itasca State Park, which has been closed due to power outages and impassable roadways. Optimism remains tempered due to the ongoing clean-up efforts and the dangerous heat affecting the region.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has deemed Irish rap group Kneecap's scheduled performance at Glastonbury Festival as "not appropriate" due to a pending court case against one of its members, Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, who faces a terror offense for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah. This follows Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch's call for the BBC to refrain from broadcasting Kneecap's performance, citing concerns about rewarding extremism with public funding. A BBC spokesperson clarified that while the broadcaster does not ban artists, it will ensure that its programming adheres to editorial guidelines, and decisions regarding output will be made leading up to the festival. The controversy has drawn support from some, as well as criticism from others, as Kneecap continues to sell out venues and gain international attention.</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison along with 13 other political prisoners after five years of incarceration. Tikhanovsky has been moved to Lithuania and reunited with his wife, who is living in exile in Vilnius, marking their first reunion since 2020. The release occurred during a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg, who met with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. While the release is seen as a significant diplomatic breakthrough for Lukashenko, hundreds of other political prisoners remain behind bars in Belarus, as the country continues to face Western sanctions and political repression.</p>

Following her diagnosis, the Greek health ministry issued a statement to hoteliers in Crete to raise awareness about monitoring water quality for Legionella. EasyJet Holidays, the company Jobling was traveling with, has moved other customers out of the hotel as a precaution, and an emergency alert has been issued on the island by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</p>

Israel's military claimed to have targeted centrifuge production sites and killed three senior Iranian commanders, including one allegedly involved in the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Iran retaliated with a new wave of drones and missiles, resulting in minor injuries to several U.S. citizens, but the Israeli military claims to have neutralized over 50% of Iran's launchers.

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the proposed policy change, which would have capped indirect costs for universities, was arbitrary and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually.

Reed stated that Trump's rebuke is "shocking" and may be related to his consideration of an attack against Iran, requiring a conclusion that Iran possesses nuclear capabilities. This criticism comes after Gabbard testified that the intelligence community assesses that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon. Reed emphasized the importance of correcting the record immediately if Gabbard made a false statement in her testimony.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Science Research Funding Cuts</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the proposed policy change, which would have capped indirect costs for universities, was arbitrary and contrary to law. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually. This decision follows similar rulings against the Trump administration's attempts to cap grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to meet with federal law enforcement amid ongoing tensions over immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard. Vance defended the continued presence of military forces in the city, alleging that state and local officials have encouraged violence during protests. He also referred to Sen. Alex Padilla as "JosÃ© Padilla," prompting criticism from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who viewed the misidentification as disrespectful and politically motivated. The visit underscores the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and California officials over immigration enforcement and federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced that Neuralink, his neurotechnology company, will begin human trials for vision implants within the next year. The implants aim to restore vision to individuals who are completely blind by writing directly to the visual cortex. Neuralink has already tested the implant on a monkey, with Musk stating that the initial vision offered will be low resolution but will improve over time, eventually exceeding the capabilities of human eyes. The technology could also enable users to see ultraviolet rays, infrared, and radar, offering what Musk described as a "superpower situation."</p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states, a key component of the GOP's savings efforts, would violate Senate rules. This ruling is a setback for Republicans who were counting on savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to offset the costs of tax breaks. While the parliamentarian allowed a provision imposing new work requirements for older Americans to receive food stamp aid, the overall loss is expected to be costly. Democrats are celebrating the decision, while Republicans are exploring alternative options to comply with Senate rules.</p>

The decision follows recent detentions by federal agents at a bus stop near Villa Parke, which drew criticism from U.S. Rep. Judy Chu and other politicians.</p>

The B-2 can carry the 30,000lb GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, designed to destroy targets deep underground, including Iran's Fordow nuclear facility. The deployment's connection to Middle East tensions is unclear, and no forward orders have been given to move the bombers beyond Guam. Experts are watching to see if the bombers will move to Diego Garcia, which is in an ideal position to operate in the Middle East.</p>

The suspects were handed over to the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the pills were placed into police custody. The arrests aim to curb the trafficking of illicit substances and prevent drugs from reaching young people, aligning with President Claudia Sheinbaum's priority of combating illegal drug distribution.</p>
