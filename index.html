          <p>A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced former President Joseph Kabila to death in absentia for treason and war crimes, including backing the M23 rebel group. The ruling, which also includes a $33 billion damages order, has intensified the long-standing rivalry between Kabila and current President Felix Tshisekedi. While some activists support the verdict as a step towards accountability, Kabila's allies condemn it as politically motivated, warning it could derail fragile peace processes in the conflict-ridden eastern provinces. Analysts remain skeptical about the sentence's enforcement, given Kabila's unknown whereabouts and the country's history of unenforced death penalties.</p>

          <p>An explosion in the boiler room of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx caused an entire corner of the structure to collapse. The blast, which occurred Wednesday morning at the Mitchel Houses, sent debris raining down on the street but miraculously resulted in no reported injuries or fatalities. Mayor Eric Adams and other officials praised the response, calling it an "all-hands-on-deck moment" that averted a major disaster. First responders are continuing to search the rubble as a precaution, while inspections are underway to ensure the building's structural integrity and restore utilities for residents.</p>

          <h2>Senate Fails to Advance Government Funding Bills as Shutdown Begins</h2>

          <p>On the first day of a government shutdown, the U.S. Senate failed to pass two procedural votes on competing funding proposals from Democrats and Republicans. This legislative stalemate mirrors previous failed attempts, with both parties continuing to blame each other for the lapse in federal funding. Republican leaders are urging Democrats to support a "clean" short-term funding bill, while Democratic leaders insist on negotiations that include health care provisions. With Congress departing for Yom Kippur, the shutdown is expected to continue through the weekend as negotiations remain at an impasse. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government has entered a shutdown after Congress failed to approve a spending bill by the October 1 fiscal deadline, furloughing hundreds of thousands of workers. The core of the dispute lies in Democrats' insistence on including an extension of Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies in any funding measure, a condition Republicans have rejected. Both a "clean" Republican-backed bill and a Democratic proposal with their priorities failed to gain the necessary support in the Senate. The impasse means non-essential government functions will cease, with significant economic and political consequences looming the longer the shutdown continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is breathing a sigh of relief after Pfizer struck a deal with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower some U.S. drug prices. The agreement includes a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs in exchange for a $70 billion investment in domestic manufacturing. This deal sets a precedent that other major drugmakers, many of whom have recently announced U.S. investments, are expected to follow. Analysts believe this shifts the administration's focus away from punitive tariffs, providing more certainty for the sector and reducing the immediate threat of widespread price controls.

          <p>Strong consumer demand for electric vehicles, partly driven by the impending expiration of federal incentives, led to significant third-quarter sales growth for major U.S. automakers. General Motors and Ford both reported overall sales increases of approximately 8%, with GM's EV sales more than doubling. The industry is estimated to have sold a record 410,000 EVs in the quarter, capturing a 10% market share.

Parks that collect fees will be permitted to use that revenue to maintain essential services such as sanitation and emergency operations.

The conversation touches on how the internet has shattered a shared reality, fostering conspiracy theories and eroding trust in institutions.

          <p>A deadly structural failure occurred in Arerti, Ethiopia, when makeshift scaffolding at a church collapsed during an annual religious festival, killing at least 36 people and injuring over 200. The incident happened early Wednesday morning as a group gathered to celebrate the Virgin Mary festival. Local officials reported that some victims remained trapped under the debris of collapsed wooden poles, and the death toll could rise. The tragedy has highlighted the widespread lack of health and safety regulations in the country, where construction accidents are unfortunately common.</p>

Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, an investment Buffett began building in 2022.

Neptune's CEO highlighted that the company remains "open for business," able to serve homeowners needing flood insurance to close on real estate deals. The company utilizes AI to assess individual property risk, offering an alternative to the government's broader, zone-based approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bankrupt low-cost carrier Spirit Airlines is significantly scaling back its operations, ending service to eleven U.S. cities and planning to furlough approximately 1,800 flight attendants. The airline is also grounding planes and reducing its overall flight schedule by 25% as it undergoes a major restructuring to regain profitability. These cuts come after a failed merger with JetBlue and reflect a post-pandemic shift in consumer preference away from budget carriers. Industry analysts warn that Spirit's withdrawal from these routes could lead to higher fares for consumers unless other low-cost competitors step in.</p>

          <p>Following the death of her husband, conservative pundit Charlie Kirk, Erika Kirk has been named CEO of his company, Turning Point USA, sparking a debate about her new role in light of her past advocacy for traditional gender roles. The article explores the apparent contradiction between her public messaging—that a wife's primary role is in the home—and her acceptance of a high-profile corporate leadership position. This situation is compared to historical figures like Phyllis Schlafly, who balanced a public career with promoting stay-at-home ideals. Analysts suggest that for conservatives, this is often reconciled by framing the woman's career as being in service to her husband's legacy or family values.</p>

The sale will raise cash to be reinvested in other holdings like Boeing and Nike, which are perceived to have stronger growth prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

The suit, which follows a similar action by the FTC, centers on a deal where Zillow paid Redfin $100 million to shut down its rental advertising business and transfer clients to Zillow. Officials argue this agreement violates federal antitrust laws, insulates Zillow from competition, and could ultimately harm renters by reducing their options. Both companies deny the allegations, claiming their partnership is pro-competitive and benefits consumers.</p>

While the Taliban has not given an official reason, the blackout raised fears of further isolating women and girls, who rely on the internet as a lifeline for education and connection since their rights were severely restricted.

However, the British Medical Association (BMA) has formally disputed the move, warning that an "online triage tsunami" could overwhelm practices and risk patient safety without proper safeguards. While the government says it has provided funding for the transition, many patients report that online booking systems are either unavailable or lack appointment slots.</p>
