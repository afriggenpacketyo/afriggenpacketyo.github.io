          <p>Taiwan's military will incorporate urban survival tests and civilian resilience drills into its annual Han Kuang war games for the first time, featuring 24/7 live-fire scenarios. This change reflects growing concerns about a potential prolonged conflict with Beijing, requiring a "whole-of-society" defense approach. The exercises will simulate a full-spectrum response, including mass evacuations and critical infrastructure protection, to enhance national mobilization and readiness. The defense ministry emphasized that integrating civil defense is crucial for preserving peace through preparedness.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has experienced a significant political setback, being forced into a major U-turn on changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) welfare benefit. Facing a large-scale rebellion from within his own Labour party, Starmer had to abandon the planned reform, drawing comparisons to the chaotic final days of previous administrations. The reversal has weakened his authority, sparked fury among loyal MPs, and raised questions about his leadership and the government's stability. The episode suggests potential tax rises may now be inevitable to cover fiscal gaps.</p>

Tribal leaders state that some of their villages are just 900 feet from the site and criticize the lack of an environmental impact study for the facility, which could hold up to 5,000 people. While President Trump toured the site, touting the surrounding swamp as a natural deterrent, the tribe fears the impact on the delicate ecosystem and their traditional way of life.

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration from prematurely ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The judge ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering Haiti's TPS designation. The ruling states that the interests of the Haitians, who rely on the status to live and work in the U.S., outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision provides a temporary reprieve for the Haitian immigrants amid ongoing gang violence and displacement in their home country.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data shows that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a historic monthly low of just over 6,000 in June. The Trump administration attributes this significant decrease to its aggressive immigration policies, including swift deportations and a halt to the release of migrants into the U.S. The current numbers are a stark contrast to the record highs seen under the previous administration. The crackdown also involves large-scale interior arrests by ICE and a messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation, which has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates and some local communities.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 7% ahead of its second-quarter delivery report, a drop linked to a renewed public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The dispute centers on the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk criticized for increasing the national debt and cutting renewable energy support, potentially harming Tesla's business. In response, Trump made comments suggesting he could target the government subsidies and contracts that benefit Musk's companies. This political clash adds to investor uncertainty as Wall Street anticipates a year-over-year decline in Tesla's vehicle deliveries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is preparing for a vote on the Senate's version of President Trump's major spending and tax cut package, known as the "big, beautiful bill." The legislation narrowly passed the Senate and now faces opposition in the House from some Republicans who are critical of the changes made, including deeper cuts to Medicaid and a higher overall cost. House leadership is pushing for a vote to meet a July 4th deadline, but conservative and moderate critics could still jeopardize its passage. The outcome remains uncertain as internal party debates continue.</p>

          <p>Recent immigration raids in Southern California have created a climate of fear, leading to the cancellation or postponement of several traditional Fourth of July celebrations in predominantly Hispanic communities. Organizers of major events in downtown Los Angeles, East L.A., and other cities cited security concerns and the potential for immigration enforcement actions at public gatherings. The atmosphere of uncertainty has dampened the holiday spirit for many, as undocumented residents and their families are afraid to venture out.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as it faces 153 legal claims of sexual abuse by clergy members. Church officials state that the financial reorganization is the only way to fairly handle the claims while allowing the diocese to continue its ministry. However, attorneys for the survivors have criticized the move as a delay tactic designed to avoid accountability and force victims into a lengthy, property-focused legal process instead of public trials. The bankruptcy follows the passage of a California law that opened a window for previously time-barred sexual assault claims.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet medical journal estimates that the Trump administration's decision to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) could lead to 14 million preventable deaths by 2030. The research found that USAID programs have saved over 90 million lives in the last two decades, particularly by reducing mortality from HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The administration has defended the cuts, arguing the agency was inefficient, but the study's authors contend that for a small taxpayer cost, the agency has had a massive life-saving impact globally.</p>

          <p>Parts of England are officially in a state of drought, and other regions across the UK are at risk following one of the driest springs since 1836.

The dry conditions are already impacting farmers, who face higher costs for irrigation, and are harming wildlife habitats. With forecasts suggesting continued dry weather, there is widespread concern about water supplies and the potential need for restrictions like hosepipe bans in the coming months.</p>

          <p>California has passed the most significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in its 55-year history, a move aimed at spurring housing construction. Pushed through by Governor Gavin Newsom as part of the state budget, the changes waive CEQA's lengthy environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas. This reform removes a tool that opponents, including labor unions and community groups, have often used to delay or block new developments through lawsuits. The goal is to remove barriers that have stifled construction and contributed to the state's severe housing affordability crisis.</p>
