          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported slightly disappointing first-quarter results due to inclement weather, but promising signs of a stronger second quarter boosted investor confidence. The company's comparable store sales slowed to 3.5%, driven by traffic and average check increases, but exceeded consensus estimates. Despite an increase in commodity cost inflation outlook, Texas Roadhouse reaffirmed most of its 2025 outlook, indicating continued positive comparable sales growth and store week growth. The article suggests that Texas Roadhouse's brand strength and customer value proposition position it well to navigate economic uncertainties.</p>
