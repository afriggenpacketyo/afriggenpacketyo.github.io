          <p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was recently observed at Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Texas, the same facility now housing Ghislaine Maxwell. Holmes is currently serving an 11-year sentence for fraud, while Maxwell was recently transferred to the minimum-security prison to continue her sentence for sex trafficking crimes connected to Jeffrey Epstein. The reason for Maxwell's transfer from her previous facility in Florida remains unclear, but it follows meetings with a Deputy Attorney General as her legal team seeks a presidential pardon or sentence commutation.</p>

          <p>Authorities in London have uncovered a major counterfeiting operation, seizing thousands of fake Labubu dolls that pose a serious choking hazard to children. The immense popularity of the dolls, driven by a TikTok trend, has created a lucrative market that criminals are exploiting with cheap, unsafe knockoffs featuring easily detachable parts. Trading Standards officials warn that these fakes, often traced back to China, may also contain toxic materials, highlighting the dangers of purchasing counterfeit goods spurred by online crazes.</p>

          <p>Four municipal workers in Gyoda, Japan, have died after falling into a manhole while conducting a sewage pipe inspection. The tragic incident occurred when one worker fell in for an unknown reason, and his three colleagues perished while attempting a rescue. Authorities detected high concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas emanating from the manhole and suspect the workers were overcome by the fumes. A full investigation is now underway to determine the exact circumstances of the fatal workplace accident.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new climate study indicates that significant reductions in air pollution across East Asia over the past decade may have unintentionally accelerated the pace of global warming. Major cleanup efforts, such as China's 75% cut in sulfur dioxide emissions since 2013, removed cooling aerosol particles from the atmosphere. This reduction in pollutants has resulted in less solar radiation being reflected away from the Earth, potentially contributing up to 0.05 degrees Celsius to the rate of global surface warming since 2010.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake was reported in the New York City metropolitan area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey.

The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this minor tremor was not considered significant and caused little reason for public alarm.</p>

          <p>Germany is deepening its military-industrial cooperation with Ukraine by directly funding the production of long-range weapons, including combat drones, on Ukrainian soil. This represents a significant evolution in Germany's support, moving beyond simply supplying weapons to actively investing in Ukraine's domestic defense industry. The collaboration aims to provide Ukraine with crucial long-range strike capabilities, with German startups and established firms like Rheinmetall expanding their presence and engaging in joint ventures for manufacturing and repair.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the US and Israeli attacks on Iran 50 days ago have largely backfired, failing to halt Iran's nuclear program or destabilize the regime. Instead, the strikes have reportedly led to an intense domestic crackdown, with a surge in arrests and executions of political dissidents as the government blames internal spies for intelligence failures. The author contends the aggression has strengthened hardliners, deepened Iran's alliance with China, and ironically increased the likelihood of Iran pursuing a nuclear bomb for self-defense.</p>
