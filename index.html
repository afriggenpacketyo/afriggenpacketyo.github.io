Investing in clean energy and climate-smart solutions presents economic opportunities that can overcome political and economic divisions.

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by surging rice prices, as the central bank considers pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. The core inflation figure, which strips out prices for fresh food, was higher than expectations and marks the highest level since January 2023. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates given price trends, while also citing the need to monitor the effects of U.S. tariffs.</p>
