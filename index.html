        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the event of a US government shutdown, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their salaries due to constitutional and legal mandates that treat their pay as a permanent appropriation. This differs from the hundreds of thousands of federal employees, who would see their paychecks delayed regardless of whether they are furloughed or deemed essential. While programs like Social Security have permanent funding, most federal agencies must cease non-essential operations, and their employees will only receive back pay once Congress approves new spending.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has distributed a memo to Republican lawmakers aimed at shaping the narrative around a potential government shutdown. The document, titled "Debunking the Democrats’ Shutdown Delusion," instructs the GOP to portray their short-term funding bill as a nonpartisan solution and to blame Democrats for forcing a shutdown over unrelated policy demands, such as healthcare subsidies. It provides talking points to counter Democratic arguments and frame their proposals as fiscally irresponsible, urging Republicans to remain united in the messaging war.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the fintech startup Frank, has been sentenced to just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase in its $175 million acquisition of her company. Javice was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud for grossly inflating Frank's customer base from fewer than 300,000 to over 4 million to secure the deal. During the sentencing, Javice expressed profound remorse for her actions, while the prosecution argued that JPMorgan had acquired a "crime scene" driven by greed.</p>

The proposal reportedly includes provisions for a demilitarized Gaza, with Israel retaining security responsibility, and a civilian administration not run by Hamas or the Palestinian Authority. Netanyahu stated that if Hamas rejects the deal, Israel has the full backing of the US to "finish the job by itself," underscoring the high stakes of the diplomatic effort.</p>

          <p>According to stress physiologist Dr. Rebecca Heiss, the most effective way to manage stress is not through solitary self-care but by channeling that energy outward to help others. This approach, which she calls "stress springboarding," aligns with the body's natural release of oxytocin, a hormone that encourages social connection during stressful times. Research indicates that workplace wellness programs encouraging volunteer work are uniquely successful, and brain imaging shows that helping others activates reward centers and reduces stress-related brain activity.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old man charged with the aggravated murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, made a remote court appearance where his lawyers requested a preliminary hearing. Robinson did not enter a plea, and the hearing will allow a judge to determine if there is sufficient evidence for a trial. Prosecutors, who plan to seek the death penalty, have cited text messages and DNA evidence allegedly linking Robinson to the shooting, which has become a galvanizing event for Republicans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The used electric vehicle market is experiencing a significant boom, with sales increasing 34% in the first half of 2025 as average prices become nearly competitive with used gasoline-powered cars. This trend is fueled by the rapid depreciation of new EVs, which creates an attractive buyer's market and helps alleviate concerns about affordability. While the new EV market has seen sluggish growth, the robust secondary market indicates that consumer skepticism about the technology is diminishing with real-world exposure.

          <p>The United States has recorded its highest number of measles cases in over three decades, with more than 1,500 infections confirmed across at least 39 states this year. A significant portion of these cases stemmed from a major outbreak in West Texas that led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the resurgence of this highly contagious and preventable disease to declining childhood vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold needed for effective community immunity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a plan to support the U.S. coal industry by providing $625 million to modernize coal-fired power plants and opening 13.1 million acres of public land to new mining operations. This move aims to revive a sector that has been in steep decline due to competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy sources. Environmental groups have criticized the initiative as a colossal waste of taxpayer money that props up the oldest and most polluting form of energy.</p>

          <p>This article explores the feasibility of buying an annuity at age 55, a decade or more before traditional retirement age. While it is possible, the decision requires careful consideration of one's financial goals and need for liquidity, as annuities involve long-term commitments with surrender penalties for early withdrawal. Purchasing a deferred annuity at 55 can offer years of tax-deferred growth, but it also means locking in rates and tying up capital that might be needed for unexpected life events.

          <p>With mortgage rates recently falling to a three-year low, prospective homebuyers are presented with a new window of opportunity this October. However, the article advises caution, noting that rates remain volatile and that the fall market can be challenging due to lower housing inventory. Buyers should weigh the benefit of current lower rates against these factors, while also keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve's next meeting, as another rate cut appears likely and could further influence the market.

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside of the United States, arguing the measure is necessary to stop foreign countries from stealing America's filmmaking business. The proposal has been met with skepticism and concern from Hollywood studios and California politicians, who worry it would increase costs for consumers and create damaging consequences. Many in the industry and government instead advocate for a federal film tax incentive to make U.S. production more competitive.</p>
