        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK councils are persisting with legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal ruling overturned an injunction in Epping. The Epping Forest District Council is considering an appeal to the Supreme Court, while other councils, backed by political figures, argue the hotels are unsuitable and strain local services. This ongoing conflict highlights the tension between local governance and national immigration policy, as the government aims to stop using hotels for this purpose by 2029 amid protests and legal battles.</p>

          <p>Despite preliminary CDC data showing a significant and steady decline in fatal drug overdoses in the U.S. to their lowest point since March 2020, the Trump administration continues to frame fentanyl as a growing crisis. This narrative is used to justify policies like mandatory minimum sentences and potential military action against Mexican cartels. Public health experts note the positive trend, with some states seeing deaths fall by nearly 42%, attributing the success to disrupted supply chains and improved addiction treatment, contrasting sharply with the administration's punitive approach.</p>

          <p>Across Europe, countries are reconsidering mandatory military service in response to heightened security concerns, with Germany planning a new, initially voluntary model that could become compulsory. Nations like Sweden, Latvia, and Lithuania have already reinstated conscription after previously abolishing it, while countries with long-standing traditions like Finland and Norway continue their models, with Norway including women. This trend reflects a broader strategic shift towards bolstering national defense capabilities and increasing military reserve forces throughout the continent.</p>

          <p>At least three people were killed after protestors set fire to a regional parliament building in Makassar, Indonesia, during widespread demonstrations. The protests, which have turned violent in several cities, were initially sparked by public anger over excessive housing allowances for lawmakers and were further fueled by the death of a ride-hailing driver during a rally in Jakarta. The incident has led to hundreds of arrests and criticism from human rights groups over the police's forceful crackdown on demonstrators.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso has indicated that Republicans are prepared to unilaterally change Senate rules, a move known as the "nuclear option," to confirm President Trump's stalled nominees. This consideration comes after negotiations with Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, fell apart over funding demands, leaving 145 nominations pending. Barrasso argues the blockade is purely political, while Schumer contends the nominees are "historically bad," setting the stage for a major procedural showdown when the Senate returns.</p>

          <p>Despite the artificial intelligence sector bolstering the stock market, recent events are raising concerns about a potential bubble. AI chip leader Nvidia saw its stock fall even after reporting blockbuster profits, reflecting investor uncertainty and a new MIT survey showing 95% of companies experimenting with AI are not yet generating revenue from it. This market anxiety is compounded by the Trump administration's increasing intervention in the tech industry, including a controversial deal with Nvidia and taking a stake in Intel, creating a complex economic outlook.

Defensively, United's two-man midfield is often outnumbered, allowing opponents to control the game, raising questions about whether Amorim's methods need adaptation for the higher level of competition.</p>
