          <p>The Panama Canal is facing potential business challenges due to President Trump's trade war with China, which has caused a decline in manufactured goods ordered by U.S. shippers. As a critical passage for U.S. East Coast-bound container traffic, the canal's revenue could be impacted by the decrease in vessel transits and container movement. The Panama Canal Authority acknowledges that any recession in the U.S. would affect the canal, as approximately 75% of its cargo involves the United States. The canal has also been a focal point of controversy amid claims from Trump that China controls key ports, which both China and Panama deny.</p>

          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her family's home in Wisconsin in 1962, has been found alive and well, residing out of state. The Sauk County Sheriff‚Äôs Office reports that her disappearance was a personal choice and not due to any criminal activity or foul play. The case was reopened earlier this year, involving a thorough re-evaluation of case files and interviews.

          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project (LAIP) has announced new evidence in the Scott Peterson murder case, claiming it "eviscerates" the prosecution's theory and proves Peterson's innocence.

The new evidence includes details of a burglary near the Peterson's home on the day of Laci's disappearance and revised fetal growth data suggesting Laci was killed days after the prosecution claimed, challenging the timeline.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is considering legal challenges against the government to prevent migrants from being housed in areas where it now controls the local council. Party chairman Zia Yusuf said Reform would use every instrument of power available, including judicial reviews, to resist housing asylum seekers. The Home Office is responsible for housing adult asylum seekers, and while councils can object, they have little power to stop it. Reform gained more than 600 seats and took control of 10 local authorities in the local elections.</p>
