          <p>Council tax in the UK is projected to increase by 5% annually to finance local services, including policing, as indicated by documents in the Spending Review. Local authorities have the autonomy to raise the tax by up to 5% each year without requiring central government approval, and the Spending Review assumes councils will implement the maximum increase. This tax increase is factored into the government's calculations, which project an average rise in "police spending power" of 2.3% per year in real terms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that councils are not obligated to raise council tax by the full 5%.</p>

Despite heightened tensions in the region, the U.S. delegation still intends to participate, with Iran expressing optimism that a mutually beneficial agreement ensuring the peaceful nature of its nuclear program is achievable under IAEA supervision.

He will also emphasize that Illinois remains committed to public safety and cooperates with federal immigration officers executing criminal warrants, while prioritizing the state's best interests when allocating resources.

This tactic has caught judges and lawyers off guard and is part of a broader effort to streamline cases and expedite deportations. Critics argue that this approach bypasses the legal system and denies individuals the opportunity for a fair hearing, while ICE maintains it is simply following the law.

          <p>Washington, D.C., is set to host a large military parade to commemorate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday and Flag Day. The parade is expected to involve over 6,000 soldiers, 50 aircraft, 150 vehicles, and even animals, costing between $25 million and $45 million. While some Democratic lawmakers have criticized the event as a vanity project and misuse of funds, Trump has defended the cost, emphasizing the importance of celebrating the nation's military strength. Counter-protests are planned in over 1,800 cities across the country to denounce what organizers call anti-democratic policies. </p>
