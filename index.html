          <p>The South Korean government has secured an agreement with the United States for the release of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. U.S. officials had detained 475 people, including over 300 South Korean nationals, for allegedly working illegally. The Trump administration defended the raid as standard procedure by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to protect American jobs. The incident has raised concerns in Seoul about its timing amid sensitive trade negotiations between the two allied nations.</p>

          <p>Russia launched its largest aerial assault of the war on Ukraine, involving over 800 drones and missiles, which resulted in damage to the Cabinet of Ministers building in Kyiv. The attack killed at least two people in the capital, identified as a mother and her three-month-old child, and injured numerous others across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the strike as a deliberate crime and reiterated his urgent call for stronger air defense systems and increased international sanctions against Russia to halt such attacks on civilian and government infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that the Trump administration is escalating a failed 'war on drugs' into a more dangerous reality by using military force against alleged traffickers. The piece critiques a recent U.S. strike on a Venezuelan boat, which killed 11 people, as an act of extrajudicial killing that sets a hazardous precedent for military action without congressional or UN approval. The article suggests this approach is counterproductive, likely to alienate international partners, and serves more as a macho spectacle than an effective policy to curb the drug trade.</p>

          <p>England achieved a historic 342-run victory over South Africa in their third one-day international match, marking the largest winning margin in men's ODI history. The win was powered by Jacob Bethell's first professional century and a hundred from Joe Root, which propelled England to a total of 414-5. Bowler Jofra Archer then dismantled the South African batting lineup, taking four wickets in a devastating opening spell. Although South Africa had already won the series, the dominant performance served as a significant morale boost for the English team.</p>

In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually. The article notes that lottery sales can be a substantial source of state revenue, accounting for up to 3% in some states like Rhode Island and South Dakota. This data provides insight into regional gambling habits as a major Powerball jackpot recently swelled to nearly $1.8 billion.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its immigration enforcement efforts with a new operation in Boston, dubbed "Patriot 2.0," while continuing to threaten a similar crackdown in Chicago. President Trump has defended his focus on these cities, citing crime rates, and has used provocative, war-like imagery on social media to describe the planned actions. These moves follow the recent renaming of the Department of Defense to the Department of War via executive order, signaling a more aggressive posture on domestic issues like immigration and crime.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 people demonstrated in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Protesters, including family members of the abductees, voiced strong opposition to the government's plans to intensify the war, fearing it will further endanger the lives of those in captivity. The large-scale protests reflect growing domestic pressure on the Israeli government's strategy, which maintains that total military victory is the path to bringing the hostages home.</p>

          <p>A Black man in South Carolina is urging the state to enact a hate crime law after being the victim of a racially motivated attack in which a white man allegedly fired a rifle over his head and shouted racial slurs. The alleged perpetrator was charged under a local county ordinance, as South Carolina is one of only two U.S. states without a statewide hate crime law that would allow for sentence enhancements. The incident has renewed calls from survivors of the Charleston church massacre and business leaders for the Republican-led state senate to pass the long-stalled legislation.</p>

          <p>The advancement of artificial intelligence is poised to disrupt not just entry-level jobs but the entire structure of career advancement, effectively ending the traditional 'career ladder.' As AI automates more tasks and corporate hierarchies flatten, the conventional path from the mailroom to the boardroom is becoming obsolete. This shift presents a major challenge for new graduates, who now need to acquire specialized skills before entering the workforce, and it raises critical questions for companies about future talent development and knowledge transfer.</p>

          <p>Four former high-ranking physicians from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have spoken out against the new public health policies being implemented by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Having recently resigned, the doctors expressed deep concern that changes, such as new COVID vaccine recommendations for children, are compromising scientific integrity and endangering the nation's health. Their departure follows the controversial firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, signaling a growing rift within the Trump administration over vaccine science and public health strategy.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that while the Trump administration's recent elimination of a tariff loophole for purchases under $800 will impact some businesses, the widespread concern may be misdirected. The article contends that the majority of America's 33 million small businesses are service-based and do not directly import goods, meaning they will be unaffected by this specific policy. The more critical economic question, it argues, is whether the broader economy and consumer incomes can continue to absorb the price increases resulting from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This 12-hour voyage is the longest ever in such a vessel and aims to demonstrate the potential of fungal-based materials as a biodegradable alternative to the plastics commonly used in marine recreation.</p>

Most arrests were made under the Terrorism Act for showing support for a proscribed organization, with 17 additional arrests for assaults on police officers. Protest organizers, Defend Our Juries, stated the demonstration was peaceful and accused the police of using violence, arguing that the mass arrests demonstrate the ban is unenforceable and a waste of resources.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people in Denmark, Taiwan, and the U.S. has found a consistent, decades-long pattern of individuals forming couples with partners who share similar psychiatric diagnoses. The research identified significant correlations for nine disorders, including anxiety, depression, and ADHD, suggesting that people may be drawn to those with shared experiences of suffering. Researchers theorize that shared environments or the stigma surrounding mental illness could also contribute to this phenomenon of assortative mating.</p>

          <p>The Colombian port town of Leticia, the nation's sole access to the Amazon River, faces the risk of being left landlocked as the river's main channel shifts southward into Peruvian territory. This natural phenomenon is intensifying a border dispute with Peru over the sovereignty of Santa Rosa Island, which now lies between the old and new river channels. The situation threatens Leticia's river-dependent economy and has prompted renewed diplomatic discussions between the two countries to address the complex territorial and logistical challenges.</p>

The case, which has drawn significant media attention, pits the country's strict anti-migration policies against the moral and legal obligations to provide aid. Prosecutors are seeking prison time, arguing the activists undermined state security, while the defense maintains their actions were necessary to save lives in the face of illegal government pushbacks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles have been eliminated from the Women's Rugby World Cup, despite a decisive 60-0 victory over Samoa in their final pool stage match. The team's exit was determined by points differential after Australia's performance against England secured them the last quarter-final position. Although the result is disappointing for the American side, their performance showcased the talent of emerging young stars, such as 22-year-old Freda Tafuna who scored four tries, offering a hopeful outlook for the team's future in international rugby.</p>
