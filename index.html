        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a combative address to the United Nations General Assembly, former President Donald Trump heavily criticized the international body, accusing it of failing to live up to its potential and solving global conflicts with empty words. He also took aim at world leaders on issues ranging from migration to the Russia-Ukraine war, stating their countries were being ruined by uncontrolled migration. Trump touted his administration's accomplishments and threatened Russia with powerful tariffs if it did not agree to a peace deal, while also admonishing European nations for purchasing Russian energy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has caused significant confusion among immigrant workers and their employers, particularly regarding travel for current visa holders. Although the White House clarified the one-time fee applies only to new applicants, immigration attorneys express concern over gray areas, such as how it might affect those renewing visas or changing employers. This uncertainty has prompted some lawyers to advise their clients' H-1B employees to avoid international travel until further guidance is issued from federal agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee voiced caution about lowering interest rates too aggressively, despite recently voting for a rate cut. He stated that while rates can gradually decrease if stagflationary pressures ease, the central bank must be careful given that inflation has remained above its target for over four years. Goolsbee's comments reflect the Federal Reserve's delicate task of navigating a slowing economy and a weaker labor market while trying to guide inflation back to its 2% goal.

          <p>The UK's Home Office has lost its appeal to overturn a court order that blocked the removal of an Eritrean asylum seeker to France. This case is one of the first under the new "one in, one out" agreement between the two countries, which allows the UK to return migrants who arrive via small boats. Judges upheld the injunction, agreeing there was a serious issue to be tried regarding whether the government was acting against its own legal guidance on modern slavery claims, thus delaying the man's removal.</p>

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has forecast that the United Kingdom will have the highest inflation rate among the G7 advanced economies in 2025, raising its prediction to 3.5%. The report cites higher food costs as a key factor and anticipates that UK economic growth will slow in the following year due to a tighter fiscal stance. This economic outlook places additional pressure on the UK government as it prepares for the upcoming November Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket selectors have announced a 16-man squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring a surprise recall for off-spinning all-rounder Will Jacks. In another significant move, batsman Harry Brook has been named vice-captain, replacing Ollie Pope, which may increase pressure on Pope's position at number three. The squad includes a formidable pace-bowling contingent, with Mark Wood returning from injury to join a group capable of generating the high speeds deemed necessary for success on Australian pitches.</p>

          <p>While England enters the Women's Rugby World Cup final as the top-ranked and undefeated favorite, their opponent, Canada, poses a significant threat. The second-ranked Canadian team, also undefeated this year, demonstrated their strength by decisively beating defending champions New Zealand in the semi-finals. Canada's success is attributed to its fast-paced, fluid style of play and the second-fastest ruck speed in the tournament, creating a chaotic and unpredictable attack that could challenge England's structured defense in the highly anticipated final.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Strategies for Securing Lower Mortgage Rates This Fall</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates remain elevated, financial experts are advising potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance on several strategies to secure a lower rate. Key recommendations include shopping around and comparing quotes from multiple lenders, working to increase one's credit score, and exploring alternative loan options. These alternatives include adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which offer a lower initial rate, or shorter-term loans like a 15-year mortgage, which typically have better rates than the standard 30-year option.

The suspension followed comments made by Kimmel linking the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement, which prompted major ABC affiliate owners like Sinclair and Nexstar to threaten to preempt the program. Disney stated that after thoughtful conversations with the host, the decision was made to bring the show back.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed nearly 20 more immigration judges, contributing to a loss of over 125 judges this year due to firings and resignations. This reduction in judicial staff is exacerbating a historic case backlog that now stands at nearly 4 million, pushing some case dates as far out as 2029. Advocates and the judges' union argue that the firings are illogical, undermine the law, and delay justice at a time when immigration enforcement is a stated administrative priority.</p>

          <p>After a period of strengthening in the first half of the year, the rate of rent growth for single-family homes began to slow in July, according to new data from Cotality. The annual increase fell below the pre-pandemic average, with weakening growth observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers. This cooling trend could indicate that landlords are beginning to feel pressure from a struggling consumer base, potentially leading to more competitive rental pricing in the near future.</p>

While large corporations may be able to comply, there are significant concerns that smallholders, who manage over 40% of Indonesia's plantations, will struggle to meet the traceability requirements and risk being excluded from the supply chain.</p>
