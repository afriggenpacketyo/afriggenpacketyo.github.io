          <h2>Businesses Legally Circumvent Tariffs Using the First Sale Rule</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule," which allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. This rule gained renewed attention during the Trump administration's tariff regime, enabling companies to reduce costs, particularly in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products. The criteria for applying the rule include at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, sales carried out at arm's length by independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. Moncler, an Italian luxury fashion brand, has flagged the first sale rule as providing "significant benefit" to its cost structure.</p>

          <p>China is set to receive the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming, named Su Hai No 1, in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to enhance its seafood supply through offshore aquaculture. Built by Huangpu Wenchong Shipyard at a cost of $83.6 million, the vessel is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the Su Hai No 1 can quickly relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery to domestic markets, reducing reliance on imported chilled salmon. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security amid global climate change and geopolitical tensions.</p>

These methods include stockpiling chips, optimizing AI models for efficiency, and utilizing domestically produced semiconductors. Tencent president Martin Lau mentioned the company's substantial stockpile of GPUs and its ability to achieve strong AI training results with a smaller number of chips. Baidu is emphasizing its "full-stack" capabilities, combining cloud computing infrastructure, AI models, and applications to drive down costs and improve GPU utilization.

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, loyal to Nicol√°s Maduro, declared an overwhelming victory in regional and legislative elections, despite sparsely populated polling places and boycotts by opposition leaders. The results, announced on state television without evidence, stripped the opposition of key positions, including the governor‚Äôs seat of Zulia, the country‚Äôs most populous state. The electoral council claimed turnout exceeded 40 percent, though independent observers were absent and results were not posted online as in previous elections. Opposition figure Mar√≠a Corina Machado had called for abstention, and the announcement follows a presidential election where Maduro claimed victory despite counts showing a loss to Edmundo Gonz√°lez, deemed a ‚Äúfalsification‚Äù by the Carter Center.</p>

Hardin pleaded guilty in 2017 to first-degree murder for the shooting death of James Appleton and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism reveals that sleep helps the brain flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. Researchers discovered that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.</p>

          <p>Wild chickens have become increasingly prevalent in Miami, inhabiting residential neighborhoods and even the downtown area, and are embraced by many as an unofficial mascot. These fowl are closely connected to the cultural heritage of people who have moved to Miami from rural areas of Cuba and Latin America. In Little Havana, fiberglass rooster statues were installed in 2002 to celebrate the area's culture, further solidifying the birds' symbolic status. While some worry about the impact of development and gentrification on the chicken population, residents like Donato Ramos Mart√≠nez appreciate their presence and consider them an integral part of the community.</p>

          <p>As South Korea prepares for an election to replace its president, many women feel their priorities are not being adequately addressed by the candidates. Despite their active role in protests against the previous administration, issues such as gender-based discrimination, lower pay, and online sexual abuse remain largely unaddressed. Many young men consider themselves victims of reverse discrimination, leading politicians to avoid feminist messages to secure votes. While some candidates have proposed measures to help women, fundamental issues like anti-discrimination legislation and expanding the definition of sexual assault remain untouched, leaving many women feeling they have limited options in the upcoming election.</p>

A study reveals that by 2030, the world‚Äôs longest suspension spans and tallest crossings will bear the imprint of Chinese civil engineers.

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to lower soaring prices, with the aim of reducing them to around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move seeks to address public criticism over the government's perceived ineffectiveness in controlling rice prices amidst broader inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system to exert greater influence over prices. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, partly due to a poor harvest.</p>

          <p>According to Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025," approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted to the platform in 2024 were identified as fake. This increase compared to 2022 is attributed to a more aggressive stance against "incentivized reviews" and improvements in the company's detection system. Tripadvisor employs a three-pronged process that relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews. The company is continuously improving its technology, which increasingly focuses on how a review is posted rather than what it says, to combat paid reviews and other fraudulent activities.</p>
