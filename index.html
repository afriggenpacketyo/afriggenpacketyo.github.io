          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced its second air traffic control outage in two weeks, causing significant flight delays and cancellations. The FAA confirmed the 90-second telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar display at the Philadelphia TRACON Area C, which guides aircraft in and out of Newark's airspace. Senator Charles Schumer called for immediate action to fix the connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center, while Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to overhaul the U.S. air traffic control system. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark amid these ongoing issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle undocumented immigrants, according to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller stated the Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus during a time of invasion, an option they are actively considering depending on court decisions. The administration is currently facing multiple lawsuits over its handling of undocumented immigrants and has criticized federal courts for impeding the deportation process. The writ of habeas corpus, requiring authorities to justify an individual's confinement in court, has been suspended only a few times in U.S. history, primarily during the Civil War and other insurrections.</p>

President Trump suggested potential tariff reductions to 80% ahead of trade negotiations with China, but the high levies continue to disrupt trade patterns.

Economists warn that even with a lower tariff rate, businesses will still face higher costs, which could lead to increased prices for consumers and potential economic slowdown. The deal's impact on the U.S. economy remains uncertain, with concerns over ongoing trade tensions and the risk of a recession.</p>

          <p>A man died at San Francisco's Ocean Beach after entering the water to save his dog, which survived the incident. Ocean Beach is known for its strong rip currents, powerful waves, and cold water temperatures, making it one of California's most dangerous beaches. Despite the risks, there are no traditional lifeguards, but Ocean Rescue personnel patrol the area. Authorities urged the public to call 911 for rescues instead of attempting them personally due to the perilous conditions. Between 2014 and 2020, eight people died at Ocean Beach, highlighting the need for caution.</p>

Failure to do so would have devastating consequences for the financial system and America's global leadership.

The debate centers around extending tax cuts passed in 2017 and whether to raise the top individual tax rate to generate revenue and address the national debt.</p>
