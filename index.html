          <p>The Powerball jackpot has reached an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing after no one won Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize, with a cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. This jackpot is poised to be the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot won in November 2022 and the $1.765 billion jackpot won in October 2023. There have been six jackpots exceeding $1 billion in Powerball's 33-year history, with four won this year alone, and the odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million. Saturday's drawing marks the 42nd since the last Powerball jackpot was won on May 31, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings without a winner.

          <p>Donald Trump stated on Truth Social that he is considering revoking Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship, a threat he has made before despite its legal impossibility under the 14th Amendment. O'Donnell, born in New York, responded to Trump's July statement referencing a "Game of Thrones" character and asserting her right to speak freely. Trump's feud with O'Donnell dates back to 2006 when she criticized his leniency toward a Miss USA winner. In March, Trump dismissed O'Donnell when the Irish prime minister was asked about her moving to Ireland, where she is seeking dual citizenship, citing the current political climate in the U.S. This article provides context on the long-standing conflict between the two public figures.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced gains, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, although economic concerns continue to cast a shadow. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose by 1.56%, propelled by domestic tech stocks like SoftBank Group, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.96% after positive household spending data. In contrast, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell by 1.21%, and mainland China's CSI 300 declined by 2.47% amidst volatile trading, as global bond markets remain under scrutiny with rising borrowing costs. The article notes that the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield nudged above 5% after a court ruling questioned the future of tariff revenues. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>

          <p>Nidec Corp's shares experienced a significant drop of up to 22.44% following the announcement of an investigation into potential accounting irregularities within the company. The probe was initiated after an internal review of Nidec's Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor, revealed possible links between the management and the alleged malpractice. This announcement follows a previous delay in submitting its financial report due to potentially incorrect declarations of country of origin for certain motors, which could have led to unpaid import tariffs. Nidec, a major manufacturer of mini and brushless motors used in various devices, has seen its shares decline by 10.61% since the beginning of the year.

          <p>France is facing unexpected fiscal challenges, drawing unfavorable comparisons to Italy, which was previously known for political and economic instability. Economists are questioning if France is becoming the "new Italy" due to ongoing political disputes, unresolved budget issues, and frequent changes in prime ministers. France's debt is 113% of its GDP, lower than Italy's 135%, but France's deficit is higher at 5.8% compared to Italy's 3.4%, with Prime Minister Francois Bayrou calling for a confidence vote on a budget containing significant cuts. The article notes that political instability and budget disagreements are raising concerns about France's debt sustainability. The optimism score has not been included in this summary.</p>
