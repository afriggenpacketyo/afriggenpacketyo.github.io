            <p>Home equity loan and HELOC interest rates are currently averaging 8.40% and 8.02% respectively, as of April 18, 2025, influenced by federal funds rate adjustments. Securing a favorable rate involves comparing quotes from multiple lenders, selecting an appropriate loan term, and improving credit scores. While rates fluctuate, home equity products often offer competitive interest compared to other financing options like credit cards. Homeowners can leverage their equity for various financial needs, but careful consideration of terms and financial goals is crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A U.S. District Judge threatened to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for allegedly defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador.

The administration denies violating the order and plans to appeal, arguing the judge's decision was misconceived.

The decline comes ahead of new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, creating uncertainty for Apple's manufacturing supply chain and China's smartphone industry. The Trump administration has imposed cumulative tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods, while Beijing has responded with a 125% tariff on U.S. goods.</p>

The grassroots effort, unaffiliated with Mamdani's campaign, aims to boost his name recognition and appeal to working-class voters. Mamdani's platform includes policies such as a $30 minimum wage, city-owned grocery stores, and free childcare and bus fares. The movement draws inspiration from the "Hot Girls for Bernie" campaign in 2020, using the term "hot" as a tongue-in-cheek way for voters to self-identify and mobilize support.</p>

Harvard argues that revoking its tax-exempt status would be unlawful and harm its educational mission, leading to potential legal challenges.

            <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction restricting the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from accessing sensitive personal information within the Social Security Administration (SSA). Judge Ellen Hollander cited concerns about the agency's "unprecedented, unfettered access" to millions of Americans' data, questioning why a more targeted approach wasn't used. The ruling prevents DOGE staffers from accessing Social Security databases containing personally identifiable information and directs them to delete any non-anonymized data in their possession. The decision follows concerns about DOGE's data access practices across multiple federal agencies.</p>

This conversation occurs before Vice-President JD Vance's visit to India for discussions on economic, trade, and geopolitical ties. Musk's companies, Starlink and Tesla, are exploring opportunities in India, with Starlink signing agreements with Indian telecoms and Tesla hiring for positions in Delhi and Mumbai. These developments take place amid an intensifying trade war between the US and China, with India seeking a bilateral trade agreement with the US.</p>

            <p>Gerald Yin Zheyao, founder, chairman, and CEO of Chinese semiconductor equipment maker AMEC, has renounced his U.S. citizenship and restored his Chinese nationality. This change reflects the escalating tech war between China and the U.S., particularly after restrictions were placed on "US persons" involved in chip development in China. Last year, two other AMEC executives with U.S. citizenship also stepped down from their positions. This move signals the increasing bifurcation of semiconductor supply chains between the two countries.</p>

            <p>Michael Plant argues that President Trump's policies are fostering selfishness and disregard for others, evidenced by actions like dismantling USAID and undermining international cooperation. This trend exacerbates declining happiness and trust in Western societies. He suggests that resisting Trumpism requires embodying opposite virtues, building social connections, and promoting policies that prioritize social well-being. Fighting back involves choosing kindness, generosity, and evidence over cruelty, selfishness, and bluster, ultimately contributing to a happier, higher-trust society.</p>

            <p>A large study published in Frontiers in Oncology suggests medical cannabis has potential in treating cancer symptoms and possibly fighting the disease itself. The analysis of over 10,000 studies found strong support for cannabis in treating inflammation, appetite loss, and nausea, and indicated potential to fight cancer cells. While some experts remain skeptical, citing flawed studies and a lack of clinical evidence in humans, the study's authors hope it will encourage the reclassification of cannabis to facilitate further research. The study showed that 75% of the studies showed medical cannabis improved cancer outcomes.</p>
