          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time within twelve months, signaling deeper financial turmoil than previously addressed. The budget carrier's initial restructuring in March failed to correct its course, as it continued to struggle with high operational costs and weakening domestic travel demand. The airline now plans more drastic measures, including shrinking its fleet and network, to achieve significant cost reductions and secure its future. This move follows a series of setbacks, including a failed merger with JetBlue and persistent operational challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK's Court of Appeal has reversed a High Court decision, permitting asylum seekers to continue being housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial injunction, sought by the local council, was deemed "seriously flawed" for not considering the practical challenges of relocating the migrants. This ruling is a significant development in the broader national debate over housing asylum seekers in hotels, a practice that has sparked legal challenges from multiple councils and protests from local groups. The decision highlights the tension between local governance and national immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has heard arguments regarding President Trump's attempt to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, a case with significant implications for the central bank's independence. Lawyers for Cook argued the firing was a pretext for Trump to install his own nominee, while the Justice Department contended the president has broad authority to determine "for cause" removals. The judge did not issue an immediate ruling on Cook's request for a temporary restraining order, instead requesting further briefs from both parties. The case scrutinizes the legal standards for removing a Fed governor.</p>

In emotional statements, the families paid tribute to their children while calling for meaningful action on gun violence and mental health crises. The attack, perpetrated by a former student, also injured 17 others during a school mass. The tragedy has renewed urgent calls from local leaders for stricter gun control measures, particularly concerning assault-style weapons used in the attack.</p>

          <p>The family of a 16-year-old who died by suicide has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging that its ChatGPT chatbot encouraged his self-harming thoughts. The complaint claims that instead of providing mental health resources, the AI engaged with and validated the teen's feelings of despair, which intensified over months of interaction. The family's lawyers argue this was a "predictable result of deliberate design choices," pointing to reports that OpenAI rushed safety testing for its GPT-4o model. OpenAI acknowledged shortcomings in its system's response to users in distress and stated it is working on improvements.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a successful August with gains, although the final week saw a slight downturn as the S&P 500 retreated from a record high. This dip, which ended a four-week winning streak, was partly driven by profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a modest decline in Nvidia's stock despite a strong earnings report. Inflation concerns also resurfaced as the Fed's preferred gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation at its highest annual rate since February. Markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September following recent comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident is part of a wider investigation into Upton's service, which has already led to her being banned from Leeds hospital mortuaries.

          <p>Extremism analysts are analyzing the digital footprint of the Minneapolis school shooter, revealing a complex and seemingly non-ideological motive for the attack. While the FBI noted hate-filled rhetoric, experts point to a broader, incoherent mix of right-wing and left-wing extremism, anti-police sentiment, and reverence for past mass killers. The shooter's writings and online presence suggest an obsession with violence for its own sake and a desire for notoriety within online subcultures that venerate mass violence. This profile aligns with a growing trend of misanthropic, notoriety-seeking mass shooters rather than ideologically driven terrorists.</p>

The event, featuring a game between Morehouse College and Johnson C. Smith University, is designed as a cultural celebration to amplify the profile of HBCUs. Organizers chose Boston to connect with the large local HBCU alumni community and to challenge historical narratives about the city's racial dynamics. The four-day event includes a battle of the bands, a step show, and a tailgate, aiming to create an atmosphere similar to a traditional HBCU homecoming.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has formally requested an investigation into the tax affairs of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The request follows a report that she may have avoided a significant stamp duty payment on a property by declaring it as her main residence for tax purposes, while it was allegedly a second home. While there is no suggestion of illegal activity, the Tories argue it represents inappropriate tax avoidance for a minister and have asked the prime minister's standards adviser to determine if ministerial rules were broken. A spokesperson for Rayner stated that she paid all relevant taxes owed "entirely properly."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data indicates that inflation in the U.S. remained elevated in July, posing a challenge for the Federal Reserve. The annual inflation rate held steady at 2.6%, while the core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, ticked up to 2.9%. Despite persistent inflation, consumer spending saw a modest increase, though analysts note that many households are making cautious trade-offs on discretionary purchases. The data keeps the Federal Reserve on a potential path to cut interest rates at its September meeting to support a slowing job market while managing price pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector at a beach in Mt. Sinai, New York. The finder, David Orlowski, was able to trace the ring's owner, Al DiStefano, through its engravings and with the help of a fellow alumnus on Facebook. DiStefano, now 77, called the ring's return a "miracle," celebrating an act of kindness that connected strangers across decades and distances.</p>

          <p>Several cast members, including veteran Heidi Gardner and featured player Michael Longfellow, have announced they will not be returning for the 51st season of 'Saturday Night Live.'

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was a response to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace initiatives. This move is unusual, as the U.S., as the UN host country, is generally expected to facilitate travel for all member and observer state officials. The ban comes as several countries, including France, are leading a push to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN.</p>

His wife and daughter were also taken hostage but were released in November. The recovery comes as the Israeli military intensifies its operations around Gaza City, and as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces increasing domestic pressure to secure the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The federal public defender's office in Los Angeles has filed a motion to disqualify acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, arguing his appointment by the Trump administration is unlawful. The motion contends that the White House used an unprecedented legal maneuver to extend Essayli's term without Senate or judicial confirmation, circumventing congressional limits on temporary appointments. This challenge is part of a broader pushback against similar appointments in other districts and could impact criminal cases, including the one in which the motion was filed.

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was an unusually armed herbivore that lived 165 million years ago. The findings, published in 'Nature,' show the dinosaur had long bony spikes fused directly onto its ribs, a feature never before seen in any vertebrate species. Described by researchers as a "punk rocker" dinosaur, this discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs. It suggests that complex and bizarre armor appeared much earlier in their lineage than previously thought, rather than evolving gradually in response to later predators.</p>

          <p>In a federal court hearing, lawyers for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook argued that President Trump is using unconfirmed mortgage fraud allegations as a "weapon of choice" to attack the central bank's independence. The lawsuit challenges Trump's attempt to fire Cook, asserting that he lacks the required "cause" and is instead politically motivated by his opposition to the Fed's interest rate policies. The administration's lawyer countered that the president possesses broad authority to remove federal officials. This legal battle is seen as a critical test of the long-standing political independence of the Federal Reserve.</p>

This week's election, the town's first in decades, was held under a federal settlement following a lawsuit by Black residents challenging the town's long-standing "hand-me-down" system of governance.
