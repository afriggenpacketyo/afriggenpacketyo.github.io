          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:05:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is launching a trial to equip specially trained prison officers with Tasers in England and Wales to combat escalating violence. This pilot program follows new data revealing over £20 million paid in assault-related damages to staff and inmates over five years. The Prison Officers' Association supports the move as a necessary tool for safety, though some express concerns about the risks of a wider rollout. The trial will focus on specialist units that respond to the most serious incidents, such as riots and hostage situations, aiming to provide staff with better protection.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests New US-EU Trade Deal Could Significantly Reduce Global Exports to the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:04:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new trade deal between the United States and the European Union, which imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods, is projected to cause a significant shift in global trade dynamics. According to an economic modeling tool, the agreement could lead to a more than 46% drop in global exports to the U.S. by 2027 compared to recent averages. The forecast suggests that while the U.S. will import more from the UK and France, imports from key partners like China, Canada, and Mexico are expected to decrease substantially. This shift is anticipated to cause supply chain reconfigurations and potentially reduce product diversity for American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 21:01:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, causing its shares to rise over 2% in early trading. The South Korean technology giant did not disclose the name of the counterparty, citing a request to protect trade secrets, with details to remain confidential until the contract ends on December 31, 2033. This long-term agreement highlights the sustained demand for semiconductors and strengthens Samsung's position as the world's second-largest foundry service provider. The company advised investors to be cautious, as the contract's confidential nature limits public information about its terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented new rules to foster innovation by offering leniency to researchers whose government-funded projects fail. The policy states that innovators will not be punished for failures if there was no misconduct or abuse of power, and if reasonable corrective actions were taken. This protection applies in scenarios such as insurmountable technical difficulties or market changes rendering a product unviable. The goal is to encourage researchers to explore bold, uncharted territories without the fear that an unsuccessful project will negatively impact their careers or future funding opportunities.</p>

          <p>Japan's political landscape is experiencing a significant shift with the surge of the far-right Sanseito party, which increased its parliamentary seats from one to fifteen in recent elections. Running on a "Japanese First" platform, the party has capitalized on public frustration over economic issues like high inflation, stagnant wages, and rising food prices. The movement also echoes populist trends seen elsewhere, focusing on anti-immigration rhetoric and concerns over the behavior of tourists, which has been amplified on social media. This development challenges the long-standing dominance of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and signals a new era of political volatility in a nation known for its stability.</p>

Many of these animals are sold online with minimal vetting, a process one expert called a "Deliveroo for dogs."

          <p>In a profile for "60 Minutes," comedian and "Last Week Tonight" host John Oliver emphasized that performing live stand-up comedy remains his favorite professional activity. Despite the success of his acclaimed HBO show, Oliver continues to hone his craft on stage. He explained that experiencing a poorly received set, or "bombing," is a crucial part of a comedian's development, stating that "failure is a hell of a tutor." For Oliver, the struggle of working through a difficult performance provides more valuable lessons than an easy success, reinforcing the importance of resilience in his comedic process.</p>

          <p>Argentina's human rights organizations, crucial for documenting the crimes of the 1976-1983 military dictatorship, are facing mass layoffs and funding cuts under President Javier Milei's new government. Agencies housed at the former ESMA detention center, now a UNESCO World Heritage site, have seen their staff decimated, including the National Archive of Remembrance and the Human Rights Secretariat. This threatens the ongoing work of groups like the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, who use DNA to identify children stolen at birth by the regime. Activists fear these cuts will undermine decades of progress in achieving truth, memory, and justice for the dictatorship's victims.</p>

          <p>A "60 Minutes" report details the story of Guillermo Pérez Roisinblit, a man who was stolen at birth in 1978 after his mother was detained and killed by Argentina's military dictatorship. Raised by a military-affiliated family, he discovered his true identity at age 21 after his biological sister, Mariana, found him. The revelation led to a painful journey of rebuilding his life while grappling with the fact that his adoptive father participated in his mother's capture. Though the truth fractured his family relationships, Guillermo has become a human rights lawyer, continuing the work of his biological grandmother to find other stolen children.</p>

          <p>An investigation by a photographer and a journalist, chronicled by "60 Minutes," successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 aircraft used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights" in the 1970s. The plane was used to drop political prisoners alive into the Atlantic Ocean. By finding the plane in the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs, investigators were able to provide crucial evidence linking specific flights to the disappearance of activists, including some of the founding Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. This evidence was instrumental in convicting the pilots for crimes against humanity, and the plane now stands as a memorial at a former detention center.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully dismantled a global child abuse network in an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull."

At least 18 individuals who led or utilized the network have been convicted, including William Spearman, a key administrator who received a life sentence. Officials described the network as one of the most significant of its kind, and its takedown represents a major victory for law enforcement in combating online child exploitation.</p>

The analyst maintains strong conviction, comparing the situation to previous premature sells of companies like Oracle and Emerson, and plans to purchase more shares.
