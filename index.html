          <p>Palantir announced it surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, beating Wall Street expectations and causing its stock to rally. The AI software provider's revenue grew 48%, driven by a 68% jump in U.S. revenues and significant government contracts, including a recent $10 billion deal with the U.S. Army. CEO Alex Karp highlighted a goal of increasing revenue while decreasing headcount, signaling a focus on efficiency. The company raised its full-year outlook, reflecting strong performance and investor confidence that has more than doubled its stock price this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge cited Combs as a flight risk and a danger to the community, referencing violent behavior seen in 2016 hotel surveillance footage. The defense argued that Combs' participation in a "swingers lifestyle" did not involve coercion, but the judge found evidence to the contrary. Combs will remain incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center, where he has been held for 11 months.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has placed former President Jair Bolsonaro under house arrest amid an ongoing trial over allegations that he plotted a coup. The decision came after Judge Alexandre de Moraes found that Bolsonaro had violated previous restraining orders by using allies' social media to encourage attacks on the court. The judge also banned him from receiving most visitors and using a mobile phone. The case has drawn international attention, with President Donald Trump citing the trial as justification for imposing new tariffs on some Brazilian goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global competition for rare earth minerals, essential for electronics, green energy, and military technology, is increasingly focused on developing nations with untapped reserves. China currently dominates the supply chain, controlling about 60% of mining and over 85% of processing, creating a strategic vulnerability for the United States and other Western countries. While the West is making diplomatic efforts to diversify its sources, analysts note a lack of sufficient investment and technical expertise to meaningfully shift away from Chinese dependence. This positions resource-rich developing countries as a new arena for geopolitical rivalry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed paperwork to reverse a Biden-era policy, aiming to block the Department of Veterans Affairs from providing abortions in cases of sexual assault, incest, or when the mother's health is at risk. The proposed rule change argues the current policy is "legally questionable" and inconsistent with congressional limits on federal funding for abortions. Critics, including Planned Parenthood, argue the move denies veterans control over their own bodies and puts their health at risk, especially since over half of female veterans live in states with abortion bans. The proposal is open for public comment.</p>

          <p>The recent departure of over 50 Texas Democratic lawmakers to block a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan echoes a similar event from July 2021. Three years ago, Democrats fled to Washington, D.C., to stall a vote on new voting restrictions, though they eventually returned after several weeks. In the current situation, Democrats have left the state to prevent a quorum, halting a vote on a congressional map that could create five new GOP-leaning districts.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer described the plan as a result of "grown-up diplomacy," while critics argue it will not be as effective as previous proposals and fails to address the need for safe, legal routes.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has died at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, an era that saw MI5 take on new counter-terrorism responsibilities and move toward greater public openness. Dame Stella was the first MI5 head to be publicly named upon appointment and was widely seen as the inspiration for Dame Judi Dench's portrayal of "M" in the James Bond films. After retiring, she became a successful author and was remembered by colleagues as a "true trailblazer."</p>

          <p>Conservative commentator Candace Owens has claimed that former President Donald Trump personally called her to request she stop promoting a debunked conspiracy theory about the gender of Brigitte Macron, the first lady of France. Owens, who is being sued for defamation by the Macrons, alleged that the French president raised the issue with Trump directly. According to Owens, Trump told her the claims were distressing to Mrs. Macron and that he had seen her "up close and she looks like a woman to me." The baseless theory is part of a wider trend targeting prominent women.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. defense industry is facing significant challenges in sourcing rare earth minerals following China's decision to restrict their export for defense purposes. This move has caused prices for some essential materials to skyrocket and exposed America's deep reliance on China, which controls roughly 90% of the global supply. These minerals are critical for manufacturing advanced weaponry, including fighter jets, drones, and missile systems. The Pentagon has accelerated investments in domestic production, but experts warn that China's control gives it powerful geopolitical leverage. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the nonprofit Circulate San Diego argues that complex third-party permitting requirements are a primary reason for significant delays and cost overruns on California's transit projects, including the high-speed rail. The regulations, originally intended to prevent unchecked infrastructure development, have now created a bureaucratic maze where multiple jurisdictions must sign off on projects. This system allows local disputes to stall progress for years. The report suggests adopting models from Canada, where transit agencies can self-permit if other bodies fail to act within a specific timeframe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beth Hammack, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, has warned that U.S. inflation could rise in 2025 as businesses begin passing the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs on to consumers. Many companies initially absorbed the costs by selling from stockpiled inventory or accepting lower margins, but are now reaching a point where price hikes are necessary. Hammack noted the existence of a "two-speed economy," where high-income households are thriving while lower-income families struggle. This potential for tariff-driven inflation complicates the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The July jobs report, which showed only 73,000 new nonfarm payrolls and significant downward revisions for the previous two months, confirms that the U.S. economy is slowing considerably. The three-month average for job gains has fallen to just 35,000, a fraction of last year's pace. Economists now see an elevated risk of recession, citing pressure from tariffs that could depress consumer spending and business investment. While GDP grew in the second quarter, the underlying data for the first half of the year shows much weaker growth, raising concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research proposes a novel explanation for the unusually high levels of nitrogen found in the remains of Neanderthals. Scientists suggest that this chemical signature may not be from a diet exclusively of large game, as previously thought, but could be the result of consuming maggots. The squirmy insects, which would have infested animal carcasses, are rich in nitrogen. This theory challenges long-held assumptions about the Neanderthal diet and offers a new perspective on how they utilized all available food resources in their environment.</p>
