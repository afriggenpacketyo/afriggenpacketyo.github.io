          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing shortages, as announced by CEO Scott Kirby. The FAA attributes the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia's traffic control center, which oversees Newark's airspace. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is set to unveil plans to revamp the air traffic control system to address these long-standing issues. Travelers are experiencing significant delays and cancellations, impacting airports across the country and causing frustration among passengers who are hoping for seamless travel experiences.</p>

          <p>Residents of Russia's Kursk region, near the Ukrainian border, are living in fear and feeling abandoned by Moscow after Ukrainian troops launched incursions into the area, leading to a humanitarian crisis. Thousands have fled their homes, and those who remain report constant drone attacks and shelling, while some accuse both Russian and Ukrainian forces of looting. Despite Russian military claims of regaining full control, conflicting reports persist, and residents express disillusionment with the lack of support from the government. Some locals quietly blame Putin for starting the war, while others express sympathy for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation, but are unsure if they will ever be able to return home.</p>

A recent study indicates that nearly half of the Communist Party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold PhDs, with a significant proportion coming from prestigious universities like Tsinghua University. This shift towards a technocratic meritocracy is seen as a philosophical shift rooted in Chinese tradition, where competence is valued over ideology.

          <p>California Democrats are considering a proposal to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians, sparking debate about ageism and the value of experience. The discussion follows concerns about leaders remaining in power too long, referencing instances such as Dianne Feinstein's declining health and Joseph R. Biden's age during his campaign. While some argue for making way for younger candidates, others caution against discriminating against experienced leaders like Bernie Sanders.

While some agree with Trump's call for increased European defense spending, there is concern that his administration may abandon them.

Reform's success reflects a mood of disillusionment with the Conservatives and Labour, appealing to a distinctive segment of the population that feels left behind by globalization and holds conservative views on immigration.
