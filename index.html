        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White addressed the intense physical challenges rookie Caitlin Clark has faced this season. Following a game where Clark sustained an apparent groin injury, White commented on the unique level of physicality opponents are permitted to use against her, suggesting the team must find ways to help her adjust. Clark, who was seen in tears on the sideline, is now listed as questionable for the upcoming game against the New York Liberty. White acknowledged that the entire WNBA has seen a rise in physical play, but noted the specific nature of the defensive pressure on Clark.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international, successfully chasing a target of 259 runs. All-rounder Deepti Sharma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 62, guiding the tourists to victory with 10 balls remaining. Despite a late rally from England that created a tense finish, India achieved its second-highest successful run chase in the format. England's performance was hampered by a slow start and sloppy fielding, though Sophia Dunkley's 83 and Alice Davidson-Richards' 53 provided some positives for the home team in the crucial series ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced it will use Google's cloud infrastructure to support its popular ChatGPT AI assistant, diversifying its computing resources beyond its initial exclusive reliance on Microsoft. This move addresses the heavy demand for OpenAI's services and the need for additional computing power, which CEO Sam Altman has previously highlighted as a capacity constraint. The partnership is a significant win for Google's cloud division, which also services AI competitor Anthropic. OpenAI will now leverage a multi-cloud strategy, using platforms from Google, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and Oracle to power its AI models and APIs globally.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is receiving accolades for his adept navigation of U.S.-China trade tensions, culminating in Washington's approval for Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese customers. Huang's strategy involved consistently arguing that excluding Nvidia from China would undermine U.S. tech leadership, a message that appears to have resonated with the Trump administration. Analysts praise his ability to cultivate relationships in both Washington and Beijing, turning a potential geopolitical crisis into a diplomatic victory for the company. This success has reinforced his status as a highly effective leader, further bolstering investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

While RFK Jr. has the authority to enact nationwide bans, he has so far focused on pressuring companies for voluntary changes, a strategy that avoids regulatory hurdles. This state-led approach may create de facto national standards, as companies might alter products to comply with the strictest state laws.</p>

Recent cases include South Africa's suit against Israel and Ukraine's against Russia.

The measures also specifically target steel melted and poured in China with an additional tariff, reflecting a broader strategy to reduce dependency on foreign steel. The government also pledged to prioritize Canadian steel in federal projects, aiming to bolster domestic production which has fallen significantly since the U.S. levies began.</p>

With the average credit card rate already exceeding 21%, any further increases would make it more difficult for individuals to pay down their balances.

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, has introduced the Presidential Library Anti-Corruption Act to impose restrictions on donations to presidential libraries. The bill comes after several large corporations, including Paramount Global and Walt Disney Co., made multi-million dollar payments to Donald Trump's future library as part of legal settlements. The proposed legislation would cap contributions, prohibit donations from lobbyists and foreign governments, and require public disclosure to prevent libraries from being used as a tool for corruption or to curry favor with a sitting president. The lawmakers argue that the current lack of rules creates significant loopholes for influence peddling.</p>

          <p>Four Louisiana law enforcement officials, including two active police chiefs, have been federally indicted for their alleged roles in a visa fraud conspiracy. Prosecutors allege the officials conspired with a local businessman to fabricate police reports of armed robberies, which were then used to help immigrants fraudulently apply for U visas, a special category for crime victims. The officials were allegedly paid $5,000 for each false report they created, which were used for hundreds of applications. The charges include conspiracy, visa fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering, carrying potential sentences of decades in prison.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-standing debate over Germany's staggered summer school vacation schedule is intensifying, as several states call for a fairer rotation system. Currently, the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg always receive the latest vacation slots, which they argue is necessary due to their traditional Pentecost holidays. Other states contend this is unfair, as it forces their residents to travel during peak season with higher prices. Proponents of the current system say it prevents traffic chaos and spreads tourism demand, but critics are demanding that the two southern states join the rotating schedule for a more equitable arrangement.</p>

However, optimism is waning, with fewer than half of the firms feeling positive about the future due to concerns over tariffs, policy uncertainty, and weak domestic demand in China.

The song's confrontational lyrics about the treatment of immigrant workers caught the attention of musicians like Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, who called them his "new favorite band." Morello subsequently invited the group to perform at his Defend L.A. benefit concert, which raised funds for immigrant rights.

In return for removing the post, British authorities offered a fast-tracked review of his case; the man is now understood to be in the UK.

The organization projects that exports from the world's 46 most vulnerable countries could fall by as much as 54% if the threatened tariffs are fully implemented.
