          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump is threatening a lawsuit exceeding $1 billion against Hunter Biden for defamation. The legal threat follows Biden's claim during an interview that Jeffrey Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump. Mrs. Trump's lawyers have demanded a retraction and apology, stating the allegation is false and has caused significant financial and reputational harm. Biden has refused to apologize, suggesting a lawsuit would allow him to depose both Trumps and is merely a distraction tactic. There is no evidence supporting the claim that Epstein, who died in 2019, introduced the couple.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a former mixed martial arts fighter, revealed he does not wear a seat belt while driving in Washington, D.C. He explained his decision during a Fox News appearance, stating it stems from a fear of being carjacked and needing to exit his vehicle quickly. Mullin clarified that while he typically uses a seat belt, he forgoes it in the capital due to the perceived prevalence of carjackings. His comments come as President Trump has initiated a crackdown on crime in the city, vowing to "take our capital back."</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's 'girls of the year' for inventing a device to help homeless individuals stay warm. At age 12, she designed a solar-powered blanket that stores solar energy during the day to provide heat at night. Engineering firm Thales developed her idea into a working prototype, with dozens of units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Young was also immortalized as a Lego mini-figure, an achievement her friends and family find remarkable.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is on track to intensify into the first hurricane of the Atlantic season, potentially reaching major Category 3 status by Sunday as it moves north of Puerto Rico. Current forecasts indicate the storm is not a direct threat to the United States mainland, with most meteorological models showing it remaining over the ocean between Bermuda and the East Coast. While Puerto Rico may experience rain and rough surf, the primary impact on the U.S. will be a high risk of rip currents along the East Coast from August 21 to 27. Meteorologists are monitoring the storm's path closely for any deviations.</p>

          <p>Pakistani authorities have detained numerous Afghan refugees in Islamabad, including individuals approved for relocation to Germany, as part of a broader crackdown. These refugees, some of whom are former local staff for German institutions, fled the Taliban takeover in 2021 and were awaiting entry to Germany. Advocacy groups report that families have been separated during night raids, with some individuals already deported to Afghanistan. The German government has acknowledged the detentions and is in contact with Pakistani officials, while facing criticism from opposition parties for not acting swiftly enough to issue visas and protect these vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, data analytics firm Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, pushing its market valuation past $430 billion. This growth is largely fueled by significant U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, international commercial revenues have declined, raising some concerns. The company's stock trades at a significant premium, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio over 280, dwarfing tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, reflecting immense investor confidence in its AI-powered future.

The staff member assigned to watch her was on his first shift and had used fraudulent credentials to get the job.

It also posits that drastic emission-reduction policies could cause more economic harm than climate change itself, advocating for open debate rather than enforced consensus on the issue.</p>

          <p>Amid rising costs and high interest rates, consumers are increasingly considering debt forgiveness and debt management to handle their finances. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay back less than the full amount owed, which can provide significant savings but severely damages one's credit score and may have tax implications. Conversely, debt management, typically arranged through a credit counseling agency, focuses on creating an affordable repayment plan with lower interest rates, allowing full repayment while preserving credit. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, with forgiveness being a last resort for severe hardship and management being better for those with steady income struggling with high interest.

This represents the largest monthly jump since June 2022 and suggests that inflationary pressures may still be a threat to the U.S. economy. The report indicates that businesses may be absorbing costs from tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers, but that could soon change. The unexpected surge complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates, slightly reducing market expectations for a rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Agricultural machinery giant John Deere has warned that tariffs could cost the company up to $600 million in fiscal year 2025, causing its stock to fall roughly 7%. The company reported that tariffs were a primary reason for decreased operating profits in its third quarter, with tariff expenses for the quarter alone reaching approximately $200 million. Despite beating earnings expectations, Deere saw significant year-over-year declines in both net income and sales. The company has trimmed its full-year net income outlook, reflecting the substantial economic headwinds and trade uncertainty affecting the agricultural sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The decline in project investment value comes as the kingdom faces lower global oil prices and a growing fiscal deficit. In response, the PIF has broadened its funding base and slightly reduced its international investments to focus more on domestic opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The E1 project has been frozen for decades due to strong international opposition, as settlements are considered illegal under international law.

          <p>Wholesale prices in the United States experienced their fastest increase in over three years, jumping 0.9% in July.

The report has renewed concerns about future consumer price inflation, which had recently appeared to stabilize. Economists warn that these rising costs will likely be passed on to consumers soon. The data also presents a dilemma for the Federal Reserve, which faces pressure from Trump to cut interest rates despite the building inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
