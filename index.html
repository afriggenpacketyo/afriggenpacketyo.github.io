        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic state lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on a Republican-led congressional redistricting plan. By leaving the state, the Democrats broke the House's quorum, effectively halting legislative proceedings on the controversial map, which would create five new GOP-leaning districts. Abbott's order directs state law enforcement to locate and return the absent members, though their jurisdiction is limited outside of Texas. This escalates a political standoff reminiscent of a similar walkout in 2021, with Republicans vowing consequences and Democrats defending their actions as a constitutionally protected measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant escalation of the Texas political standoff, Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit to remove Democratic Representative Gene Wu from office. The suit accuses Wu of being the "ringleader" of the legislative walkout and claims he has abandoned his official duties by fleeing the state to block a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. Wu responded by stating that denying a quorum is a constitutional tool and a fulfillment of his oath to oppose a "racist gerrymandered map." The governor is seeking an expedited ruling from the Texas Supreme Court, a move critics are calling a violation of the separation of powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of a medium-security state prison in Norco by fall 2026. The decision is attributed to a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will not release prisoners early but will transfer them to other institutions. The closure raises questions about the future of the property, which originally opened in 1928 as a luxury hotel before being converted into a hospital and then a prison.</p>

          <p>A House Oversight Committee has issued subpoenas to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of its investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan committee is seeking information regarding Epstein's history and connections, a move that follows the Trump administration's decision not to release additional federal files on the case. The subpoenas also target former attorneys general and FBI directors. The committee's letter cites Bill Clinton's acknowledged travel on Epstein's private plane and other reported encounters as the basis for requiring his deposition, reviving scrutiny of their past association.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced the termination of 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccine development, totaling nearly $500 million. Kennedy, a known vaccine skeptic, stated the decision was made because the technology allegedly fails to effectively protect against respiratory infections like COVID-19 and the flu. The move, which affects major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and Moderna, is part of a broader shift in U.S. health policy under the new administration. Health experts have criticized the decision, highlighting that mRNA technology was crucial in helping to end the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has arrested and charged two Chinese nationals in California for allegedly orchestrating an illegal export scheme involving tens of millions of dollars in sensitive technology. The individuals are accused of shipping advanced artificial intelligence chips, including Nvidia's powerful H100 GPUs, to China without the required export licenses. These chips are subject to strict U.S. export controls designed to prevent China from accessing cutting-edge semiconductor technology for military or strategic advantage. The DOJ alleges the defendants used their company to route the shipments through third countries like Malaysia to conceal their final destination.</p>

          <p>Japan marked the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima with a solemn ceremony at the city's Peace Memorial Park. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and other international officials attended the event, where a silent prayer was held to honor the more than 200,000 people killed by the blast and its aftereffects. In his speech, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the global trend of military buildup and the growing reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Survivors of the bombing shared their harrowing memories, calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons amid current global conflicts that echo the destruction they witnessed.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, parts of the Great Barrier Reef have suffered their most significant annual decline in coral cover in nearly 40 years of record-keeping. The report identifies widespread coral bleaching, caused primarily by heat stress from climate change, as the main driver of the damage. While cyclones and starfish outbreaks also contributed, the unprecedented heat has pushed the fragile ecosystem toward a potential tipping point where it can no longer recover between catastrophic events. This year marked the first time that both the Great Barrier Reef and Australia's second-largest reef experienced bleaching simultaneously.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy thinkers regarding whether to include measurable consumption targets in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a formal goal for the household consumption rate—the share of consumer spending in GDP—is a crucial national strategy to boost domestic demand. They point out that China's rate was a relatively low 39.6% in 2023. However, other influential voices contend that such metrics are not operationally feasible as policy goals, highlighting a key point of contention as Beijing formulates its future economic blueprint.

The breakthrough in the 50-year-old cold case was achieved using advanced DNA testing and forensic-grade genome sequencing from a few strands of the boy's hair. Investigators traced his family to Philadelphia and confirmed his identity by exhuming his mother, who died in 1980. While the boy now has a name, the circumstances of his death, and that of his infant brother who also disappeared, remain unsolved.

While no sanctions were imposed and the current leadership will remain, the commission issued a regulatory action plan to address governance weaknesses. The outcome is mixed for Prince Harry, who resigned from the charity earlier this year, stating his relationship with the chair was broken "beyond repair."</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban, according to Department of Homeland Security officials. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore laws that protect migrants from being returned to countries where they would face torture or persecution. This move effectively reopens humanitarian pathways that had been closed, requiring officials to once again screen migrants for credible fear claims. The original ban was credited by the administration for a historic drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection and one of the franchise's all-time leading receivers, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap-related move. His return addresses a need for the Chargers following the recent retirement of receiver Mike Williams. At 33, Allen will bring experience and a familiar target for quarterback Justin Herbert to a young receiving corps, and team management expressed confidence in his versatility and ability to contribute immediately.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is scheduled to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. The decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed as the fourth-string quarterback on the team's initial depth chart. However, injuries to fellow quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel have created an opportunity for the fifth-round draft pick. Sanders, who had a highly successful college career playing for his father, Deion Sanders, will now have a crucial chance to prove himself and compete for a roster spot in his first NFL game action, likely splitting playing time with another quarterback.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has released its final report on the 2023 Titan submersible implosion, concluding that the deaths of the five passengers were preventable. The investigation found that OceanGate, the sub's operator, used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory loopholes to evade safety scrutiny for years. The report identified a "toxic" safety culture, flawed design using inadequate materials, and a failure to address previous damage that likely compromised the hull's integrity. Investigators stated that CEO Stockton Rush, who was killed in the incident, exhibited negligence and would have likely faced a criminal investigation had he survived.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Southern California are reporting a rise in cases of flea-borne typhus, a disease spread to humans through infected fleas from animals like rats, opossums, and stray cats. Los Angeles County has seen 79 cases so far this year, while the city of Long Beach is on track to surpass its previous annual record. The disease, caused by Rickettsia typhi bacteria, can lead to fever, headache, and rash, and often requires hospitalization. Officials are urging residents to protect themselves and their pets by using flea control medicine, securing trash, and avoiding contact with stray animals.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have announced that the U.S. will not pursue the death penalty against three high-profile alleged Mexican drug cartel leaders, including Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero is accused of orchestrating the 1985 murder of a DEA agent, while Zambada is charged with running a major faction of the Sinaloa cartel. The decision is notable given the Trump administration's support for capital punishment for drug traffickers. The move may be linked to Mexico's own abolition of the death penalty and its typical requirement that extradited citizens be spared execution, despite the unusual transfer circumstances.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliated companies to resolve claims related to long-term pollution from "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other contaminants. State officials called it the largest environmental settlement ever achieved by a single state. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and to fund the extensive cleanup of four industrial sites across New Jersey. It also establishes a substantial reserve fund to protect taxpayers if the companies fail to meet their obligations. The settlement stems from a 2019 lawsuit over decades of pollution.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of Ukrainian Air Force data reveals that Russia has more than doubled its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. Despite Trump's campaign promises to end the war quickly, recorded aerial munitions launched by Moscow have surged to their highest levels. The analysis shows over 27,000 munitions were fired between January and July, compared to about 11,600 in the last six months of the previous administration. Critics suggest that Trump's pauses on military aid to Ukraine may have emboldened Russia, which has significantly ramped up its domestic drone and missile production.</p>
