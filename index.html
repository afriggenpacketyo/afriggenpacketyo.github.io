        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a new anti-corruption bill after a previous version faced significant backlash from the public and condemnation from the European Union. The initial bill was criticized for undermining the independence of anti-corruption bodies, sparking the first major protests in Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. The new legislation aims to strengthen the rule of law and is crucial for Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU and secure ongoing Western financial aid. This move demonstrates responsiveness to both domestic and international pressure for meaningful reform.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines experienced a significant drop in its stock value after reporting second-quarter earnings that missed expectations and cutting its full-year profit forecast. The airline cited weaker domestic travel demand and economic uncertainty for the revised outlook, which is now projected to be substantially lower than initial 2025 estimates. Despite the downturn, the company's CEO noted a recent stabilization in travel demand and announced changes to its business model, including new fare structures and a share buyback program.

          <p>The 27th season of "South Park" premiered with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its parent company, Paramount, just a day after its creators secured a new $1.5 billion deal. The episode tackles recent controversies, including Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," and the administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. This bold critique highlights the show's defiant tone, as it directly lampoons the corporate and political powers it is now more deeply entangled with.

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, seeking to dismantle a portion of Proposition 12, a state law mandating minimum space requirements for farmed animals. The lawsuit specifically targets the law's provisions for egg-laying hens, which the administration partially blames for high egg prices, a claim disputed by agricultural economists who cite bird flu as the primary cause. Critics suggest the lawsuit is politically motivated, serving as a way to attack a political rival and to support the pork industry's efforts to overturn similar laws affecting their practices.</p>

          <p>An investigation commissioned by the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) found that the San Diego Wave's front office "could have done more" to address a sexual assault allegation from a staff member. The report, obtained by The Guardian, noted that the club's response was hindered because the victim did not initially use the term "sexual" to describe her traumatic experience. This finding highlights systemic issues in workplace reporting mechanisms for such incidents. The case has since led to a lawsuit filed by five former employees against both the club and the league, alleging a hostile work environment.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the science and philosophy behind why time seems to accelerate as we age, a concept explored by thinkers like Henri Bergson. Our perception of time is subjective, influenced by age, circadian rhythms, and the novelty of our experiences, with dopamine levels playing a key role. To make life feel subjectively longer, the author suggests pursuing meaningful activities over simple fun, as this creates denser memories. Savoring moments, both positive and negative, and actively avoiding routine are also recommended as strategies to feel more fully alive and expand one's experience of time.</p>

The president has been openly critical of Powell for months over the central bank's decision to maintain current interest rates, which he believes should be cut to stimulate the economy. Trump has also recently suggested that the rising costs of a renovation project at the Fed's buildings could be grounds for firing Powell. This visit intensifies the political tension surrounding the Fed's independence, a cornerstone of U.S. economic stability.</p>
