          <p>The U.S. State Department is launching a pilot program that will require some tourists to post bonds of up to $15,000 to deter visa overstays. The program targets visitors from countries with high overstay rates and will apply to B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas for about one year. Consular officials will have discretion to set bond amounts at $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, with the funds being refundable if the traveler departs the U.S. as required. Travelers from countries in the Visa Waiver Program are exempt from this new requirement, which is part of a broader effort to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>India has responded to threats of increased tariffs from former President Donald Trump by defending its purchase of Russian oil, stating the imports began only after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. The Indian foreign ministry highlighted that both the U.S. and E.U. engage in significant trade with Russia, arguing that India's imports are a matter of national necessity to ensure affordable energy for its citizens. Officials noted that the U.S. had previously encouraged India to buy Russian oil to help stabilize global energy markets. Bilateral trade between India and Russia has surged to a record $68.7 billion for the year ending March 2025.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new plan to strengthen its cattle industry and promote consumption of high-quality domestic beef amid falling prices and competition from imports. The policy, announced by the nation's top economic planner, includes implementing a quality-grading system to enhance the appeal of local products. Officials state there is significant room for growth in consumption, as the diet of many Chinese residents lacks sufficient high-quality protein. Wholesale beef prices have slightly rebounded from an eight-year low in March but remain significantly lower than the average prices before 2023, signaling a need for market stabilization and support for local producers.</p>

          <p>A recent report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas indicates that the adoption of artificial intelligence contributed to over 10,000 job cuts in the first seven months of 2025. The technology sector has been most affected, with over 89,000 layoffs announced this year, a 36% increase from the previous year. While AI is an emerging factor, the report identifies federal spending cuts and economic uncertainty as more immediate drivers of the 806,000 total private-sector job cuts this year. The impact is also visible in hiring, with a 15% decline in entry-level corporate roles available to recent college graduates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major political standoff is unfolding as Texas Democrats flee the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to threaten retaliatory measures. Newsom stated that if Texas Republicans proceed with their maps, which could add five GOP seats, California would fight "fire with fire" by advancing its own partisan redistricting. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to arrest and expel the absent Democratic lawmakers. The conflict highlights the intense national battle over congressional maps, with both sides accusing the other of partisan manipulation and undermining democratic processes.</p>

          <p>New York City police arrested more than 40 protesters outside the Trump International hotel during a demonstration against the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow, hundreds gathered to demand an end to the conflict and pressure the Trump administration to increase humanitarian aid. Speakers, including NYC Comptroller Brad Lander, condemned the Israeli government's blockade of Gaza, describing it as a policy of forced starvation. The protesters, who later blocked the street in front of the hotel, held signs reading "stop ethnic cleansing" and "not in our name," reflecting growing outrage within some segments of the American Jewish community.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have been instructed to cease deportations under a specific asylum ban following a federal appeals court order. The ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially limited the ban, stating it cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. Consequently, Customs and Border Protection officials were directed to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the contested policy. This development stems from a legal challenge brought by the ACLU, which argued that the broad ban violates both U.S. and international law.</p>

Over 1,000 firefighters are battling the flames in challenging terrain, while ranchers have been forced to evacuate cattle.

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has directed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. This move follows a referral from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who alleged that intelligence was politicized by the Obama administration to unfairly target Donald Trump. The potential charges and targets are currently unclear, but the action reinvigorates the long-standing political debate over the "Russiagate" probe. This development comes after the declassification of an appendix from the Durham report, which cited a memo suggesting a plan to link Trump to Russia.</p>

The season, which runs from August to December, sees male tarantulas traveling up to 20 miles, making them more visible in chaparral, deserts, and mountain areas. Experts note that while their appearance can be startling, tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their bodies are covered in irritant hairs used for defense, which can cause a rash if touched, but their venom is not considered a serious threat.</p>

          <p>A report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that Taiwan's natural gas supplies would last only 11 days under a full blockade by mainland China. The analysis, based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, also projected that coal reserves would be depleted in seven weeks and oil in 20 weeks. The authors concluded that a blockade would be a high-risk option for Beijing, likely causing significant casualties and potentially escalating into a wider conflict involving the United States.

          <p>Over £100 million in Premium Bond prizes remain unclaimed in the United Kingdom, according to data from operator National Savings and Investments (NS&I). The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue that the government-owned bank is not doing enough to trace winners, particularly those who were gifted bonds or only possess old paper records. NS&I states it has paid out over 99% of prizes since the draws began in 1957 but acknowledges that bonds purchased before digitization are harder to trace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wildlife officials in California are issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have been exposed to a blue-dyed rodenticide. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) confirmed the presence of the anticoagulant diphacinone in one of the pigs, which caused its muscle and fat tissue to turn blue. The department is urging pesticide applicators to prevent non-target species from accessing bait and advising hunters to avoid consuming animals with discolored tissue. Officials note that contamination may not always be visible and that such reports from the public are crucial for monitoring wildlife health.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screenings for this demographic increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This led to a 12% annual jump in early-stage diagnoses between 2019 and 2022, a sharp rise from the 1.1% increase seen previously. Researchers called the findings promising but warned that screening rates for this group remain suboptimal and have not increased equitably across all populations.</p>

          <p>Firefighters on Maui have been battling a brush fire burning above Ka'anapali, near the location of the devastating Lahaina wildfires from nearly two years ago. The blaze prompted the closure of both lanes of the Honoapiʻilani Highway as crews worked to contain it. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the fire was slowly being contained, but smoke continued to impact the highway, necessitating the road closure. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the region's vulnerability to wildfires, which previously caused over 100 fatalities and widespread destruction.</p>

Emma Ambler has campaigned for tighter controls since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun certificate applications instead of one and mandate police checks for signs of domestic abuse.
