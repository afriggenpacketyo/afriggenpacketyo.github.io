          <p>Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton reaggravated a calf injury during Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, forcing him to leave the game. Haliburton, who had been instrumental in the Pacers' playoff success, appeared to slip while driving towards the basket, causing him to fall and writhe in pain. His father reported that the injury may be an Achilles problem, sidelining him for the remainder of the game. The Pacers later announced that Haliburton would not return due to a lower right-leg injury; he had already made three 3-pointers in the first quarter before his injury. The score of the game will determine the Pacers' fate this season.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump addressed the possibility of regime change in Iran after the U.S. military bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. Trump defended the operation as a "spectacular military success," claiming the facilities were completely obliterated. On Truth Social, he questioned why there shouldn't be regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." This follows Trump's campaign promise of "no more wars," but global events have shifted his perspective.</p>

          <p>China has criticized the United States and Israel, calling for a de-escalation of the conflict with Iran following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

He urged the international community to promote peace and stability in the Middle East. This statement was made during an emergency UN Security Council meeting where geopolitical lines were drawn, with China and Russia defending Iran and the U.S. and its allies defending Israel.</p>

          <p>A child development expert who has studied over 200 kids details five "toxic" phrases that parents should never use to get their child to listen. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, the expert suggests using alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries. By shifting to language that respects a child's feelings and encourages cooperation, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, concerns have risen about potential Iranian retaliation, including blocking oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a vital oil trade route, connecting the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. More than a quarter of global maritime oil trade flowed through the Strait of Hormuz in 2024. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said an Iranian effort to block the strait "would be a suicidal move."</p>
