          <p>Vietnam has requested the United States to postpone the implementation of newly announced tariffs, which include a 46% tariff rate on Vietnamese goods, while the two countries engage in trade negotiations. Vietnamese officials argue that the tariffs are inconsistent with the spirit of the comprehensive strategic partnership between Vietnam and the United States. The request comes as many countries express willingness to negotiate tariff rates with the Trump administration, following a global stock market downturn and growing business concerns over the tariffs.

          <p>A new study reveals that over half of millennials are engaging in 'polyworking,' holding multiple jobs to supplement their income amid rising inflation and stagnant wages. Many millennials are pursuing side gigs to save money, pursue personal interests, and develop skills for career advancement, earning an additional $12,000 to $45,000 annually. While some critics express concerns about the long-term effects on work-life balance and family time, others view polyworking as a form of entrepreneurship that provides financial security and personal fulfillment. The trend reflects a changing reality in the workplace, where full-time employment may not be sufficient to meet financial needs.</p>

          <p>As deportations increase under the Trump administration, immigrants are expressing growing fear over routine check-ins with ICE, which are increasingly leading to arrests and detention. Previously, immigrants with pending cases or parole were generally allowed to continue living in the US while complying with ICE requirements, but the new administration prioritizes the arrest of all immigrants without legal status. Lawyers are advising clients to prepare for the possibility of detention during check-ins, as ICE knows their current addresses and has access to their real-time whereabouts through monitoring programs. The situation has created anxiety and uncertainty within immigrant communities, who are now facing the possibility of deportation despite cooperating with authorities.</p>

          <h2>DOJ Argues Judge Can't Order Return of Mistakenly Deported Man</h2>

          <p>The Justice Department argues that a federal judge lacks the authority to order the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The DOJ claims such an order would force the Executive branch to engage with a foreign power, which is constitutionally impermissible. This comes after a federal judge ordered the administration to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. by Monday night, following his deportation despite a previous ruling that shielded him from deportation.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has defended Israel's decision to deny entry to two UK Labour MPs, drawing criticism from across the political spectrum. Badenoch stated that countries should be able to control their borders and expressed concern that other countries do not want to allow certain Labour MPs entry. Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey criticized Badenoch's comments, while other politicians expressed concerns about democracy and the right to travel to other countries. The two MPs were on a trip to visit the occupied West Bank.</p>

          <p>Federal student loan borrowers are facing challenging times as the Biden administration's SAVE plan has been blocked and the Trump administration has changed the terms of other repayment plans. Borrowers should explore their options and understand the terms of their repayment plan to successfully manage their debt. While the Biden administration has placed millions of borrowers in an interest-free forbearance, it does not count toward debt forgiveness. Borrowers may consider switching to Income-Based Repayment, Pay As You Earn, or Income-Contingent Repayment plans, but should be aware of the limitations on automatic loan forgiveness under these plans.

          <p>Taiwan is increasingly concerned that regular large-scale joint combat drills by Mainland China's People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could escalate into a real attack. The PLA's strategy of gradually eroding buffer zones has heightened fears that Taiwan's military may not be able to respond quickly enough. Exercises have simulated strikes from multiple directions, encirclement, blockade, and area control operations. A former Taiwanese air force commander warned that warplanes could reach Taipei within three minutes of crossing the median line in the Taiwan Strait, leaving insufficient time for response.</p>

          <p>Americans are facing an era of uncertainty as President Trump implements widespread tariffs, triggering market turmoil and raising recession fears. Despite criticism from economists and global leaders, Trump remains committed to his trade policies, aiming to revive American manufacturing.

Economists warn of higher inflation and slower growth, while the Trump administration remains resolute in pursuing its economic agenda.</p>
