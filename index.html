          <p>Nearly ten months after a Texas family's boat capsized off the coast of Homer, Alaska, search efforts have led to the discovery of human remains at the bottom of the bay, bringing a measure of closure to a tragic event. The U.S. Coast Guard had previously suspended their search without any sightings back in August 2024. Private companies using remotely operated vehicles located the missing boat in 180 feet of water, identifying potential human remains onboard. Divers have since recovered three sets of remains, which have been transported to the State Medical Examiner’s Office for identification and autopsy. The Alaska Wildlife Troopers expressed gratitude to all involved in the recovery operation, while a GoFundMe page highlighted the family's significant impact on many people.</p>

          <p>German defense firm Renk is actively recruiting talent from the struggling automotive sector to support its rapid expansion driven by rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending. The company, a leader in tank gearbox manufacturing, has seen its stock price soar and order book jump significantly. This cross-industry collaboration involves hiring engineers from the automotive industry, leveraging their expertise in areas like continuous improvement and efficiency. While Germany's largest trade union acknowledges the potential for job creation, it cautions against a one-sided industrial policy focused on rearmament and emphasizes the importance of lasting peace over continuous military buildup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a major blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway. Global financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on 2 April because some measures were reversed or reduced as the White House negotiated with foreign governments.</p>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations and radicalization processes that lead young Americans to serve in a foreign army involved in what the author describes as apartheid. The author draws parallels to historical examples of individuals feeling more loyalty to a foreign cause than their own nation, such as the pied-noirs in Algeria. The article highlights the elaborate social apparatus, including Zionist summer camps, through which young Americans are radicalized and instilled with a fierce commitment to the Jewish state. The author contrasts this phenomenon with Americans fighting alongside Ukrainians against Russian occupation, emphasizing the significant difference in scale and purpose.</p>

Russell criticizes Israel's new aid delivery system, facilitated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, arguing that it bypasses the United Nations and threatens to worsen the crisis.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of the anticipated negative effects of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3. For the full business year through March, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit to 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen.</p>

While emphasizing that security matters and tariff negotiations should remain separate, the negotiator acknowledged the possibility of including defense purchases within the scope of trade talks. Japan has been urging the U.S. to withdraw higher tariffs on key automotive products, steel, and aluminum.

          <p>A U.S. Court of International Trade ruling has undermined President Trump's core economic policy by finding his sweeping tariffs unlawful. The ruling, which is being appealed, has the potential to deepen the schism between the administration and the judiciary, contributing to a sense of constitutional crisis. The court stated that the president does not have the authority to impose such tariffs, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant him unbounded tariff authority.

The British government has hardened its position toward Israel over its conduct of the war in Gaza. Momentum toward the sanctions had accelerated in recent weeks, after Britain joined France and Canada in condemning Israel’s expansion of military operations in Gaza. However, the recent fatal attack on two Israeli embassy staff members in Washington has given pause to some British officials, who question whether this is the right moment to punish senior Israeli leaders.</p>

          <p>Despite legal guarantees at national and EU level, racial segregation in schools exists today in several countries in the EU, and in Slovakia, more than 60% of Roma children attend schools where they are in the majority. The article highlights the ongoing segregation of Roma children in Slovakian schools, despite legal guarantees and reforms. It criticizes the government's justifications for this segregation, including claims related to language, behavior, and parental choice. The authors argue that reforms, such as the creation of "Roma national schools," risk reinforcing segregation under the guise of minority rights. They call for an end to managing segregation and a focus on creating diverse classrooms and providing early support, urging the EU to address this systemic failure.</p>

          <p>Since regaining the White House, President Trump has been fixated on making an example of those who push back against him. According to President Trump, Harvard University has no one but itself to blame for his administration’s swift suffocation of its federal funding because the university was fighting back. This reflects Trump's worldview that if he goes after someone or something, it is their fault, not his. For Mr. Trump, making an example of institutions and people that push back against him has been paramount since he regained the White House, sending a message that no dissent will be tolerated.</p>

Larry Hoover, the former leader of the Gangster Disciples, received a commutation, although he will remain imprisoned on state murder charges.

Hoover's attorneys expressed their appreciation for the commutation, while the lead prosecutor in his federal trial voiced disappointment.

Held back by tariffs and global supply chain constraints, China’s civil aviation passenger capacity is likely to grow by an average of 3.1 per cent a year until 2028, analysts at China International Capital Corporation (CICC) said in a note released on Wednesday.

Despite the "safe third country agreement," which typically prevents asylum seekers denied refuge in one country from seeking asylum in the other, the family persisted.
