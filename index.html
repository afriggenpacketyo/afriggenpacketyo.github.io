        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices in its upcoming Spending Review, impacting various sectors from the NHS to defense. With spending sharply increased in 2024 for areas like transport and net zero, the IFS notes that this growth will not continue, given the government's commitments. The IFS highlights that the level of NHS funding will significantly influence potential cuts to unprotected areas, such as the criminal justice system. The think tank suggests that prioritizing health spending, which accounts for 39% of departmental spending, could lead to real-terms cuts for other departments, especially given the government's ambitions to improve prison overcrowding.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson is facing renewed scrutiny following new allegations of sexual assault, prompting a response from his legal team. Authorities previously investigated similar allegations in 2015, but declined to press charges due to insufficient evidence. Robinson and his wife have filed a $500 million cross-complaint against four former employees who accused him of sexual misconduct and creating a hostile work environment. The couple alleges that the accusations are fabricated and part of an extortion scheme, while the former employees' lawyers claim the cross-complaint is an attempt to silence and intimidate survivors of sexual battery and assault.</p>

          <p>Paris St-Germain (PSG) decisively defeated Inter Milan in the Champions League final, leading to speculation about a potential rebuild for the Italian team. Inter's president previously expressed a desire to invest in younger players, and the loss to PSG has solidified this stance. Inter Milan's coach, Simone Inzaghi, acknowledged that his team was fatigued compared to PSG, which had an earlier end to their league season. Inzaghi's future with the club is uncertain, as he has been linked to Saudi club Al-Hilal and did not commit to staying after the game.</p>

          <p>Patti LuPone has issued an apology after receiving backlash from the Broadway community for her remarks about Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald. An open letter signed by over 500 Broadway performers criticized LuPone's "inappropriate and unacceptable public comments," particularly those directed at Lewis. The controversy stemmed from an interview where LuPone disparaged Lewis's claim of being a Broadway veteran and made dismissive remarks about McDonald. LuPone expressed regret for her flippant responses, stating that her behavior was inappropriate and ran counter to the values of the theater community.</p>

Despite PepsiCo's recent underperformance, the company's diversified portfolio, global reach, and leading brands make it an attractive investment for dividend investors and those concerned about valuation.

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its weapons production capabilities. This initiative aims to support the creation of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and generate approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move is part of the government's Strategic Defence Review, prompted by deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The new funding will bring the UK's munitions spending to Â£6 billion during this parliament, strengthening the armed forces and boosting British jobs.</p>
