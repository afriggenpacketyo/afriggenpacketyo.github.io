          <h2>RSV Hospitalizations in Babies Drop Significantly Due to New Preventative Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, attributed to widespread availability of vaccines for pregnant women and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants. Hospitalization rates dropped by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach noted fewer critically ill children with RSV this year and wishes the shot had been available when her own son was hospitalized with the virus. The study suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young babies from severe illness, leading to a significant public health breakthrough. </p>

          <p>Despite a temporary pause in Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, businesses are warned to anticipate a potential resumption of trade hostilities. Existing tariffs remain substantial, and Trump's past rhetoric and actions suggest a quick resolution is unlikely. Smart businesses are using the suspension to stockpile goods, seek alternative suppliers, or bring manufacturing back to the US. Small businesses heavily reliant on Chinese suppliers face particular challenges and need to plan for further disruptions in the trade landscape. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's private dinner for top meme coin holders is expected to include mostly non-Americans, based on an analysis of $TRUMP token holders. Blockchain analytics indicate that many of the top wallets are heavily tied to international exchanges, suggesting the owners are not U.S. citizens. Justin Sun, known for purchasing a significant amount of the Trump family's World Liberty Financial token, is believed to be a leading figure on the $TRUMP meme token leaderboard. The pseudonymous nature of these wallets raises questions about the token's largest holders' true identities and motivations. </p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll reveals a record low support rate of 27.4% for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, driven by dissatisfaction over rising prices and economic policies. Nissan Motor Co. is set to solicit early retirement applications from administrative staff in Japan for the first time in 18 years, aiming to restructure its business. Additionally, the poll indicates that 81% of Japanese citizens feel 'uneasy' about Donald Trump's second presidency, largely due to concerns about potential tariffs. Finally, Taiwan has shut down its last nuclear reactor after 40 years of operation, aligning with its policy to phase out atomic energy. </p>

Speaking ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, the minister expressed confidence in reaching an agreement on food standards to lower prices and hopes for a youth mobility scheme. Conservative MP Alex Burghart voiced concerns that the proposed deal could lead to the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards.

          <p>The approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low of 27.4%, according to a recent Kyodo News survey. Dissatisfaction is growing due to the government's failure to address soaring rice prices and its dismissal of consumption tax cuts as a solution. The survey indicates that 73.2% of respondents believe consumption taxes should be slashed, while 87.1% feel the government's efforts to curb rising rice prices are insufficient. Concerns about potential declines in social security services due to tax cuts were also noted. </p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Joe Biden's insistence on running for a second term despite his declining health ultimately led to the current chaotic political climate. The article cites Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's book, 'Original Sin,' which details a systematic effort to conceal Biden's condition. The author suggests that the media and Democratic leaders failed to hold Biden accountable, leading to a situation where the nation is now governed by a 'corrupt felon.' The author also expresses a preference for an impaired Biden over the current president. </p>
