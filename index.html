          <p>Three wildfires in northern Minnesota have burned nearly 37,000 acres, prompting the activation of the National Guard. The largest, the Jenkins Creek Fire, has grown to over 20,000 acres, while the Camp House Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, with investigations ongoing into the cause of the Camp House Fire, which may have been started by unattended campers. Weather conditions are expected to improve with incoming humidity and potential rainfall, offering some relief to firefighters, and the governor's office is in contact with FEMA for potential federal assistance.

          <p>During a visit to Saudi Arabia, President Trump criticized Western intervention and nation-building efforts, urging Middle Eastern nations to chart their own destinies. He expressed a desire for Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and for a nuclear deal with Iran, and Trump met with Ahmed al-Shara, the new leader of Syria, a former jihadist who led the rebel alliance that ousted Bashar al-Assad. Trump's remarks and actions during the trip signal a potential shift in U.S. foreign policy towards the region. The article explores the reactions to Trump's speech, including both praise from those who feel the U.S. has overstepped its role in the Middle East and concerns about the potential impact on human rights.</p>

          <p>Faced with a $12 billion budget deficit, California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a pause on enrolling new low-income immigrants without legal status in the state's healthcare program starting in 2026.
