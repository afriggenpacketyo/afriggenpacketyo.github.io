          <p>Scotland's A9, the country's longest road, has been the site of 48 fatalities in the past decade, with a recent crash claiming three American tourists. The article highlights that over 80% of these deaths occurred on single-carriageway sections, underscoring the urgency of a long-promised dualling project. Originally slated for completion by 2025, the £3bn upgrade has been delayed until 2035, drawing criticism from campaigners and families affected by the tragedies. The government cites factors like Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic for the delays, while safety measures are being implemented in the interim. This ongoing infrastructure issue continues to cause immense personal loss and public concern. The human toll of these incidents is immeasurable. The delays are a major point of contention.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw a significant rise on Monday, mirroring gains on Wall Street, following signals from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that the central bank might ease monetary policy next month. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi index both increased, alongside Australia's S&P/ASX 200. Investors are now anticipating key economic data, including Singapore's consumer price index, and upcoming earnings reports from major companies like Nvidia. This market optimism is fueled by the potential for lower interest rates, which could stimulate economic activity globally. The positive market movements reflect a renewed confidence among investors.

          <p>France has summoned US Ambassador Charles Kushner to address his "unacceptable allegations" that the French government is failing to combat a surge in antisemitism. Kushner, in an open letter to President Emmanuel Macron, echoed Israeli criticism, claiming an "explosion of hatred towards Jews" since the Gaza war began and urged Macron to temper his criticism of Israel. The French foreign ministry firmly refuted these claims, emphasizing that ambassadors should not interfere in a country's internal affairs. This diplomatic incident highlights growing tensions between the US and France over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its impact on domestic issues. The exchange underscores deep divisions on international policy. France's planned recognition of a Palestinian state further complicates matters.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a celebrated figure in both Broadway and television, has passed away peacefully at the age of 96. Before gaining fame in his 60s for roles like Hesh Rabkin in 'The Sopranos' and Howard Lyman in 'The Good Wife,' Adler spent decades as a stage manager, producer, and director on 53 Broadway productions, including the original 'My Fair Lady.' Hailing from a prominent Jewish and Yiddish theater family, he transitioned to acting later in life, proving his versatility and passion for the craft. His memoir, 'Too Funny for Words,' was published last year, reflecting on a long and distinguished career. Adler's journey from behind-the-scenes to on-screen success is a testament to his enduring talent. His contributions to entertainment were significant. He leaves behind a remarkable legacy.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has postponed its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from the Texas Gulf Coast, citing an issue with ground systems. This delay follows three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures, as the company works to test significant upgrades and push the vehicle's capabilities. The ambitious flight plan included a controlled splashdown for the Super Heavy booster and a suborbital trajectory for the Starship, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and attempting an in-space engine restart. This mega-rocket is crucial for Elon Musk's vision of colonizing Mars and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, which relies on numerous successful Starship flights for in-space refueling. The ongoing challenges highlight the complexity of developing such advanced space technology. The program faces significant hurdles. Delays are a common part of space exploration development.</p>

          <p>New Justice Department filings allege that Smartmatic executives, already indicted for bribery and money laundering, transferred funds from a 2018 Los Angeles County voting machine contract into slush funds. These funds were previously used to bribe election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines between 2012 and 2016. While prosecutors haven't confirmed if LA County money was used for bribes, the allegations raise concerns about the company's integrity and its relationship with county officials, including Registrar-Recorder Dean Logan. Fox News, facing a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, is seeking records related to Logan's alleged receipt of undeclared gifts from the company. The revelations further complicate the ongoing legal and ethical scrutiny surrounding Smartmatic's operations and election integrity. The company denies wrongdoing, stating it operates ethically. The case highlights broader concerns about transparency in election technology procurement.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to Baltimore by demanding he "clean up this crime mess" first, and threatened to reconsider federal funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. Moore had invited Trump after the president's critical remarks about Baltimore's crime rate and his decision to deploy National Guard personnel in Washington D.C. Moore called Trump's rhetoric "purely performative," asserting that crime rates in Maryland and Baltimore have significantly decreased. The exchange underscores a contentious debate over federal intervention in local law enforcement and the politicization of crime statistics. The president's comments have sparked strong reactions.

          <p>A small contingent of National Guard members, fewer than 50, will be armed starting Sunday night in Washington D.C., following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. This marks an escalation in President Trump's federal intervention into the city's policing, which has seen nearly 2,000 National Guard members deployed. While troops have primarily protected landmarks and assisted with crowd control, without prior reports of threats requiring weapons, this new measure raises questions about their evolving role. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, maintain that the initiative is unnecessary, citing declining violent crime rates despite the president's claims of an "epidemic." The decision reflects heightened federal control over local security matters. The move has drawn criticism from local authorities.

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency due to the state's infant mortality rate reaching its highest level in over a decade, with 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, nearly double the national average. Black infants are disproportionately affected, dying at more than twice the rate of white infants. Leading causes include congenital malformations, premature birth, and SIDS. The emergency declaration aims to expand prenatal services, establish an obstetric care system, and strengthen community health programs. Experts emphasize that structural inequities, poverty, and lack of continuous healthcare are key drivers, highlighting the limitations of focusing solely on individual behavior. Federal funding cuts to programs like PRAMS further complicate efforts. This crisis underscores deep-seated societal challenges. The state is taking urgent action to address this critical issue.

          <p>Chinese property behemoth Evergrande is set to be delisted from the Hong Kong stock market on Monday, marking the final chapter in its spectacular collapse. Once China's largest real estate firm with a $50bn valuation, Evergrande succumbed to over $300bn in debt, a crisis exacerbated by Beijing's tightened borrowing rules. Its founder, Hui Ka Yan, was fined and banned for overstating revenue, with liquidators now pursuing his personal assets. The company's downfall has severely impacted China's economy, leading to layoffs, decreased household savings, and suppressed consumer spending. Despite government efforts to revive the housing market, experts predict a slow recovery, with property prices potentially falling until 2027. The delisting is a symbolic milestone in an ongoing sector-wide struggle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian state-backed media, including RT and Sputnik, are significantly expanding their international presence across Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, coinciding with bans in Western countries for spreading disinformation. This expansion leverages a perceived weakening of Western media in these regions due to budget cuts. Russia strategically tailors its content to appeal to diverse audiences, often exploiting anti-Western sentiments and portraying Russia as a victim of aggression. While some content is accurate, researchers note a careful manipulation of narratives, such as downplaying Russian war crimes or promoting the annexation of Crimea as reunification. This effort aims to undermine Western influence and build support for Russia's actions globally. The strategy poses a challenge to the global information landscape. The long-term impact on global perceptions is a growing concern.</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of defense tech company Anduril, argues that AI-powered autonomous weapons represent the future of warfare, offering a more efficient and less risky approach for US military engagement. Luckey contends that current US military technology lags behind commercial AI, leading Anduril to develop systems like the Roadrunner drone interceptor and the autonomous Dive XL submarine. These weapons can identify and engage targets without direct human operation, though Luckey asserts they all include a "kill switch." Despite concerns from international groups and the UN Secretary-General about "killer robots," Luckey believes these systems act as powerful deterrents, promoting peace by making adversaries hesitant to attack. He emphasizes the need for the US to arm allies effectively. His vision challenges traditional defense procurement models.

The Pentagon confirmed the mobilization of up to 1,700 Guardsmen in 19 states to assist ICE, but Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stated no request for assistance was made.

          <p>A reckless driving incident on Interstate 15 in Temecula resulted in a fiery crash that killed four people on Saturday night. A black BMW M4, traveling northbound, veered across the concrete median into southbound traffic, colliding head-on with a white Nissan Sentra before erupting in flames. Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed. The 35-year-old driver of the Sentra also died en route to the hospital. Good Samaritans rescued the 25-year-old BMW driver, who sustained major injuries. Authorities confirmed alcohol was not a factor, and the California Highway Patrol is investigating, with charges pending against the BMW driver. This tragic accident has devastated multiple families. The incident serves as a stark reminder of road safety. The investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongfully deported to an El Salvadoran prison and later returned to the US, is expected to be detained by immigration officials again on Monday.
