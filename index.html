          <p>Australia has officially granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist from Hong Kong who fled the city in 2020 to avoid prosecution. Hui faced multiple criminal charges related to his involvement in the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists targeted by Hong Kong authorities with million-dollar police bounties. While expressing sincere gratitude to the Australian government for the protection offered to him and his family, Hui conveyed his profound sadness at being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He also used the opportunity to urge Australia to increase its efforts to help other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Increased government scrutiny of businesses in China that evade social insurance obligations is expected to further boost the employment of retirees, who are exempt from such payments. This growing trend, highlighted by recent recruitment notices from McDonald's, has sparked widespread concern on social media, with many fearing it will shrink job opportunities for the record number of university graduates entering the workforce. A new judicial interpretation from the Supreme People’s Court will soon invalidate agreements to forgo social insurance, potentially making experienced, retired workers an even more financially attractive option for companies looking to control labor costs.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action, classifying it as a terrorist organization. Cooper argued the group's activities, which include claiming responsibility for incidents of property damage and alleged assaults leading to charges with a "terrorism connection," extend far beyond legitimate protest. Her defense comes as the Metropolitan Police announced that 60 more individuals will be prosecuted for showing support for the group, bringing the total number of arrests to over 700 since the ban was enacted in early July amid ongoing demonstrations.</p>

          <p>Legendary musician Billy Joel announced he is closing his Long Island motorcycle shop, 20th Century Cycles, and will auction his extensive personal collection of bikes. This decision comes after the 76-year-old singer revealed his recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder that significantly affects his vision, hearing, and balance, making it unsafe for him to ride. The condition has also forced Joel to cancel all of his tour dates for the remainder of 2025 and through July 2026, as he undergoes physical therapy and focuses on his recovery under his doctor's instructions.</p>

The All Blacks established an early lead, and despite a spirited second-half comeback from Argentina's Pumas that narrowed the score, two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho sealed the decisive win. The victory also extends Argentina's challenging record, marking their 15th consecutive loss to New Zealand on home soil ahead of their next meeting in Buenos Aires.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led states of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced the deployment of hundreds of their National Guard members to Washington, D.C. This move is intended to bolster the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in the nation's capital through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. The deployment marks a significant escalation of federal intervention, adding to the already activated D.C. National Guard and federal law enforcement presence. This action has been met with protests from local officials and residents who view it as an unnecessary power play, asserting that violent crime rates are actually lower than in previous years.</p>

          <p>In the 11 days since a new "one in, one out" migrant returns agreement between the UK and France took effect, over 2,500 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept another person with a strong asylum case, though no returns have yet taken place. These recent arrivals contribute to a total of over 50,000 since July 2024, intensifying pressure on the government to demonstrate the policy's effectiveness amid concerns that smugglers are now using larger boats to transport more people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett explores how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection shaped by life events. Initially dismissing the genre as unrelatable and overly religious, she later found new meaning in its depictions of trauma, motherhood, and grief after experiencing personal hardship and eventually pregnancy. The article argues that lived experience is often the key to understanding the deep emotional resonance of historical masterpieces, transforming them from academic subjects into powerful, moving reflections of the universal human condition and the pain of others.</p>

The legality of the novel "revenue-sharing" deal is reportedly still being examined by the Department of Commerce, with critics arguing that it could be considered an unconstitutional tax on exports, further destabilizing international trade relations.

          <p>During his trial for the Phoenix canal murders, Bryan Patrick Miller's defense team admitted he was the killer but argued he was not guilty by reason of insanity. His lawyers claimed that severe and sadistic physical and psychological abuse by his mother, a detention officer, caused him to develop dissociative amnesia and a violent alternate personality responsible for the brutal killings of two women in the 1990s. While the judge acknowledged in her verdict that the extensive childhood abuse was proven, she ultimately rejected the insanity defense, found Miller guilty of both murders, and sentenced him to death.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have declined to provide any comment on the status of quarterback Matthew Stafford's scheduled workout, deepening the mystery surrounding the back injury that has kept him sidelined throughout training camp. Stafford, 37, has been dealing with an aggravated disc and has not been able to practice with the team, raising serious concerns about his availability for the upcoming season opener. With the veteran starter's situation remaining uncertain, the preseason performance of backup quarterback Stetson Bennett, who led a game-winning drive against the Chargers, is becoming increasingly critical for the team.</p>
