          <p>A New York City police officer and three civilians were fatally shot inside a Midtown Manhattan office building by a gunman who later died from a self-inflicted wound. The officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year veteran of the force and father of two with another child on the way. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, used an M4 rifle in what officials described as a senseless and evil attack. The motive remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>In his first official call with his new South Korean counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Seoul to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." The conversation reflects Beijing's effort to reset relations with South Korea's new presidential administration, which is viewed as more open to China than its predecessor. Both sides reportedly agreed to advance their strategic partnership and ensure the success of the upcoming APEC summit in Gyeongju, fostering more practical cooperation.</p>

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines fell over 8% after the company reported a 59% plunge in first-quarter net profit. The carrier attributed the significant drop to lower interest income and losses from its 25.1% stake in Air India, which is undergoing a complex restructuring. While the airline noted that demand for air travel remains healthy, analysts expressed concern over Air India's deeper-than-expected losses and weaker cargo demand, leading to downgrades in profit estimates.

This reverses a long-standing practice of allowing release for those not deemed a flight or safety risk. Advocates argue the policy is a misinterpretation of the law that violates due process rights and causes catastrophic harm to families, including U.S. citizen children.</p>

          <p>University of Southern California offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA seeking to regain his final year of eligibility. The NCAA denied Wingfield's waiver request, citing its "Five-Year Rule," which limits athletes to four seasons of competition within a five-year period. The lawsuit argues the rule is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for circumstances including the pandemic and a previous injury, with the outcome potentially impacting USC's upcoming season.</p>

This case follows a lower court's injunction that blocked ICE from using criteria like race or location as the sole basis for detention, escalating a legal battle over Trump administration immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent acknowledgment of "real starvation" in Gaza, a statement that contradicts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, appears to be driven by television news imagery rather than intelligence reports. This article analyzes how Trump's reliance on mass media shapes his policy perspectives, making him highly responsive to shifts in public opinion but also vulnerable to misinformation. His approach to the Gaza crisis exemplifies this tendency to form conclusions based on what is visible on screen.</p>
