            <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, is transitioning to a new role within the Department of Defense as a special government employee handling special projects. This move follows a period of staffing changes at the Pentagon, including the firing of senior aides amid a leak investigation. Hegseth has faced scrutiny for sharing information about airstrikes in Yemen in a Signal messaging app group chat that included his wife and personal attorney, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive information. President Trump has publicly supported Hegseth, dismissing claims of dysfunction at the Pentagon.</p>

            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez, has been convicted on all counts for her role in a bribery scheme. The scheme involved accepting lavish gifts, including gold bars and cash, in exchange for political favors. Her husband was convicted in July 2024 and sentenced to 11 years in prison. The jury found her guilty of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to secretly aid the Egyptian government using the former senator's position.</p>

            <p>Pete Hegseth, the Defense Secretary, faces increasing scrutiny due to a series of scandals, including the sharing of sensitive information on Signal chats and high staff turnover. Aides had warned Hegseth not to have sensitive discussions on Signal or on his personal phone, according to the Times’ reporting. The departure of key aides and allegations of leaks have contributed to a perception of dysfunction within the Pentagon. Despite these issues, President Trump has publicly supported Hegseth, dismissing the concerns as media-driven.</p>

While Ukraine is a complete loser, Russia's gains merely amount to a Pyrrhic victory. China could play a role in helping to broker peace and stabilize the region.</p>
