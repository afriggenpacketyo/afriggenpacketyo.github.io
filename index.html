          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Groq is expanding its international presence by establishing its first European data center in Helsinki, Finland, in partnership with Equinix. The move aims to meet the rising demand for AI services in Europe and leverage the region's access to renewable energy. Groq designs specialized chips called Language Processing Units (LPUs) for AI inferencing, positioning itself as a competitor to industry giants like Nvidia. This expansion reflects a broader trend of U.S. tech firms investing in the Nordics to support the growing push for sovereign AI capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill, granting parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this entitlement is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner emphasized that the change will provide people with essential time to grieve. This legislative update is being praised by campaigners as a crucial step in formally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement rather than an illness requiring sick leave.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a threat to impose an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This declaration, which did not specify the policies in question, came as the BRICS bloc issued a joint statement criticizing unilateral protectionist measures. The move signals an escalation in global trade tensions as the Trump administration prepares to implement new country-specific tariff rates beginning on August 1. The announcement has heightened uncertainty in international economic and trade activities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed Roman Starovoit from his post as transport minister after just over one year in the position. The presidential decree did not provide an official reason for the sudden firing. Starovoit was appointed in May 2024, having previously served as the governor of Russia's Kursk region. Notably, that region experienced a significant Ukrainian incursion shortly after he transitioned to the transport ministry. There is speculation that Starovoit's deputy minister may be appointed as his replacement.</p>

          <p>After making landfall in South Carolina, Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression but continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas.

In Chatham County, North Carolina, over 100 roads are already flooded and a highway has partially collapsed.

          <p>This article delves into the reasons behind the diverse tastes of chocolate around the world, focusing on the contrast between American and European varieties. American chocolate often includes butyric acid to extend its shelf life, which imparts a slightly sour flavor that can be unfamiliar to European palates. Conversely, European chocolate is governed by stricter regulations that emphasize a fine, creamy texture and higher cocoa content. The piece also examines emerging markets like India and Africa, where unique local preferences and production methods are shaping their own chocolate cultures.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey highlighted by CNN reveals that pride in being American among Democrats has fallen to a historic low. Currently, only 36% of Democrats report being "extremely" or "very" proud to be American, a steep decline from 80% in 2015. CNN data analyst Harry Enten noted that this significant shift is primarily driven by younger generations, especially Gen Z voters. In stark contrast, pride among Republicans has remained consistently high, underscoring a deepening partisan divide in national sentiment over the past decade.</p>

Key pieces of evidence included Patterson's disposal of a food dehydrator with mushroom traces and her conflicting statements to police. While the defense maintained it was an accident, the jury was ultimately persuaded by the prosecution's narrative of a premeditated crime.</p>

The blast, which occurred last Tuesday, ignited a large fire that destroyed the building and was felt throughout the community. The warehouse was operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, a company specializing in professional fireworks displays. The cause of the deadly explosion remains under investigation as authorities work to notify the families of the deceased.</p>

          <p>A significant global trend of declining birth rates is accelerating, presenting unprecedented societal challenges for nations worldwide, including the United States. This shift is largely attributed to increased female economic independence and evolving personal priorities. While this trend may offer some environmental benefits, economists are increasingly concerned about future depopulation, shrinking workforces, and the long-term viability of social safety nets like Social Security. The U.S. fertility rate has now dropped to a record low, igniting a political debate over potential government responses.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to visit China next week, where he plans to discuss the contentious ownership of the Darwin Port with President Xi Jinping. The visit is being described as a "friendly gesture" aimed at preserving positive bilateral relations, though the port's status remains a significant point of friction. The port's lease to a Chinese-owned company has faced intense scrutiny amid rising geopolitical tensions. Albanese's agenda will focus on clarifying Australia's stance on Chinese investment while also addressing broader trade matters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis posits that the growing financialization of housing across Europe has sparked a severe crisis, contributing to political disillusionment and the rise of the far right. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors have increasingly treated homes as a lucrative asset class, driving up prices and rents beyond the reach of many. The article argues that this corporate capture of the housing market, facilitated by decades of privatization and deregulation, systematically harms residents while generating immense profits for a select few, creating an unsustainable social and political situation.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly denounced former ally Elon Musk's plan to launch a new political party, labeling the idea as "ridiculous" and describing Musk as a "train wreck." Musk announced the creation of the "America Party" after a public dispute with Trump over a new bill that eliminated tax credits for electric vehicles. Trump asserted that a third party would only create confusion and claimed he had previously warned Musk about his intention to end the EV mandate. This public clash signifies a major deterioration in the relationship between the two prominent figures.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Texas have stated they were unprepared for the deadly flash floods that struck on July 4th, resulting in at least 80 deaths. The Guadalupe River in Kerr County rose an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the night while many residents were asleep. Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly confirmed that there is no warning system on the river and that officials had "no reason to believe" the event would be so severe. This lack of advance warning has become a critical focus in the aftermath of one of the deadliest floods in the state's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel gene therapy, administered through a single injection, has shown remarkable success in improving hearing for individuals with a specific type of congenital deafness. The therapy works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is vital for transmitting sound signals to the brain. In a clinical trial, all 10 participants experienced significant hearing improvement, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly all of her hearing. The treatment was found to be safe, offering considerable hope for future therapies for other genetic forms of deafness.</p>
