          <p>CoreWeave, a prominent provider of artificial intelligence data centers, experienced a significant 14% decline in its stock value after reporting a wider-than-anticipated adjusted loss of 27 cents per share for its second quarter as a public company. Despite this financial setback, the company's revenue impressively tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, surpassing Wall Street expectations due to robust demand for AI infrastructure. The stock's volatility is also influenced by the impending expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more shares to the market. Nevertheless, CoreWeave has optimistically lifted its 2025 revenue guidance, signaling confidence in its continued growth and market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Angela Craig's mysterious illness and subsequent death in Aurora, Colorado, quickly escalated into a murder investigation, leading to the arrest of her husband, Dr. James Craig. Police allege a package containing potassium cyanide was delivered to his dental office just days before her final hospitalization, becoming a key piece of evidence. The case, which will be explored in a '48 Hours' episode, details the progression from Angela's initial symptoms to the discovery of the suspicious substance. While the defense plans to argue alternative theories, the unusual circumstances surrounding the package and Angela's rapid decline form the core of the prosecution's case.</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service for fresh foods, including meat, eggs, and produce, to more than 1,000 U.S. cities, with plans to reach at least 2,300 locations by the end of the year. This service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, and Amazon reports it has successfully attracted new grocery customers who now shop more frequently. The announcement led to notable stock declines for competitors such as Instacart, Kroger, Albertsons, and Walmart, underscoring Amazon's aggressive push into the grocery market. This strategic move is part of Amazon's broader initiative to retool its grocery business and more closely integrate Whole Foods Market into its offerings.</p>

All shops will continue to trade while administrators explore potential options, including a sale, to secure a future for the well-known brand. This development follows Claire's earlier bankruptcy filing in the U.S. and reflects broader challenges faced by brick-and-mortar retailers in the evolving retail landscape.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on a network of individuals and 13 companies linked to the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) for a multi-million dollar timeshare fraud scheme in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. This "brutally violent" cartel is accused of preying on older Americans, often draining their life savings through various timeshare exit, resale, and investment scams. The Treasury Department has issued a warning to U.S. citizens to conduct thorough due diligence before purchasing Mexico-based timeshares and to be cautious of unsolicited offers. This action is part of a broader government effort to disrupt the cartel's diverse revenue streams, which increasingly supplement drug trafficking proceeds with activities like fraud and fuel theft.</p>

Analysts interpret these deals as strategic efforts to secure tariff relief and prevent significant reductions in corporate profits. While some critics question the legality and fairness of these arrangements, they underscore the administration's hands-on approach to trade policy and the tech industry's vulnerability to geopolitical tensions.

The program aims to significantly cut the time required for new plant approvals, addressing national security concerns stemming from the U.S.'s heavy reliance on foreign drug manufacturing. While concrete details on specific requirements to be eliminated are still sparse, the FDA plans to host a public meeting to present the program and discuss broader challenges related to onshoring pharmaceutical production.</p>

          <p>Maricopa County, Arizona, has reported over 400 suspected heat-related deaths so far this summer, as the region endures a brutal heatwave with August on track to be its hottest on record. Despite a current official death count that is lower than last year's, many cases remain under investigation, suggesting the final toll could be higher. The significant increase in heat-related fatalities over the past decade is attributed to a combination of climate change, unchecked urban sprawl, and an affordable housing crisis, disproportionately affecting the unhoused population. While some mitigation efforts are in place, concerns persist about the long-term impact and the potential lack of federal support for future climate adaptation initiatives.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages offer older homeowners a unique financial tool to convert their home equity into cash without incurring additional monthly payments, potentially providing a vital lifeline in today's inflationary environment and high interest rate climate. Key benefits include the ability to free up cash flow and cover rising medical costs, which is particularly advantageous for retirees on fixed incomes. However, financial experts caution that these loans often come with substantial upfront fees and ongoing costs that can quickly deplete home equity. Furthermore, reverse mortgages carry inherent risks in declining housing markets, as they rely on sustained property values, potentially leaving borrowers with negative equity or reduced inheritance for their heirs.

Despite the Bank of England's base rate holding at 4%, this easing of mortgage rates offers some relief for the hundreds of thousands of borrowers due to remortgage this year.

          <p>Gianluigi Donnarumma's career at Paris St-Germain appears to be nearing its end after his exclusion from a recent UEFA Super Cup final, following the signing of Lucas Chevalier from Lille. Manchester City sources describe reports of current talks with Donnarumma as speculation, though they haven't completely ruled out a move should their current number one, Ederson, depart. PSG would seek a transfer fee for the Italy international, who reportedly offered to reduce his salary to remain in Paris, a claim denied by the club. Donnarumma's exclusion is reportedly linked to his ability with the ball at his feet, a crucial requirement for Pep Guardiola's system at Manchester City.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve's September meeting approaches, prospective homebuyers are strongly advised by experts to avoid several common pitfalls while anticipating potential mortgage rate cuts. Key warnings include refraining from changing jobs before loan approval, opening new loans or lines of credit, and skipping mortgage preapproval, as these actions can significantly jeopardize loan qualification or limit borrowing capacity. It is crucial for buyers to understand that Federal Reserve rate cuts do not automatically guarantee lower mortgage payments, as rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield and increased buyer demand can offset any savings. Instead, strengthening credit scores, saving for larger down payments, and comparing multiple lenders are recommended strategies for securing favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that only 54% of U.S. adults now report consuming alcohol, marking the lowest percentage in Gallup's nearly 90-year trend, driven by a growing belief that even moderate drinking is detrimental to health. A record high of 53% of adults now believe moderate drinking is unhealthy, a significant increase from 28% in 2015, with younger adults leading this shift in perception. This trend aligns with evolving scientific consensus on alcohol's health risks, including its established link to cancer.
