        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has defended its decision to import Russian oil, stating it was a matter of national necessity after traditional energy supplies were redirected to Europe. The country's foreign ministry criticized the U.S. and EU for targeting India while they themselves continue substantial trade with Russia. This response follows former President Trump's threats to impose significantly higher tariffs on Indian goods, accusing New Delhi of profiting from discounted Russian crude. India maintains that its actions were previously encouraged by the U.S. to ensure global energy market stability and are vital for its economic security.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruling has prompted U.S. border agents to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had previously allowed for the summary deportation of individuals entering the country illegally, a measure credited by the administration for a significant drop in border crossings. While an appeals court affirmed the president's power to pause asylum access, it ruled the government cannot deport migrants to places where they might face torture or persecution. Consequently, officials have been directed to process migrants under existing immigration laws, which include the right to request humanitarian refuge, although most will likely remain in detention.</p>

          <p>U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has instructed a federal prosecutor to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation. This move follows claims by President Trump and his allies that the probe was a politically motivated conspiracy to undermine his presidency. The referral from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, alleged that the Obama administration politicized intelligence to falsely link Trump to Russia. While Democrats maintain that Russian interference is well-documented, this legal step could lead to potential indictments against former officials involved in the initial investigation.</p>

The pair realized their only exit was cut off and called for emergency services. A Sonoma County Sheriff's Office helicopter crew was dispatched to perform a hoist rescue, lifting the hikers to safety using a 100-foot line. No injuries were reported in the incident. Officials used the event to remind visitors of the coastline's dangers, including unpredictable tides and lack of cell service, advising them to check tide charts and carry satellite communication devices.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a vote on a Republican-drawn congressional redistricting map. By leaving, the Democrats broke the legislative quorum, halting proceedings on a bill that would create five new GOP-leaning districts. The Republican-controlled House voted to issue arrest warrants to compel the members' return, though Texas law enforcement has no jurisdiction outside the state. This escalates a political standoff that Democrats argue is a necessary use of a constitutional tool to fight against authoritarian overreach and gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>Following a large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid that resulted in one worker's death and over 360 detentions, Glass House Brands is revamping its labor practices.

The raid, which federal officials claimed was related to child labor and criminal activity, has shaken the legal cannabis industry. Glass House stated it is taking these steps to prevent a recurrence of the traumatic event and ensure compliance.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a landmark defense deal valued at approximately $6.5 billion. The agreement represents the largest-ever defense industry contract between the two nations and is a significant step in Australia's military restructuring to counter China's regional influence. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described the stealthy, next-generation warships as the best capability for the country's needs. The deal marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II, signaling a shift in its post-war pacifist stance on defense equipment sales.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous materials. An investigation found that UPS had discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic waste into regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such materials. The lawsuit stated these actions posed a risk of dangerous chemical reactions and environmental harm. UPS cooperated with the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities to address the issue.</p>

          <p>August marks the beginning of tarantula mating season in Southern California, a period when male spiders actively leave their burrows in search of mates. This behavior makes sightings more common, particularly during dusk and nighttime in desert, chaparral, and mountain areas. Experts note that while the spiders can travel up to 20 miles, they are generally harmless to humans unless provoked. Their primary defense mechanism involves flicking irritant hairs, which can cause a rash, rather than biting. Popular viewing locations include Joshua Tree National Park, Griffith Park, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park.</p>

          <p>A declining number of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is creating a critical public safety challenge, as nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews are volunteers. Between 1985 and 2020, the number of volunteers dropped by over 20%, while emergency call volumes more than tripled, leading to burnout and resource strain. This shortage could force more towns to switch to paid fire departments, a move that would significantly increase taxpayer costs. To combat the decline, some lawmakers are proposing incentives like student loan forgiveness to recruit younger volunteers and ensure the continued viability of these essential community services.</p>

The judge cited an incident where Bolsonaro addressed supporters via his son's phone at a rally as a deliberate violation.

The president's comments contrasted the campaign with what he termed "woke" advertising by other companies.

The study concluded that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely result in high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States.

          <p>Maui firefighters are currently battling a brush fire in Ka'anapali, near the location of the catastrophic Lahaina wildfires that occurred nearly two years ago. The blaze is located near the old Sugar Cane Train warehouse, prompting the closure of Honoapiʻilani Highway in both directions to facilitate firefighting efforts. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the fire is slowly being contained, but smoke continues to impact the area. The incident raises concerns in a community still recovering from the 2023 fires, which were among the deadliest in U.S. history, claiming over 100 lives.</p>

          <p>Gareth Ward, an independent member of the New South Wales state parliament in Australia, is fighting to keep his seat from his jail cell after being convicted of sexual assault. Ward was found guilty last month of assaulting two young men and is in custody awaiting sentencing. Despite calls for his resignation from both the Premier and Opposition leader, Ward's lawyers are seeking a court injunction to prevent the parliament from expelling him. The situation has been labeled "unconscionable" by political leaders, as taxpayers continue to pay his salary while his constituents are left without representation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean “Diddy” Combs’ motion for release, ordering that he remain in custody at the Brooklyn Metropolitan Detention Center until his sentencing on October 3. Combs was convicted on two prostitution-related charges, though he was cleared of racketeering and sex trafficking. His lawyers argued for his release, citing ongoing threats at the notoriously troubled facility and insisting he is not a flight risk. However, the judge ruled that Combs failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to warrant his release, keeping the former music mogul incarcerated ahead of his sentencing.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has attributed the stock market's recent rebound to the strong earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Apple. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over new tariffs, the major indexes surged on Monday, recouping previous losses. Cramer noted that the financial strength, diverse revenue streams, and controlled expenses of these tech giants make them resilient forces in the market. He highlighted impressive growth in cloud infrastructure at Microsoft and user engagement at Meta as key drivers of investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held firearm says new, stricter gun licensing laws in the UK make her feel hopeful. Emma Ambler has campaigned for reform since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require more referees for applicants, mandatory checks with partners for signs of domestic abuse, and greater scrutiny of an applicant's honesty. Ambler believes these changes are a meaningful step toward preventing similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>

After an inquiry from the Associated Press about the potential conflict of interest, the line was removed from the filing. A law firm involved called it a clerical error, but government ethics experts argue it reveals an attempt to exploit public office for private gain.</p>

Co Tupul, a single mother of three U.S. citizens, was placed in expedited removal, a fast-track process typically reserved for recent arrivals.

          <p>California is on track for a more severe wildfire season than last year, with significantly more acreage burned, largely due to major fires in the southern part of the state. As of mid-July, over 220,000 acres have burned, far exceeding the five-year average for this point in the season. Limited winter rains and early heat waves have left vegetation in Southern California critically dry, fueling large and erratic blazes like the ongoing Gifford fire. While Northern California has had a slower start, officials warn that conditions are drying out, with an above-normal fire potential projected statewide through October.</p>
