        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to reinstate an asset test for seniors seeking Medi-Cal healthcare benefits to address rising program costs. Under the proposal, individuals with assets exceeding $2,000 would be ineligible for Medi-Cal, a move projected to save the state millions. Disability Rights California argues that the asset test would harm vulnerable populations by demanding extreme poverty for healthcare access. Newsom defends the proposal as a necessary step to balance the state budget amidst increasing Medi-Cal costs due to factors like higher enrollment and pharmacy expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

Bandini noted that the format benefited PSG, enabling their development throughout the season and providing a more entertaining journey for viewers.

          <p>The United States has presented Iran with a proposal for a nuclear deal aimed at curbing Tehran's enriched uranium production. This development follows a report by the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, which indicated that Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium, a key component in nuclear weapons. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that accepting the deal is in Tehran's "best interest," while Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the proposal would be appropriately addressed. The IAEA report noted that Iran possesses over 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade levels.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have expressed disappointment with Hamas's response to the proposed Gaza cease-fire, stating that it "only takes us backward." Hamas is reportedly seeking changes to the guarantees for a permanent end to the war, a long-standing point of contention with Israel. The U.S. had presented a proposal that Washington claims Israel accepted, but Hamas's demands for a complete Israeli withdrawal and sustained humanitarian aid remain unmet. The core sticking point remains the guarantees for a permanent end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, warns that China‚Äôs quantum satellite, Micius, could be hacked due to time delays between its onboard lasers. These delays provide opportunities for eavesdroppers to exploit flaws in the experimental implementation of quantum key distribution (QKD). Miller analyzed data from communication between a ground station and Micius, revealing that the distribution of quantum keys was insecure. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data in single light particles, theoretically making it unhackable, but realistic QKD devices can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks.</p>

Critics argue that the program has been used to clear native trees for cash crops, undermining sustainable livelihoods and biodiversity.
