          <p>Three former Memphis police officers were acquitted of state charges, including second-degree murder, in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols following a traffic stop. The jury deliberated for about 8 1/2 hours before finding Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith not guilty on all charges. Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, died three days after being punched, kicked, and hit with a baton by five officers. The officers still face federal charges, and two other officers have agreed to plead guilty to state charges. The article notes that the defense argued the officers followed police policies, while the prosecution claimed they used excessive force.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has called on the FAA to take immediate action to resolve ongoing delays at Newark Liberty International Airport, attributing the issues to technology outages, staffing shortages, and the FAA's approval of more flights per hour than the airport can handle. Kirby suggests limiting flights during construction, returning Newark to a slot-controlled airport, modernizing the air traffic control system, and fully staffing air traffic control. The FAA says it is installing new high-bandwidth communications, replacing copper wires with fiberoptic wires, and boosting controller staffing.

          <p>As Europe marks 80 years since the end of World War II, questions arise about the US's continued commitment to European security, especially with Donald Trump calling NATO's security arrangements into question. The article discusses how the US has ensured security in Europe since WWII, but Trump's stance is causing concern among European leaders. Some in Germany advocate for Europe to develop its own security policy independent of America, while others caution against complete independence, emphasizing the need for continued cooperation with the US. The article considers whether a stronger Europe can replace a US that can no longer be relied upon or if a new alliance with Washington is possible.</p>

          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, savers may be wondering whether to renew their maturing CD accounts. Despite potential cuts, renewing can still be a smart move because the rate cut trajectory could easily change, and the rate cuts, when they come, are likely to be small. Savers would also lose the interest-earning opportunity in the interim, as alternatives like high-yield savings accounts have variable rates and traditional savings accounts have much lower rates.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower U.S. borrowing costs. The central bank signaled that economic risks are on the rise, citing increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. The Fed's statement offered no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, and economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. The article notes that the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear.</p>

          <p>Used vehicle prices have jumped to their highest level since October 2023 due to consumers rushing purchases amid fears of price hikes caused by auto tariffs. Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index increased 4.9% last month compared with a year earlier. The index also marked a 2.7% increase from March, which is significant compared with a historically typical month-to-month index move of 0.2%. The article notes that strong price appreciation was expected in response to the tariffs, and that's exactly what came.</p>
