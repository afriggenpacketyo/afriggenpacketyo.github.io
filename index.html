Despite this, the company maintained its full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty from potential tariff impacts on consumers and its business. CEO Corie Barry highlighted strong performance in mobile phones and gaming, especially with the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, but noted ongoing challenges in appliances and home theater categories.

          <p>Trade relations between India and the US have dramatically deteriorated, with most Indian goods now facing 50% tariffs in the US market. Tensions escalated after failed trade talks and an additional 25% tariff imposed by Trump over India's Russian oil purchases. The US is India's largest trade partner, and experts predict a significant drop in Indian exports, potentially jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of jobs in sectors like textiles and jewelry. While India faces greater economic losses, the US could see impacts on manufacturing relocation plans and a reduction in Indian students.</p>

          <p>Martin Rafferty, a musician from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing for 24 hours straight. Despite breaking his thumb last week, Rafferty continued his performance, ultimately ending his set after 27 hours due to a fading voice. His impressive feat, which surpassed the previous unofficial record, was undertaken to raise money for a local Christmas toy appeal. The event required adherence to strict rules, including not repeating songs within four hours and a 30-second break between each track.</p>

          <p>An Alabama death row inmate, Christopher Barbour, has been granted a new trial after 31 years, following recent forensic tests that found another man's DNA on the victim's body. Barbour, 56, was convicted in the 1992 fatal stabbing of Thelma Bishop Roberts, with his confession being a key part of the original case, which he later recanted, alleging police coercion. New DNA testing in 2021 linked semen on the victim to her neighbor, who is currently incarcerated for an unrelated murder. The federal judge ruled that prosecutors failed to disclose initial forensic notes excluding Barbour, violating his constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government has proposed changes to its controversial tax rules for self-catering holiday accommodation, aiming to ease requirements for owners. Since 2023, properties needed to be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower non-domestic rates. The new proposal suggests an average of 182 let days over several years and allowing charity donations to count towards the target. While some welcome the flexibility, critics argue the changes are insufficient to address the ongoing crisis in Welsh tourism, with many businesses struggling to meet current thresholds and facing significant backdated tax bills.

          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes that the prehistoric need for assistance in child-rearing was a primary catalyst for the development of human language. Beekman argues that the demands of vulnerable infants, combined with biological changes allowing for a wider range of sounds, drove early humans to develop complex communication. This theory challenges traditional male-dominated evolutionary perspectives by emphasizing familial care and cooperation. The article highlights how the intricate work of raising children may have pushed humans to discover new internal capacities and modes of connection, shaping our species in fundamental ways.</p>
