            <p>President Trump has announced a new set of tariffs, imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports to the US effective April 5th, with some countries being exempt. Customized tariffs will be applied to approximately 60 'worst offenders' starting April 9th, including the European Union (20%), China (54%), and Vietnam (46%). Canada and Mexico are excluded from the baseline rate due to previous tariffs related to fentanyl and border issues. Trump believes these tariffs are necessary to address trade imbalances and protect American jobs, but they are expected to send economic shockwaves around the world. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Following the escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, investment firms like Citi and Natixis have lowered their GDP forecasts for China to 4.2% for the year. This adjustment reflects concerns about the impact of increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing's retaliatory measures on U.S. businesses. While Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have maintained their forecasts at 4.5%, they have cautioned about increasing downside risks. China's official growth target for 2025 is 'around 5%', but analysts suggest this goal may be difficult to achieve given the current trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot exclude Associated Press (AP) journalists from the Oval Office, Air Force One, and other restricted areas due to the news agency's refusal to adopt the President's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico. Judge McFadden stated that blocking AP journalists is contrary to the First Amendment. The ruling comes after the White House curtailed AP's access in mid-February. The judge's order is paused until Sunday to allow the White House time to appeal. The AP's executive editor emphasized that the lawsuit is about preventing government control over what the press can say.</p>

The Treasury Department argues the agreement will help secure U.S. borders and is part of the administration's immigration crackdown.
