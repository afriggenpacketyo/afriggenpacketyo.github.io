        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning advising citizens traveling abroad to be cautious of souvenirs that could be modified for surveillance. The agency stated that items like key rings or jewelry might contain hidden cameras, listening devices, or trackers, potentially used by foreign spy agencies to gather intelligence. State sector workers, academics, and students are identified as prime targets for these "forced gifts," which could lead to the leakage of state secrets if brought into classified environments. This warning aligns with China's amended counter-espionage law, which prohibits the possession of specialized spy equipment.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's newly appointed Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated she will likely pursue a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to address the nation's significant fiscal needs. With global donors having only committed about half of the estimated $75 billion required over the next two years, fresh financing is critical. The discussions are expected to take place during an IMF review in August, as the country's current $16 billion loan program is set to expire in 2027. Meanwhile, Ukraine's defense minister stated that the country requires at least $120 billion for defense spending next year.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Borrowing in June Surpasses Expectations, Increasing Fiscal Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:53:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, a £6.6 billion increase from the previous year and higher than anticipated. According to the Office for National Statistics, this rise was driven by increased spending on public services and debt interest payments, which have nearly doubled due to inflation. This figure represents the second-highest June borrowing on record, fueling speculation that the Chancellor may need to implement tax hikes in the upcoming autumn budget. Economists warn that the long-term outlook for public finances remains challenging amid policy reversals and economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annie Farmer, a key witness in the Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking trial, is urging the U.S. government to release all information related to Jeffrey Epstein. In a recent interview, Farmer expressed exhaustion with the politicization of the case and stated that victims feel used, while little new information has emerged. She remains skeptical of the Trump administration's handling of the files and voiced concern over the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey. Farmer was motivated to speak out partly due to the recent suicide of fellow accuser Virginia Giuffre and calls from some to pardon Maxwell.</p>

          <p>The estimated cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in the UK has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous £20 billion figure. A plant official clarified that earlier estimates did not account for inflation and risk, and confirmed the new cost will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during the decade-long construction phase. The government has confirmed its 44.9% stake in the project, alongside investments from companies like Centrica and EDF. Critics argue that the public will bear the burden of inevitable cost overruns for the plant, which is expected to begin operations in the mid-to-late 2030s.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet to bolster her frontbench team. Former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly is expected to make a prominent return, a move intended to intensify the opposition's challenge to the Labour government. The reshuffle is described as part of the party's policy renewal and a demonstration of unity under Badenoch's leadership. This political shake-up occurs as the Conservative Party continues to struggle in opinion polls, often placing third or fourth, and follows poor results in recent local elections eight months into her leadership.</p>

          <p>This article explores how Hollywood films are altered by censors in various countries to comply with local cultural and political standards. In India, scenes deemed "overly sensual" are cut, while in Iran, digital technology is used to alter images to conform to Islamic modesty. Russia has historically removed scenes depicting homosexuality to comply with its "anti-gay" laws, and China's strict censorship guidelines prohibit content related to cults or superstition, leading to altered plots and endings. This has led some Hollywood studios to self-censor or create alternate versions of films to gain access to lucrative but restricted markets, raising concerns about compromises on free expression.</p>

King's surviving children, Martin III and Bernice, called the release ill-timed and asked the public to review the documents with empathy and historical context.

The WHO described the incidents as part of a systematic destruction of health facilities, which cripples efforts to support Gaza's collapsing health system.

Analysts predict the daily number of drones launched could soon exceed 1,000, as Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and inflict maximum damage. This surge in drone warfare reflects a strategic shift, with Russia establishing a separate military branch dedicated to unmanned systems and their tactical deployment.</p>

          <p>A massive recall has been issued for more than 5.2 million above-ground swimming pools sold in the U.S. and Canada due to a serious drowning hazard. The recall affects pools from brands like Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup sold since 2002, which feature external compression straps that can act as a foothold for small children, allowing them to access the water unsupervised. According to safety regulators, this design flaw is linked to the drowning deaths of nine children in the U.S. between 2007 and 2022. Consumers are urged to contact the manufacturers for a free repair kit to replace the hazardous strap.</p>

The project, with an estimated investment of $167 billion, will feature five cascade stations and is expected to have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure, construction, and hydropower companies when markets reopened. The river, known as the Brahmaputra in India, is a shared resource, and large-scale dam projects have previously raised concerns in downstream countries.</p>

One attendee called it "one of the most misleading shows I've ever seen," with some leaving early and demanding refunds. The creator, Layered Reality, responded that the concept evolved during production and that the final product is a theatrical experience, not a traditional hologram concert, designed to offer a new perspective on Elvis's life.</p>

          <p>A Brazilian Supreme Court justice has threatened former President Jair Bolsonaro with imprisonment for allegedly violating a court-ordered social media ban. The ban was imposed as part of an investigation into claims he plotted a coup. The violation occurred when a video of a speech Bolsonaro gave to journalists was widely circulated on social media by his political allies and sons. Justice Alexandre de Moraes has given Bolsonaro's lawyers 24 hours to explain the breach. The incident has ignited a debate in Brazil over whether a social media ban should extend to interviews that are subsequently shared by third parties.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes U.S. President Donald Trump's increasing reliance on tariffs as a primary foreign policy tool, often using them to achieve goals typically associated with sanctions. Since returning to office, Trump has used the threat of steep tariffs to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking, creating significant uncertainty for global markets. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be deployed unilaterally and quickly, providing what the White House sees as flexible leverage. However, critics warn this approach destabilizes global trade and could be linked to broader de-globalization and conflict, a departure from the post-war consensus that open markets foster peace.</p>

The measure, supported by the mayor, aims to clear sidewalks and address sanitation issues, targeting at least 400 RVs currently used as homes by people unable to afford housing. A permit program will exempt some current residents, provided they work with the city to find alternative housing and agree to sell their RVs. Critics argue the policy is cruel, as it displaces vulnerable populations without providing sufficient and immediate housing solutions for everyone affected.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl critiques the tendency of U.S. and British publishers to favor stories from the Balkans that focus on war, tragedy, and political trauma. She recounts being advised by a publisher to write about themes specific to her culture's problematic history, revealing an expectation that Balkan literature should serve an explanatory or didactic purpose for Western readers. Schnabl argues this preference for self-exoticizing narratives limits the diversity of voices from the region, overlooking universal stories that don't fit into a preconceived mold of a perpetually troubled place. She calls for publishers to engage with a broader range of stories beyond those that reinforce stereotypes.</p>
