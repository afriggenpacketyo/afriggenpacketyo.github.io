          <p>Two teenagers, now 16, have received life sentences with a minimum term of over 15 years for the murder of 14-year-old Kelyan Bokassa. The attack, which occurred on a public bus in Woolwich, south-east London, involved the victim being stabbed 27 times with machetes in a 14-second assault captured on CCTV. In a victim impact statement, Kelyan's mother expressed her profound grief, while the judge acknowledged that no sentence could truly reflect the loss of a young life. Both convicted teens had prior convictions for carrying knives in public.</p>

While Thymen Arensman claimed a dramatic victory in stage 19, Pogacar finished alongside his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, maintaining a lead of over four minutes. With only two flatter stages remaining before the final ride into Paris, Pogacar's overall victory appears all but certain. The stage was shortened due to a herd of diseased cattle on the original route.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that deportation flights have commenced from the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility located in the Everglades. The state, in cooperation with federal ICE officials, has begun processing hundreds of detainees for deportation directly from the site. Officials also warned of an impending "surge" in immigration arrests across Florida, with nearly 3,000 additional state and local officers now credentialed to enforce federal immigration laws. The facility's capacity is being expanded, despite reports of poor and unsanitary conditions from detainees held there.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price plummeted by 9% following the company's announcement of significant cost-cutting measures for its struggling chip manufacturing business. Despite a better-than-expected earnings report, investors were spooked by a warning that Intel may discontinue its foundry business if it fails to secure a major customer for its next-generation 14A chip process. The company is canceling facility projects in Germany and Poland and has already laid off 15% of its workforce, with the new CEO citing excessive investment without adequate demand in previous years.

          <p>Two men, Jordan Willis and Ivory Carson, faced murder charges in court for the deaths of three Kansas City Chiefs fans found in a friend's backyard in January 2024. During a preliminary hearing, a judge found sufficient probable cause to proceed to trial on second-degree felony-murder charges. The defense argued there is no evidence proving the defendants provided the fatal drugs, as all three victims died from a combination of fentanyl and cocaine. Police testimony indicated no signs of trauma or foul play at the scene, with an initial presumption of overdose.</p>

The author notes that the visit is focused on Trump's golf resorts, including the dedication of a new course named after his mother, with official meetings being secondary. The piece highlights this as the latest example of Trump using the presidency for personal profit, citing his family's increased wealth and the high cost of his frequent visits to his own properties, while questioning the lack of significant outrage from Congress or the media.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed course on federal oversight of police departments, ending investigations and consent decrees in nearly two dozen cities, including Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis, Minnesota. This move halts a key accountability measure used to curb police abuse and civil rights violations, which had been implemented following high-profile cases like the death of Breonna Taylor. While some local officials have pledged to continue with reforms voluntarily, community activists and civil rights groups have expressed deep disappointment, viewing it as an abdication of the Justice Department's duty to enforce civil rights.</p>

          <p>Thousands of resident doctors in England have started a five-day strike, creating a challenging period for the National Health Service. The walkout, organized by the British Medical Association (BMA) over a long-running pay dispute, is the 12th such action since March 2023. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that while disruption is unavoidable, efforts are being made to keep as many non-urgent services running as possible. The BMA, which argues that pay has fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008, has begun agreeing to requests for some doctors to return to work in critical areas.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence may not be ready to replace most human jobs entirely, it presents a significant challenge for the future of work, particularly for entry-level positions, according to Wharton professor Ethan Mollick. He argues that the key skills needed will be judgment and deep expertise, which are traditionally gained through apprenticeship-style work that AI can now perform. Mollick expresses concern that this will make it harder for new workers to gain the experience necessary to oversee AI systems. He advises students to seek "bundled jobs" with diverse tasks that are less susceptible to complete automation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the possibility of clemency for convicted Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, stating, "it's something I haven't thought about," while affirming he has the authority to do so. When questioned about his own past association with Epstein, Trump deflected, insisting reporters should instead focus on others like former President Bill Clinton. The comments came as Maxwell was scheduled for a second day of interviews with a top Justice Department official in Florida, amid growing pressure on the Trump administration to release its investigative files on Epstein.</p>

Gómez stated the fund is designed to help good, hard-working people who are now anxious about being arrested and deported. The program, supported by donations, will operate through the archdiocese's 288 parishes, reactivating delivery systems established during the pandemic.</p>

The development comes amid increasing public and political pressure on the Trump administration to release its files on the Epstein investigation.

          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window has seen dominant spending from the top clubs, with Liverpool leading the way at £269 million spent on new players so far. Chelsea, Arsenal, and Manchester City have also invested heavily, each spending well over £100 million to strengthen their squads. This massive outlay by the league's elite contrasts with the rest of the division and raises questions about competitiveness. According to a football finance expert, Liverpool's spending is financially sustainable due to increased revenues from their recent success and expanded stadium, keeping them well within profit and sustainability rules.

          <p>Auction sales at the major houses of Sotheby's, Christie's, and Phillips fell 6% in the first half of the year, continuing a multi-year decline and raising fears of a structural shift in the art market. Total sales are down 44% from their 2022 peak, a divergence from soaring stock markets and overall wealth, which historically correlate with art prices. Experts suggest this could be a temporary dip or a more fundamental change driven by a generational shift, as younger, digital-native collectors may not share the tastes of the baby boomers who long dominated the market.

The UK government, however, has traditionally been more cautious, preferring to use recognition as a lever at the end of a process to avoid upsetting the U.S. and Israel.
