        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called for Prince Andrew to appear before MPs to address his lease of Royal Lodge, amidst demands for greater transparency in royal finances. A document seen by BBC News confirmed the Prince made large upfront payments, totaling £8m, to effectively buy out future rent obligations on his 75-year lease, rather than paying annual rent. This arrangement has been criticized as a "rotten deal" by former Public Accounts Committee chair Baroness Margaret Hodge, who argues the Crown Estate is obliged to maximize income for taxpayers. The article also notes renewed focus on Prince Andrew's links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and proposals for a new law enabling the King to remove royal titles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government has entered a significant shutdown, now ranking as the second-longest in the nation's history due to Congress's failure to agree on new funding. This prolonged lapse in appropriations has broad implications, leading to the suspension of many non-essential federal services and causing numerous federal employees to face furloughs or delayed pay. The ongoing political stalemate highlights deep ideological divisions over budget priorities and the increasing difficulty of legislative compromise in Washington. While essential services largely continue, the uncertainty creates significant stress for federal workers and could impact various sectors of the economy, underscoring the critical need for a swift resolution to the funding crisis.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 11:13:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares dropped 9% after the company missed its third-quarter earnings estimates, attributing the shortfall to an unexpected 10% tax expense from a dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. The streamer clarified this tax was not previously forecasted and is not specific to Netflix or streaming, and it does not anticipate a material impact on future results. Despite the earnings miss, Netflix reported a 17% revenue increase, driven by membership growth, pricing adjustments, and its best ad sales quarter ever, projecting continued growth for Q4. The company is also expanding its "KPop Demon Hunters" franchise with product partnerships and exploring live experiences.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 11:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clarified that the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas applies specifically to new applicants residing abroad, rather than those already holding an H-1B or changing visa types. President Trump introduced this substantial fee to address perceived program abuse and compel U.S. companies to prioritize hiring American workers. However, economists anticipate mixed results, with some research indicating that H-1B workers can actually contribute to broader job creation. This guidance provides crucial details for employers and foreign workers navigating the updated immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A new study by Schroders reveals that 90% of working Americans intend to disregard common financial advice to wait until age 70 to claim Social Security benefits, which would maximize their monthly payments. Instead, 44% expect to file before reaching full retirement age (67), despite understanding the 30% reduction in benefits. This decision often stems from immediate financial necessity or concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency, as many face retirement savings shortfalls. The article notes that while the program faces a financial crunch by 2034, payments would continue, albeit at a reduced rate.</p>

          <p>Trade officials from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet in Malaysia to address an escalating dispute over rare earths, which are critical components for high-technology products. This meeting is seen as a crucial precursor to a potential summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea, amidst deep bilateral divisions. The U.S. has accused China of violating prior commitments to ensure the supply of these essential materials, while Beijing presents a differing narrative, underscoring significant miscommunication. Despite the ongoing tensions, there remains hope for finding a "good landing zone" for more equitable trade relations between the two nations.</p>

This inflationary trend, coupled with a late start to fall, creates significant inventory challenges for retailers who typically stock up on outerwear for colder months.

Researchers interviewed by the Post describe their careers as "chaotic" and their future in the U.S. as increasingly uncertain, drawing stark parallels to China's own Cultural Revolution which crippled its science and education sectors for a decade. This trend, if widespread, could have significant long-term implications for American scientific leadership and innovation, potentially bolstering China's technological advancements.

While some strategists view this trend as an exciting "fourth industrial revolution" and an opportunity, others warn of potential risks to investors due to the lack of broad diversification.

          <p>Drone attacks, apparently launched by Sudan's RSF paramilitary forces, have seemingly derailed the planned reopening of Khartoum International Airport, which had been shuttered for over a year and a half due to civil war. Residents reported multiple explosions near the airport, leading to an announced delay in its resumption of domestic flights. The reopening was intended to signify government control and normalization in the capital, which has seen efforts towards reconstruction. However, RSF leader Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo had warned of shooting down planes suspected of supporting the army, highlighting the persistent instability and ongoing conflict in the region, particularly in Darfur.</p>

          <p>A small plane made an emergency landing at Heartwell Park in Long Beach, California, resulting in injuries to both the elderly pilot and a woman who was struck by the aircraft. Firefighters responded to the scene, finding the glider on its belly with broken landing gear after it touched down. Both individuals sustained moderate injuries but are reported to be in stable condition, with Mayor Rex Richardson emphasizing that it "could've been a whole lot worse" and thankfully no fatalities occurred. The plane was returning to Compton after a flight when the crash happened, and an investigation into the precise cause of the incident is currently underway.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has asserted that he would have the final say on whether his administration pays him roughly $230 million in damages for past federal investigations, including the Mar-a-Lago search and the Russia inquiry. Trump, who filed claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, stated, "I'm the one that makes the decision, right?" This creates an unprecedented ethical and legal dilemma, as the process is typically handled by career Justice Department officials insulated from political interference. The act itself bars claims from discretionary actions, making a president seeking damages for investigations into his own conduct highly unusual and legally questionable.</p>

          <p>This article debunks viral claims that protein powders are poisoning Americans with lead, arguing that a Consumer Reports investigation used an "impossibly low" lead exposure baseline from California's Prop 65. While lead exposure is serious, the article explains that the Prop 65 limit of 0.5 micrograms per day is significantly lower than the FDA's more realistic reference levels (e.g., 8.8 micrograms for women of childbearing age), which already account for lead naturally present in food. All 23 protein products tested by Consumer Reports were found relatively safe by FDA standards. The article highlights that the real issue is the under-regulation of supplements in the U.S., not widespread contamination.</p>

The plant-based food company's stock, which had become a penny stock after a long decline since its 2019 IPO, is experiencing a resurgence reminiscent of pandemic-era retail trading frenzies.

These lapses in federal funding began after Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti's opinions in the early 1980s clarified that agencies lacked authority to operate without approved funding. Notable shutdowns include eight under President Reagan, two lengthy ones under President Clinton stemming from budget disputes with Republicans, and recent impasses under Presidents Obama and Trump, often over healthcare or immigration. The most recent, in late 2018, lasted 34 days and incurred $3 billion in permanent losses.</p>

          <p>During a government shutdown, members of Congress and the President continue to receive their salaries, a stark contrast to hundreds of thousands of other federal employees who face delayed pay or furloughs. This distinction stems from the U.S. Constitution, which permanently appropriates lawmakers' pay and explicitly prohibits reducing the President's salary while in office. Most federal employees, whether deemed essential and required to work or furloughed, will not be paid until funding is officially restored to their respective agencies, though a 2019 law now guarantees them back pay. Congressional staffers' pay is also delayed, while federal contractors are not guaranteed any compensation whatsoever.</p>

Apple argues such a move risks "weaker privacy," "delayed access to new features," and a "fragmented experience," citing similar issues in the EU where it faces heavy regulation.

          <p>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) is currently vetting over 300 new listing applications, affirming the city's strong momentum after becoming the world's largest initial public offering (IPO) market. HKEX CEO Bonnie Chan Yiting noted active involvement from international long-term investors across Europe, the U.S., the Middle East, and emerging markets, particularly in new tech company listings. This reflects confidence in mainland China's technology development and a shift in asset allocation. In the first nine months of 2025, Hong Kong's new share sales jumped 220% year-on-year, raising $23.27 billion, surpassing the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</p>

          <p>China's State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), including Sinochem Holdings and China Huaneng Group, are relocating their headquarters and thousands of employees to Xiongan New Area, Xi Jinping's "city of the future." Launched in 2017 to coordinate development in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Xiongan aims to relieve Beijing of non-capital functions and ease congestion. The influx of SOEs is attracting further investment and people, though the 100km distance from Beijing poses some challenges for staff. This strategic move is central to China's long-term urban development and economic planning, showcasing a concerted effort to build a modern, innovative urban hub.</p>
