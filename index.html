        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese police investigated a record number of stalking cases in 2024, surpassing 1,300 incidents, which is the highest since the anti-stalking law was enacted in 2000. This increase of 260 cases from the previous year prompted the National Police Agency to instruct prefectural headquarters to improve coordination with local stations to address complaints more effectively. The increased emphasis on stalking cases follows the death of Asahi Okazaki, who had reported abuse from her former partner prior to her death. The data also revealed a record 2,415 restraining orders were issued, highlighting the seriousness of stalking issues in Japan. The need for better statistical methods to include all relevant cases regardless of consultation timing was also emphasized, in order to improve response to these issues.</p>

          <p>A lawyer representing families of victims from the 2018 and 2019 Boeing 737 Max crashes has criticized a deal between Boeing and the US Justice Department as "morally repugnant." The agreement allows Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution by paying $1.1 billion, including $444.5 million to the families of the crash victims and $455 million towards improving safety and compliance programs. Sanjiv Singh, counsel for the families, argues that the deal lets Boeing sidestep true criminal accountability and that the payout is insufficient, comparing it to a mere parking ticket for the company. The crashes, linked to faulty flight control systems, resulted in the deaths of 346 people, leading to previous fraud charges and admissions of deception by Boeing.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by providing cheap solar panels, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The think tank, Renewables First, argues that the increasing flow of Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, leading to stranded assets. Muhammad Basit Ghauri, the report's lead author, highlights this as an unintentional but profound strategic contradiction, positioning Pakistan as ground zero for energy disruption. However, a Chinese energy scholar has questioned whether this vision is too expensive to be true, implying that the costs may outweigh the benefits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, argues that tariffs disrupt the global trading system and weaken economic links that stabilize international relations. He contends that President Trump's tariff policies undermine trade, disregard free trade agreements, and undercut the international rules-based order. Prasad warns that denying low-income countries the opportunity to develop their economies through trade could lead to increased migration and political discontent. He suggests that while a full-scale retreat from global trade is unlikely, international commerce is already shifting in ways that could deepen geopolitical fissures, as business interests have historically kept relationships between rivals stable.

          <p>A Japanese government report indicates that domestic tourism is struggling to keep pace with inbound visitors, prompting a focus on encouraging residents to explore their own country. The Japan Tourism Agency's annual white paper shifts its focus from inbound visitors to Japanese domestic travelers, whose numbers have not returned to pre-pandemic levels. While foreign visitors have increased, domestic trips by Japanese travelers are down by 8.2 percent compared to 2019. The agency aims to promote a new style of travel that involves more engagement with local communities to encourage repeat visits and create a sense of returning home, highlighting successful demonstration projects like the one in Dake Onsen.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a proclamation suspending travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 countries, citing national security interests and insufficient vetting processes. The affected countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Additionally, partial restrictions have been placed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban announced in January 2017, which was later ended by President Joe Biden in 2021, and has already faced opposition from Democratic lawmakers who view it as discriminatory.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether individuals working for former President Joe Biden conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state through the use of an autopen. Trump alleges that Biden's aides abused the power of presidential signatures to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority. He claims that Biden suffered from serious cognitive decline for years, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) recently concluded that Biden should not stand trial, despite evidence he broke the law, because of his mental state. The investigation will examine any activity that purposefully shielded the public from information about Biden’s mental and physical health.</p>

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum bypasses parliament and puts the question directly in the hands of the people, addressing obstacles faced by many residents due to clerical errors, insufficient income, and other systemic issues. The Italian state has been tightening its citizenship rules, and the current government quashed efforts to introduce a reform that would have automatically extended citizenship to foreign nationals who have completed a cycle of schooling. This vote presents a rare chance for Italians to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent and recognize the diversity of its residents.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging top aides masked his predecessor’s “cognitive decline”. The investigation will build on a Republican-led campaign already under way to discredit the former president and overturn some of his executive actions, including pardons and federal rules issued towards the end of his term in office. GOP lawmakers have sought testimony from five of Biden’s top aides and advisers about his “mental and physical faculties”. Trump took aim at Biden’s use of an autopen to sign executive actions, focusing on “who ran the United States while President Biden was in office”.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old student died after being struck by a vehicle in the parking lot of Campbell Hall, a private school in Studio City. The Los Angeles Police Department responded to a vehicle-on-pedestrian collision, where a green 2025 Rivian SUV struck the boy and pinned him against a white SUV. Two additional minors and three adults received non-life-threatening injuries in the collision. The cause of the collision is currently unknown, and the Mayor’s Crisis Response Team was dispatched to provide emotional support and recovery assistance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a "phased pause" in operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide, affecting over 25,000 young people ages 16 to 24. The Labor Department cited concerns about the program's outcomes and serious incident reports, but a U.S District Judge temporarily blocked the administration from eliminating the Job Corps program. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the move to suspend Job Corps operations, calling it illegal. The decision to pause operations aligned with President Trump's 2026 budget proposal and the administration's commitment to ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results.</p>

This stance contrasts with President Trump's assertion that the agreement would not allow any enrichment of uranium.
