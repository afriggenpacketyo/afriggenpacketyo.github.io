          <p>Mali's military government has dissolved all political parties, triggering protests and raising concerns about democratic backsliding. The junta, led by President Assimi Goita, cited the need for political reforms but provided no timeline for elections, initially promised for February 2022. Opposition leaders have gone missing, and human rights organizations are reporting increased repression of dissent. Former Prime Minister Moussa Mara criticized the decision as a severe blow to reconciliation efforts, further destabilizing the crisis-hit country as it faces growing security challenges and political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A new book alleges that former President Joe Biden's aides concealed his declining physical and mental state during his 2024 re-election campaign. The book, citing anonymous sources, claims that Biden's condition was so poor that aides discussed using a wheelchair but delayed doing so until after the election. The authors suggest that Biden's abrupt withdrawal from the race was due to his poor performance and physical decline, leading to Vice-President Kamala Harris's defeat by Donald Trump. A spokesperson for Biden defended his effectiveness as president, dismissing the claims of mental incapacity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reversed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, reinstating Pete Rose, "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, and 15 other players. Rose, banned for betting on baseball, and Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, are now eligible for Hall of Fame consideration. The decision comes after Rose's death and is based on the view that the deterrent effect of a lifetime ban ends upon death. However, Rose's past issues, including allegations of statutory sexual assault, could still affect his Hall of Fame chances.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that despite public denials, Israeli military officials have privately warned of widespread starvation in Gaza unless aid deliveries are restored quickly. This assessment contradicts the Israeli government's stance that its blockade on food and fuel to Gaza did not pose a major threat to civilian life. Aid agencies report that most bakeries have shut down, charity kitchens are closing, and the UN's World Food Program has run out of food stocks. The situation is exacerbated by Israeli restrictions on aid, implemented shortly before breaking a cease-fire with Hamas, leading to soaring food prices and increased looting.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to relocate thousands of civil servant jobs out of London to save money and distribute government roles across the country. The government aims to cut 12,000 roles in London and close 11 offices, saving £94m annually by 2032. New government campuses will open in Manchester and Aberdeen, with roles created in other cities. The government wants 50% of UK-based senior civil servants in regional offices by 2030, and the government expects the changes to bring £729m to the local economy by 2030.</p>
