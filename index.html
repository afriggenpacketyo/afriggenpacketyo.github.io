          <p>In a recent interview, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether all undocumented immigrants in the city should be permitted to stay. When pressed, Bass emphasized the city's reliance on immigrant labor and criticized the Trump administration's "reign of terror" and use of the National Guard. She advocated for comprehensive immigration reform rather than mass deportations, stating that many immigrants arrive out of desperation. The discussion highlighted the ongoing tension between sanctuary city policies and federal enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for the Washington Commanders NFL team to "IMMEDIATELY" change its name back to the Washington Redskins. In a social media post, Trump claimed there is significant demand for the change and that Native American people feel their heritage is being taken away. He also urged the Cleveland Guardians baseball team to revert to their former "Indians" name. The Washington team dropped its previous name in 2020 following years of criticism and pressure from sponsors and Native American groups.</p>

The demonstration was organized following the arrest of an asylum seeker in connection with alleged sexual assaults in the town. In response to the unrest, which included a similar incident days earlier, Essex Police implemented a Section 60AA order. This temporary measure allows officers to require the removal of face coverings to prevent further serious disorder.</p>

          <p>A recreational outing on the Deschutes River in Oregon turned tragic when a group of six people was swept over Dillon Falls. The Deschutes County Sheriff's Office confirmed that one person has died, three were rescued and hospitalized, and a search is ongoing for two who remain missing. Emergency responders used drones in their search efforts near the popular falls, which have a dangerous 15-foot drop. The search for the two missing individuals was paused overnight and is scheduled to resume.</p>

          <h2>Following Viral 'Affair' Incident, Chris Martin Issues Warning Before 'Jumbotron Song'</h2>

          <p>At a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned the audience that they might be shown on the large video screens during the "Jumbotron Song." The lighthearted warning comes after a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as a tech CEO and his HR chief, were filmed in an intimate moment that went viral. That incident led to the CEO's resignation amid affair allegations. Martin's new pre-song banter appears to be a subtle acknowledgment of the controversy and a friendly notice to his fans.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even as exit polls project his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The election was held amid public frustration over rising prices and a series of political scandals affecting the Liberal Democratic Party. A loss of the upper house majority, following a similar loss in the lower house last year, would significantly weaken Ishiba's political influence. The result underscores voter dissatisfaction and could destabilize the government during critical trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group have signed a peace declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations.

Reed acknowledged public fury over the "broken" state of the water sector and stated he should be judged at the next election on his progress.

This choice of destination comes despite Vance's previous critical remarks about the UK and Europe, where he has accused leaders of suppressing free speech and failing on immigration. Vance, known for his "hillbilly" memoir, will be visiting a famously genteel and affluent part of the English countryside.</p>

During the grueling race, she sang Dolly Parton songs to keep her spirits up and even paused to check on a man she saw lying on a golf course. Her dominant performance follows a previous record-breaking run on the Southern Upland Way.</p>
