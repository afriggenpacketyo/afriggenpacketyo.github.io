            <p>Roki Sasaki, the Dodgers' pitcher, demonstrated progress in his fourth start against the Chicago Cubs, pitching five solid innings and allowing only one run. Despite his strong performance, the Dodgers' offense struggled, resulting in a significant 16-0 loss. Sasaki's first start as a Dodger was in his homeland four weeks ago, and it did not go well. His third start was better, giving up one run in four innings while throwing first-pitch strikes to 13 of 17 batters. </p>

            <p>Jaron 'Boots' Ennis secured a sixth-round TKO against Eimantas Stanionis in Atlantic City, unifying the IBF and WBA welterweight titles. The fight was a dominant performance by Ennis, who systematically broke down Stanionis with precision and power. Ennis established his jab early, used it to break Stanionis’ rhythm and repeatedly caught him stepping in. Round six was the breaking point, Ennis connected with two thudding body shots that folded Stanionis forward, then unleashed a barrage upstairs that dropped the Lithuanian hard to the canvas. </p>

This decision follows concerns from US tech companies about potential price increases for consumers. The exemptions are backdated to April 5 and include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. While these goods are still subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl, the move is seen as a positive development for the tech industry, potentially preventing significant price hikes on popular devices.

            <p>The UK Parliament passed emergency legislation to allow the government to take control of the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, after the Chinese-owned company was put at risk of imminent closure. This move aims to keep its two blast furnaces operating and prevent the UK from becoming the only G7 nation without the ability to make virgin steel. The supplies needed to keep the blast furnaces running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low at the Scunthorpe plant. The government has told the company's UK management to keep the site operational.</p>
