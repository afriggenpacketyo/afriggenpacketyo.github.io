            <p>Kerri Pegg, a prison governor at HMP Kirkham, was found guilty of misconduct for having a relationship with Anthony Saunderson, an inmate and drug-dealing gang leader. Pegg helped Saunderson secure day release and was found to have received a Mercedes C-class car paid for with drug money. Saunderson, who used aliases from TV shows like Breaking Bad, was known to spend a lot of time in Pegg's office. Pegg claimed she was "stupid" in her interactions but denied wrongdoing; she now faces a custodial sentence.</p>

            <p>Stocks rebounded on Tuesday after a multi-day sell-off driven by anxieties about President Trump's tariffs, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all experiencing significant gains. Optimism was fueled by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's remarks that the administration is negotiating tariffs with several countries and expects to reach "good deals." However, analysts caution that the tariff overhang remains a concern, potentially disrupting global trade and negatively impacting economic growth. Corporate earnings season and upcoming inflation data will be closely watched.</p>

            <p>Vietnam, a major beneficiary of global trade, faces potential disruption due to President Trump's new tariffs. The country, which relies heavily on exports, has been hit with a 46% import duty, potentially shaving 1.2 percentage points off its economic growth this year. Many companies, including Nike, Adidas, and Apple, have established manufacturing hubs in Vietnam, taking advantage of relatively cheap labor and supportive government policies. The tariffs could force companies to relocate, threatening Vietnam's ambitious growth targets.</p>
