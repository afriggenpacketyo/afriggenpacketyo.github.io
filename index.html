          <h2>Musk Expresses Regret Over Social Media Criticisms of Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly expressed regret for some of his social media posts criticizing President Donald Trump, acknowledging they "went too far." This reconciliation attempt follows an explosive public dispute between the two figures, dissolving a close partnership that had seen Musk spearhead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump's administration. The feud, sparked by Musk's opposition to Trump's tax and spending bill, had fueled market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX, with Tesla shares initially taking a significant hit. Trump had previously warned of consequences if Musk supported Democratic candidates, but later indicated a willingness to speak with him. The reconciliation could ease market anxieties surrounding Musk's ventures. Optimism remains cautious as the potential long-term implications of their renewed relationship are still unknown.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea, aiming to reduce military confrontation and foster mutual trust. This decision by President Lee Jae Myung's administration seeks to ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts had resumed in June of the previous year under Lee's predecessor in response to North Korea's launch of waste-carrying balloons into the South. The Unification Ministry has also urged activists to halt leaflet distribution, citing heightened tensions and risks to residents in border areas. These actions reflect a shift towards a more pragmatic approach in inter-Korean relations.</p>

Ma, a former chairman of Taiwanâ€™s main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), will attend the Straits Forum in Xiamen and a ceremony in Gansu honoring a legendary Han Chinese ancestor. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council expressed regret and incomprehension over Ma's decision, while the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) accused him of supporting Beijing's agenda.

          <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's administration is engaged in a revolutionary assault on the U.S. government, facing increasing resistance from courts, Wall Street, and even former allies. The administration's goals include concentrating power in the presidency, replacing civil servants with loyalists, and shifting resources from the poor to the rich. Methods employed include targeted attacks on institutions and the deployment of military force against protesters. As Trump's agenda faces legal challenges and internal opposition, he is choosing radicalization and polarization, potentially leading to violence, thereby threatening the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Adam Weymouth's book, "Lone Wolf," explores the reemergence of wolves in Europe and the divisions it creates within rural communities. Following the path of a wolf named Slavc, Weymouth examines how the animal's return reflects anxieties about polarized politics, climate change, and shifting demographics. Farmers in the Lessinia mountains, for example, see the wolf as a symbol of broader frustrations, leading to illegal killings and a narrative of rural victims versus urban elites. The article highlights the need for effective conflict-mitigation strategies and honest communication to ensure the sustainable coexistence of wolves and people.</p>

          <p>The article explores the theory of "recession pop," upbeat music from the time of the Great Recession, as a potential economic indicator. It questions whether music truly reflects economic trends, noting that music industry struggles and diverse musical styles existed during the recession. While some artists like Katy Perry embodied the upbeat sound, others like Justin Timberlake and Rihanna offered different tones. The author suggests the current interest in recession pop may be more about millennial nostalgia than economic forecasting. The author concludes that the genre is slippery and may not reflect any real economic trend.</p>
