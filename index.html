            <p>An Italian media outlet has identified a British couple, Elaine and Graeme Winn, as among the four fatalities in a cable car crash near Naples. The cable car cabin plummeted after a support cable snapped, prompting a criminal investigation despite the operator's claim of a recent successful safety inspection. A fifth person, the brother of an Israeli woman who also died in the crash, remains critically injured in the hospital. The Mount Faito cable car has been in operation since 1952 and a similar accident occurred in 1960.</p>

            <p>Unusual volatility in the U.S. bond market, triggered by trade tariffs, has raised concerns about investor confidence in the American economy. A sharp rise in bond yields suggests investors are demanding higher returns due to uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs. This could lead to increased borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially hindering economic growth and job creation. The situation has drawn comparisons to the UK's mini-Budget crisis in 2022 and prompted President Trump to introduce a pause on higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An opinion piece argues that Donald Trump's immigration policies, particularly the deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador, mirror the authoritarian tactics of President Nayib Bukele. The author contends that Trump is using anti-establishment anger to justify an authoritarian slide, similar to Bukele's crackdown on gangs. Both leaders cultivate a culture of fear and undermine the rule of law, outsourcing egregious actions to foreign actors and sites. The author highlights the human cost of these policies, citing cases of wrongful deportations and detentions.</p>

            <p>President Trump shared what appears to be a digitally altered image of a deported man's hand, claiming it showed MS-13 tattoos. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador, and Trump accused Democrats of supporting his return despite alleged gang affiliations. Courts have not confirmed Abrego Garcia's gang membership, and the image's authenticity is being questioned. The post follows a meeting between Senator Chris Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.</p>
