            <h2>Global Emissions Tax Discussed at Shipping Talks</h2>

            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a UN agency, is holding talks in London to establish regulations to phase out fossil fuels in global shipping. The discussions include a potential global emissions levy or carbon credit scheme, which could significantly impact the climate. However, implementing a carbon tax faces challenges due to concerns about U.S. tariffs, trade wars, and opposition from some member states. Fortescue's Sara Edmonson calls the talks historic but notes uncertainty about a global carbon price.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 104% levy on Chinese goods, have taken effect, escalating global trade war fears and causing Asian markets to decline. The White House claims the tariffs are designed to open negotiations, but China has vowed to retaliate. Business experts warn of potential inflation, while the EU seeks to de-escalate tensions.

Some Republicans are exploring ways to limit Trump's tariff power, but the White House has signaled a veto.</p>

Free speech advocates argue that the government is violating the Constitution by targeting immigrants for their activism and political beliefs. Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Khalil's green card, citing potential adverse foreign policy consequences.</p>

            <p>Chinese commentators suggest that China may retaliate against the US's 104% tariffs by expanding the trade dispute to include the services sector. This could involve restricting US firms from participating in Chinese government procurement processes and limiting cooperation between Chinese companies and US law firms and consultancies. Other potential countermeasures include increasing tariffs on US soybeans, banning imports of US poultry and Hollywood films, suspending cooperation on fentanyl control, and investigating US companies over intellectual property.</p>

            <p>A second unvaccinated child has died in Texas from measles-related complications as the outbreak continues to spread. The death comes as the US has confirmed at least 607 measles cases this year, more than double the number in all of 2024. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., despite a history of anti-vaccine activism, says that "The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine." Doctors are on high alert and are urging people to check their vaccination records and to get vaccinated.</p>

Despite the aim of bringing manufacturing back to the US, a trade group says this is unlikely. Manufacturers in Cambodia are looking at other countries to mitigate the tariffs.

The algal bloom has appeared for four consecutive years, raising concerns it may be turning into an annual event.</p>

Natixis also lowered its forecast to 4.2%, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs warned of increasing downside risks to their 4.5% growth predictions.

The accident, which killed four people and injured six, occurred near Sea World on the Gold Coast. An investigation found that one pilot did not hear a vital radio call due to the faulty antenna, and changes by Sea World eroded risk controls over time. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau made 28 findings underlining key lessons for operators and pilots.</p>
