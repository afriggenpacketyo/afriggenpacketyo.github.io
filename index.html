          <p>In Sean Combs' racketeering and sex-trafficking trial, a former personal assistant known as 'Mia' testified about the demanding and sometimes violent work environment under Combs, stating that he sexually assaulted her multiple times. Mia described instances of physical violence, including being thrown against a wall and into a pool, and detailed instances of sexual assault, including being forced to perform oral sex and being penetrated against her will. The prosecution argues that Combs subjected Mia to forced labor, including sexual activity, through violence and threats, while the defense claims that any sexual activity was consensual and that Mia expressed love for Combs in messages. The trial continues with cross-examination of Mia and further testimonies related to Combs' alleged criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has given Harvard University 30 days to respond to the proposed revocation of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) certification, a partial backtrack amid a legal challenge. A federal judge plans to issue a preliminary injunction to prevent the administration from immediately revoking Harvard's SEVP certification without due process. Harvard is arguing that the revocation is a violation of its First Amendment rights, retaliation for not complying with government demands. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claims the revocation is necessary because Harvard failed to provide requested information about international students, but the judge feels an order is necessary to protect international students who are anxious about coming to the university.</p>

          <p>The daughter of Juliana Leon, who died during a 2021 Pacific Northwest heat wave, is suing seven oil and gas companies for wrongful death, alleging they failed to warn the public about the dangers of planet-warming emissions and suppressed scientific consensus on global warming. This case marks the first time fossil fuel companies have been sued over an individual's death linked to climate change-induced weather conditions. The lawsuit argues that these companies knew for decades that their products would dangerously alter the planet's atmosphere but continued production while undermining public awareness. The legal action seeks monetary damages and includes claims of creating a public nuisance and failure to warn under Washingtonâ€™s product liability act.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that Elon Musk's tenure overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has permanently altered how Americans view federal spending, despite criticisms. DOGE estimates it saved taxpayers $160 billion, though some sources claim the figure is closer to $63 billion, which is still a substantial amount. The piece highlights the speed and transparency with which DOGE identified and cut wasteful spending, citing examples such as funding for a former Taliban member and Sesame Street broadcasts in Iraq. Musk's approach has made bureaucrats more accountable and has opened up federal spending to public scrutiny, even though some Republicans may not be eager to codify the cuts.</p>

It denounces both the atrocities committed by Hamas and the Israeli government's actions, calling for the release of hostages and condemning antisemitism and anti-Palestinian prejudice.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to pause a federal court ruling that blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, arguing that the ruling causes irreparable national security and economic harm. This consideration comes as top Trump aides criticize the judges who struck down the tariffs, accusing them of judicial tyranny and being globalist and pro-importer. The administration is also requesting the trade court judges to pause enforcement of their ruling while the case is appealed. The tariffs in question were imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which the court found did not grant the president such broad authority.</p>

Located 15,000 light-years from Earth, this star flashes every 44 minutes in both radio waves and X-ray emissions, setting it apart from other known examples. Researchers hypothesize that it may be a magnetar or a white dwarf with a companion star, but neither explanation fully accounts for its observed behavior.

Trump hinted at possible sanctions but has yet to act, facing pressure to take a harder line. Critics argue Trump is being duped, and his approach has emboldened Putin, giving him little incentive to end the war.</p>

          <p>Wes Anderson's "The Phoenician Scheme" follows tycoon Zsa-zsa Korda, played by Benicio del Toro, as he schemes to build a grand project in Modern Greater Independent Phoenicia. Despite his questionable morals, the film portrays Zsa-zsa as a charismatic and driven entrepreneur. The film, set in the 1950s, features Anderson's signature vintage aesthetic and a cast of characters impressed by Zsa-zsa's absurd performance. The film celebrates ambition and the art of negotiation, with Zsa-zsa embodying the spirit of a bygone era's globe-roaming magnates.</p>

The time away allowed her to focus on her mental and physical well-being, seek counseling, and rediscover her love for the game.
