        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court hearing concluded without a decision on President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who is seeking a temporary restraining order against her removal. Cook's lawyers argue the firing is unlawful, while the Justice Department asserts the president has the authority to remove a governor "for cause," citing allegations of mortgage fraud. Her legal team has dismissed these claims as a smear campaign by a Trump ally intended to pressure the central bank on interest rates. The unresolved case raises significant questions about the Federal Reserve's independence from political influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several methods for seniors to tap into their home equity without having to refinance their existing mortgages, which is particularly relevant in a high-interest-rate environment. The primary options discussed are reverse mortgages, which are exclusive to homeowners aged 62 and older and do not require monthly repayments. Other viable alternatives include home equity loans, which offer fixed interest rates, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide flexible access to funds. Each option presents different benefits and considerations regarding repayment terms, interest rates, and eligibility requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of chipmaker Marvell Technology fell over 15% after the company's data center revenue for the second quarter missed analyst expectations and it issued a weaker-than-anticipated forecast for the upcoming quarter. Although overall revenue grew 58% year-over-year, fueled by strong demand for its AI-related products, sales in the critical data center segment were slightly below projections. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the flat third-quarter guidance to the non-linear growth in its custom AI chip business, though he expects a substantially stronger fourth quarter. Analysts expressed concern over the lack of clarity on new customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has announced it will deny or revoke visas for Palestinian officials planning to attend the upcoming UN General Assembly in New York. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the decision was a response to Palestinian efforts to seek unilateral statehood recognition and undermine peace negotiations. This move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters, regardless of diplomatic relations. The ban comes as several allied nations, including France and the UK, plan to support the recognition of a Palestinian state at the UN.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Cut Billions in Foreign Aid Funding</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Congress of its plan to cut $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding for USAID and the State Department. The White House is utilizing a rare budgetary maneuver known as a "pocket rescission," which involves submitting the request so late in the fiscal year that the funds expire before Congress is required to vote. This action has drawn bipartisan criticism, with lawmakers arguing it illegally sidesteps Congress's constitutional power over government spending. The move follows other efforts by the administration to reduce foreign aid and pressure various federal institutions.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has dismissed proposals for a 40-kilometer buffer zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces as a viable path to peace. He argued that such a concept is outdated and fails to account for the realities of modern drone warfare, which has already created a 'dead zone' along the front line. Zelenskyy stated that any agreement requiring Ukraine to cede territory is unacceptable and asserted that Russia is not genuinely prepared for diplomacy. His remarks come amid fading momentum for a U.S.-led diplomatic effort to end the ongoing conflict.</p>

Kennedy Jr. is facing intense scrutiny and calls for his resignation following a week of turmoil at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a series of his own questionable medical statements. After a school shooting, Kennedy suggested a link between psychiatric drugs and gun violence, drawing sharp rebukes from lawmakers. He also made the unsubstantiated claim that he can identify children with "mitochondrial challenges" simply by looking at them.

          <p>Tesla is seeking to overturn a $242.5 million verdict against the company in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system. The automaker has filed a motion for a new trial or to have the verdict dismissed, arguing that the vehicle had no design defects and the crash was solely the driver's fault. The incident occurred when a driver, believing Autopilot would brake for obstacles, failed to stop and crashed, killing one person and severely injuring another. Tesla's lawyers are also arguing for a steep reduction in compensatory and punitive damages based on Florida state law.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by trying to end the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics. This decision provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who fled political and economic crises in their home country, allowing them to continue living and working in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The era of inexpensive international online shopping for Americans is changing as the Trump administration has ended the "de minimis" exemption for all countries. This long-standing loophole allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the U.S. without duties, fueling the growth of e-commerce platforms like Shein, Temu, Etsy, and Amazon Marketplace. With the exemption gone, consumers may face higher prices due to new tariffs, longer shipping times from customs backlogs, or find that some international sellers no longer ship to the U.S. This policy shift aims to level the playing field for domestic retailers but will impact the global accessibility of many consumer goods.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced the initial phase of a major offensive into Gaza City, declaring the densely populated area a "dangerous combat zone" and suspending daily humanitarian pauses. This escalation of the war against Hamas includes an expanded call-up of 60,000 military reservists. Amid the offensive, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that the bodies of two hostages taken during the October 7th attack have been recovered from Gaza. The move has drawn international condemnation and protests within Israel from citizens and hostage families concerned about the safety of those still held captive.</p>

Financial services body UK Finance opposes the idea, stating that an additional tax would harm Britain's international competitiveness, as banks already pay a corporation tax surcharge and a bank levy.

          <p>This editorial uses President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook as a case study to critique the notion of central bank independence. While condemning Trump's actions as authoritarian, the article argues that defending the Fed's independence as inherently democratic is a mistake. It suggests that the institution's structure favors business elites over the public and that its independence is from electoral accountability, not politics itself. The piece concludes that instead of simply defending the status quo, the focus should be on reimagining a more democratic and accountable form of monetary authority.</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion, this article explains the qualification criteria for several debt relief strategies. For traditional debt consolidation loans, lenders typically require a good credit score and a manageable debt-to-income ratio. Debt forgiveness programs are generally for those facing severe financial hardship with significant unsecured debt. Other options include debt management plans offered by credit counseling agencies, which negotiate lower interest rates, and internal hardship programs from credit card issuers that can temporarily pause payments. Each solution is designed for different financial situations and has unique requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential returns for a $30,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) in the current interest rate climate, highlighting it as a predictable alternative to more volatile stock investments. Based on today's rates, a $30,000 CD could earn from over $300 on a 3-month term to more than $6,700 on a 5-year term. The main advantage of a CD is its fixed interest rate, which locks in current high yields and protects savings from future rate cuts. However, this comes at the cost of liquidity, as funds cannot be withdrawn before the term ends without incurring a penalty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article contrasts California Governor Gavin Newsom's deployment of state highway patrol officers with President Trump's use of National Guard troops to address crime in major cities. While both actions represent a show of force, the author argues they stem from different philosophies: Newsom's approach is framed as targeted law enforcement support, while Trump's is depicted as authoritarian repression. The piece suggests that Newsom's strategy is part of a broader, more nuanced approach to public safety that includes rehabilitation, whereas Trump focuses solely on punishment. The differing tactics highlight a fundamental divide in how each leader views the role of government in maintaining order.</p>
