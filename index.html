          <p>A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, cautioned that any "military intervention" by the United States in Iran would be a hazardous move with potentially severe and unforeseen consequences. Zakharova also addressed Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, particularly those employing Russian specialists, urging Israel to cease these raids immediately. She emphasized the importance of averting further escalation, securing a ceasefire, and restoring peace, which would then pave the way for renewed negotiations. Russia has stated its readiness to contribute to these efforts through political and diplomatic channels, according to Zakharova. </p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has advocated for continued negotiations to de-escalate the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. This comes as President Trump considers joining Israeli strikes, a decision that has prompted varied reactions from UK political figures. Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel supports UK backing of the US in any strikes against Iran, while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey calls for the publication of any legal advice related to potential UK involvement. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to discuss the matter with his US counterpart. </p>

          <p>A Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer transited the Taiwan Strait, following an incident where a Chinese fighter jet approached a Japanese patrol plane over the Pacific. The destroyer, Takanami, entered the strait from the East China Sea on June 12, proceeding southward through the waterway separating China and Taiwan. This transit occurred amid heightened tensions and increasing military activity in the region, including joint exercises between the Philippines and Japan in the South China Sea. The event underscores the delicate balance of power and ongoing territorial disputes in the area. </p>

          <p>The Bank of England has decided to maintain interest rates at 4.25%, signaling potential rate cuts as early as August, while also acknowledging the world's unpredictable state. Despite inflation remaining above the Bank's target rate, Governor Andrew Bailey suggested a "gradual downward path" for interest rates, cautioning about the impact of the Israel-Iran conflict on energy costs. Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli emphasized careful monitoring of these events and their potential impact on UK inflation, with oil and gas prices having already risen significantly. The Bank marginally raised its expectations for the UK economy, but noted that underlying growth remains weak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration has left many asylum seekers stranded at the US-Mexico border after canceling scheduled appointments made through the CBPOne app. Families fleeing violence and poverty in countries like El Salvador and Mexico find themselves in precarious situations, with overcrowded shelters and limited options. The US immigration policy has led to a drop in migration, but the risks and needs in countries of origin remain dire. While some migrants have given up on seeking asylum in the US, others continue to seek ways to cross the border or apply for asylum in Mexico. </p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and prompting strong condemnation from Israeli leaders, who vowed intensified attacks on Iran's military and government targets. Israel's defense minister accused Iran of war crimes and declared that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be held accountable. The attack comes as President Trump considers direct US involvement in Israel's efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. Israel has also carried out strikes on Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, escalating the conflict between the two nations. </p>

Financial planners emphasize that high-yield savings accounts should not replace long-term investments like stocks and bonds. Certificates of deposit (CDs) are presented as an alternative option, offering fixed interest rates but with less liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
