          <p>President Trump claimed that former FBI Director James Comey's social media post containing the numbers "8647" was a veiled call for his assassination, alleging Comey knew the implied meaning, despite Comey's denial and explanation that he was simply sharing a "shell formation" he saw on a beach walk. Trump further stated that Comey apologized after being confronted about the post, labeling him a "very bad guy." The Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service opened an investigation into Comey's post after Trump's son and others criticized it. </p>

          <p>A new report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) reveals that the majority of Americans, particularly the bottom 60% of households, cannot afford a basic quality of life. The analysis considers costs beyond necessities, including technology, education, and healthcare, revealing a significant gap between earnings and essential expenses. The report suggests that traditional economic indicators like GDP and unemployment rates do not accurately reflect the economic struggles faced by many Americans, and the gap between income and the cost of a minimal quality of life is expected to widen. </p>

          <p>A new report by Wood MacKenzie indicates that individuals and small businesses may bear some of the costs for grid upgrades needed to support large electricity users like data centers and factories. The report suggests that the payments from these large energy users may not cover the full cost of necessary infrastructure, potentially leading to higher electricity rates for other customers. While some states, like Texas, have policies to protect individuals from these costs, the report emphasizes that complete protection requires removing data-center-caused infrastructure costs from utilities' books. </p>

          <p>Despite a trade truce between the U.S. and China, the stacking of multiple tariff layers implemented during the trade war continues to drive up import costs on retail goods.

This stacking of tariffs has led some small businesses to cut product lines and may result in increased prices for consumers on goods including food, toys, and electronics. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy, announced that its CEO is stepping down by "mutual agreement" with the board, citing "recent market challenges" and a significant decline in the company's share price. Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen's departure follows a week after the company downgraded its sales and profits forecast, and a more than 50% decline in the company's shares since mid-2024. The company said Wegovy sales in the U.S. had been undercut by cheaper replica drugs produced by compounding pharmacies. </p>
