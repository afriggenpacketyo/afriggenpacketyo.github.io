          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 16:31:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching at the end of July, financial experts are advising savers to make strategic moves with their certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in currently high interest rates. The article recommends that savers carefully calculate the deposit amount and term length they can commit to, avoiding potential early withdrawal penalties. It also suggests shopping for the best rates at online banks, which often offer higher returns than traditional institutions. The key message is to act decisively now, as potential future interest rate cuts could diminish the high-yield opportunities currently available for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's injunction, allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its plans for widespread layoffs across numerous federal agencies. The court's unsigned opinion stated the administration is likely to succeed in its argument that the executive order initiating the cuts is lawful, though it did not rule on the legality of specific agency plans. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, expressing concern over the court greenlighting the president's actions. The decision enables the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to resume its efforts to significantly scale back the federal government while legal challenges continue.</p>

          <p>A family from Kentfield, California, remains missing after their vacation home in Central Texas was destroyed by last week's historic flash floods. Mark Walker, his wife Sara, and their 14-year-old son Johnny have not been heard from since the disaster struck. Mark is the older brother of former San Francisco Giants pitcher Tyler Walker. The family's 16-year-old daughter, Ellie, was at a nearby camp and was safely rescued. Community members held a vigil for the missing family, praying for a miracle amid the widespread devastation that has claimed over 100 lives.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, presents a Man of Steel who is more impulsive and obtuse than idealistic, according to this critical review. The article suggests that while making Superman a bit stupid is a clever idea for a modern reboot, the film's tone is inconsistent, shifting recklessly between sincerity and silliness. David Corenswet's portrayal is seen as empathetic but dazed, while Nicholas Hoult's Lex Luthor is a highlight. The review concludes that the movie is entertaining but struggles to be earnest, ultimately wishing it was having more fun with its own premise.</p>

The article challenges the long-held progressive belief that universal programs, like Social Security, are inherently more politically durable than targeted, means-tested benefits for the poor. It points to the historical growth of means-tested programs and the vulnerability of some universal benefits to cuts. The author suggests that while universal programs may have substantive policy advantages, their political superiority is not as clear-cut as often claimed, especially given the difficulty of enacting them in the first place.</p>

          <h2>Record-High Beef Prices in the U.S. Driven by Dwindling Cattle Herds and Drought</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. beef prices have reached their highest levels since tracking began in the 1980s, putting a strain on consumers and restaurants. The primary cause is a classic supply and demand issue, with robust consumer demand for beef meeting the smallest national cattle herd since the 1960s. This herd reduction has been largely driven by years of severe drought, which diminished feedstock and forced ranchers to sell off cattle. Due to the long biological cycle of raising cattle, experts predict that tight supplies and elevated prices will likely persist for the next several years, potentially through the end of the decade.

          <p>At least 31 people were killed and over 100 were injured during anti-government protests in Kenya, according to the country's national human rights commission. The demonstrations, which called for better governance and the removal of President William Ruto, marked the highest single-day death toll from protests this year. The protests took place on a historically significant date for Kenya's pro-democracy movement. The human rights report accused police of working with armed gangs during the violence, and the UN has called for calm and for the grievances leading to the protests to be addressed.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with top congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, during a visit to Washington. The discussions focused on the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, a potential ceasefire in Gaza, and the aftermath of the recent U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear program. The visit comes as the Trump administration faces criticism for the strikes, with some lawmakers accusing Netanyahu of trying to draw the U.S. into a larger conflict. Netanyahu praised the "unmatched" coordination with the Trump administration, stating it has created new opportunities for peace.</p>

In a Cabinet meeting, Trump accused Putin of throwing "bulls---" at the U.S. in response to efforts to end the conflict, noting that Putin's niceness in conversations "turns out to be meaningless." The comments came a day after the administration announced it would send more weapons to Ukraine, following a brief, unexplained pause in a previous shipment.

While Judge Amit P.

The Department of Justice had terminated the grants in April, stating the funds would be redirected to more directly support law enforcement operations.

          <p>This positive review praises the new "Superman" movie as a brilliant and consciously sincere work that successfully relaunches the DC Universe. Director James Gunn is lauded for shifting away from cynicism, creating a hero who is a regular guy at heart, surrounded by a world of other super-powered individuals. The article highlights the film's lighthearted, whimsical energy, comparing it to a grand-scale Saturday-morning cartoon. It argues that by placing Superman among his peers and building modern skepticism into the narrative, the film smartly makes the case for the hero's exceptional, unambiguous goodness in a complex world.</p>

Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the bill puts fans "back at the heart of the game." The regulator will be independent of both the government and existing football authorities, marking a significant change in how the sport is managed.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes which savings vehicle, a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account (HYSA), would generate more earnings on a $20,000 deposit in the current interest rate environment. The calculation shows that for shorter terms, such as 3-month or 1-year, a CD currently offers a slightly higher return due to fixed rates. However, for longer terms like 18 months or two years, an HYSA with a competitive variable rate could potentially earn more, assuming rates remain stable. The choice depends on the saver's goals: CDs offer a guaranteed return but lock up funds, while HYSAs provide liquidity but have variable rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the public discourse around artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly radicalized, polarizing into two warring camps with little room for nuance. One side, the industry zealots, evangelizes the inevitable and world-changing arrival of superintelligence, dismissing immediate concerns like job loss. The other side, the skeptics, heckles from the sidelines, dismissing AI as an overhyped and flawed technology. The author contends that this polarization, fueled by the technology's ubiquity and the industry's massive spending, pushes people to ignore the complex, material effects AI is having on society right now, from science to employment.</p>

While Gabbard's office disputed the report, sources told the paper the effort has so far been unsuccessful and would pose a major security risk.
