          <p>A significant ceasefire and hostage deal has been announced between Israel and Hamas, following intense negotiations in Egypt, largely influenced by President Donald Trump's personal involvement. This agreement outlines the release of remaining hostages, the return of deceased captives' remains, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of Gaza, and an increase in humanitarian aid. While celebrated as a major diplomatic victory and a moment of hope, particularly for Trump, crucial details such as Hamas's disarmament, the extent of Israeli withdrawal, and plans for Gaza's future governance still need to be resolved. This article underscores that while a breakthrough, a strong, durable, and everlasting peace is not yet certain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend among Gen Z consumers shows a strong preference for secondhand furniture, driven by environmental awareness and a desire to reduce the massive carbon footprint of the furniture industry. This article highlights that over 95% of the estimated 51 million tons of furniture consumed annually is discarded, largely due to "fast furniture" – cheap, mass-produced items designed for short lifecycles and difficult recycling. Younger consumers are actively seeking durable, unique pieces from platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest, investing in their restoration, and forming emotional connections with items. This shift represents a significant push towards sustainability, counteracting the environmental toll of disposable home decor.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has expanded its budget-friendly ChatGPT Go subscription plan to 16 more countries across Asia, aiming to make its advanced GPT-5 model more accessible to a wider user base. This lower-cost plan, initially launched in India and Indonesia, offers extended access to features like image generation, file uploads, and advanced data analysis, alongside higher usage limits compared to the free version. The expansion addresses a key user request for affordability, particularly as AI chatbot adoption growth rates in lower-income countries have significantly outpaced those in higher-income regions, reflecting OpenAI's strategic move to broaden its global reach and ensure wider participation in AI technology.</p>

          <p>China, controlling 60% of global rare earth production and 90% of refining, is increasingly using these critical minerals as a strategic weapon, particularly against the United States during trade talks. This article details how Beijing has tightened export controls on rare earth elements and processing technology, responding to US tariffs and aiming to leverage its chokehold on essential materials for electronics, automotive, and defense systems. The restrictions have already impacted American industries like car manufacturing, prompting G7 leaders to discuss strategies for anticipating shortages and diversifying supply chains to counter China's dominance and its cost advantage.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team could secure a World Cup play-off spot as early as Sunday, following a strong start to their qualifying campaign. This article outlines the scenario where two home victories against Greece and Belarus this week would bring their points total to ten, potentially making them uncatchable by Belarus and out of sight of Greece if the latter also loses to Denmark. Head coach Steve Clarke's side, currently in a truncated group, aims to build on their recent success, including sailing to Euro 2024 qualification. The BBC will provide live coverage of these crucial matches, offering fans multiple platforms to follow the team's journey.</p>

          <p>Discord, a popular messaging platform, has reported that official ID photos of approximately 70,000 users may have been leaked due to a cyberattack targeting a third-party age verification firm, not Discord's core platform.

Discord has contacted affected users, revoked the third-party provider's system access, and is cooperating with law enforcement to investigate.

          <p>Germany's auto industry is in deep crisis, facing stagnation, mass layoffs, and a rocky transition to electric vehicles (EVs), prompting Chancellor Friedrich Merz to call a high-stakes auto summit. German carmakers are struggling to compete with cheaper, tech-savvy Chinese EV rivals and are impacted by US protectionist policies. Merz has advocated for delaying the EU's planned 2035 ban on internal combustion engine vehicles and proposed extending EV tax breaks, alongside linking industry support to domestic steel use. This article highlights the sector's significant job losses and declining profits, urging a coherent industrial and trade policy response to global challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, faced a difficult Game 3 of the National League Division Series, giving up six hits and five runs in two relief innings against the Philadelphia Phillies. Teammates and manager Dave Roberts acknowledged his off-night, noting his slider lacked effectiveness and he hadn't pitched in nine days, an unusually long break. Despite the "debacle" that turned a tight game into a rout, Kershaw maintained he felt physically fine but "wasn't finding it" on the mound. This article suggests that while the performance was a setback, it won't tarnish his legacy, as the Dodgers look to rebound in Game 4 to avoid elimination and give Kershaw a chance for a more positive career-ending note.</p>

          <p>China has activated a world-first thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, built by the China Three Gorges Corporation in Guazhou county. This innovative plant utilizes two towers to feed a single turbine system, a design unprecedented in concentrated solar power technology. Nearly 27,000 mirrors focus sunlight onto the 200-meter towers, generating concentrated heat that melts and stores salt at high temperatures to create steam, ensuring continuous power even after sunset or on cloudy days. The dual-tower approach significantly enhances efficiency by optimizing morning and afternoon sun capture, making the plant approximately 25% more effective than single-tower designs.</p>
