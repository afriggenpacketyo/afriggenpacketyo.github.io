          <p>The United States Tennis Association plans to begin an $800 million renovation of the Arthur Ashe Stadium and construct a new players' building at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, scheduled for completion by the 2027 U.S. Open. The project aims to enhance the fan experience by expanding walkways and adding high-end shops and restaurants, increasing stadium space by 40 percent. The new players' building will include state-of-the-art training facilities and luxury accommodations, ensuring players are fit and able to perform at a high level. This renovation marks the largest single investment in the site's history, doubling down on the growth of tennis in the United States, and will be funded through reserve funds and debt without requiring more land.</p>

          <p>Scientists are engaged in a global race to understand why our Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan constructing advanced detectors to study neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and Hyper-K in Japan seek to determine if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change differently as they travel, potentially explaining why matter won out over antimatter after the Big Bang. These international collaborations involve over 1,400 scientists from dozens of countries, utilizing cutting-edge technology to explore fundamental questions about the Universe's origins. Discoveries from these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos and humanity's place within it.</p>

          <p>In a recent phone call, Vladimir Putin expressed readiness to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, though maintaining demands for broad concessions; Donald Trump offered a more optimistic view, indicating immediate negotiations towards a ceasefire. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to remove deportation protections from nearly 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants, a decision described as shocking by immigrant advocates. Joe Biden's office announced his prostate cancer diagnosis, Stage 4 and spread to his bones, though experts emphasize recent advances have greatly improved treatment outcomes.

One video was shared on a controversial message board dedicated to suicide, with posts from the same account detailing a failed suicide attempt and disturbing plans for death.

          <p>Individuals are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, with some finding them helpful for coping with anxiety and low self-esteem, particularly when traditional therapy is inaccessible. While these chatbots offer 24/7 availability and coping strategies, concerns persist about potential biases, lack of safeguarding, and the security of user information. Experts caution that chatbots lack the nuanced understanding and real-life experience of human therapists, potentially providing unhelpful or even harmful advice. Despite these limitations, some believe that with proper safeguards, AI chatbots could serve as a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system, providing support while individuals wait for professional care.</p>

          <p>Facing long-term threats like debt, decoupling, and demographic challenges, China has settled on three key strategic directions reinforced by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war and technology restrictions. First, China will not repeat its old playbook of massive stimulus and property market support. Instead, the central government is enforcing fiscal discipline on local governments eager to borrow and sell land, signaling that housing will not be the cornerstone of China’s economic future. Before Trump’s second term, it was believed that the Chinese government had acted too hastily to deflate the property market bubble.</p>

Her recent appearance, however, marks a deliberate return to conspicuous consumption, defying past criticism and asserting her control over her narrative.

          <p>Conservatives have been holding out against the major tax and spending cut package to implement President Trump’s agenda, arguing it will swell federal deficits. The Moody’s downgrade underscored their concerns. When the United States lost its last triple-A credit rating last week, the ratings firm that downgraded the nation’s debt pointed to ongoing gridlock in Congress and the potential enactment of a Republican fiscal plan that is projected to add trillions of dollars to the federal deficit. In calling out Congress’s persistent political paralysis, Moody’s may have prolonged it, giving fresh ammunition to a group of fiscally conservative Republicans who had already stalled their party’s efforts to push through a tax and spending cut package that would implement President Trump’s domestic agenda.</p>

          <p>Experts say it's not uncommon for older prostate cancer patients to receive a diagnosis after the disease has advanced or spread, as was the case with former President Joe Biden. While screening tests like PSA levels can help identify prostate cancer early, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older due to potential harms. Even with regular screening, prostate cancer can develop rapidly between tests or may not be present at the time of screening. Some patients with borderline-high PSA results may decide not to pursue further testing, and advanced prostate cancer may not always present noticeable symptoms.</p>

          <p>Two crew members died aboard a Mexican Navy sailing ship, ARM Cuauhtémoc, after it drifted into the Brooklyn Bridge, smashing its masts and rigging; the ship had 277 people on board, including 175 naval cadets, and was on a good-will tour. The accident injured at least 22 other crew members, and investigations are underway by the Mexican Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Transportation Safety Board. The Cuauhtémoc has been used as a training ship since 1982 and was en route to Reykjavik, Iceland, after leaving New York. Cadets were standing on the yards in a traditional ritual when the ship crashed, and the ship will undergo repairs, likely at a shipyard in the Port of New York and New Jersey.</p>

          <p>Researchers are deploying specially trained dogs to combat the spread of the invasive spotted lanternfly in the US, with the dogs able to sniff out the insect's eggs before they hatch. Four dogs have been scouring parks in the Cleveland area since late last year, uncovering more than 4,000 egg masses, which can produce 30 to 50 lanternflies each. The dogs were trained through a research project led by Virginia Tech University, with owners receiving treats when they spot a new mass of eggs. The female spotted lanternflies typically start to lay their eggs from late August through November, and their egg masses can survive the winter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements received by Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign, suggesting some celebrities were illegally paid. Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce have denied receiving fees, stating payments were for production costs associated with campaign events. Experts note that FEC rules do not prohibit campaigns from paying celebrities for endorsements as long as payments are disclosed. The Harris campaign paid Winfrey's company $1 million for event production and Beyonce's company $165,000 after Beyonce endorsed Harris, but these payments are being scrutinized by Trump.</p>

          <p>Former President Biden’s cancer diagnosis comes as a new book details efforts by aides to shield the effects of his aging from the public and the press during last year’s presidential campaign. The revelation that former President Biden has advanced prostate cancer generated more questions than answers on Monday, prompting debate among experts in the oncology community over the likely progression of his disease and resurfacing concerns in Washington over his decision last year to run for reelection. Biden’s private office said Sunday afternoon that he had been diagnosed earlier in the week with an “aggressive form” of the cancer that had already spread to his bones, after urinary symptoms led to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's recent diagnosis of an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer, it's important to understand the disease, its signs and symptoms, how it is diagnosed, and treatment options. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer after skin cancer diagnosed in American men, with early prostate cancer generally not causing symptoms, but advanced stages can cause problems with urination or blood in the urine or semen. Screening tests, such as PSA blood tests and digital rectal exams, can often detect prostate cancer early, increasing the odds of successful treatment. Treatment options vary depending on the stage of the cancer, and can include observation, surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy.</p>

In April, the port saw a 9.5% increase in container units moved compared to the previous year, largely due to importers rushing cargo before the tariffs took effect. While exports fell by 3% year-on-year, imports enjoyed a 5% increase, but the executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, Gene Seroka, notes that the boost is largely due to importers getting a last push of cargo before the tariffs hit.</p>

Elevated mortgage rates, combined with a shortage of affordable properties and near-record-high home prices, are challenging aspiring homebuyers.

          <p>The struggle to pass Donald Trump’s second-term agenda in Congress has never been between Republicans and Democrats; the minority party has had little real role so far. Instead, it’s been a battle between the House and Senate GOP, between moderates and hard-liners, and, most salient, between Republicans and reality. Any straightforward accounting points to one conclusion: The president’s “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” (as Republicans insist on formally calling it) would make the country’s fiscal situation worse. It would slash taxes for years to come, and although it would make some budget cuts, they aren’t anywhere near enough to cover the difference. The bill is projected to add trillions of dollars to the deficit; the only real disagreement among analysts is over how many trillions.</p>

Grealish, 29, was a British record signing when he joined Pep Guardiola's side from Aston Villa for £100m in 2021. Grealish has only started 16 times this season in all competitions, and has been on the pitch for 1,520 minutes - fewer than half the amount he played in the 2022-23 season when City won the Champions League. Defeat in the FA Cup final means that City will finish without a major trophy for the first time since Guardiola's first season in charge in 2016-17.</p>
