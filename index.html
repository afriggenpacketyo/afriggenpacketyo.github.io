            <p>Melanie Krause, the acting commissioner of the IRS, plans to resign following a data-sharing agreement between the agency and the Department of Homeland Security to support the Trump administration's deportation efforts. This marks the third leader of the IRS to resign this year, raising concerns among other senior officials about the legality of the agreement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signed the agreement on behalf of the IRS, sparking internal dissent within the agency. The spokesperson for the Treasury Department stated that Melanie Krause has been leading the IRS through a time of extraordinary change, as they focus on IT modernization and re-organize the agency to better serve the taxpayer.</p>

BBC Verify has examined these claims, finding that Trump's statements are often unsubstantiated or exaggerated. While Canada does impose high tariffs on dairy products under specific conditions, the U.S. has never come close to exceeding the quotas. Trump also claimed the US has a trillion dollar trade deficit with China, when the actual figure is around $295bn.</p>

Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%. Economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.</p>

            <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper, a $10 billion-plus venture, launched its first batch of satellites into space, aiming to compete with SpaceX's Starlink in providing broadband internet connectivity. The company is targeting corporations, consumers lacking internet access, and governments globally. Starlink, with roughly 8,000 satellites and over 5 million customers, has a significant head start, but faces increasing competition. There is also concern that Elon Musk's role in the White House as a top advisor could give SpaceX a more favorable position versus its competition when trying to ink deals.</p>

            <p>The 10-year Treasury yield retreated from its highs after a successful bond auction eased concerns about demand for U.S. debt. A 90-day pause in some tariffs announced by President Donald Trump helped to ease some mounting worries in the fixed income market.

Among those confirmed dead are merengue singer Rubby Pérez and former Major League Baseball players Octavio Dotel and Tony Blanco. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that at least one US national, and multiple legal permanent residents, were killed in the roof collapse.</p>

The company initially formed the Denza brand in 2010 with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group.</p>

Canadian officials aim to incentivize production and investment in Canada while protecting Canadian jobs. The tariffs are expected to generate 8 billion Canadian dollars, which will be used to help workers and companies affected by Trump's tariffs.</p>

            <p>Consumers and businesses should expect inflation and price increases due to President Trump's new tariffs, but immediate price hikes may be opportunistic. U.S. Customs guidance includes an "on the water clause" exempting cargo in transit from the tariffs. Major corporations are preparing investors and consumers for eventual cost and price impacts, with CEOs predicting price increases ranging from 5% to 20%. Lower supply due to reduced orders and potential changes in supply and demand could also influence pricing.</p>

            <p>Businesses are concerned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to freight being abandoned at ports as cash-strapped owners reject incoming goods. Deer Stags, a shoe retailer, faces exponentially increased import duties, with costs rising from $60,000 to between $600,000 and $1 million. Some importers are expected to abandon goods at ports, while Trump added a 90-day pause for some countries but increased tariffs on China to 125%. More than half of the $2 billion in daily import tariffs are expected to be on Chinese goods.</p>

He intends to reinvigorate a mission-first culture at NASA and acknowledged that he was not “a typical nominee for this position”.
