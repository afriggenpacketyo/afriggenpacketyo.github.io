          <p>Toyota has unveiled a redesigned version of its all-electric vehicle (EV) in the U.S., renaming it the "bZ" from "bZ4X" for the 2026 model year. The move is likely aimed at distancing the updated model from its predecessor, which received lackluster reviews and experienced a recall due to wheel detachment issues. Toyota has addressed these concerns with the new model, including a 25% increase in EV range, up to 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities. </p>

          <p>New research indicates that the universe may end much sooner than previously estimated, though still trillions of years away. Dutch scientists at Radboud University calculated the "evaporation time" of white dwarf stars, revising the timeline for the universe's end to 10 to the power of 78 years. This new estimate is significantly shorter than the previous one. This research comes alongside other findings suggesting that dark energy, which constitutes nearly 70% of the universe, may be weakening, which could potentially lead to a "Big Crunch" scenario. </p>

          <p>The Dallas Mavericks defied the odds by winning the NBA Draft Lottery with only a 1.8% chance, securing the No. 1 overall pick, which is expected to be Cooper Flagg.

          <p>Historian Rutger Bregman advocates for "moral ambition" as a way to find meaning in work, urging individuals to focus on solving the world's biggest problems rather than pursuing fame or fortune. He criticizes the waste of talent in modern economies, where many workers find their jobs socially meaningless, and encourages people to identify pressing global issues and contribute to making a difference. Bregman's approach shares similarities with effective altruism but emphasizes doing "a lot of good" rather than striving for perfection, suggesting that personal passion can develop through dedication to morally ambitious goals. </p>

          <p>Proposed "baby bonuses" from the Trump administration to incentivize childbirth have been met with skepticism and criticism from American women, who cite the high cost of raising children and broader economic struggles.

The pronatalist movement's push for higher birth rates is viewed with suspicion, as women question whether the administration is genuinely committed to supporting families beyond childbirth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" to describe the UK's potential future with unchecked immigration, despite criticism from some Labour MPs. Cooper argued that Starmer was highlighting the impact of rising migration and emphasizing the need for integration, including English language tests. She rejected comparisons to Enoch Powell's divisive rhetoric, stating that Starmer's speech was fundamentally different. The comments come amid ongoing debate over immigration policies and the rise of Reform UK in recent local elections. </p>

          <p>French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu was found guilty of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in 2021, receiving an 18-month suspended sentence and placement on the national sex offender registry. The court found that Depardieu had groped the women during work on a film and rejected the actor's defense that he came from a different generation with different standards. This verdict marks a significant moment in France's reckoning with sexual abuse allegations in the film industry, with the victims' lawyers hailing it as a victory. The actor's lawyer said he would appeal. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reduced its China tariffs from 145 percent to 30 percent, a move that contradicts President Trump's earlier claims that China needs the U.S. more than the U.S. needs China. The tariff reduction, intended to be temporary, comes without China making any significant concessions. This action suggests that the U.S. economy is vulnerable to trade disruptions and that Trump's negotiating position is weaker than initially portrayed. Despite the tariff cuts, prices on imported goods are expected to remain higher than pre-tariff levels. </p>

Factors contributing to this challenge include a tight labor market, the need for specialized skills, and an aging workforce. While manufacturers have increased pay in recent years, the industry's recruitment and retention issues extend beyond compensation, encompassing outdated perceptions of manufacturing jobs and a shortage of skilled technicians.
