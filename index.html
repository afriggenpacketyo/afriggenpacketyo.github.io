          <p>Lowe's exceeded Q2 earnings and revenue forecasts, announcing an $8.8 billion acquisition of Foundation Building Materials to strengthen its home professional business. Despite a softer market for larger projects due to high mortgage rates, sales improved throughout the quarter, with July seeing a notable increase. CEO Marvin Ellison highlighted growth in online sales and loyalty programs, underscoring the strategic shift towards professional customers. This move positions Lowe's for future growth when housing markets rebound, mirroring competitors' efforts to expand their pro segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Trump called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's resignation following allegations of mortgage fraud made by Bill Pulte, director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte claims Cook falsified residency statuses on mortgage agreements for two properties to secure lower interest rates. This incident escalates Trump's ongoing pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates and comes amidst his efforts to influence the central bank's composition. While Wall Street anticipates a rate cut, Cook is unlikely to resign before the next FOMC meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palantir stock entered bear market territory, dropping 20% from its peak in its longest losing streak since April 2024. This decline follows a broader market selloff and a critical short-seller report from Citron Research, which argued the company's valuation is detached from fundamentals compared to other AI leaders. Despite recently achieving its first $1 billion revenue quarter and securing significant government contracts, including with the Department of Defense, the article notes that Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio remains high, indicating its shares are still considered expensive.

          <p>GE Vernova plans to invest at least $41 million in its Schenectady, New York, plant to expand generator operations and increase gas power capacity.

While the investment directly targets generators, it prevents bottlenecks crucial for the overall gas turbine business, which is largely sold out through 2027. This move signals GE Vernova's commitment to meeting surging electricity needs, despite past hesitations about expanding production capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former priest Chris Brain, 68, was found guilty of 17 counts of indecent assault against nine women who were part of the Nine O'Clock Service (NOS), an evangelical movement he led in the 1980s and 90s.

Brain denied all charges, despite having previously admitted to "improper sexual conduct" in a 1995 BBC documentary, leading to the dissolution of the NOS and his resignation from holy orders.</p>

The recipe showcases caramelized, crispy plantains perfectly complemented by a versatile, house-made aioli derived from Forte's "Yawd" cookbook. The chef describes the pickled Scotch bonnet aioli as a "utility paste" suitable for enhancing a wide range of dishes. Notably, pickling the Scotch bonnets reduces their inherent heat, which is subsequently absorbed by the vinegar, intensifying the liquid's spiciness over time.</p>
