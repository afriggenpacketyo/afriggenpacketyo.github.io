          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Barry, made landfall in Mexico as a tropical depression. Located near Tampico, the storm brought maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. Forecasters anticipate it will deliver heavy rainfall, with totals potentially reaching up to ten inches in some areas. This precipitation poses a significant threat of flooding and mudslides as the system moves inland and dissipates over the next couple of days, even after weakening from its brief tropical storm status.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax, which would have primarily affected American technology companies. This decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a termination of all trade discussions with Canada in response to the tax proposal. Following the reversal, both nations have agreed to resume negotiations with the goal of reaching a new comprehensive trade arrangement by late July 2025. The move is aimed at de-escalating the trade dispute and fostering a mutually beneficial economic partnership.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Russia's restrained reaction to the recent conflict between Israel and Iran demonstrates its waning power as a global ally. The author posits that Moscow's deep involvement in the war in Ukraine has depleted its military and financial resources, limiting its ability to support its partners. Despite a strategic alliance with Iran, Russia offered only diplomatic platitudes rather than substantive military or political aid. This pattern of strategic neglect, also seen with allies like Syria and Armenia, signals a significant decline in Russia's credibility on the world stage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is debating President Trump's major legislative package, which includes significant spending increases for border security and defense offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. Republicans are advancing the bill using the budget reconciliation process, which requires only a simple majority and bypasses the need for Democratic support. The process has been contentious, with Democrats forcing a full reading of the bill to delay proceedings.

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.7 in June, marking the third straight month of contraction in the sector. While this figure is a slight improvement from May's 49.5, it remains below the 50-point threshold that separates growth from contraction. The data reflects ongoing challenges for Chinese manufacturers, including sluggish consumer demand, a deepening price war, and the impact of U.S. tariffs. These factors contribute to persistent deflationary pressures that continue to affect the nation's industrial firms. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies indicate that passengers in electric vehicles (EVs) are more prone to experiencing motion sickness compared to those in traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this phenomenon to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs. Specifically, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into battery power, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes feelings of queasiness. As EVs become more prevalent, this issue presents a new challenge for automotive engineering and passenger comfort.</p>

          <p>Police in Istanbul detained more than 50 people and used force to block activists from holding an LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which has been banned by Turkish authorities for years. The city's governor had prohibited the event, claiming it undermines social peace and family values. This crackdown occurs amidst a backdrop of increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government. Human rights groups have warned that the government's actions are fostering a hostile environment, leading to increased discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals in Turkey.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is conducting a widespread crackdown on young women who write and publish gay erotic fiction, a genre known as "danmei." At least 30 writers, mostly in their 20s, have been arrested since February for allegedly producing and distributing obscene material, a charge that can lead to long prison sentences. The crackdown has targeted authors on a popular Taiwan-hosted platform and has sparked a rare online debate in China about censorship, female sexual expression, and the country's outdated anti-obscenity laws.</p>
