          <p>A cooling labor market is leading to a rise in long-term unemployment, with many Americans struggling for months to find new jobs. Despite a historically low unemployment rate, the number of available positions has decreased, and private payrolls have seen a decline. Individuals with extensive experience report sending hundreds of applications with little success, forcing them to deplete savings and retirement funds. This trend is creating financial hardship and discouraging workers, posing a risk to the broader economy.</p>

          <p>David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, has cautioned that the stock market could experience a significant "drawdown" in the next one to two years. He attributes the current market highs to an investment frenzy surrounding artificial intelligence, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Solomon believes that while AI technology is transformative, market enthusiasm has likely run ahead of its actual potential, leading to overvaluation. He predicts a reset will occur when capital deployed into less viable ventures fails to deliver returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has called on his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, citing controversy over an animated show titled "Dead End: Paranormal Park."

The controversy also involves allegations that the show's creator mocked a conservative activist's murder, amplifying a culture war debate.

          <p>A review of Taylor Swift's 12th album, "The Life of a Showgirl," suggests she is moving past her long-held persona of reluctant ambition. The album's title track concludes with the narrator, representing Swift, declaring she "wouldn't have it any other way," despite the pains of fame. This marks a shift from her previous work, which often highlighted the negative aspects of celebrity while downplaying her drive for success. The article argues that in an era of anti-feminist backlash, Swift is boldly claiming her professional ambition and success as a source of happiness, not torment.</p>

This comes after Comac had previously announced ambitious plans to increase its manufacturing capacity by 50% in 2025, a goal that now appears uncertain.</p>

The album, a collaboration with producer Max Martin, is criticized for its lack of novelty and passion, with songwriting that revisits familiar themes in crasser terms.

The article argues that the Premier League's intensity and Liverpool's new tactical system under manager Arne Slot have placed significant physical demands on him.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.1 billion in federal funding designated for two major public transit projects in Chicago. The Department of Transportation stated the hold is to review the projects for "unconstitutional practices" related to race-based contracting. Administration officials blamed the government shutdown on Democrats, claiming it has slowed the review process. This action is the latest in a series of funding freezes targeting infrastructure projects in cities and states led by Democrats, raising accusations of political motivation.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has fired Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a top scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The dismissal comes just three weeks after Dr. Marrazzo filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration. In her complaint, she alleged her earlier demotion was retaliation for protesting administration moves to undermine vaccine research and politicize grant decisions. Her termination is part of a broader series of firings and restructuring within the Department of Health and Human Services under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the newly-elected leader of the UK's Green Party, has called for a tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to fund public services and combat the cost-of-living crisis. In his speech at the party conference, Polanski argued that this revenue could pay for universal free childcare, special needs education, and improved rural bus routes. He also strongly defended migrants and refugees and criticized the Labour Party for, in his view, echoing the rhetoric of Reform UK on immigration. The speech signaled a leftward shift for the party, focusing on economic inequality as a core issue.</p>

          <p>A weakening labor market is disproportionately affecting recent college graduates, many of whom are struggling to find their first full-time jobs. Data shows that the unemployment rate for new entrants into the workforce has reached a nine-year high, and the traditional advantage of a bachelor's degree is diminishing. This trend is attributed to a "low-hiring" environment where companies are not creating enough new roles for those trying to break in. As a result, many young graduates are moving back home with their parents and questioning the value of their degrees.</p>

          <p>Seven people from Kenya have won a landmark legal case in a London Family Court, successfully proving they were fathered by British men stationed at an army base in their country. The case utilized commercially available DNA databases to identify the fathers, six of whom had served at the British Army Training Unit in Kenya (Batuk). This is the first time paternity has been established this way in a UK court. The ruling now allows the seven individuals to apply for British citizenship and seek paternal recognition.</p>

          <p>Amid the federal government shutdown, the Department of Energy has canceled nearly $8 billion in funding for over 300 projects in 16 states that voted for the Democratic nominee in the 2024 election. The eliminated funds were intended for projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, strengthening electrical grids, and combating pollution. Critics argue the move is politically motivated and will result in the loss of thousands of jobs while undermining U.S. manufacturing goals. The administration stated the projects were not economically viable, a claim disputed by state officials and environmental groups.</p>

Bezos believes that once the dust settles, society will reap "gigantic" benefits from the successful AI innovations that emerge. He argued that such industrial bubbles can ultimately be positive, driving progress despite the initial market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Thomas Tuchel, has chosen not to include Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham in his latest squad for upcoming matches, despite the player's desire to be selected. The decision is based on Bellingham's limited playing time following shoulder surgery and signals that no player, regardless of status, is guaranteed a spot. Tuchel emphasized the need to have plans that are not solely reliant on Bellingham's availability, especially with the World Cup approaching. The move also rewards other players who performed well in England's recent decisive victory over Serbia.</p>

This condemnation comes amid escalating trade tensions, with Mexico having initiated eleven such probes against Chinese goods this year, a significant increase from the previous year.</p>
