          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had state terrorism charges dismissed in a New York City court, although he still faces second-degree murder and weapons charges. The defense argued the terrorism charges were legally insufficient, while prosecutors alleged Mangione intended to broadcast a social and political message. The judge did not rule on suppressing evidence from Mangione's backpack, including a gun and notebook, and hearings will begin in December. The defense also wanted to fight the state charges on the grounds of double jeopardy, but the judge ruled against this request. The state will proceed with the murder and weapons charges, and the judge will hear arguments in December on evidence from Mangione's backpack.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faced questioning from congressional committees regarding his handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation, his "enemies list," and the Jeffrey Epstein files. Patel defended his performance in the Kirk investigation, citing the rapid capture of the suspect due to his decision to release video and photos. He also addressed criticism about transparency and allegations of politicizing the FBI, stemming from the firing of three senior agents who sued for reinstatement. Patel is also facing scrutiny regarding his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, as well as his so-called 'enemies list' and his use of the FBI plane. Patel's decisions and actions have drawn criticism from Democrats and sparked debate over the weaponization of the FBI.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence in the airline's expansion plans, citing customer loyalty and the company's product, network, and technology investments. He believes United's resilience during a customer pull-back earlier in the year demonstrates its brand loyalty, and expects strong fourth-quarter results with an economic recovery. United's domestic capacity is set to grow significantly more than its rivals in 2025. Kirby also reiterated his view that the ultra-discount model is failing, referencing Spirit Airlines' bankruptcy filing. United is about two-thirds of the way through updating its narrow-body Airbus and Boeing planes with new interiors, as U.S. airlines race to offer more modern seating and spacious premium options.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supports President Trump's suggestion to switch from quarterly to semiannual company reports, arguing it would benefit investors. Trump believes it would allow executives to focus on long-term goals. Bessent notes that many foreign jurisdictions already follow a semiannual reporting system, potentially attracting more companies to list in the U.S. Some investors have warned that quarterly reports are crucial for transparency and protecting their interests. Bessent believes the move could make the U.S. market more attractive to European companies by lowering compliance costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spain experienced its hottest summer on record in 2025, with an average temperature of 24.2C, surpassing the previous record set in 2022. The national meteorological agency AEMET noted this is the highest figure since records began in 1961. Scientists warn that manmade climate change is causing extreme weather events. The summer included a 16-day heatwave in August, which caused wildfires and resulted in over 1,100 deaths, mostly among people older than 65.

          <p>The article discusses the need for improved criminal justice and mental health systems to prevent random acts of violence, such as the murder of Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina. It emphasizes addressing repeat offenders through risk assessment tools and sentencing enhancements. The article also highlights the importance of improving mental healthcare access and treatment capacity, including compelled outpatient commitment. Additionally, the article suggests enhancing security on public transit systems by enforcing minor offenses and increasing fare inspections.

          <p>Chelsea and Ukraine winger Mykhailo Mudryk is currently suspended due to a doping offence, after testing positive for a banned substance. The Football Association investigation is ongoing, and the potential punishment remains unclear. Mudryk's legal team insists he did not knowingly ingest any banned substance, and he has reportedly passed a lie detector test. The BBC has learned that Mudryk came into contact with meldonium, a cardiovascular medication, while on duty with the Ukraine national team. The absence of Mudryk has led to frustration in Ukraine, and his former club Shakhtar Donetsk could lose potential transfer add-ons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Gallup survey indicates that most U.S. adults aspire to be their own boss, but few achieve it due to financial concerns, fear of failure, and lack of business knowledge. Experts recommend starting with a side hustle to test the business idea and build proof of concept before quitting a regular job. They also suggest focusing on service-based businesses to minimize startup expenses and building a strong network for mentorship and support. Overcoming the fear of failure requires resilience and thorough preparation, as passion alone is insufficient for long-term success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC survey indicates that most respondents believe President Trump's actions towards the Federal Reserve aim to limit its independence. The majority of respondents anticipate that these actions will result in weaker growth, higher inflation and unemployment, and a lower value for the dollar. Respondents are divided on the effect on interest rates, with some expecting lower rates and others forecasting higher rates. Recession concerns have increased, with the probability of a recession jumping to 40%. The survey identifies tariffs and policy uncertainty as major threats to the economic expansion.

          <p>Tom Brady faced online criticism for appearing in the Las Vegas Raiders' coaching booth during a game against the Los Angeles Chargers. As a minority owner of the Raiders and a Fox broadcaster, some argue that Brady's access provides an unfair advantage, particularly when he covers teams that Las Vegas will face later in the season. Raiders head coach Pete Carroll downplayed the significance of Brady's involvement. Brady is scheduled to broadcast games involving teams that the Raiders will face in upcoming weeks, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. This situation has sparked debate about the ethics of Brady's dual role as team owner and broadcaster.</p>

          <p>Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek has conducted internal evaluations on the "frontier risks" of its AI models, according to a source familiar with the matter. This comes as Beijing seeks to promote awareness of such risks within China's AI industry. Frontier risks refer to AI systems that pose potentially significant threats to public safety and social stability. Unlike US AI firms, Chinese companies have not publicized the findings of their frontier risk evaluations. The results of DeepSeek's evaluations were not publicized.</p>

          <p>Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, has developed a method to transform recycled plastic, including red Solo cups, into fabric for clothing. Her company, The New Norm, produces stylish sweatshirts and beanies from post-consumer recycled plastic. Choi partnered with campus fraternities to gather cups and developed an extruder machine to spin plastic waste into textile filaments. She collaborated with textile facilities to create a custom formula for soft, wearable textiles. The company's first collection of sweaters and beanies, made from 5,000 upcycled party cups, sold out in two months.</p>

          <p>Maya Moore, a WNBA superstar, walked away from basketball in her prime to focus on social-justice activism. Moore reflected on whether she would still be playing if the WNBA paid more fairly, noting she earned more playing overseas. She also discussed her activism, including her support for Black Lives Matter and her work to free Jonathan Irons, whom she later married. Moore questioned the current state of activism in sports, given the dismantling of DEI initiatives and the growing acceptance of racist ideas. She asserted that modeling human dignity plants seeds that will continue to grow, despite the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Despite lower gas reserves compared to previous years, Europe is preparing for winter with diversified energy supplies and alternative sources. EU gas reserves are just over 80%, stronger than 2021 but lower than the 90% cushions of recent years. Diversification efforts include liquified natural gas (LNG) from Norway, the United States, and Qatar, along with increased renewable energy production. However, geopolitical shocks, such as Trump's potential tariffs on buyers of Russian energy, could introduce uncertainty. While prices are unlikely to reach 2022 extremes, isolated shortages could still cause temporary spikes.</p>
