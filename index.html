          <p>Chinese officials and state media are portraying the recent trade agreement and tariff pause with the U.S. as a major win for China. They claim that Beijing's firm stance and countermeasures were instrumental in securing the deal with relatively few concessions. Chinese negotiators appear to have convinced the Trump administration to significantly roll back tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for China easing countertariffs on U.S. products. Social media in China is filled with celebratory posts touting the deal's benefits, emphasizing the reduction in import duties for both countries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts hit a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by revenue from President Trump's trade policies. This influx of duties significantly reduced the budget deficit for the month, which totaled $258.4 billion, a 23% increase from the previous year. The rise in tariff revenue comes after Trump implemented 10% tariffs on U.S. imports starting April 2, adding to existing duties. Despite the surplus in April, the year-to-date budget deficit remains substantial at $1.05 trillion, with high interest rates posing a significant budgetary burden.</p>

The US has accused South Africa of seizing land from white farmers without compensation, while South Africa disputes these claims, stating that any allegations of persecution would not meet the threshold required under refugee law.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved three new "natural" food colorings for use in various products, including Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate. These dyes are seen by some as safer alternatives to synthetic dyes, which have been linked to behavioral issues in some children. Experts emphasize that "natural" does not automatically equate to safer, but the FDA's vetting process for new color additives is typically rigorous. While research suggests these additives are safe in small amounts, some individuals with kidney stones may need to limit their calcium phosphate consumption.</p>

This decision comes after a lengthy legal battle and amid concerns about the rights of LGBTQ Americans.

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a comprehensive tax bill that would enact several of President Trump's campaign pledges on a temporary basis. The bill proposes not taxing tips or overtime pay, rolling back clean energy subsidies, and creating new tax-advantaged investment accounts for children. While it extends provisions from the 2017 tax law, it also faces criticism from within the Republican party over issues like the state and local tax deduction limit. The bill aims to balance tax cuts with measures to raise revenue, including ending some clean-energy tax credits and taxing university endowments.</p>
