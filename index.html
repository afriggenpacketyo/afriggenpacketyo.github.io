            <p>President Trump's new tariffs on imports from numerous countries, including a 104% tariff on goods from China, have taken effect, escalating a potential global trade war.

She insists that any external discussions of denuclearization constitute a denial of her country’s sovereignty.

A staff member at a China-listed export company reported a significant drop in US-bound container volume due to the new tariffs. One client reportedly abandoned goods already at sea, surrendering them to the shipping company, as "no one will buy them after the tariffs are imposed." The company's leadership has suspended all container business until tariffs stabilize or alternative markets are secured.</p>

            <p>President Trump's latest tariffs against America's trading partners have taken effect, imposing additional taxes ranging from 20% to 104% on goods from various countries. Trump claims tariffs will boost the US economy and protect jobs, but economists warn that the move could harm the world economy and increase prices for consumers. The tariffs are intended to reduce the trade deficit and encourage consumers to buy American-made goods. However, the measures have caused significant volatility on global stock markets and are expected to push up prices across a range of imported goods.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect, hitting South East Asia particularly hard, with Vietnam and Cambodia facing some of the highest rates. Vietnam's "bamboo diplomacy" is now being tested as it attempts to balance ties with both China and the US. Under the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. This will now be even harder to meet.</p>

            <p>Asian shares experienced significant losses, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping substantially, as the latest set of U.S. tariffs, including a large levy on Chinese imports, went into effect.

Analysts are warning of further market swings given the uncertainty over how long Trump will keep the stiff tariffs on imports, which will raise prices for U.S. shoppers and slow the economy.

Schools are implementing measures to combat derogatory language and promote respect, but there is a call for more government guidance on tackling misogyny in education.
