The shares rose over 7%, marking the highest point since 2000, reflecting positive investor sentiment. This breakthrough contributes to the broader rally in equities across various global markets, driven by easing inflation pressures and expectations for U.S. rate cuts. Steve Sosnick from Interactive Brokers noted that momentum and the anticipation of easier monetary policy are key factors driving market performance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was fatally shot at an event at Utah Valley University, prompting a manhunt for the shooter. The FBI and Utah authorities released new images of a person of interest captured on campus security footage just before the shooting. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the identification and arrest of the person responsible for Kirk's murder. Authorities recovered a "high-powered bolt action rifle" in a wooded area near the shooting, and are analyzing the weapon and cartridges for fingerprints and DNA.</p>

          <p>The Philippine national security adviser, Eduardo Ano, criticized China's plan in the South China Sea as a pretext for eventual occupation, while the Philippine foreign ministry announced it would issue a formal diplomatic protest against China's actions. This comes in response to China's plan to bolster its claims in the South China Sea. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian defended the plan as within China's sovereignty to protect the ecological system, urging the Philippines to cease infringing actions.</p>

          <p>Amap, Alibaba's mapping app, saw over 40 million users testing its new AI-powered ranking service, Amap Street Stars, which provides recommendations for 1.6 million establishments in mainland China. This service ranks destinations, including restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, marking a significant step in Alibaba's super-app strategy. JPMorgan analysts suggest Amap is becoming Alibaba's primary entry point for offline local services, potentially challenging Meituan's user review service, Dianping. The service combines ranking and navigation features, similar to Google Maps in markets outside mainland China.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has cautioned Mexico to "think twice" before increasing tariffs on Asia-made cars to 50%, threatening countermeasures in response. The ministry stated that China and Mexico are important trade partners and expressed unwillingness to see economic cooperation affected. Mexico plans to raise tariffs on vehicles from Asia, particularly China, from 20% to 50%, pending Congressional approval. China's potential countermeasures could include restrictions on mineral exports critical to car production (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has heightened concerns regarding security and free speech on college campuses, leading university police chiefs to re-evaluate security measures. The event, attended by approximately 3,000 people, had minimal security presence, raising questions about balancing security needs with campus freedom. Free speech groups express concern that violence against speakers undermines democratic debate, fearing a potential "assassin's veto" effect. Some campus police chiefs anticipate increased diligence in preparing for events involving contentious figures but do not foresee major changes to large outdoor events.</p>

          <p>Many Americans are facing difficulties obtaining COVID-19 vaccines due to new FDA guidelines and eligibility criteria, despite the availability of reformulated shots. The FDA has approved the shots only for those at greatest risk, including people over 65 or with underlying health conditions. The new rules have resulted in confusion and challenges for those seeking vaccination, with some turned away due to supply issues or lack of doctor's notes. Health insurance coverage may also be a factor, with some plans not covering the shot.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that husbands can take their wives' family name, overturning a law that only allowed women to change their family name upon marriage. The court found that the existing law discriminated on the grounds of gender and was a "colonial import." The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. The decision has sparked mixed reactions on social media, with some welcoming it as a progressive step and others criticizing it as going against tradition.</p>

Steady gains could shift household wealth away from the property market and boost consumption (not investment advice).</p>

Southern Water's managing director expressed dismay and imposed an immediate ban on tanker extraction from standpipes. Residents had been tracking the tankers and reported the activity to the water company.</p>

Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated the move aims to restore Senate precedent and allow the President to assemble his team efficiently. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opposed the change, calling it an act of genuflection to the executive branch.</p>
