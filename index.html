        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data reveals that smartphone exports from China to the United States, including Apple's iPhones, experienced a significant drop in April, reaching their lowest levels since 2011. This decline reflects the impact of ongoing trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which have disrupted tech supply chains and diverted electronics production to other countries. Investors are concerned about a potential global trade war that could negatively affect U.S.-China bilateral trade and increase consumer prices. Tensions remain high as the U.S. pursues sanctions on Huawei Technologies' artificial intelligence chips. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, potentially exposing them to deportation. This decision reverses a lower court's order that had prevented the administration from ending the protections, which allowed Venezuelans to work in the United States. Legal representatives for the TPS holders expressed shock at the Court's decision, calling it the largest single action stripping non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history. The ruling's immediate impact is unclear, leaving many Venezuelans uncertain about their legal status and employment authorization.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred through a social media post targeting migrants. Connolly's tweet, which called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, was viewed over 310,000 times before it was deleted. The Court of Appeal upheld the original sentence, stating that there was no arguable basis to deem it manifestly excessive.

Home Depot's full-year sales forecast remains unchanged, with expectations of 2.8% total sales growth and a 1% increase in comparable sales, assuming current tariff agreements remain in place.

          <p>Ahmed Ebid, a UK-based people smuggler, has been sentenced to 25 years in jail for organizing the illegal transport of nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy, some of whom eventually reached Britain. Ebid's operation, which generated approximately Â£12 million, involved using fishing boats for the crossings between October 2022 and June 2023. This marks the first conviction of someone organizing Mediterranean boat crossings from the UK. Ebid himself arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 after serving a five-year sentence in Italy for attempted drug smuggling and had applied for asylum.</p>

          <p>This article examines the 1965 debate between William F. Buckley Jr. and James Baldwin, focusing on the context of the civil rights movement and the ideological divide between the two figures. It highlights Buckley's conservative views and Baldwin's powerful arguments on race in America. The article explores the impact of the debate on both men and the broader discussion of race and equality in the United States. Buckley criticized Baldwin's sweeping denunciation of American ideals and his depiction of white evil in absolute terms, while Baldwin challenged the audience with his words.</p>

          <p>Representative Mike Quigley of Illinois realized President Biden's behavior reminded him of his father's struggle with Parkinson's disease during a trip to Ireland in 2023.

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project in Sonora, Mexico, is working to conserve jaguars by transforming them from threats to valuable assets for ranchers. The Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, incentivizing them to protect jaguars and their prey. The program has expanded the protected area for jaguars and has shifted local attitudes towards the animals. However, the border wall between the U.S. and Mexico poses a significant threat to the jaguars' ability to return to their historic range in the American Southwest.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit over the next decade. The bill includes tax breaks, such as renewing the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which are projected to exceed any savings from spending cuts. The Trump administration disagrees with these analyses, claiming the bill includes $1.6 trillion in savings.</p>
