          <p>A shooting at a student housing complex at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque resulted in one fatality and one non-life-threatening injury. The suspect fled the scene and was believed to still be at large on campus, prompting university officials to issue a shelter-in-place order for students and close the central campus as a precautionary measure. Local law enforcement and university police are actively investigating the incident and searching for the suspect involved in the early morning violence. The situation remains a developing story with authorities urging caution.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize Palestine as a state, with the formal decision to be presented at the United Nations General Assembly in September. The move comes amid growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and is framed as part of a commitment to a just peace in the Middle East. The decision has drawn strong condemnation from Israel, which views it as a reward for terrorism, and criticism from the United States. France is now the most prominent G7 nation to take this step.</p>

          <p>Violent clashes between Thai and Cambodian forces have intensified along their shared border, leading to at least 16 deaths and the displacement of thousands of civilians. Thailand's acting prime minister warned the conflict could escalate towards war, as heavy weapons are now being used across multiple locations. Both nations have accused each other of initiating the hostilities, which stem from a long-standing territorial dispute. Despite international calls for an immediate ceasefire, Thailand has rejected third-party mediation, insisting on bilateral negotiations to resolve the crisis.</p>

          <p>Daniel Born, the deputy speaker of the state parliament in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, has resigned from his post after admitting to drawing a swastika on a ballot.

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that during her early career, she budgeted carefully, making $40 last for three days, which taught her the value of financial security. While this method worked for her, financial advisors today suggest a different approach for those with unpredictable incomes, such as freelancers or artists. Experts recommend a "bucketing strategy," where income is allocated by percentage to different categories like essentials, savings, and taxes, rather than focusing on strict daily rationing. This approach provides more flexibility to manage financial volatility and build a stable foundation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is visiting Scotland for a private trip that includes the opening of a new course at his Trump International Golf Links. The visit has highlighted divided opinions among local residents in Aberdeenshire. Some neighbors, like David Milne, remain critical of the development's impact on the natural landscape and Trump's treatment of property owners who refused to sell. Others, however, point to the positive economic impact and employment opportunities the golf course has brought to the area. Protests are planned, reflecting a broader sentiment in Scotland where polls show a largely unfavorable opinion of the president.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has determined that a 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene "Buzzy" Peltola Jr., husband of then-Congresswoman Mary Peltola, was caused by the aircraft being overloaded. The report states the plane was nearly 120 pounds over its maximum gross weight due to a large quantity of moose meat from a hunting trip. Additionally, an unapproved external load of moose antlers was strapped to the wing strut, which degraded the plane's performance. These factors led to the pilot losing control shortly after takeoff, resulting in the fatal crash.</p>

Hamas expressed surprise at the "negative" U.S. remarks but affirmed its commitment to continue negotiations. The talks have centered on a 60-day ceasefire in exchange for the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but have stalled over key issues like aid distribution and a permanent end to the war.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to save money, with many accounts currently providing returns that outpace the inflation rate. National average yields for CDs vary by term, but top rates from competitive banks, particularly online institutions, are significantly higher. For example, some 1-year CDs offer APYs around 4.40%, while 5-year terms can reach 4.20%. Experts suggest that short-term CDs currently have higher rates due to an inverted yield curve, and savers can use strategies like CD laddering to take advantage of these favorable conditions.

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor. As of late July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.79%, while a 15-year mortgage averages around 6.01%. Refinance rates are slightly higher. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, as top rates are typically reserved for borrowers with high credit scores.

          <p>German automaker Volkswagen has reduced its financial outlook for the year after reporting a 29% drop in second-quarter operating profit. The company attributed the decline to a significant financial hit from U.S. tariffs, which cost €1.3 billion in the first half of the year, and an additional €700 million in restructuring provisions. Consequently, Volkswagen has lowered its expected operating return on sales for 2025. The company's CFO noted that margins on electric vehicles are currently lower than those for combustion engine cars, which also contributed to the weaker financial performance.</p>

The piece suggests that resistance to such tactics requires active, nonviolent mobilization, such as street protests and court-watching, to disrupt the government's machinery.

          <p>Democratic congressmen Robert Garcia and Summer Lee are pressing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for information regarding the practice of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks and concealing their identities during operations. In a letter to the DHS secretary, they argue that this practice erodes public trust, violates due process rights, and creates safety risks by making it easier for criminals to impersonate law enforcement. The letter highlights several cases where criminals posing as ICE agents have robbed or kidnapped people, underscoring the dangers of anonymous enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new plan to invest nearly $9 billion in icebreakers and enhance its presence in the Arctic is fueling a debate about the region's strategic importance. This "historic investment in U.S. Arctic security" comes as global warming makes the Northern Sea Route, the shortest passage from Asia to Europe, more navigable. Chinese scholars argue that these Arctic shipping routes offer significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional paths. They view the development of this "Polar Silk Road" as a potential new way for China to counter what they see as U.S. geopolitical containment.</p>

          <p>Gated communities in the United States have become increasingly popular across various budgets and lifestyles, extending beyond just the ultra-wealthy and retirees. While security and controlled access are key features, the primary draw for many is the array of top-tier amenities like golf courses and concierge-style living. Homes in these communities, which are most prevalent in states like Florida and California, are typically 5% to 20% more expensive than similar non-gated homes. They also come with Homeowners Association (HOA) fees but tend to have higher appreciation rates, making them a desirable investment for many.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author recounts her experience dating a wealthy and charming film producer in Los Angeles who initially seemed kind and supportive. However, his pattern of disappearing for weeks at a time, followed by reappearances with lavish gifts like a platinum credit card for a shopping spree, raised red flags. She eventually discovered he was seeing other women and that the expensive presents were a way to compensate for his disloyalty. The author reflects on learning that a life of affluence and expensive gifts does not equate to love or honesty, a lesson that came at a heartbreaking emotional cost.</p>

          <p>The ongoing saga surrounding files related to the late Jeffrey Epstein is reportedly creating a rift among President Trump's supporters in online conspiratorial circles. While the administration has signaled a shift away from releasing more documents, some prominent MAGA influencers and followers are continuing to demand transparency, a stance Trump himself once endorsed. This has led to online battles between those who trust the White House's strategy and those who feel the president is not fulfilling a key promise. The division highlights the challenge for the administration as it navigates the high expectations of its most fervent base.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how the food aid system in Gaza, managed by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has become a deadly ordeal for starving civilians. Since the GHF began operations, over 1,000 Palestinians have reportedly been killed near its few distribution centers, with Israeli soldiers allegedly using live fire for crowd control. The aid provided is described as woefully inadequate, pushing Gaza further toward famine while traditional, experienced aid agencies remain barred by Israel. The system forces desperate people to risk their lives for sustenance, creating a horrific choice between starvation and potential death.</p>

          <p>Trey Parker, the co-creator of "South Park," offered a mock-serious apology to President Donald Trump after the show's season premiere heavily ridiculed him, depicting him in bed with Satan. The episode prompted a White House spokesperson to call the show "fourth-rate" and irrelevant. Speaking at a Comic-Con panel, Parker dryly stated, "We're terribly sorry." The episode satirized Trump's use of lawsuits to silence critics, referencing a recent legal dispute between Paramount, the show's parent company, and the president, just after the creators signed a major new deal with the media giant.</p>

Slater went missing in June after a night out, prompting a massive search. An inquest heard that he had taken drugs and alcohol and was attempting a long walk back to his apartment when he fell in a remote and dangerous area of a national park.
