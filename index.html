          <p>A temporary U.S.-China trade truce has been reached in Geneva, rolling back tariffs to 30% and lifting China's restrictions on rare earth exports, but skepticism remains about the long-term stability of the trade relationship. According to the article, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged the prior escalation was akin to an embargo. Despite the relief in financial markets, the author cautions that this may be the eye of the hurricane, with potential for further escalations. The article emphasizes that U.S. companies should use this window to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on China, as the intention to strategically decouple in key sectors remains embedded in U.S. policy thinking.</p>

          <p>New research indicates the universe will die much faster than previously estimated, though the end is still trillions of years away. The article details how scientists at Radboud University calculated the "evaporation time" of white dwarf stars based on Hawking radiation. While the previous estimate was 10 to the power of 1,100 years, the new calculation suggests it will occur in 10 to the power of 78 years. Additionally, new findings suggest dark energy, which makes up nearly 70% of the universe, may be weakening.</p>

          <p>An interview with historian Rutger Bregman discusses the concept of "moral ambition," urging people to dedicate their talents to solving the world's biggest problems rather than pursuing meaningless work. The article explores the idea of measuring success by the good one does for others and challenges the notion that work helping the greatest number of people is the only way to find meaning. The conversation also touches on the relationship between moral ambition and effective altruism, and the importance of personal passion and avoiding dogmatism.</p>
