          <p>The White House announced President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults that affects blood flow in the legs. This disclosure came after public speculation arose from photographs showing the president with swollen legs and bruised hands. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the condition is benign, treatable, and that the president is not experiencing discomfort. The bruising on his hand was attributed to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, with officials asserting he remains in excellent health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey by F&G Annuities & Life found that 23% of Americans over 50 are postponing their retirement, a significant increase from 14% in the previous year. The primary drivers for this trend are financial uncertainties, economic volatility, and persistent worries about inflation and potential recessions. With the median savings for a 55-year-old at only $50,000, many in this demographic feel unprepared for their post-work years. Experts advise that delaying Social Security claims can increase monthly benefits, offering a potential strategy to bolster retirement income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged a Los Angeles woman with conspiracy and making false statements after she allegedly fabricated a story about being kidnapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The woman, Yuriana Julia Pelaez Calderon, is accused of orchestrating the hoax to elicit public sympathy and financial donations, which included a GoFundMe campaign. Investigators used cellphone records and surveillance footage to disprove her claims of being forcibly taken and held in custody. The incident occurred amid heightened community fears regarding federal immigration enforcement tactics and reports of ICE impersonators in the region.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market, reversing a previous ban from 2022. The agency concluded that the company's studies sufficiently demonstrated that its products could benefit public health by helping adult smokers switch from more harmful traditional cigarettes. This decision makes Juul one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol-flavored vapes. The move has drawn sharp criticism from anti-tobacco groups, who argue that Juul's products were a primary driver of the teen vaping crisis.</p>

          <p>Shares of agricultural processor Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) experienced a notable decline after President Trump announced that he had convinced Coca-Cola to use real cane sugar in its U.S. products instead of high-fructose corn syrup. While Coca-Cola's response was noncommittal, stating more details on new offerings would be shared soon, the announcement caused a stir in the market. The Corn Refiners Association warned the potential switch could lead to job losses and increased foreign sugar imports. The situation highlights the administration's influence on corporate product formulations and its potential impact on commodity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent Supreme Court actions suggest the conservative majority supports a broad interpretation of presidential authority, particularly regarding control over federal agencies. The court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with significant staff layoffs at the Department of Education and other agencies, setting aside lower court orders that had blocked them. These decisions align with the 'unitary executive theory,' which posits that the president has full control over the executive branch. This trend has alarmed critics who argue the court is enabling an expansion of presidential power without providing detailed legal reasoning.</p>

Comey was a key prosecutor in high-profile cases, including those against Sean "Diddy" Combs and Jeffrey Epstein.

This change would allow states and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for resources like cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. Proponents argue the move is critical as heat-related deaths surpass those from all other weather events combined.

Under the proposed settlement, Peacock must make its renewal and cancellation policies more transparent and provide an easy, immediate cancellation method. The payment includes $2 million in civil penalties and $1.5 million to fund the county's consumer protection enforcement efforts, stemming from a complaint filed in 2022.</p>

          <h2>London's Metropolitan Police to Close Half of Its Station Front Counters Amid Budget Shortfall</h2>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police in London plans to close half of its public-facing front counters at police stations as a cost-saving measure. This move will reduce the number of 24/7 service desks from one in each of the 32 boroughs to just eight across the entire city, breaking a key pledge from its community policing strategy. A Met spokesperson stated that with a significant budget shortfall, keeping all counters open is no longer sustainable. The decision comes as the force grapples with budget cuts and tries to rebuild public trust following a series of scandals.</p>

          <p>For individuals living on a fixed income from Social Security, managing debt can be particularly challenging, but options like debt consolidation are still possible. While Social Security benefits count as income for loan applications, a high debt-to-income ratio can make qualifying for favorable terms difficult. The article outlines several strategies, including home equity loans, debt management plans through credit counseling agencies, and direct negotiation with creditors for hardship programs. It also touches on debt settlement and bankruptcy as potential, though more drastic, paths to relief for those with unmanageable debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Connie Francis, a dominant female vocalist of the 1950s and 60s with hits like "Stupid Cupid" and "Lipstick On Your Collar," has died at age 87. Her career saw a recent resurgence when her 1962 song "Pretty Little Baby" went viral on TikTok. Francis's life was marked by immense success as well as profound tragedy, including being a victim of a violent sexual assault in 1974 and the murder of her brother, which led to battles with depression and bipolar disorder.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon is conducting another round of layoffs, this time affecting some employees in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division. The company stated the cuts are part of an organizational review to streamline operations and focus on key priorities, and not primarily driven by its investments in artificial intelligence. This move is a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's broader cost-cutting initiative, which has seen over 27,000 jobs eliminated since 2022. While AWS revenue growth has slowed, the company has indicated that it is still actively hiring in other strategic areas within the division.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a controversial move, California Democrats, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, are threatening to redraw the state's congressional district maps to gain more seats for their party. This proposal is a direct response to a Republican plan in Texas to gerrymander its districts to favor the GOP at President Trump's request. California's districts are currently drawn by an independent commission, a system voters approved to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Overcoming this would be legally and politically challenging, and the idea has drawn criticism for potentially undermining democratic principles, even as a tactic against Republican hardball politics.</p>

Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, was dismissed from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office, where she led high-profile cases against figures like Ghislaine Maxwell and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her firing occurred shortly after President Trump criticized supporters demanding the release of files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, a case Comey was involved in, intensifying speculation about the political motivations behind her termination.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning medication, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount off the list price. This direct-to-consumer program allows the companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), who typically receive substantial rebates. Analysts believe this move may not negatively impact the companies' net pricing and could generate goodwill with the Trump administration amid concerns over drug costs. For Bristol Myers, this strategy shift comes as Eliquis is expected to face generic competition in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>
