          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing to pursue legal action to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, even after a Court of Appeal ruling overturned a temporary injunction. The case, involving The Bell Hotel in Epping, was seen as a potential precedent, but councils argue the hotels create public safety risks and strain local services. The government maintains it will stop using hotels in an orderly fashion, while the issue fuels political debate and local protests.</p>

This move comes amid struggles with rising operational costs and increased competition from larger airlines that have introduced their own low-cost options. (not investment advice)</p>

After his family's CPR training saved his life, he spent weeks unconscious and on life support before undergoing a successful heart and kidney transplant. The condition involves abnormal proteins building up on organs and is often misdiagnosed, but Reid's case highlights the importance of advocacy and medical intervention in treating the complex disease.</p>

          <p>U.S. law enforcement agencies are increasingly alarmed by the growing interest among far-right extremist groups in using commercially available or homemade drones for domestic attacks. Online chatter within these groups indicates they are studying the use of drones in global conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and by drug cartels, as a model for a potential insurgency against the U.S. government. The FBI is particularly concerned about accelerationist neo-Nazi sects targeting critical infrastructure, with evidence of military-trained extremists identifying drones as a key weapon.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order directing federal officials to prosecute flag-burners, calling the act "uniquely offensive." However, a legal analysis suggests the order will likely backfire, as the Supreme Court has twice ruled that flag-burning is protected speech under the First Amendment. The article argues that by explicitly stating the intent to prosecute based on the message conveyed, the order could inadvertently provide defendants with a strong "selective prosecution" defense, making it even harder to secure convictions under general public-burning laws.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" are an illegal overreach of his emergency powers. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which the administration used for justification, does not grant the president the authority to impose taxes or duties. While the tariffs have not been halted immediately, the decision sets the stage for a Supreme Court challenge and creates significant uncertainty for the U.S. economy and global trade relationships.

The author, Dan Wang, argues that China operates as an "engineering state," led by individuals who view society as a technical problem to be solved, resulting in monumental projects like high-speed rail and massive bridges. In contrast, the U.S. is a "lawyerly society," where procedure, debate, and litigation often lead to paralysis and gridlock, hindering large-scale development.</p>

The 23-year-old, who stands at 6ft 6in, has signed a six-year contract, with the deal surpassing the previous record set by Alexander Isak's transfer. Woltemade had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals, and was the top scorer at the recent Under-21 Euros, making him a key strategic signing for the Premier League club.</p>

          <p>The UK prison service is reportedly in shock after former prison officer Lenny Scott was shot and killed in a planned attack by a drug dealer he had disciplined years earlier. Elias Morgan was convicted of murdering Scott four years after Scott exposed Morgan's affair with another officer inside HMP Altcourse, which led to threats against Scott and his family. The case has horrified the profession and highlighted the dangers officers face, raising concerns about whether threats against staff are taken seriously enough.</p>

          <p>Finland is set to become the first country to implement a permanent solution for nuclear waste by burying spent fuel rods in a deep underground repository named Onkalo. Developed over two decades, the facility will store over 6,000 U.S. tons of high-level waste from the country's five nuclear power plants. The project uses a multi-barrier system, encasing the waste in copper canisters and clay deep within stable bedrock, providing a long-term solution to a major environmental challenge associated with nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been responsible for over half of the €1.8 million in administrative fines issued to political parties by the parliament since 2017. The penalties relate to issues such as illegal donations and false financial reporting, with the AfD accumulating around €1.1 million in fines. A party spokesperson attributed the issues to "inexperience" in its early years, while other news from Germany includes Chancellor Merz's push for welfare reform and a historic Hamburg football derby.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis argues that the Trump administration is departing from the Republican party's traditional free-market principles through direct and frequent intervention in corporate America. Examples cited include the government taking a stake in Intel, demanding a cut of Nvidia's overseas sales, and influencing decisions at companies like Apple and Cracker Barrel. This approach, described as "Trumpalism," prioritizes the president's transactional impulses over a consistent economic ideology, challenging the long-held conservative belief that governments should not interfere with private industry.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted 23 pardons and commuted the sentences of 10 inmates, including five who were serving life without parole for murder. Newsom's office stated that many of the individuals had transformed their lives through rehabilitation and that clemency was warranted, often citing childhood trauma as a factor in their original crimes. The commutations will allow the inmates to appear before a parole board for a chance at release, a decision that has drawn emotional opposition from at least one victim's family.</p>

The Western Joshua Tree Conservation Act requires permits for any activity that could disturb the trees, including work near them. While environmentalists argue the protections are vital due to climate change and habitat loss, some residents and local officials say the law is an onerous burden imposed without local input.</p>

          <p>Recent changes in federal guidance for the 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccines have created confusion about who can get a shot and how. The FDA has only formally "approved" the updated vaccines for those 65 and older or with high-risk health conditions, meaning younger, healthier individuals may now need to consult a healthcare provider. Access could vary by state depending on whether pharmacists are authorized to administer the shots "off-label," creating potential barriers for millions seeking protection, a move criticized by many public health experts.</p>
