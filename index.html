          <h2>Virginia's Business Ranking Declines Amid Federal Workforce Reductions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:59:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Virginia has fallen from its top position in America's Top States for Business rankings, primarily due to a weaker economic outlook. The state's economy, heavily reliant on federal government jobs, is facing stagnation and potential job losses as the Trump administration implements cuts to the federal workforce. While Governor Glenn Youngkin's administration highlights the availability of private sector jobs, economists express concern about the mismatch in skills for displaced, highly-educated federal employees and the potential ripple effects on the broader state economy. The shift marks a significant change for a state historically known for its economic resilience.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have named Blue Stevens, a 24-year-old from Hampshire, as the victim of a fatal stabbing in the affluent Knightsbridge area. Emergency services were called to the scene near the Park Tower Hotel on Wednesday evening, but Mr. Stevens was pronounced dead from his injuries. No arrests have been made, and police are actively investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident. The local community has left flowers and tributes at the scene, while police have increased patrols to reassure the public.</p>

          <h2>Emergency Room Visits for Tick Bites Reach Highest Level Since 2019</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:55:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CDC reports a significant increase in emergency room visits for tick bites across the U.S., particularly in the Northeast, reaching the highest levels in six years. Experts attribute this spike to expanding tick populations and longer tick seasons, driven by milder winters and wetter springs associated with climate change. Health officials are urging public vigilance, as infected ticks can transmit various diseases, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, and Powassan virus. They emphasize preventive measures such as wearing protective clothing, using insect repellent, and conducting thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League matchup, the Dallas Mavericks, led by number one draft pick Cooper Flagg, secured a narrow 87-85 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. The game came down to the final seconds, with the Lakers' Bronny James missing a potential game-winning three-pointer. Despite the win, Flagg had a difficult shooting night, scoring 10 points on 5-for-21 shooting, which he described as one of the worst games of his life. The contest featured several direct matchups between the two prominent young players, providing an early glimpse into their professional careers.</p>

The move comes after Rayner urged the striking workers, who are protesting plans by the Labour-run city council, to accept a proposed deal. Unite, a major financial backer of the Labour party, also threatened to re-evaluate its relationship with the party if any members are made redundant. The public rift highlights broader tensions between the union and the new Labour government over issues like welfare cuts and workers' rights.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are highlighting the significant long-term value of delaying Social Security claims until age 70, which can substantially increase monthly payments. To make this delay feasible, a "bridge strategy" is recommended, where individuals fund their initial retirement years through other means, such as personal savings or annuities. This approach helps retirees secure a higher, inflation-protected income stream for life, although many Americans still claim benefits early at age 62, permanently reducing their payments. The article emphasizes that while delaying is generally beneficial, the decision depends on individual health and financial circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Tunisian Court Sentences Opposition Figures to Long Prison Terms in Mass Trial</h2>

          <p>A Tunisian court has sentenced 21 political opponents of President Kais Saied to lengthy prison sentences, ranging from 12 to 35 years, in a move critics are calling a politically motivated crackdown. Among those convicted is Rached Ghannouchi, the 86-year-old leader of the Islamist Ennahda party, who received a 14-year sentence. Human rights organizations and opposition figures argue that the trials, based on charges like terrorism and attempting to overthrow the government, are unfair and designed to eliminate dissent. The verdicts are seen as the latest step in President Saied's consolidation of power and dismantling of the country's democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The death toll from the catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas has climbed to at least 121, with search and rescue teams continuing to look for more than 170 people who remain missing. The disaster, which occurred after the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in under an hour, was particularly deadly in Kerr County, where a summer camp was devastated. A federal disaster declaration has been signed, allowing FEMA to assist local and state agencies in the ongoing recovery efforts. The search has been hampered by subsequent storms, but hundreds of responders remain on the ground.</p>

          <p>Families are facing higher prices for back-to-school essentials this year, with a new Deloitte survey indicating that overall spending per child is expected to decrease slightly as parents exercise more caution. Economic uncertainty and the threat of new tariffs are influencing shopping habits, with a majority of parents saying they will switch to cheaper brands and cut back on non-essential purchases. Despite the higher costs for items like backpacks, many shoppers are starting earlier to preempt potential price hikes. The trend reflects a cautious consumer outlook in the face of persistent inflation and evolving trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing 23 years of data has found that emergency vaccination programs have been remarkably effective, reducing deaths from major diseases by approximately 60%. The research, which covered 210 outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, cholera, and measles across 49 countries, also found a similar reduction in the number of infections. Beyond the life-saving impact, the study highlights significant economic benefits, estimating that these vaccine rollouts generated savings of around $32 billion by averting deaths and disability. The findings underscore the critical value of rapid vaccination responses in managing global health crises.</p>

          <p>In an interview with Tucker Carlson, financial personality Dave Ramsey challenged the common belief that using credit cards is harmless if the balance is paid off monthly, calling it a "great lie." Ramsey asserted that data shows the vast majority of people, 78%, do not pay off their balance each month, leading to significant debt. He argued that even for disciplined users, spending with plastic psychologically encourages 12-18% more spending than using cash. Ramsey, who advocates for a debt-free lifestyle, uses only debit cards and contends they offer the same functionalities without the inherent risks and marketing-driven pitfalls of credit cards.

While the company sources very little from China, it faces potential cost increases from tariffs on other manufacturing hubs in Southeast Asia, which it plans to partially absorb for now. The positive outlook is driven by strong direct-to-consumer sales, growth in its women's apparel category, and successful premium pricing on new products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CDC has released new data suggesting nearly one in three U.S. youths aged 12-17 had prediabetes in 2023, a significant increase from previous estimates. However, some health experts are expressing concern and skepticism, not about the problem itself, but about the lack of transparency in the CDC's announcement. The agency changed its methodology for the new estimate but released only a brief summary without a detailed, peer-reviewed paper or the raw data. This has led to questions about the accuracy of the data and the communication practices of the public health agency under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting new "national priority" vouchers that can significantly speed up the drug approval process. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary confirmed the change, aligning with the Trump administration's stated goal of lowering prescription drug costs for Americans. The program, which can reduce review times to as little as one month, is designed to incentivize development in areas of national interest, such as domestic manufacturing and cures for major diseases. It remains unclear how the FDA will assess affordability, as drug prices are typically set after a product receives market approval.</p>

In exchange, the rival firm was allegedly promised subcontracts on the project.

The Prospect union, which represents staff, acknowledged the cost pressures but also cited "management decisions" as a contributing factor.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the persistent lack of a powerful, unified movement demanding comprehensive childcare reform in the United States, despite widespread struggles with affordability and access. The author points to historical divisions, a cultural tendency to view childcare as a private family matter, and an under-resourced advocacy ecosystem as key barriers. While other developed nations have created robust public systems, the U.S. failed to pass a major federal bill in the 1970s, entrenching the issue as a personal problem. The piece notes, however, that new, energized parent-led organizing groups and increased philanthropic funding may signal a potential shift in political will.</p>
