        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose such tariffs, as the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The court's decision was based on two separate cases brought by small businesses and a coalition of US state governments. The White House has criticized the ruling, stating that unelected judges should not decide how to address a national emergency, while state attorneys general have welcomed the decision, arguing that the tariffs would lead to inflation and job losses. Global markets have responded positively to the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines is set to return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways, named Blue Sky, allowing JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United and vice versa, including reciprocal loyalty benefits. The partnership stops short of flight coordination that JetBlue had in its former alliance in the Northeast with American Airlines, which was struck down by a federal court on antitrust grounds. JetBlue's leaders have long said they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines like United and their shared rival Delta Air Lines. Some aspects of the partnership will begin as early as the fall, though the airlines didn't provide exact timing.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the past five years, according to the housing watchdog. The Housing Ombudsman's report highlights issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control, and leaks, damp, and mold. The watchdog warns of a growing imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, leading to frustration and a breakdown in trust, despite record amounts being spent on repairs and maintenance. The Housing Ombudsman is calling for a transformative overhaul of the current system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a national tenant body.</p>

Health has become a luxury commodity, with affluent individuals accessing specialized care while others forgo essential services due to financial constraints.

          <p>Google is undergoing a significant transformation with the integration of AI into its core services, prompting questions about the company's future and the evolution of online search. As AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity gain popularity, Google is adapting by introducing AI Overviews and AI Mode, which provide summarized search results and chatbot-based interactions. These changes signal a potential shift away from traditional keyword-based searches and blue links, raising concerns about the impact on publishers and the accuracy of AI-generated information. The rise of AI search suggests a future where finding information online becomes more personalized and conversational, but also potentially less reliable and more centralized.</p>

          <p>The future of the filibuster in the Senate is uncertain as both parties have chipped away at the parliamentary maneuver, with Republicans recently circumventing it to pass a measure striking down a California air pollution law. The filibuster, traditionally requiring 60 votes to pass legislation, has been weakened over the years through various exemptions, enabling the confirmation of judicial nominees and the passage of budget-related bills with a simple majority. As Republicans prepare to consider a sweeping spending and tax-cut package, pressure is mounting to include policy moves that may not qualify for reconciliation bills, potentially leading to further erosion of the filibuster's power.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the US will "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in sensitive fields, citing national security concerns. The move is likely to cause anxiety among universities, as Chinese students are the second-largest group of international students in the US. President Trump has also called for limiting international enrollment at Harvard and other top schools to around 15 percent of admitted students. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has condemned the move as "political and discriminatory."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car manufacturing has experienced a sharp decline, reaching its lowest April output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The 59,203 vehicles manufactured represent a 16% decrease compared to the same month last year, and a 25% decrease compared to March. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributes the decline to US tariffs, Easter falling in April, and the industry's shift from petrol cars to electric vehicles. While a US court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, the ruling does not apply to the tariff on steel, aluminum, and cars, impacting British car makers like Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).</p>

The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, but still managed to post strong numbers, sparking positive movement in semiconductor stocks across Japan, South Korea, and Europe.

          <p>Advocates are pushing for the adoption of single-staircase designs for apartment buildings up to six stories tall in the US, arguing that modernizing building codes could unleash more affordable housing nationwide. The current double-staircase standard, rooted in historical fire safety concerns, adds significant construction costs and limits design flexibility. Allowing single-stair construction could cut costs by about 10 percent, encourage developers to build more "missing middle" housing, and enable more varied unit layouts. While fire safety officials express concerns about safety, advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair designs just as safe, drawing comparisons to countries where single-stair buildings are common.</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the world will likely shatter temperature records again by 2029, with a high chance of average warming exceeding 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels. The projections suggest more frequent and intense natural disasters, including drought, heat waves, and longer fire seasons. Scientists express concern that the US will face this period with reduced forecasting abilities due to proposed budget cuts at NOAA. The article notes that episodes of climate “whiplash” — rapid swings between wet-to-dry and dry-to-wet conditions — are also growing more frequent and intense because of rising global temperatures.</p>
