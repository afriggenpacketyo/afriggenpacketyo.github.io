          <p>At least 67 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces while awaiting aid in northern Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which also reported six other deaths in similar circumstances. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a threat and contested the casualty figures. The incident highlights the severe humanitarian crisis in the region, with the UN and local health officials warning of widespread starvation and the imminent risk of death for many due to extreme hunger. This event occurred amid ongoing conflict and Israeli evacuation orders for other parts of Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has committed to reducing the number of sewage discharges from water companies by 50% by the year 2030, responding to public anger over waterway pollution. This pledge follows new data showing a 60% increase in serious pollution incidents in 2024, reaching a record high. The government plans to hold the industry accountable but has ruled out nationalization, while a landmark review could see the regulator Ofwat overhauled. The plan is part of a £104 billion investment into the water sector, which will be funded in part by increased consumer bills.</p>

          <p>An underwater search has been initiated by Cheshire Police for Rachel Booth, a 38-year-old woman who went missing early on Saturday. She was last seen on CCTV at a garage in Northwich, and authorities believe she may have traveled to the Oakmere area near Delamere Forest. Police have expressed growing concern for her welfare, prompting the deployment of a specialized underwater search team. A nearby outdoor activity center has temporarily closed to assist with the search efforts, as police appeal to the public and to Ms. Booth directly for information.</p>

          <p>Representative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, reiterated his call for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. He emphasized the need for transparency while also cautioning against revealing the identities of potential victims or innocent individuals mentioned in the files. Burchett distanced himself from President Trump's initial dismissal of the issue as a "hoax," noting the President has since directed the Attorney General to move toward unsealing the evidence. The congressman expressed skepticism that the full truth would ever be revealed, citing Washington's tendency to protect its secrets.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance is reportedly planning a family vacation in the Cotswolds region of England, a destination known for its gentle hills and affluent tourism. The trip is expected to take place next month, following a visit to London, a city he previously claimed was “not English any more.” The choice of vacation spot contrasts with his "hillbilly" persona and comes after he criticized European governments, including the UK and Scotland, for what he termed suppressing free speech and failing on migration. His planned visit highlights a contrast between his political rhetoric and personal travel choices.</p>

          <p>President Trump commemorated the six-month anniversary of his second term, asserting that the United States has been "totally revived" after being "DEAD" under the previous administration. He highlighted key actions, including designating the Houthis as a terrorist organization, ordering military strikes on Iran, and brokering a ceasefire in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Domestically, he pointed to the passage of a bill making his 2017 tax cuts permanent and new legislation to regulate stablecoins.

          <p>While few companies explicitly cite artificial intelligence as the reason for layoffs, employment experts suspect it is a significant, unacknowledged factor behind recent job cuts. Firms often use vague terms like "restructuring" or "optimization" to describe workforce reductions that coincide with large-scale AI adoption. This strategic silence helps companies avoid public and employee backlash while transitioning to automated systems. Experts note that while AI can automate many tasks, it often still requires human oversight, and companies that overestimate its capabilities may face challenges after eliminating human roles.</p>

Litt argues that focusing on shared activities rather than differences can foster friendships and lead to more genuine discussions on contentious issues.

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. This skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and cultivates authentic confidence, acting as a buffer against anxiety and self-doubt. Raouda suggests that parents can foster this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming their full range of emotions, and modeling their own self-connection. Small shifts in parenting can make a significant difference.</p>

          <p>Following a tragic school coach crash in Somerset, UK, two children and two adults remain in the hospital. The incident occurred when a coach carrying students from Minehead Middle School went off the road and down a 20-foot slope, resulting in the death of a 10-year-old boy. The school was closed on Friday as the community mourned, leaving flowers and tributes at the gates. Local residents have raised over £40,000 to support those affected by the crash, and a church service is planned for grieving and reflection. An investigation into the cause of the crash is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Fauja Singh, a 114-year-old man celebrated for completing nine marathons after the age of 89, was killed in a hit-and-run accident in his home state of Punjab, India. Singh, who gained international fame as the "Turbaned Tornado," had retired from marathons but remained active. His death has highlighted the severe danger of India's roads, where over 150,000 people are killed annually in traffic accidents. While a suspect has been arrested, experts point to systemic failures in road engineering and a lack of pedestrian infrastructure as major contributing factors to the country's high rate of traffic fatalities.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are voicing increasing frustration and mistrust toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government regarding negotiations for their release. Campaigners feel the government is not prioritizing a deal, pointing to the deaths of hostages like Carmel Gat, who was supposed to be freed in a previous truce but was later found killed. Many now place more hope in the US administration to pressure Israel into an agreement. This sentiment reflects a painful divide, with families feeling the government's political goals are taking precedence over the lives of the captives.</p>

          <p>The concept of personality being fixed is being challenged by new scientific research, which suggests that people can intentionally change their characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. Writer Olga Khazan documented her own year-long journey to become less neurotic and more extroverted, using techniques like improv classes to step outside her comfort zone. According to psychologists, by consciously adopting and maintaining new behaviors, individuals can shift their personality traits over time. This approach involves simple principles, such as "faking it 'til you make it," but requires difficult and consistent execution to achieve lasting change.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events company Create & Cultivate, says the biggest red flag in a job interview is a candidate who is unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company or the role. She values candidates who have done their due diligence and can offer genuine, constructive feedback on the business's operations. Conversely, she is most impressed by candidates who can openly discuss their past mistakes and what they learned from them. Johnson also asks problem-solving questions to gauge how applicants handle pressure, as adaptability is a key trait for success in a fast-paced startup environment.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for circumventing a 2021 law by restoring the Confederate names of several U.S. army bases. To bypass the law, which mandated new names, the Pentagon claims the bases are now named after different soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names as the original Confederate namesakes. This move was rebuked by the House Armed Services Committee, which voted to block the action. Critics argue the move is an insult and point out the poor historical records of the original namesakes, such as the widely derided General Braxton Bragg.</p>

Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to combat Donald Trump's political movement.

          <p>A long-form essay posits that Oklahoma's history of land theft from Native nations, racial violence, and constant reinvention serves as a microcosm of the entire American story. The author reflects on growing up with a sanitized version of state history that celebrated "Sooners" and land runs while erasing the violent dispossession of Indigenous peoples and Black communities. The piece argues that the state's current efforts to rebrand itself echo its foundational strategy of prioritizing outsiders over addressing historical injustices. Understanding this complex legacy of ambition and betrayal, the author contends, is essential for grappling with America's current divisions.</p>

Approval for the president's recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is low, with most believing it primarily helps the wealthy.
