          <p>President Trump's nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness specialist, as surgeon general has ignited controversy, with critics questioning her lack of recent medical practice and focus on functional medicine. Laura Loomer, a Trump ally, publicly criticized Dr. Means, while Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended her ability to inspire Americans to rethink the healthcare system. Dr. Means's brother, Calley Means, also defended her, stating that she left the medical system due to a moral insight that her patients were not getting better. The surgeon general oversees the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Health Service and must have specialized training or experience in public health programs.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade agreement with the UK, maintaining import taxes on most UK goods while rolling back some tariffs on sectors like cars and steel. In return, the US secured expanded opportunities for American beef, ethanol, and agricultural products in the UK. Analysts suggest the substantive benefits are limited, with the deal primarily offering marginal changes to the status quo. Despite some relief from UK steelmakers and car firms, goods from the UK still face higher tariffs than before, and American carmakers expressed concerns about increased competition from UK imports.</p>

          <p>China's latest stimulus measures to revive growth have failed to cheer the stock market, with investors focusing on trade talks with the U.S. The stimulus package, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injection, was largely priced in by markets, coupled with concerns over the ongoing trade war.

A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, and this rule is in contrast to women's gaelic football where shorts are allowed.</p>
