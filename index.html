          <h2>Trump to Announce Medicare Drug Pricing Plan</h2>

          <p>President Trump is expected to unveil a "most favored nation" plan aimed at lowering Medicare drug prices, a policy previously attempted during his first term. This plan would tie the cost of certain Medicare drugs to the lowest prices offered by drug manufacturers in other countries. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, has pointed to the high cost of drugs like Ozempic as a key impediment. The administration also scrapped a proposal to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid due to concerns about the overall cost to the healthcare system. This article indicates a renewed push for drug pricing reform under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will discontinue its database tracking billion-dollar weather and climate disasters due to evolving priorities and staffing changes. This database has been a crucial resource for government, the insurance industry, and media outlets in understanding the economic costs of extreme weather events. Critics, like Roger Pielke Jr., have argued the database requires better metadata and documentation, suggesting economists should oversee the data to address quality control issues. Former NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad believes the report should be a collaboration between NOAA scientists and economists to properly assess environmental observations and economic impacts.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced that it will cease tracking the costs of disasters causing at least $1 billion in damage. This decision will leave insurance companies, researchers, and policymakers without essential data for understanding major disaster patterns and their economic consequences, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change. Critics argue that this move aligns with the Trump administration's efforts to restrict climate research. Researchers and lawmakers have expressed concern that the absence of this database will hinder efforts to set budgets and make informed infrastructure investment decisions.</p>

          <p>Rapper Lil Durk has been denied bail pending his trial on murder-for-hire charges after a judge cited violations of jail rules, including using other inmates' phone accounts and engaging in three-way calls. Prosecutors allege that Banks may be linked to a second murder in Chicago and accused him of putting out bounties for other killings. Banks is accused of ordering the murder of Tyquian Bowman, a Georgia rapper, in 2022 and has pleaded not guilty. The defense argued that the removal of lyrics from the indictment undermines the prosecution's case, but the judge maintained that Banks should be detained.</p>

          <p>A new law in Washington State requiring clergy to report child abuse, even if learned during confession, has ignited a conflict between the state, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Justice Department. The Justice Department has launched a civil rights investigation into the law, citing concerns about religious freedom under the First Amendment. The law applies to clergy of all religions but has particularly outraged Catholics, who consider the secrecy of confession sacrosanct. The bill's sponsor, State Senator Noel Frame, was inspired by investigations into Jehovah's Witness churches and her own experience as a survivor of childhood sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Amanda Hess's book, Second Life: Having A Child In The Digital Age, explores how technology shapes every aspect of parenting. Hess discusses how technology can both inform and create anxiety during pregnancy, citing her own experience with prenatal testing and online communities. She also examines the potential impact of baby monitor surveillance and the reliance on high-tech bassinets, arguing that technology can sometimes confuse care with surveillance and make it difficult to understand a child's needs. Despite the challenges, Hess acknowledges the comfort and support found in online communities for parents facing rare conditions.</p>
