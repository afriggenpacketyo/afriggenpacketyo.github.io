          <p>Milan Mandaric, the Serbian-American businessman who formerly owned English football clubs Portsmouth, Leicester City, and Sheffield Wednesday, has died at 87 after a short illness. Known as football's 'Mr Fixit,' Mandaric rescued Portsmouth from bankruptcy and oversaw promotions for Leicester and Sheffield Wednesday. His family's statement highlighted his profound love for football, surpassed only by his devotion to his family. Mandaric's career also included founding successful electronics businesses in the US and a notable tax evasion acquittal with Harry Redknapp.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have deployed hundreds of additional officers across the city, working extended shifts and cancelling rest days, to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes confirmed resources are in place, also factoring in the upcoming Conservative Party Conference. The force questioned the appropriateness of a pro-Palestine march scheduled for Saturday, given the recent tragedy. Four suspects remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses related to the attack.</p>

          <p>A car ramming and stabbing attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur resulted in the deaths of two Jewish men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, and left three others seriously injured. The attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, was shot dead by police after attempting to force entry into the synagogue, where worshippers and security staff bravely held the doors shut. Police are treating the incident as a terror attack, potentially influenced by extreme Islamist ideology. One victim was tragically hit by police gunfire, highlighting the chaotic and horrific nature of the event.</p>

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed being 'on the verge of a very great achievement,' hoping to announce the return of all hostages soon. The plan's first stage involves Hamas releasing all Israeli hostages while the IDF redeploys but maintains control of strategic areas.

          <p>Storm Amy has impacted large parts of the UK with heavy rain and strong winds, leaving thousands of homes without power, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland. A man died in the Republic of Ireland in a weather-related incident, and many railway lines and roads experienced closures. The storm set a new record for the deepest area of low pressure in the UK for October, with gusts exceeding 100mph in some exposed areas. Safety inspections are underway, with conditions expected to improve by Sunday.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker criticized the Trump administration's plan to federalize 300 National Guard troops in the state, calling the demand 'outrageous and un-American.' This announcement coincided with a federal agent shooting a woman in Broadview, Chicago, during an aggressive immigration enforcement operation. The Department of Homeland Security stated the agents acted defensively after being threatened by vehicles, while Pritzker argued there was no need for military intervention. The incident highlights escalating tensions surrounding federal immigration crackdowns in US cities.</p>

          <p>Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš's ANO movement secured a significant victory in the Czech parliamentary election, with nearly 35% of the vote. This outcome could steer the Czech Republic away from its strong support for Ukraine and align it more closely with pro-Russian stances taken by Hungary and Slovakia. Babiš, who called his result 'historic,' aims to form a one-party government and has expressed a different view on military aid to Ukraine. His victory signals a potential shift in the country's foreign policy and its role within the European Union.</p>

          <p>The US Treasury Department is considering minting a commemorative $1 coin for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring Donald Trump. A draft design, shared by US Treasurer Brandon Beach, shows Trump's profile and the phrase 'Fight, Fight, Fight,' referencing his remarks after an assassination attempt. The proposal leverages a 2020 law authorizing special $1 coins for the semiquincentennial. While existing laws typically prohibit living persons on currency, Congress could make an exception. This initiative has emerged amidst a partial government shutdown and discussions about Trump's public image.</p>

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, clashed with anti-government protesters attempting to storm the presidential palace, using water cannons and pepper spray to disperse the crowds. The protests stem from allegations of a stolen parliamentary election last year by the ruling Georgian Dream party, which has since paused talks on joining the EU. The demonstration coincided with local elections, largely boycotted by the pro-European Union opposition. An organizer called for the arrest of senior figures from the ruling party, highlighting deep political instability in the Caucasus country.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a landmark moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, 53, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, becoming the fifth presiding bishop since the ELCA's formation in 1988. His election is seen as a significant step for diversity, encouraging others from underrepresented communities to consider similar roles. Curry's goals include fostering a more connected church, despite challenges faced by mainline Protestant denominations, such as declining membership and theological disputes.</p>

          <p>Democrats are actively refuting Republican claims that their funding resolution would provide 'free healthcare for illegals,' asserting that federal law prohibits such use of funds for undocumented immigrants. The debate intensified during the government shutdown, with Republicans accusing Democrats of prioritizing benefits for 'illegal aliens.' Democrats clarify that their proposal aims to reverse cuts to Medicaid and extend Affordable Care Act subsidies for lawfully present noncitizens, who are currently losing coverage. This political messaging battle highlights deep divisions over healthcare policy and immigration.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem issued a controversial warning, stating that only 'law-abiding Americans' should attend next year's Super Bowl, and that ICE agents 'will be all over that place.' Noem also criticized the NFL's choice of Bad Bunny as the halftime performer due to his past immigration policy criticisms. The White House press secretary later stated there were no 'tangible plans' for ICE at the Super Bowl, but reiterated that the administration would arrest and deport 'illegal immigrants' if found. This reflects heightened tensions around immigration enforcement and public events.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through its prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, targeting those paying out-of-pocket as many insurers do not cover these drugs. This move aims to increase access and demand for semaglutide, which has seen soaring prices and supply limitations, amidst a growing market for weight-loss drugs. Costco's entry could significantly impact the accessibility of these popular medications. (not investment advice)</p>
