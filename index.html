          <p>Thousands of Israelis, including families of hostages held in Gaza, are protesting against the government's plan to expand its military operation. Demonstrators fear the plan jeopardizes the lives of the remaining hostages and are demanding a deal to secure their release. The protests include calls for a general strike and have seen some former soldiers publicly refuse to serve, highlighting a significant division between public opinion and the government's strategy. This domestic pressure adds to international condemnation of the proposed military action.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Security Council is scheduled to convene for an emergency session to address Israel's plan to expand its military operations and reoccupy Gaza City. The plan has drawn widespread international condemnation, with key allies like the UK, Germany, and France strongly rejecting it as a violation of international law. The article also notes a recent German poll indicating majority support for recognizing a Palestinian state. These developments underscore the growing diplomatic isolation Israel faces over its current war strategy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing asylum applications from immigrants who entered the U.S. years ago but did not undergo a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border. This administrative change affects dozens who have been living and working in the country while awaiting their case review, effectively resetting their years-long process. Immigration lawyers argue this retroactively penalizes applicants for a screening backlog that was the government's responsibility, forcing documented individuals into an undocumented status and at risk of detention.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing for its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures expected to climb above 30C for several consecutive days. Forecasters predict a peak of 34C in the south Midlands, prompting the UK Health Security Agency to issue yellow heat health alerts for most of England. This significant shift in weather follows recent storms, with warm air being drawn up from the south. While England and Wales will experience the most sunshine, the hot and humid conditions also bring a risk of scattered thunderstorms.</p>

          <p>The Greek island of Lesbos is experiencing a significant surge in tourism from neighboring Turkey, with thousands of visitors arriving via new ferry connections. Turkish tourists are attracted by the island's relaxed atmosphere and relative affordability compared to holiday destinations in their own country. This economic boost is fostering positive cross-cultural interactions at a local level, even as political tensions between Athens and Ankara persist over maritime borders and other disputes. The trend highlights how grassroots tourism can build goodwill despite ongoing geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has developed a new set of genome editing tools, known as programmable chromosome engineering (PCE), that can precisely manipulate large DNA fragments. Published in the journal Cell, this breakthrough makes the complex process of large-scale gene editing more efficient and easier to use in higher organisms like plants. Researchers believe this technology will create new possibilities for improving crop traits, treating genetic diseases, and advancing the development of artificial chromosomes for synthetic biology applications.</p>

          <p>Despite a solid earnings report from steel manufacturing corporation ArcelorMittal, an analysis indicates that its statutory profits may be misleadingly high. The company's profit was significantly boosted by US$1.5 billion in "unusual items," which are typically one-off events and not indicative of core operational performance. This suggests that the reported profit may not be a reliable guide to the company's sustainable, underlying earnings power, potentially giving investors an overly optimistic view of its financial stability.

This trend aligns with the city government's "Night Economy 2.0" initiative, which aims to stimulate domestic consumption by enriching cultural and entertainment offerings as a way to bolster economic growth amid wider deflationary pressures.</p>

While acknowledging that current hardware is sufficient, he stated that the "AI for embodied intelligence" remains inadequate. He suggests that generative video models, like Google's Genie 3, might be more promising than current approaches for achieving this goal.</p>

          <p>Investigators solved the murder of a Minnesota nurse, Alexandra Pennig, after discovering a small, round piece of a bathroom door lock underneath her body. Initially, the only other person present, Matthew Ecker, claimed Pennig had locked herself in the bathroom and died by suicide, and that he broke the door down afterward. The placement of the broken lock piece proved the door was forced open *before* Pennig was shot and fell, contradicting Ecker's story. This crucial piece of forensic evidence led to Ecker's conviction for second-degree murder.</p>
