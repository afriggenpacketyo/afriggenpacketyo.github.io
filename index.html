          <p>A Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna plane. He allegedly threatened a flight instructor and flew from Victoria to Vancouver, prompting NORAD to scramble fighter jets. Cassim, a former pilot described as highly intelligent, appears to have acted with an ideological motive related to climate change, having posted on social media as a "messenger of Allah" sent to save humanity from global warming. The incident, which ended safely, was described by the British Columbia Premier as a "bizarre moment" and a testament to the skill of responders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the court-approved release of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, amid public pressure for more transparency. This move follows a Justice Department memo stating Epstein died by suicide and had no "client list," which drew backlash from some of Trump's own supporters. Legal experts note that such a request is unusual and the release process could take months, potentially facing objections from individuals named in the testimony. The decision comes as the administration faces scrutiny over its handling of the Epstein files.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June Amid Declining Rice Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations as soaring rice prices began to ease. Despite the cooling, this marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, with underlying price pressures persisting. The government's release of rice stockpiles has helped moderate prices, but economists remain cautious due to the yen's depreciation and potential U.S. tariffs. These economic concerns loom as the country approaches an Upper House election with political uncertainty for the ruling coalition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis from The Atlantic questions the official reasoning for ending "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," suggesting it may be part of a pattern of CBS's parent company, Paramount, capitulating to President Trump. While CBS cited it as a "purely a financial decision," Colbert has been a consistent and prominent critic of Trump, and his show has maintained strong ratings. The article contextualizes the decision within a series of events, including a controversial lawsuit settlement with Trump and the impending federal approval of the Paramount-Skydance merger. These actions have raised concerns about the network's commitment to editorial independence.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting about a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The acknowledgment follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged Watters' show lied about the timeline of the conversation to suggest it concerned the deployment of Marines to Los Angeles. In a characteristically snarky tone, Watters stated he misunderstood a social media post from Newsom and said "I'm sorry," but also criticized the governor for being "confusing and unclear." Newsom's office indicated the lawsuit will proceed, stating, "Discovery will be fun."</p>

          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the UK's Labour Party after she reiterated controversial comments about racism in a BBC interview, stating she did not regret them. Abbott asserted that it is "obvious this Labour leadership wants me out," as she now faces an investigation and must sit as an independent MP. The controversy stems from her argument that racism against Black people is distinct from prejudice faced by other groups like Jewish people or Travellers, a view that has drawn sharp criticism, including from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The suspension highlights ongoing internal tensions within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to sue The Wall Street Journal and its parent company, News Corp, over an article detailing his alleged ties to Jeffrey Epstein. The report claims that a 2003 birthday book for Epstein included a crude letter with a "Donald" signature, which Trump has vehemently denied as "false, malicious, and defamatory." This legal threat comes as the president faces pressure from his own supporters to release all files related to the Epstein case.

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a vote on a $9 billion spending cuts package requested by President Trump, targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting. The process has been complicated by Democratic efforts to force a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein, turning procedural committee meetings into heated debates. Democrats have accused the GOP of offering a non-binding resolution on the Epstein files as a "cover vote" to avoid a substantive measure. The rescissions bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, faces a tight deadline before the funds must be spent as originally allocated.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of observations from therapists highlights perceived general differences between their male and female patients' approaches to therapy and emotional expression. According to the anecdotes, male patients often take longer to open up but then do so suddenly, may frame issues in practical terms, and sometimes apologize for having emotions. Conversely, female patients were noted to be more open initially, express more self-criticism, and may apologize for crying. The therapists suggest these patterns are likely influenced by societal conditioning rather than inherent gender traits, with both groups ultimately seeking to be heard and understood.</p>

          <p>President Trump has continued his public criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, recently questioning whether he should be fired over the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates. The article explains that the Federal Reserve operates independently to manage the U.S. economy, using interest rates to balance its dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping prices stable. Trump's frustration stems from his belief that lower rates would boost economic growth, though the Fed has been cautious to avoid reigniting inflation. While a president firing a Fed chair is legally untested, the public pressure itself challenges a long-standing norm of central bank independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other locations in Sacramento, an operation seemingly designed to send a political message. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, declaring, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." The enforcement action, which resulted in 11 arrests, was immediately condemned by Governor Gavin Newsom's office as illegal racial profiling. The raids occurred despite a recent federal court order blocking agents from using such tactics, and they have heightened fear within immigrant communities far from the U.S. border.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, now permitting Juul to keep its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. The agency stated that Juul's scientific data demonstrates its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. This decision makes Juul one of only two companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes in the U.S. The move is expected to face strong opposition from anti-tobacco groups, who have long blamed the brand for fueling the teenage vaping epidemic and argue its products should be permanently banned.</p>

The announcement, which the company has not fully detailed, follows a pattern of Trump seeking populist wins and aligns with a "Make America healthy again" theme, also promoted by officials like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, health experts point out that from a metabolic standpoint, cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are nearly identical. The change is seen more as a branding and taste preference move than a significant public health victory.</p>

This follows her recent decision to eliminate the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new CT scanners in airports, which provide more detailed 3-D images of bag contents.</p>

This year's game brought together players like Republican Rep. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, whose family has been affected by the disease, and survivor Marcella Powell, who traveled from Florida.

The new "I Know What You Did Last Summer" is described as a self-aware and ironic take that is superior to the 1997 original but ultimately not memorable. Ari Aster's "Eddington," starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, is a pandemic-era neo-western that realistically explores a divided America through the lens of a conservative sheriff and a progressive mayor. Other releases reviewed include Albert Serra's graphic bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two distinct LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns."</p>

He is drawn to what he describes as the period's elegance and strong sense of community, particularly during the war. His passion extends to his job at a 1940s-themed tea room, where his knowledge and style are adored by customers, and he hopes to one day decorate his own home entirely with antiques from the era.</p>

The crackdowns have led to many people hiding in their homes, afraid to work or shop, causing businesses to shutter and community events to be canceled. The article highlights the chaos, including the death of a farmworker during a raid and violent clashes between protestors and federal agents.

Scientists will carefully melt the cylinder, which was drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, to study the ancient air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash trapped inside. This research aims to unlock vital information about Earth's climate history from a previously unknown period, particularly a mysterious planetary change called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how our planet will respond to current warming.</p>
