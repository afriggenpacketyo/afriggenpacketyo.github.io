          <p>Emergency services, including police and ambulance crews, are responding to a serious incident at London Southend Airport involving a small plane collision. Authorities have established a large response zone, evacuating nearby clubs and advising the public to avoid the area. The East England Ambulance Service dispatched a significant number of vehicles, including an air ambulance, to the scene. The incident, which occurred on Sunday afternoon, is expected to require a response lasting several hours as officials manage the situation and investigate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Boston-based gastroenterologist suggests that eating two kiwis daily can significantly improve digestive health, primarily due to the fruit's high fiber content and a unique protein-digesting enzyme called actinidin. Recent studies support this, showing kiwis can be more effective than traditional remedies like prunes or psyllium fiber for alleviating constipation and abdominal pain. Beyond digestion, research also links kiwi consumption to a reduced risk of certain cancers and heart disease, thanks to its rich concentration of vitamins and antioxidants. The advice emphasizes incorporating the whole fruit into a balanced diet for maximum health benefits.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay the implementation of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, which were set to begin on Monday. This move comes after President Trump signaled a new deadline of August 1 for imposing 30% tariffs on EU products, creating a window for further negotiations. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will continue preparing countermeasures in case a deal is not reached. The ongoing trade dispute creates uncertainty for the massive €1.7 trillion EU-U.S. trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has indicated that the Trump administration is exploring its authority to dismiss Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating the president can do so "if there's cause." This follows escalating criticism from White House officials, who are targeting a $2.5 billion renovation project at the Fed's headquarters as a potential justification for removal. The Office of Management and Budget has accused Powell of mismanagement and is demanding answers about the project's costs. These actions suggest the administration may be building a case to replace Powell, a frequent target of its criticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on deporting dangerous criminals, an analysis of government data reveals a different reality. As of late June, over 71% of individuals detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have no criminal convictions. While ICE arrests have increased, the majority of detainees are classified as having "no ICE threat level." Experts from the UCLA School of Law and the Brennan Center for Justice note a significant disconnect between the administration's rhetoric and the actual enforcement patterns, which overwhelmingly target individuals without criminal records.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report released Sunday details significant security failures by the U.S. Secret Service preceding the 2024 assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The investigation found that the agency denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional resources, including counter-snipers and drone defense systems, for Mr. Trump's campaign events. The report, led by Senator Rand Paul, describes a "cascade of errors" and accuses the former Secret Service director of providing false testimony to Congress.

The development comes as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to enact stronger sanctions against Russia and its economic partners.

This consensus comes after Fifpro filed a lawsuit against FIFA, accusing it of endangering players by expanding the fixture calendar without proper consultation, particularly with the new 32-team Club World Cup.

          <p>A Spanish government official has stated that recent violence between residents and migrants in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco was fueled by far-right groups using social media. The disturbances, which occurred over the weekend, resulted in five minor injuries and one arrest. The clashes reportedly began after an elderly man was attacked by several youths, an incident that was filmed and circulated online, leading to calls for a "hunt for migrants." Authorities responded to disperse groups armed with batons and prevent further confrontations, and are now investigating potential hate crimes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid the ongoing geopolitical rivalry with China, which dominates the rare earth metals supply chain, the United States is increasingly looking toward e-waste recycling as a strategic resource. Next-generation recycling companies are developing innovative methods to extract critical materials like neodymium and dysprosium from discarded electronics such as laptops and phones. This "urban mining" offers an alternative to traditional mining and reduces dependence on foreign supply chains, which have been disrupted by trade policies. The trend is part of a larger effort to onshore production and secure a domestic supply of materials vital for technology and defense. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique that combines DNA analysis with traditional family tree research, is proving to be a revolutionary tool for law enforcement. Pioneered by amateur sleuths like Barbara Rae-Venter, who famously identified the Golden State Killer, the method uses public DNA databases to find relatives of unknown suspects. This process provides crucial investigative leads that have helped solve dozens of cold cases, including murders and sexual assaults that have remained unsolved for decades. While raising some privacy concerns, the technology offers new hope for delivering justice to victims and their families.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump, the U.S. Secret Service has bolstered its security protocols with new technology, including military-grade drones and mobile command posts. These upgrades are a direct response to the failures identified in the Butler, Pennsylvania incident, where a shooter used a commercial drone for surveillance and communication breakdowns hampered the law enforcement response. The new mobile command posts allow for direct radio communication with local police, a capability that was lacking at the 2024 rally. These changes are intended to prevent a repeat of the security lapses that occurred that day.</p>

          <p>An investigation has been launched in France after a 20-year-old inmate escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's luggage. The cellmate was being released after completing his sentence, and the escapee managed to smuggle himself out in a laundry bag. A prison administration official described the escape as the result of "a series of serious malfunctions" and an "accumulation of errors."

          <p>Experts are actively refuting false claims, circulated by some politicians and online voices, that the deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding. Cloud seeding is a weather modification technique used to increase precipitation, but scientists state it is incapable of creating or significantly intensifying a massive storm system like the one that caused the floods. These experts warn that spreading such misinformation is not only untrue but also actively harmful, as it erodes public trust in science and distracts from the real causes of extreme weather events, such as climate change.</p>

While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she pointed to an upcoming announcement and a new £25 million package to help councils install charging solutions for homes without driveways. This comes as the UK works toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, with the high upfront cost of EVs remaining a major barrier for many consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration's idea that "able-bodied" adults on Medicaid could fill labor shortages on farms resulting from an immigration crackdown is being met with skepticism. Health policy experts point out significant practical and logistical challenges to this proposal. Many Medicaid enrollees already work in low-wage jobs, have health conditions that prevent strenuous farm labor, or live far from agricultural areas. The suggestion overlooks the specific skills, physical demands, and realities of farm work, as well as the complex circumstances of people enrolled in the Medicaid program.</p>
