        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates steady, specifically holding the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision follows the monetary easing measures implemented last month aimed at stimulating economic growth amidst trade tensions with the United States. Chinese authorities had previously cut lending rates for the first time since October by 10 basis points, and several commercial banks also reduced deposit rates to safeguard their net interest margin. Recent remarks from Chinese policymakers suggest satisfaction with the current monetary policy stance, indicating a potential shift towards alternative methods to stimulate economic growth.

          <p>The Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument, along with other national monuments, is at risk of being sold off or reduced due to a legal opinion from the Justice Department and proposed budget cuts to the National Park Service. The monument, which commemorates the story of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old boy who was lynched in 1955, consists of sites in Mississippi and Illinois. Historians and former National Park Service directors express concern that these actions could erase important civil rights history.

          <p>President Trump posted on Truth Social expressing his view that the United States has "too many non-working holidays," arguing that they cost the country billions of dollars, but the post did not specifically mention Juneteenth. Juneteenth, a federal holiday since 2021, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War, specifically when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, in 1865 to announce the freedom of enslaved people. While federal and state government offices, banks, and stock exchanges are generally closed, private businesses are not required to close for Juneteenth.</p>

          <p>Rice prices in Japan have more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, with a spike of 101.7% year-over-year. This surge follows a 98.4% increase in April and a 92.1% rise in March, prompting the government to release emergency stockpiles to moderate prices. The surge in rice prices coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023. The Bank of Japan held rates at 0.5% after its recent monetary policy meeting, but is expected to raise rates once underlying inflation approaches the 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks a shift in how these bonds, typically used for revenue-generating construction projects, are being used. The funds will be distributed based on outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing cities and counties to complete construction, clear obligations, and reduce fiscal risk. While seen as a positive step, the allocated sum may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt, raising concerns about which arrears will be prioritized and which firms will receive payments.

          <p>An expert familiar with Iran's nuclear program has raised concerns about the effectiveness of bombing Iran's underground Fordo nuclear plant, even with the use of massive bunker-buster bombs. The expert notes that the exact nature of the concrete and metal protecting the site is not fully known, and the weapon has never been used. He also stated that an attack would not eliminate Iran's nuclear weapons capability, and the government has the knowledge and resources to continue the program. White House officials have indicated that President Trump will make a decision about attacking Iran in two weeks.</p>
