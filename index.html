          <p>The Trump administration has signed executive orders aimed at preventing the use of so-called 'woke AI' within the federal government, specifically targeting models influenced by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) ideologies. The orders mandate that government-procured AI must be neutral, nonpartisan, and prioritize factual accuracy, citing concerns that DEI principles could lead to manipulated or inaccurate outputs. Concurrently, the administration launched an initiative to establish an 'American AI Exports Program,' designed to promote the global deployment of U.S. artificial intelligence technology by reducing regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strengthening euro. The German lender affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with pre-tax profits rising 34% year-on-year to €2.4 billion. While its investment banking division saw mixed results, with a strong performance in fixed income and currencies offsetting a decline in advisory services, the bank's overall financial health appeared robust. The results come as European banks navigate a lower interest rate environment and increased geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a plan to issue monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens, a rare move towards direct fiscal support aimed at easing the financial burden of its aging population. The electronic vouchers, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, are intended for disabled seniors to help cover costs for services like meal assistance and day care. This initiative seeks to bolster the social safety net, encourage the use of senior care services, and unlock domestic consumption by reducing precautionary savings among households. The program will be piloted in select cities before a planned nationwide rollout.</p>

          <p>Deoleo, the world's top olive oil producer, has cautioned that a potential 30% tariff on EU imports by the Trump administration could lead to higher prices and reduced availability for U.S. consumers. The Spanish company, which makes brands like Bertolli, highlighted that the U.S. imports approximately 95% of its olive oil, making it highly vulnerable to such trade measures. The warning comes as the U.S. and EU face an August 1 deadline to negotiate a trade deal, with significant uncertainty remaining. Deoleo emphasized its priority is to protect American consumer access to what it calls an essential and healthy food product.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan man, Arturo Suarez, has spoken out about his traumatic experience after being deported by the Trump administration to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, despite having no criminal record. Suarez was one of over 250 Venezuelan men sent to the prison as part of a crackdown on alleged gang members, an accusation he denies. He described enduring months of constant physical and psychological abuse, humiliation, and poor conditions alongside dangerous criminals. Released in a prisoner swap, Suarez says he was targeted simply for being Venezuelan and having tattoos, and is now scarred by the ordeal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a new directive instructing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to offer migrant teenagers the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This policy, previously limited to minors from Mexico and Canada, now applies to non-contiguous countries for teens aged 14 and older. The change upends a longstanding practice, mandated by a 2008 anti-trafficking law, which required these children to be transferred to government shelters. If the teens decline the offer, they will still be sent to the shelter system, but the new policy prioritizes their prompt removal from the U.S.</p>

          <p>England's Environment Agency (EA) has cancelled thousands of scheduled water tests for harmful pollutants in rivers and lakes over the last three months because of significant staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that seven national testing programs for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates, which can indicate sewage or agricultural runoff, have been completely paused. Campaigners and former employees warn that this reduction in monitoring makes it difficult to track pollution trends and identify problems quickly. The EA confirmed the cuts, blaming 'fluctuations in staffing capacity' at its main laboratory.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography made a rare discovery on a La Jolla beach: a violet sea snail, or Janthina janthina. These creatures, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically live in warm tropical seas and have not been spotted locally in a decade. Their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore waters, prompting speculation about a potential link to climate change. The discovery has generated public interest, and scientists are urging beachgoers to report any further sightings of this small but mighty predatory snail.</p>

Media regulator Ofcom has outlined several approved methods, including credit card checks and photo ID matching, with non-compliant sites facing massive fines.

However, an unnamed official reportedly did not deny his name was in the documents.

The developments come as the DOJ plans to meet with convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, and a House committee has subpoenaed her to testify from prison.</p>

          <p>Following the death of singer Ozzy Osbourne at 76, this article reflects on his monumental impact on music as the frontman of Black Sabbath. The band, formed in working-class Birmingham, reacted against the 'hippy-dippy' music of the late 1960s to create a darker, heavier sound that became the blueprint for heavy metal. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique, detuned style—developed after an industrial accident—and the band's horror-inspired lyrics set them apart. From their controversial debut to iconic albums like 'Paranoid,' Black Sabbath created an indelible legacy that defined a genre and influenced countless artists.</p>

This marks a significant change from his time with the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about exclusively handling DH duties. Devers explained that playing on the field keeps him more active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. The comments come after a tense spring training where he and his former manager appeared at odds over his role, which was ultimately settled as a full-time DH.</p>

The resolution's backers argue the culling is inhumane, unworkable, and a waste of taxpayer money, estimating a cost of $1.35 billion.
