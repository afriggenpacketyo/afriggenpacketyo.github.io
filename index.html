          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel was questioned by the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his handling of the investigation into the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Patel defended his decision to quickly release suspect photos, which led to an arrest, despite criticism from Democrats for causing public confusion. The hearing also covered the FBI's investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case, with Patel blaming former officials for mishandling the initial probe and denying that Epstein was an informant, leading to several heated exchanges with senators.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Stephen Miran, an economist and adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors in a narrow 48-47 vote. His confirmation comes just before a critical meeting where officials are expected to decide on an interest rate cut. Miran's appointment has drawn criticism from Democrats, who express concern that his dual role—taking an unpaid leave from the White House Council of Economic Advisers instead of resigning—could compromise the central bank's political independence at a time when President Trump has been openly critical of its policies.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed history of the Menendez brothers' case, from the 1989 murders of their parents to their recent legal battles for a new trial. It recounts their two trials, where they claimed self-defense after years of severe sexual and physical abuse, a defense that was largely dismissed in their second trial, leading to life sentences. The summary highlights new evidence that has prompted a review by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, resulting in a resentencing that now makes the brothers eligible for parole hearings under youth offender laws.</p>

          <p>A 25-year-old Eritrean man who arrived in the UK via a small boat has successfully obtained a last-minute legal injunction to block his removal to France. The removal was planned under a new pilot scheme, but his lawyers argued in the High Court that more time was needed to investigate his claim as a potential victim of modern slavery. A judge granted the temporary block, stating there was a serious issue to be tried regarding the trafficking claim and whether the Home Office had lawfully conducted its investigation, raising questions about the viability of the returns deal.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out early Tuesday morning on the seventh floor of the Rosslyn Lofts, a high-rise apartment complex in downtown Los Angeles, resulting in one fatality. Over 100 firefighters responded to the blaze, which presented significant challenges due to its location several stories up, requiring equipment to be carried up stairs. After extinguishing the fire, authorities discovered a deceased person inside one of the units; no other injuries were reported. The building has a history of code violations, including persistent roach infestations noted in previous inspections.</p>

          <p>While mortgage purchase rates have been declining, refinance rates remain elevated, making traditional refinancing financially unfeasible for many homeowners. This article outlines alternative methods for borrowing home equity without altering an existing low-interest mortgage. The two primary options discussed are a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which functions like a revolving credit line with variable rates, and a home equity loan, which provides a lump-sum payment with a fixed interest rate. Both methods allow homeowners to access their equity while waiting for a more favorable refinancing climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that President Trump's credible threat to allow TikTok to be banned in the U.S. was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that while commercial terms had been settled for months, China paused negotiations after Trump's tariff announcements. It was the president's firm stance on prioritizing national security over the deal that ultimately brought negotiators back to the table. This development suggests a potential turning point in U.S.-China trade relations, with a final agreement expected to be confirmed soon.</p>

In an opinion piece, they proposed focusing on family, nutrition, and fitness instead. However, mental health experts interviewed for this article refute these claims, stating that universal screenings actually reduce stigma by normalizing conversations about mental health. They clarify that these tools are for early identification of at-risk students, not diagnosis, and help schools address student well-being proactively.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has defended the club's £450 million expenditure on eight new players over the summer, criticizing pundits for focusing on the gross spending figure. He pointed out that the club recouped over £250 million from player sales, making the net investment a strategic move to strengthen the squad with young talent. Slot praised the club's business strategy, highlighting that all new signings are 25 or younger, and stated the spending was funded by previous successes, including winning the league after a season with minimal purchasing.</p>

          <h2>Experts Outline Common Financial Habits That Can Unintentionally Worsen Debt</h2>

          <p>This article details three subtle ways consumers might be worsening their debt without realizing it, especially in a high-interest-rate environment. These include falling into the minimum payment trap, where most of the payment covers interest rather than principal, and overusing "buy now, pay later" services, which can lead to an accumulation of small, unmanageable debts. Another pitfall is relying too heavily on balance transfers without addressing underlying spending habits, which often results in debt being shuffled around rather than eliminated before promotional periods end.

Liberatore's hiring comes as OpenAI continues its transition into a for-profit entity and increases its computational commitments, including a major deal with Oracle, further solidifying its commercial ambitions in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

She reflected on how this persona has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic," and explained that the album's title is a playful nod to this long-running public perception.</p>

This marks a significant expansion for Waymo, which already operates in the surrounding county and recently received a permit for testing at San Jose's airport, as it continues to integrate its technology into major transportation hubs.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a preliminary investigation into the 2021 Tesla Model Y following multiple reports of inoperable electronic door handles. The probe covers over 174,000 vehicles and focuses on complaints where owners, particularly parents, were locked out of their cars, sometimes with children trapped inside, forcing some to break windows to regain entry. The issue appears to be linked to insufficient voltage reaching the door locks, which occurs without any prior warning to the driver, raising significant safety concerns.</p>
