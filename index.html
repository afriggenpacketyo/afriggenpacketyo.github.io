          <p>Brentford's Yoane Wissa has publicly criticized the club and demanded they honor a promise to let him leave before the transfer deadline. In a social media statement, the striker accused Brentford of obstructing a move to Newcastle United, who have had offers up to £40 million rejected. Wissa claims the club initially agreed to a reasonable sale but has since significantly increased its asking price, leaving him in a frustrating position as the transfer window nears its close.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the death of a baby from whooping cough, marking the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy, a measure recommended to provide passive immunity to newborns. This tragic event occurs amid growing concerns from health officials about declining vaccine uptake for childhood diseases and rising vaccine hesitancy, which have left communities more vulnerable to outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has harshly condemned ongoing nationwide protests over economic inequality, labeling the actions of some demonstrators as bordering on "treason and terrorism." The statement follows a period of intense unrest, including the deaths of several protesters and the ransacking of the finance minister's home. While offering a minor concession by revoking some parliamentary allowances, the president has also ordered police and military forces to take the "strongest actions" against looters.</p>

          <p>An analytical article examines whether the Trump administration's recent actions, such as calling for the arrest of political opponents and revoking security for rivals, are normalizing authoritarianism in America. The piece cites political scientists and activists who see a familiar pattern of power consolidation, comparing the current political climate to autocratic regimes abroad. It argues that the constant threat of political persecution, rather than just its execution, is a key characteristic that is shaping US democracy.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order prohibiting city police from collaborating with National Guard troops or federal agents if President Trump deploys them to the city. This preemptive measure ensures Chicago police will not assist in patrols, arrests, or immigration enforcement conducted by federal forces. The order escalates a political feud between the city and the White House over the potential federal intervention to address crime, which local leaders deem unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>NPR is gathering personal stories from Gen Z and millennials to understand how financial pressures are influencing their lives and political views. The article frames the issue by citing research that shows younger Americans are less optimistic about achieving the American dream and face significant barriers to employment and homeownership. These generations, having come of age during periods of economic uncertainty, are reportedly delaying major life decisions due to concerns about affordability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $679 million in federal funding designated for 12 port projects intended to support the offshore wind industry. The U.S. Transportation Secretary described the projects as "wasteful," stating the funds would be redirected to other critical port upgrades if possible. This move, part of a broader campaign against wind power, has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers and industry leaders who argue it will kill thousands of jobs and hinder clean energy development.</p>

          <p>India's primary automotive lobby group, SIAM, has addressed public concern over the nationwide rollout of E20 fuel, a blend containing 20% ethanol. The group confirmed that while the fuel is safe for vehicles, it causes a 2-4% reduction in mileage, a figure they say is based on scientific studies. This announcement aims to counter widespread motorist complaints of much larger efficiency losses, as the E20 blend has become the only option available at nearly all fuel stations across the country.</p>

          <p>New 50% tariffs imposed by the US on Indian goods are reportedly a key factor driving Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, they are motivated to look past their long-standing border disputes and mutual mistrust. This potential reset in relations could enhance economic cooperation between the world's two most populous countries and strengthen the Global South's position in world affairs.</p>

The vast majority of these disappearances have occurred since 2007, in the context of the nation's violent "war on drugs."</p>
