          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visited India, emphasizing the goal of doubling trade volume between the two nations. He expressed optimism about the potential for an EU-India free trade agreement, highlighting the need to lower trade barriers amidst global protectionist measures. Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar requested Germany's assistance in navigating complex EU trade negotiations, focusing on issues like import duties, climate standards, and farmer protection. The ongoing trade discussions have gained urgency due to altered tariffs imposed by the US on both the EU and India, creating a new impetus for reaching a consensus.

          <p>Reports indicate that almost 300 people have been killed in Gaza in the three days following accusations by genocide scholars that Israel is committing genocide. The International Association of Genocide Scholars cited the killing of children and characterizations of Palestinians as evidence. Israel's Foreign Ministry dismissed the allegations, asserting that they are based on Hamas's lies. The UN considers the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health death toll to be the most accurate information available, as international journalists have not been allowed to freely enter Gaza.

          <p>Phantom energy, or vampire energy, refers to the wasted electricity consumed by devices left plugged in when not in use, accounting for 5% to 10% of home energy consumption. Smart televisions with internet connectivity and wake features can consume significantly more energy in standby mode. Experts recommend unplugging devices when not in use or disabling unnecessary features to reduce energy waste and emissions. Individual actions, like unplugging chargers, can contribute to significant emissions reductions nationally, influencing others to adopt sustainable practices and promote societal norms of responsibility. </p>

          <p>A grand jury in Washington, D.C., rejected multiple indictment requests from the Justice Department in a week, a rare occurrence that has raised concerns. One case involved a woman accused of posting an Instagram threat against President Trump, while another involved a former Justice Department employee accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. The reasons for the grand jury's decisions are unknown, but some speculate it may be due to disagreements with the Justice Department's theories of prosecution. This article discusses the unusual number of rejections and potential implications for the Justice Department's credibility. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased on Wednesday after job openings data came in lower than expected, with the 30-year Treasury bond yield falling more than 6 basis points to 4.909%. Earlier, tariff uncertainty and concerns about Federal Reserve independence briefly pushed the 30-year yield above 5% before it retreated. Investors are also anticipating Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show a slight increase in the unemployment rate and modest job creation for August.
