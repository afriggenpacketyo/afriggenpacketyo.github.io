          <p>President Trump addressed the nation from the White House, announcing that the U.S. had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, deeming the operation a "spectacular military success." He warned Iran of "far greater" attacks if they do not pursue peace, emphasizing that many targets remain. Flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump thanked the Israeli military for their earlier actions in Iran. The president stated that the strikes aimed to end the nuclear threat posed by Iran, which he called the world's leading state sponsor of terror. This is in response to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran and the potential threat of Iran's nuclear capabilities. </p>

Trump warned Iran to end its war with Israel, stating that a failure to do so would result in further attacks. The U.S. has reportedly reached out to Iran diplomatically to assure them that the strikes are the extent of U.S. plans and that regime change is not the goal. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has directly entered the conflict between Israel and Iran, initiating strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites: Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Trump stated that the U.S. and Israel worked closely together and that the strikes were a massive success in erasing the threat to Israel. The strikes involved B-2 stealth bombers, which are capable of carrying the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bomb designed to destroy underground facilities.

          <p>The United States initiated strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in the conflict between Israel and Iran. According to a U.S. official, B-2 stealth bombers were used in the strikes, but it was not clear which of the locations -- Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan -- were hit by them. The action has drawn varied reactions from American leaders, with some Republicans praising the move and Democrats raising concerns about the lack of congressional authorization.

The departures include ambassadors from Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, all of whom have served in their respective posts for varying lengths of time.

          <p>President Trump announced that the American military has completed strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing war between Iran and Israel. The U.S. attack involved a secretive nuclear site called Fordo, an enrichment plant hidden in a remote mountainside that is vital to Iran's nuclear ambitions. The deputy political director of Iran's state broadcaster, Hassan Abedini, said Iran evacuated these three nuclear sites a "while ago" and that Iran "didn't suffer a major blow because the materials had already been taken out." It remains unclear what damage the U.S. attack has had on the nuclear enrichment facilities, or whether there are any injuries or casualties.</p>

Early Saturday, smoke was seen rising from an area near a mountain in Isfahan, where a local official reported that Israel had attacked the nuclear research facility in two waves. Meanwhile, two flights departed from Tel Aviv to Athens with approximately 70 U.S. citizens, their accompanying immediate family members and lawful permanent residents, the State Department said, as the U.S. begins assisting with evacuations of Americans and green card holders.
