          <h2>Chinese Tourists in Japan Shift Towards Experiential Travel</h2>

          <p>Chinese tourism to Japan has rebounded past pre-pandemic levels, but with a shift in travel preferences. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. This trend is driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, many of whom have visited Japan before and are now choosing family trips with their children over group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its marketing strategies to better target this evolving demographic, including opening accounts on Chinese social media platforms. Despite a brief dip in tourism from Hong Kong due to concerns about a manga predicting a major disaster, overall visitor numbers continue to rise. The strong rebound indicates that the Japanese tourism industry is successfully adapting to changing consumer demands.</p>

The flight was diverted to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where the man was taken to a local hospital for medical evaluation, and a second unruly passenger was removed for punching a bathroom door.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and be "controlled by the USA."

He emphasized that U.S. Steel's headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, promising no layoffs and a $5,000 bonus for workers. Despite hailing the agreement, Trump later admitted he had not seen the final details and needed to approve the deal, even though he previously opposed the merger.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump praised Nippon Steel Corp. for committing to invest $14 billion in United States Steel Corp. and protect the jobs of American workers. During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump called the Japanese company a "great partner" for the iconic but struggling producer. He said the two steelmakers will form a "tremendous relationship." Trump also said he will raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent from the 25 percent that his administration imposed in February along with an impost of the same rate on aluminum from most countries, citing national security.</p>

          <p>An appeals court refused to freeze a California judge's order halting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, which means that Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts remain on pause for now. The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued by U.S. Judge Susan Illston of San Francisco in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities, including San Francisco and Chicago. The judge's order questioned whether President Trump's administration was acting lawfully in trying to pare the federal workforce. The appeals court wrote that the Executive Order at issue far exceeds the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution.</p>

          <p>China has completed its first overseas new-generation radio telescope in northern Thailand , bolstering a global scientific network that monitors deep space signals and tracks subtle shifts in the Earth’s rotation and tectonic plates. The 13-metre (43-foot) radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was officially inaugurated in Chiang Mai on May 16, according to the observatory’s WeChat account. Together with a second telescope under construction in Songkhla, southern Thailand, the station will enhance deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research and earthquake forecasting.</p>

The increase, set to take effect next week, is likely to create fresh economic turmoil.

Benjamin Franklin "Hawkeye" Pierce on "M*A*S*H," which aired for 11 seasons on CBS, from 1972 to 1983. Swit won two Emmys for her performances on "M*A*S*H" and was nominated eight other times for her work on the show.

          <p>Law enforcement officials warn that social media sites are increasingly being used as storefronts for illicit drug sales, and emojis — those cute tiny symbols and characters — are being used as codes names for drugs that are available for purchase. An investigation into a case in Lompoc prompted authorities to break down the meaning of the emojis to help the public decode the illicit transactions. In payments transactions and messages about the products, detectives found that emojis were used to identify the drugs that were being sold. Officials from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office are asking parents to review their children’s social media accounts for suspicious activity or unfamiliar contacts.</p>
