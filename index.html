          <p>A House Oversight Committee investigation is examining whether former President Joe Biden's aides concealed evidence of his mental decline and improperly used an autopen for official duties. The probe, which Democrats label as partisan, has so far questioned eight former aides, including Neera Tanden and former White House physician Kevin O'Connor, who invoked the Fifth Amendment. Testimonies have varied, with some aides recalling little and others, like former chief of staff Ron Klain, acknowledging Biden's memory worsened over time but asserting he was still capable of governing. The investigation continues as more former officials are scheduled to appear before the committee.</p>

          <p>Amber Meade experienced excruciating, persistent pain after foot surgery, a sensation she described as "walking on a hot bed of Legos constantly." After months of seeing specialists, she was diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a rare and incurable nerve disorder that can follow an injury or surgery. Diagnosis is difficult as there is no definitive test, relying instead on clinical symptoms like extreme pain, swelling, and skin changes. Meade eventually found a multi-pronged treatment plan, including specialized physical therapy and ketamine infusions, which has significantly improved her quality of life and allowed her to resume many daily activities.</p>

          <p>Hamilton, Ohio, a town revitalized by its growing immigrant community, is now gripped by fear due to an aggressive anti-immigration crackdown led by Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones. The local jail primarily houses detainees on immigration-related charges, generating significant revenue for the county from ICE. The situation intensified with the detention of a Cincinnati-based imam, Ayman Soliman, sparking protests and violent police responses. This local conflict reflects a broader national division over immigration, pitting those who support harsh enforcement against those who see immigrants as vital to their community's social and economic fabric.</p>

          <p>Imprisoned socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is pursuing a multi-faceted legal strategy to overturn her 20-year sentence for child sex-trafficking, including a recent meeting with the deputy attorney general to discuss matters related to Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team is simultaneously petitioning the Supreme Court, arguing she was protected by Epstein's 2007 plea deal, and exploring the possibility of clemency from the Trump administration. Legal experts view this broad approach as a standard, albeit long-shot, effort to secure her freedom by any means available. The situation is complicated by President Trump's own connections to Epstein and his administration's mixed signals on releasing related files.</p>

          <p>China has funded and constructed a satellite data receiving ground station near Windhoek, Namibia, underscoring its expanding role in Africa's developing space industry. The facility, completed ahead of schedule, will help Namibia with applications like environmental monitoring, agriculture, and disaster management by processing remote sensing satellite data. As part of the cooperation, China will also train Namibian engineers to operate the station independently. The project is being hailed as a key example of China-Namibia relations and China's broader strategy of supporting African nations in building their technological and space capabilities.</p>

These generations show a strong preference for bolder, more adventurous flavors, with data suggesting half of Gen Z consumers eat a spicy meal weekly. For restaurants facing slower consumer spending, adding spice is a low-cost, high-return way to generate buzz and re-engage customers, often promoted through social media trends and collaborations. Chains like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell have recently launched spicy limited-time offers to capture this growing market segment.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. Set to be JFK's largest terminal, it will exclusively serve international travelers with a design focused on natural light and efficiency, placing departures, security, and customs on the same level. The project is part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of the airport aimed at modernizing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic. Upon full completion in 2030, the terminal will feature 23 gates, extensive retail and dining space, and its own resilient microgrid power system.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan Little League team, Cacique Mara from Maracaibo, was unable to compete in the Senior League World Series in South Carolina after being denied U.S. travel visas. This occurred despite a U.S. policy that allows for national interest exceptions for athletes in major sporting events, which has been applied on a case-by-case basis. The State Department cited the need for additional processing time, a difficult requirement for teams that only qualify for tournaments shortly before they begin. The team's league president expressed that the young players, aged 15, were demoralized by the decision, which raises questions about future access for international athletes.</p>

The case stemmed from controversial raids by the Trump administration that advocates argued constituted racial profiling and violated the Fourth Amendment.

This new, sphere-like organ is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. While the body does not reject the neobladder, it lacks the nerves to signal when it's full, requiring patients to learn a new schedule for urination and often manage incontinence.

A key factor was an Indian intelligence failure regarding the extended range of the Chinese PL-15 missile, which allowed Pakistani J-10C jets to strike from an unexpected distance. Pakistan also effectively utilized a networked "kill chain," linking its Chinese jets with other air and land sensors to achieve superior situational awareness. The event has surprised military observers, boosted China's reputation as a defense exporter, and prompted India to re-evaluate its tactics and technological integration.</p>

          <p>Businesses in Southern California's Little India are facing significant anxiety and operational changes as a 25% tariff on Indian goods, authorized by President Trump, is set to take effect. Owners of grocery stores, jewelry shops, and apparel stores that rely heavily on imports from India state they will have no choice but to pass the increased costs on to consumers. Many are already experiencing a slowdown in sales amid economic uncertainty and fear the steep tariff will further depress business. The trade policy adds another layer of pressure on small, family-owned businesses that are central to the region's Indian-American cultural and economic life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a grim diagnosis left him in urgent need of a kidney transplant, 66-year-old Jim Irish discovered an incredibly rare donor: his own wife, Mirna. The odds of the couple being a compatible match were estimated at one in 100,000, but tests revealed Mirna's kidney was a strong genetic match. Jim had been managing kidney issues for two decades, but his condition worsened after complications from a procedure to treat a kidney mass. Following further health hurdles, including another cancerous tumor, Jim is now cancer-free and set to receive the life-saving organ from his wife, a gift she calls a blessing.</p>

          <p>Over a million Ukrainians who fled the 2022 Russian invasion have returned, but more than five million remain abroad, many hoping to come back once it is safe. The war has exacerbated Ukraine's long-standing population decline, prompting efforts to facilitate the return of refugees. However, challenges are immense, including destroyed homes, lack of jobs, and the psychological trauma of war, with security being the primary concern preventing returns. The experiences of returnees like Iryna Schestova, who came back to Kyiv for economic reasons but whose family remains scattered, highlight the complex personal and national struggles of a population displaced by conflict.</p>

          <p>Colombia's former President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery, marking the first time a Colombian head of state has been convicted in a criminal trial. The court found Uribe guilty of paying jailed paramilitaries to retract testimony linking him to the formation of right-wing militia groups during the country's civil war. In addition to the house arrest, Uribe was fined and barred from holding public office for over eight years. While human rights groups have praised the verdict as a landmark for accountability, Uribe maintains his innocence and plans to appeal.</p>

However, the process faces challenges, including a loss of trust among minority groups and controversy over the electoral system. While 140 members will be chosen by regional committees, interim president Ahmed al-Sharaa will appoint the remaining 70, raising concerns about the potential for transparency and genuine political diversity.</p>

          <p>Police in several German states, including Bavaria and Hesse, are expanding their use of Gotham, a powerful AI-driven surveillance software from the U.S. firm Palantir. The program can rapidly analyze vast amounts of data to create comprehensive profiles of individuals, raising significant privacy concerns. Civil rights organizations have filed constitutional complaints, arguing that this large-scale data analysis violates fundamental rights by potentially ensnaring innocent people without their knowledge. The growing reliance on the controversial U.S. tech company, owned by billionaire Peter Thiel, also conflicts with Germany's stated goal of achieving digital sovereignty and reducing dependence on foreign technology.</p>

          <p>Australian cricketer David Warner, currently in England for The Hundred tournament, has cast doubt on Joe Root's ability to perform in the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Warner pointed out that the English batter has yet to score a century in Australia and is often troubled by bowler Josh Hazlewood, quipping that Root needs to "take the surfboard off his front leg." Warner, who retired from international cricket last year, suggested that England's success will depend heavily on their bowlers making an impact on Australia's top order. The comments add a classic layer of pre-Ashes rivalry to the cricketing calendar.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy under the Trump administration is showing a chaotic and mixed picture, complicating claims of a consistent boom. While second-quarter GDP showed robust growth, it followed a first-quarter contraction, and business investment has fallen amid policy uncertainty. The president's aggressive tariff strategy has caused wild swings in trade, with imports surging and then tumbling. Most significantly, a recent jobs report revealed that employment growth has stalled, with far fewer jobs created than expected and major downward revisions for previous months, casting a pall over the economic outlook.

          <p>During President Trump's second term, a distinct pattern of praise and flattery from world leaders has emerged as a key diplomatic strategy. Leaders from the U.K., Israel, and the European Union have offered effusive compliments and symbolic gestures, such as state visit invitations and Nobel Prize nominations, to appeal to Trump's desire to be seen as a uniquely successful dealmaker. Analysts suggest this is a calculated shift from his first term, as foreign leaders now recognize that appealing directly to Trump's ego is the most effective way to secure favorable outcomes, from trade deals to defense commitments, in a highly personalized political environment.</p>
