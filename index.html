          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is determined to push through welfare reforms aimed at cutting the benefits bill by Â£5 billion by 2030, despite facing potential rebellion within the Labour Party. The Welfare Reform Bill includes measures to make it harder for disabled individuals with less severe conditions to claim Personal Independence Payment in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Starmer insists the current system is not working for those needing support or for taxpayers, emphasizing that everyone agrees reform is necessary. The Prime Minister states the intention is to reform the system to make it more efficient and effective.</p>

          <p>The owner and family members of a formerly Michelin-starred restaurant in Japan were arrested for violating the Food Sanitation Act after ignoring an order to temporarily shut down following a food poisoning outbreak. Thirty-three customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea after eating at the restaurant or consuming its bento boxes, with norovirus detected in some individuals. Despite a two-day business suspension order, the restaurant continued selling bento boxes, leading to a subsequent indefinite closure order. The head of the restaurant, along with his son and wife, were arrested for allegedly selling bento boxes during the initial suspension period.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter has been taken into custody as the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses in what authorities believe were politically motivated attacks. State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark were killed, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were injured. The manhunt for Boelter lasted over 36 hours, with authorities issuing shelter-in-place orders for parts of the northwest metro.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland will export up to 100 truckloads of waste each day to England due to a landfill ban on biodegradable municipal waste taking effect at the end of the year, as current incinerator capacity cannot meet the demand. The ban, originally planned for 2021 but delayed due to COVID-19, aims to reduce methane emissions from landfills by increasing recycling and using energy-from-waste incinerators. Environmental consultants estimate a capacity gap of 600,000 tonnes in the first year of the ban, requiring councils and waste companies to approach English operators for temporary contracts. Concerns have been raised about the environmental impact of transporting waste and the stagnating domestic recycling rates in Scotland.</p>

Lorenzo Simonelli of Baker Hughes noted the fluidity of the situation and expressed hope for de-escalation, while Meg O'Neill of Woodside Energy highlighted the significant impact on forward prices. The potential disruption of supplies through the Strait of Hormuz could further impact prices, though the Strait remains open according to the Joint Maritime Information Center.

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning its trade policy with the United States amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC, along with their subsidiaries, on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List." This regulation requires domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. The move reinforces existing US export restrictions and tightens loopholes, potentially raising penalties for future breaches. Both Huawei and SMIC are also on a US trade blacklist and have been impacted by Washington's controls on advanced chips.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent actions, including the assault on Gaza and strikes against Iran, have damaged its reputation and destabilized the Middle East. The disproportionate response to the Hamas attack and the strikes on Iran have stretched justifications for Israel's actions beyond plausibility. The conflict is being used by Prime Minister Netanyahu to bolster his political career, further capitalizing on insecurity and breaking trust with key allies. By engaging another enemy, Israel risks further instability and faces questions about its endgame, drawing parallels to the escalation in Gaza with no clear resolution.</p>

          <p>Analysts are warning that Donald Trump's "revenge tax" could threaten foreign investment into the US. Section 899 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows the US to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions that levy "unfair foreign taxes" on US individuals and companies. This could alienate foreign investors and undermine the US's openness, potentially backfiring given the large amount of domestic assets held by foreigners. UK companies, particularly those listed on the FTSE 100 with significant US revenue exposure, could be particularly vulnerable, potentially leading some to consider redomiciling in New York.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are facing criticism for their silence regarding recent immigration raids, despite having a large Latino fan base. While other local organizations expressed solidarity with those affected by the raids, the Dodgers have declined to comment. This silence has been perceived as ungrateful, disrespectful, and cowardly, especially given the team's history and connection with its Latino fans. The team's vice president stated that they would not be making any comments on the matter.</p>

          <p>Hospice staff are at the center of the debate surrounding the assisted dying bill, with varying perspectives on its potential impact on their services. The bill would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives in England and Wales. While some support the autonomy it would provide to patients, others worry about the impact on palliative care and potential pressure on patients. Concerns also exist regarding funding shortages for hospices and the need for improved end-of-life care.</p>

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges. XRG's interest in Santos stems from its hunt for deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is prioritizing preemptive cyber defense, urging firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and data. The government enacted cyber defense legislation in May to shift from reactive to preemptive measures.

The legislation allows tracking of online data and early action against harmful servers, while obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027.</p>
