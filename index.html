Trump urged lawmakers not to let SALT deductions impede the bill's progress, highlighting the importance of unity in achieving legislative goals. Concurrently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

          <p>The Washington D.C. home of U.S. Navy Secretary John Phelan sustained damage in a fire, according to U.S. officials. Phelan and his wife were preparing to move into the Kalorama mansion, which they purchased last month, but the residence was unoccupied during renovations. Firefighters responded to the scene, and a Navy spokesperson confirmed that the family was not home when the fire broke out.

          <p>The Trump administration explored acquiring a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One due to delays in the delivery of new planes. The proposal involved secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with Trump's Middle East envoy playing a key role. The potential deal has faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, raising ethical concerns and questions about the financial sense of retrofitting the plane for presidential use. Despite Qatar's denial of using the transaction for influence, the arrangement remains controversial due to its unprecedented nature and potential implications.</p>

          <p>A new study utilizing machine learning challenges the theory that dark streaks on Mars are caused by flowing water. Researchers analyzed over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images, creating a global Martian map of slope streaks and recurring slope lineae (RSLs). The analysis found that these features are more likely associated with wind speeds and dust deposition rather than liquid or frost. The study suggests a dry origin for the streaks, potentially caused by shockwaves from recent-impact craters or rockfalls, casting doubt on the habitability of these regions.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced plans to significantly scale back his political spending, stating he does not currently see a reason to invest in politics. He spent at least $277 million to help Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 election cycle. This decision comes as Musk faces scrutiny for his role in government cuts and as his company, Tesla, experienced a decline in net income. He accompanied Mr. Trump on the president's trip to the Middle East last week and announced his satellite company Starlink has been approved for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>
