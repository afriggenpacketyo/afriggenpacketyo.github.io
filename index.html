            <p>A woman in Spain, Lina, was murdered by her ex-partner after a police algorithm, VioGén, assessed her risk level as medium despite previous threats. The algorithm is used to allocate police resources, but in Lina's case, it failed to prevent her death. Critics suggest the algorithm may lead to police abdicating decision-making about women's safety. The case raises questions about the effectiveness and potential biases of algorithmic risk assessments in domestic violence cases and whether it influenced the court's decision to deny her a restraining order.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen claims El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and President Donald Trump orchestrated a setup during his meeting with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a wrongly deported Salvadoran man. Van Hollen alleges that officials placed margarita glasses on the table to defame him and Abrego Garcia. He maintains that neither he nor Abrego Garcia touched the drinks. Trump criticized Van Hollen and repeated claims that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member, allegations that have not been substantiated in court.</p>

            <p>The United States and Iran held a second round of negotiations in Rome regarding Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff met with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. Both sides reported "very good progress" and agreed to meet again next week in Oman. The talks represent a historic moment given the decades of strained relations between the two countries. The goal is to ensure Iran is free of nuclear weapons and sanctions, while maintaining its ability to develop peaceful nuclear energy.</p>

            <p>Superman's enduring appeal lies not only in his role as a beacon of hope but also in his relatability across different backgrounds. The character's story resonates with many, including those who see parallels with Jewish narratives, such as Moses's story and the Kindertransport. Superman's creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, infused the character with subtle religious undertones, while others find the character embodies American civil religion. Atheists appreciate Superman's pragmatic approach to problem-solving and his focus on shared human values.</p>
