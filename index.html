          <h2>Mortgage Demand Sees Over-Month High After Holiday Adjustment</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage application volume experienced a notable increase last week, reaching its highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index, with an additional adjustment made for the Memorial Day holiday. Despite this surge, overall volume remains low from a historical perspective. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages saw a slight increase, while refinance applications rose significantly compared to the previous year, and applications for home purchases also increased, driven by loosening housing inventory in certain markets. While economic uncertainty persists, homebuyers appear to be capitalizing on the increased availability of listings and slightly easing home prices. Optimism is tempered by the potential impact of upcoming inflation data and ongoing trade talks with China on bond markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have prohibited teaching antisemitism in public schools, citing concerns that it would unfairly target educators and expose them to costly lawsuits. Hobbs argued that the bill was not genuinely about combating antisemitism but rather about attacking teachers, placing an unacceptable level of personal liability on them. The bill would have allowed students and parents to file lawsuits over violations creating a hostile environment, with teachers responsible for covering any damages. Opponents of the bill claimed it would silence discussions on the oppression of Palestinians and hinder educators from providing a comprehensive account of the Holocaust. </p>

Riot officers used baton rounds and a water cannon to disperse protesters, while cars were set on fire and homes were damaged, leading some residents to flee the area. First Minister Michelle O'Neill condemned the violence, and police have urged those involved to reflect on their actions, with investigations underway to identify offenders. </p>

Ecologists are surveying the area and identifying a growing number of plant species, as well as fossilized bones of prehistoric animals.
