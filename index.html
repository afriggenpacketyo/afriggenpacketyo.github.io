            <h2>Indiana Cold Case Solved After 53 Years with DNA Evidence</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 09:33:10 EDT</div>

            <p>After 53 years, authorities have identified a suspect in the 1972 murder of Phyllis Bailer, thanks to advancements in DNA technology. Bailer, 26, was found murdered after disappearing en route to visit her parents, with her unharmed three-year-old daughter nearby. A partial DNA profile from Bailer's clothing, initially used to eliminate a suspect, was strengthened in 2024 and matched to Fred Allen Lienemann, who had a long criminal history. Lienemann was murdered in 1985, so he will not be charged, but the identification brings closure to Bailer's family after decades of uncertainty. The case highlights the impact of forensic genealogy in resolving cold cases.</p>

            <p>Eli Lilly has announced positive results from its Phase 3 clinical trial for orforglipron, a once-daily oral GLP-1 pill for diabetes and weight loss, offering an alternative to injectable medications. The trial demonstrated that the pill significantly lowered A1C levels in adults with Type 2 diabetes and led to an average weight loss of 16 pounds at the highest dose. The most common side effects were mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues. Eli Lilly plans to seek FDA approval for orforglipron as a Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026 and will submit it for weight management approval by the end of this year, aiming to address the growing impact of diabetes globally.</p>

            <p>Mondelēz International has discontinued its 360g dark chocolate Toblerone bar in the UK after nearly six decades, citing "changing tastes" and business growth strategies. The original Toblerone bar was created in 1908, with the dark chocolate version released in 1969. This decision comes amid rising cocoa prices in recent years, which have reached record highs due to a sharp fall in cocoa production. The company did not specify if other sizes or markets would also be affected. The brand name combines the founder's surname and the Italian word for the chocolate's nougat ingredient.</p>

            <p>Saving money in an inflationary economy can be achieved through certificates of deposit (CDs), which provide higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow investors to lock in high rates for a specific term and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000. While national average CD rates vary, online banks often offer the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies like considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs can help savers take advantage of the current inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering revoking Harvard University’s tax-exempt status, potentially impacting its ability to carry out its educational mission, which could come in the coming days. This action follows a White House freeze on $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts after Harvard refused to comply with demands from the Trump administration regarding DEI programs and student visa records. Harvard argues that revoking its tax-exempt status would be unlawful and endanger its ability to provide financial aid and conduct critical research. The White House maintains that any IRS investigation began before President Trump's public statements on the matter.</p>

            <p>Canadian small businesses are responding to US tariffs with a mix of national pride and concern, with some renaming products and highlighting Canadian-made goods. More than half of surveyed businesses agreed that the U.S. is not a reliable trading partner. The trade tensions have strained long-standing relationships between U.S. and Canadian small businesses, as entrepreneurs decide who will absorb the costs of new tariffs. Some businesses have even started looking for guidance on how to renegotiate contracts with partners to the south.</p>

            <p>Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), resigned from his job at a private cybersecurity firm after being targeted by an executive order by President Trump. The executive order called Krebs a "significant bad-faith actor who weaponized his Government authority." Krebs has long maintained that the 2020 election was safe and secure, at odds with Trump who made false claims of election fraud, ultimately leading to his firing in late 2020 as CISA director. Krebs stated that he needed to take on the fight for democracy and freedom of speech outside of SentinelOne.</p>

This decision reflects the club's focus on the competition, where they will face Athletic Bilbao in the semi-finals, despite their struggling Premier League performance.</p>

            <p>A large study published in Frontiers in Oncology suggests that medical cannabis has potential to treat cancer symptoms and possibly fight the disease itself. The study, analyzing over 10,000 studies, found strong support for cannabis in treating cancer-related inflammation, appetite loss, and nausea. It also indicated that cannabis has the potential to fight cancer cells by killing them and stopping their spread, although some experts remain skeptical of claims that cannabis can actually fight cancer. The study's authors hope the findings will encourage the reclassification of cannabis to facilitate further research.</p>
