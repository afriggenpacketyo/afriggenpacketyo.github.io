          <p>Ukrainian drones targeted Moscow, with at least 10 shot down, while Russia continued its long-range strikes into Ukraine, reportedly launching 49 drones and three missiles. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is urging Western partners to provide more concrete support for air defense systems, emphasizing that Russia must be held accountable and pressured into realistic peace negotiations. Zelenskyy framed Russia's expanding attacks as proof that Putin is not genuine in his willingness to negotiate a peace deal. Recent weeks have seen both sides intensify their long-range strike operations, even as U.S.-brokered peace talks continue in a bid to end Russia's 3-year-old invasion of its neighbor. The situation remains tense as both sides engage in retaliatory actions, and the prospect of a peaceful resolution remains uncertain. </p>

          <p>A major exhibition in Trier explores the enduring relevance of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his Stoic philosophy, particularly in times of crisis. Marcus Aurelius, known as the philosopher-king, ruled during a period marked by wars, economic problems, and a plague. His writings in "Meditations," never intended for publication, emphasize equanimity, wisdom, justice, prudence, and moderation. The exhibition aims to inspire reflection on good leadership and its importance in today's polarized world, highlighting the virtues that distinguished good governance according to ancient standards. The museum directors believe that Aurelius would not have considered Donald Trump a good leader, but acknowledge that the emperor was a product of his time, accepting slavery and unequal rights for women. </p>

          <p>Rwanda has announced its withdrawal from the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) due to tensions with the Democratic Republic of Congo. The move comes after Rwanda was blocked from assuming the rotating presidency of the bloc, which Kigali views as a violation of its rights. The DRC accused Rwanda of aggression and demanded the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from Congolese soil, citing the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group's seizure of territory in eastern Congo. Rwanda condemned Congo's "instrumentalization" of the bloc, stating it sees "no justification for remaining in an organization whose current functioning runs counter to its founding principles."</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the investment would create jobs and boost security, aiming to increase science and technology spending to over Â£22.5 billion per year by 2029. Research backers have emphasized the need for a decade-long plan to train workers and address challenges such as visa costs and university funding to secure the UK's reputation for science on the world stage. </p>

          <p>A new study has found that microplastics from polylactic acid (PLA), a widely used biodegradable material, can enter the metabolic cycle of bacteria and cells in the gut after ingestion. Researchers in China and the United States discovered that these microplastics alter gut metabolism and damage the gut barrier in mice. This damage could potentially contribute to conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and diabetes. The study marks the first time microplastics have been found to enter the bodyâ€™s metabolic cycle, raising concerns about the widespread use of PLA in food packaging and disposable tableware. </p>

The artifacts included semi-finished marble sculptures, mainly of Aphrodite, clay heads of female figures, and clay molds and stamps.

          <p>Iranian rapper Tataloo, once a supporter of a hard-line presidential candidate, now faces execution after being convicted of "insulting Islamic sanctities." His music, popular among Iranian youth, challenged the theocracy, especially after the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini. Tataloo's lyrics became increasingly political and critical of authorities, leading to his arrest and sentencing. Despite his past support for the regime, his current plight has drawn condemnation from activists who fear for his safety. The Iranian Supreme Court upheld his death sentence last month. </p>

The government said Thursday's data showed there were 2,346 more teachers in secondary and special schools in England compared to last year.
