          <p>World leaders have responded to President Trump's announcement that the U.S. military conducted a "successful attack" on three nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran "reserves all options" in response to the attack, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision as "historic." United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that the strikes represent a dangerous escalation, urging diplomacy. The European Union and countries in the Middle East also called for de-escalation and a return to negotiations to prevent further conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi declared that Tehran reserves all options to defend its sovereignty. Iran launched its 20th wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets, prompting Israel to begin its own missile offensives in western Iran. Araghchi condemned the U.S. attacks as having "everlasting consequences" and a grave violation of international law. President Trump claimed the strikes on Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan were a "spectacular military success," though this claim has not been independently verified.</p>

          <p>China is strengthening its economic and political ties with Central Asian countries, as evidenced by the second China-Central Asia Summit in Kazakhstan, where 58 agreements worth nearly US$25 billion were signed.

The European Union is also seeking to expand ties with the region, eyeing Central Asian raw materials, while Russia maintains strong security ties with some countries through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO).

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Prime Minister Netanyahu praised President Trump for a bold decision that "will change history," suggesting the strikes could bring the conflict closer to an end. Iran claims to have already moved its nuclear material out of the targeted sites. The trajectory of the war has shifted, and the extent of further escalation will depend on Iran's response, with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei having previously warned of "irreparable damage" should the U.S. intervene. The strikes mark a significant turning point in the conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people in cities including Tel Aviv and Haifa. Searches are underway for people believed to be trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building in Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched about 30 missiles, while the Iranian assault took place hours after President Trump announced the U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion," Iran has reportedly fired over 450 missiles and 400 drones at Israel.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik maintains her innocence, claiming her bloody bedroom was not a crime scene after being convicted of murdering her husband, Bob, in 2001. Dorotik reported her husband missing in February 2000, and his body was later found with signs of blunt force trauma and strangulation. Investigators found blood spots throughout the Dorotik's bedroom, which Dorotik explained as resulting from Bob's nosebleeds and their dogs' injuries, but authorities dismissed her explanations.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called on Iran to "return to the negotiating table" after the US bombed nuclear sites in the country. In a statement, he said stability in the region was a priority, describing Iran's nuclear programme as "a grave threat to international security". The BBC understands there was no UK involvement in the US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and that the prime minister was informed of them in advance.</p>
