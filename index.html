        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices fell by over 4% following OPEC+'s decision to increase production for the second consecutive month. The group agreed to raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast. This decision comes after a similar increase in May, bringing over 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market. Oil prices have declined more than 20% this year, leading to reduced investment in exploration and production by oilfield service firms. Goldman Sachs forecasts U.S. crude and Brent prices to average $59 and $63 per barrel this year, respectively.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man undergoing cancer treatment has sparked debate after refusing to travel with his brother's picky-eating children on a celebratory post-treatment trip. The man, wanting to experience the food culture of Vietnam, South Korea, or Japan, cited his niece and nephew's strict diet of "plain beige foods" as a major obstacle. He expressed that the trip is a celebration of life after cancer and not easily affordable. While his brother is upset, the man feels he should travel with someone who shares his desire to explore new cuisines, especially given his health journey.</p>

Harbaugh emphasized that decisions must be based on football factors, including salary cap and the talent of the rookie kicker.

          <p>Rory Truex, a China expert at Princeton University, discusses the evolution of Donald Trump's China policy, noting a shift from a "relatively easy" approach to a tariff war. Initially, there was speculation about a broader authoritarian realignment, but Trump's aggressive rhetoric and tariffs suggest he is not interested in resetting the relationship with China more broadly. Truex views Trump as a proto-autocrat who does not respect democratic institutions and has an affinity for authoritarian leaders. The interview highlights the increasingly hostile environment in Washington regarding China policy.</p>

          <p>The bodies of 13 security guards kidnapped from a Peruvian gold mine, La Poderosa, were discovered after being abducted by informal miners allegedly linked to criminal gangs. La Poderosa reports that 39 of its workers have been killed since 1980 due to violence from groups vying for control of the mine. The company criticizes the state of emergency and police presence as insufficient to halt the deteriorating security situation. Relatives of the victims are demanding justice. Mining is a crucial economic driver in Peru, where informal miners operate with some protections, but illegal mining has surged due to increasing metal prices.</p>

          <p>A failed interception of a missile fired from Yemen forced Israel to briefly shut down its main international airport, exposing the country's vulnerabilities and the Houthi rebels' continued ability to strike distant targets. The missile landed in the vicinity of Ben Gurion Airport, prompting a temporary halt of flights. The Iran-backed Houthi group claimed responsibility for the attack and warned it could strike again, threatening a comprehensive air blockade on Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu vowed further attacks against the Houthis, while Defense Minister Katz warned that the response would be ‚Äúsevenfold.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation will hurt public schools, siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools. Attorney General Ken Paxton praised the bill as a historic step in ensuring educational freedom for students.</p>

          <p>The de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed packages worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, expired on May 2, leading to higher prices for consumers on cheaper goods from China. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu, which relied on this loophole, are expected to raise prices. The end of the exemption also presents administrative challenges for importers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, potentially causing shipment delays. Some retailers are already adding tariff surcharges to orders. The rise of trade between the U.S. and China allowed for a much greater variety of goods to enter U.S. markets, but the end of the loophole will lead to a "much diminished market."</p>

Buffett's approach of buying "wonderful businesses at fair prices" transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Over 60 years, he amassed a personal fortune of approximately $168 billion, influencing generations of financiers. Known for his long-term investments and aversion to fees, Buffett's success earned him millions of admirers, although he acknowledges the role of luck in his achievements.
