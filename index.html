          <p>According to Bloomberg's wealth tracker, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has become the world's wealthiest individual, overtaking Elon Musk. This shift occurred after Oracle's stock surged dramatically following a strong earnings report driven by high demand for AI technology. Ellison's net worth is now estimated at $393 billion, while Musk's has been affected by a decline in Tesla's stock value this year. Forbes' ranking still places Musk at the top, highlighting differing valuation methods for private assets like SpaceX.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, many consumers face a prolonged repayment cycle due to high interest rates. This article explores scenarios where paying for professional debt relief can be a financially sound decision. Such services may be beneficial when managing multiple high-interest cards, as credit counselors can consolidate payments and negotiate lower rates. Additionally, debt relief companies can leverage established relationships with creditors for better settlements, and the structured programs offer accountability for those who struggle with repayment on their own.

          <h2>Atlantic Hurricane Season Remains Unusually Quiet Despite Reaching Statistical Peak</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 14:28:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite September 10 being the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, activity has been notably subdued this year. Meteorologists attribute the quiet season to the presence of Saharan dust moving across the Atlantic, which inhibits the development of thunderstorms necessary for cyclone formation. The planet is also in an "ENSO Neutral" phase, lacking the influence of El Niño or La Niña, which typically drives hurricane patterns. Forecasters, however, maintain that the season is far from over and still predict an above-average number of storms before it concludes on November 30.</p>

          <p>Apple has unveiled the 'iPhone Air,' its thinnest model yet, signaling a new design direction that may pave the way for a future foldable device. While the phone is technologically impressive, its higher price and reduced battery life compared to other new models raise questions about its practicality. Major carriers are offering substantial subsidies to entice upgrades, but these deals often lock customers into long-term contracts with premium plans. This article suggests consumers should also scrutinize their monthly phone bills, as cheaper plans from mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) could offer significant long-term savings.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris describes President Joe Biden's late decision to exit the 2024 presidential race as "recklessness." She suggests the choice should not have been left to an individual's ego, given the high stakes for the country. Harris also recounts her frustration with the Biden administration, stating that West Wing staffers often fueled negative narratives about her and failed to defend her from unfair attacks. The book details her perspective on the challenges she faced while serving as vice president.</p>

          <p>At the IAA auto show in Munich, major European automakers like Volkswagen and Mercedes are pivoting their electric vehicle design strategy away from futuristic aesthetics towards more familiar and traditional looks. Volkswagen, for example, is renaming its ID.2 to the ID.Polo and incorporating design elements from the classic model to evoke a sense of friendliness and reliability. This industry-wide shift aims to broaden the appeal of EVs to a wider consumer base by emphasizing brand heritage and comfort over novelty. The change reflects a response to slower-than-expected EV adoption rates in Europe.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial contends that Israel's airstrike in Doha, which targeted Hamas's ceasefire negotiation team, demonstrates Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's lack of commitment to peace. The piece argues that this action, along with the impending full-scale invasion of Gaza City, prioritizes military objectives over ending civilian suffering or securing the return of hostages. The editorial criticizes the passive response from Western leaders, particularly President Trump, suggesting this inaction allows Netanyahu's government to act with impunity. It calls on the UK and EU to apply greater pressure on both Israel and the U.S. to prevent further escalation.</p>

Tuchel has emphasized off-the-ball running, direct passing, and creating one-on-one opportunities for his wingers.

The raid and detentions have caused a diplomatic stir, with South Korea's president calling the infringement on his citizens "unjust" and calling for institutional improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Freight Imports Slow as Chinese Exports Continue to Decline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 12:47:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The typical peak season for U.S. freight imports is experiencing a significant slowdown, largely due to a sustained drop in exports from China. Data shows a 27% year-over-year decline in Chinese imports for three consecutive weeks, with key sectors like furniture, toys, and electronics seeing major reductions. This trend is attributed to the ongoing trade war, which prompted an early frontloading of inventory in May, followed by a sharp decline in orders. In response to reduced demand, ocean carriers have announced numerous blank sailings for October, which is expected to push freight rates higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is appealing a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had determined that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood that her removal would violate the Federal Reserve Act, which requires legal "cause" for such an action. The president announced his intention to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her attorneys argue the move is a pretext and part of a broader pressure campaign on the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Democrats should not use the threat of a government shutdown to force Republicans into enacting new legal constraints on President Trump's power. The author contends that such a strategy has almost no chance of success, as the GOP is unlikely to defy its base and could simply abolish the filibuster for budget bills to bypass Democratic opposition. Instead, the piece suggests that if a shutdown is pursued, it should be focused on a more politically advantageous issue, like extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, to maximize the party's electoral chances in 2026.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have charged eight suspected members of a far-right extremist group, the "Saxony Separatists," with planning to violently overthrow the government and establish an independent state based on Nazi ideology. The group allegedly anticipated the collapse of the German state, referred to as "day X," after which they planned to take over territory and remove ethnic minorities. The plot was uncovered in 2024, and investigators found weapons, ammunition, and paramilitary equipment. Three of the accused had ties to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that it is a mistake to view the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies as targeting only Latinos. The author points to a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing roving immigration raids, suggesting it effectively equates being a person of color with "reasonable suspicion" of being undocumented. The column highlights that while Latinos bear the brunt of enforcement, thousands of immigrants from India, China, and various African nations have also been detained.

The dinner occurred just as his 30-day federal takeover of the D.C. police force was set to expire. While the president asserted that crime was virtually gone and business was booming, his appearance drew both cheers and protests, with some demonstrators chanting inside the restaurant before being removed. Data indicates that while crime has fallen compared to last year, the city has not become crime-free, and some restaurant traffic has declined.</p>

Electoral law prohibits donations made on behalf of an ineligible person.
