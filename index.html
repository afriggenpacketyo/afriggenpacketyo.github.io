        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts from the criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, a key associate of Jeffrey Epstein. In his ruling, Judge Paul Engelmayer criticized the government's reasoning as "demonstrably false," stating the materials would not reveal significant new information about the case. The judge suggested the motion might be a public relations "diversion" rather than a genuine effort at transparency, noting the documents are not the trove of new evidence some might expect. This marks the second judicial denial of such a request concerning the Epstein investigations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has declared a public safety emergency in Washington, D.C., placing the city's police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard. The move, announced as a plan to combat crime and improve the city's condition, puts the Attorney General in command of the local police force. This action comes despite official data from the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department showing that overall crime has decreased by 7% since last year. Mayor Muriel Bowser has contested the administration's claims, stating the city has successfully driven down violent crime to a 30-year low.</p>

          <p>In an interview for her new memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated that individuals who commit sexual assault "probably" forfeit their right to choose their gender, a comment she later qualified. She also expressed regret over the handling of Scotland's gender self-ID legislation, admitting she is partly responsible for the debate losing rationality and should have paused the bill. Sturgeon's revised stance comes after significant controversy surrounding a transgender offender and has drawn fresh criticism from political opponents who argue her change of heart is too late.</p>

          <p>Ford is investing $2 billion into its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new line of more affordable electric vehicles, starting with a midsize electric pickup in 2027 priced around $30,000. This "Universal EV Program" aims to create a modern "Model T moment" and compete with global manufacturers, particularly from China. The investment is expected to secure approximately 2,200 jobs, though overall employment at the retooled plant will decrease slightly. Ford emphasized that the new LFP batteries for these EVs will be assembled in the U.S.</p>

This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface, streamlining the process and creating a new "marketplace" controlled by AI assistants. Experts believe this change could disrupt the e-commerce value chain, shifting the focus from who closes the sale to who controls the pre-sale customer attention, posing a threat to traditional online retailers and payment processors.</p>

          <p>Following a widely publicized violent assault in Cincinnati, the Hamilton County Association of Chiefs of Police has criticized local leaders for "gaps in the judicial process" and lax bail practices that allow violent offenders back on the streets. The association plans a roundtable to address public safety concerns, as the incident fuels a political debate over policing and bail reform. Six individuals have been indicted in connection with the assault, with one suspect having been out on a low bond for a prior offense at the time of the attack.</p>

          <p>A critical funding shortfall for the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) program has left private attorneys who represent indigent federal defendants unpaid since early July, threatening the constitutional right to counsel. This financial crisis, requiring an estimated $116 million from Congress, is causing lawyers to turn down cases and could lead to trial delays and a justice system breakdown. Federal judges and legal associations are warning that without congressional action, the system that ensures legal representation for the poor faces a potential collapse, undermining a cornerstone of the American legal process.</p>

Experts suggest HYSAs are better for those needing liquidity for emergency funds, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who can lock away their money to guarantee a fixed, often higher, return, which is advantageous in an environment where rates are expected to fall. Some advisors also recommend a "laddering" strategy, splitting funds between both to balance liquidity with higher earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

Her comments followed the mass arrest of 532 people who protested the ban by displaying placards supporting the group. Cooper suggested that some supporters may not know the full extent of the group's activities, which allegedly include violent attacks and major criminal damage. The proscription, which is being challenged in court, has been criticized by Amnesty International as a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor from Dartford, Ricky Jones, is on trial for allegedly encouraging violent disorder by calling for far-right protesters to have their throats cut during a counter-protest. A video shown in court captured Jones making the remarks and a throat-slitting gesture at a large anti-racism rally in Walthamstow. The prosecution argues that Jones was "rabble rousing" a large crowd in a "tinderbox" atmosphere where violence was anticipated. Jones, who has been suspended by the Labour Party, denies the charge.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike in Gaza killed five Al Jazeera journalists, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who had recently expressed fears for his life. Israel claimed responsibility, alleging al-Sharif was a Hamas leader, a charge Al Jazeera and the journalist had previously denied. The incident has been condemned by press freedom organizations, which note that at least 178 Palestinian media workers have been killed during the war. Al Jazeera described the attack as a "targeted assassination," highlighting the immense dangers faced by local journalists covering the conflict.</p>

The pressure on Tan stems from questions raised by some Republicans about his ties to Chinese companies. Tan is scheduled to visit the White House to address these concerns.</p>

Critics, including a Nobel laureate, have condemned the move as a "Soviet-style politicization of American science" that replaces merit with ideological loyalty and threatens the integrity and global leadership of the U.S. research enterprise.</p>
