          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online is driving a surge in AI-based safety technology. Spurred by new regulations like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, which holds tech companies accountable for shielding minors from harmful content, firms are developing innovative solutions. Companies such as Yoti are using AI for facial age estimation, while phone maker HMD Global has launched a smartphone designed to prevent the sharing of explicit content. This trend reflects a significant shift in the industry's approach to user safety, though it also raises privacy concerns among critics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and approximately 80 other officials from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly by revoking their visas. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited actions undermining peace efforts as the reason for the decision, which has been welcomed by Israel. The move is highly unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters under the UN Headquarters Agreement. The Palestinian leadership has expressed astonishment and urged the U.S. to reverse the ban, calling it a contradiction of international law.</p>

Demonstrators set fire to a local council building, resulting in the deaths of three people who were trapped inside the blaze. The unrest, which also saw clashes in the capital, Jakarta, stems from public anger over the driver's death and broader grievances against the government. President Prabowo Subianto has promised a full investigation and urged for calm, marking a significant early test for his new administration.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has fired a Department of Justice paralegal, Elizabeth Baxter, for making an obscene gesture and cursing at National Guard members in Washington, D.C. The incident reportedly occurred while Baxter was on her way to work, and she later boasted about her actions to a security guard. In a termination letter, Bondi stated that employees who disrespect law enforcement will no longer work at the DOJ. This follows the recent termination of another DOJ paralegal for allegedly throwing a sandwich at a federal officer, amidst a heightened federal law enforcement presence in the city.</p>

          <p>The UK prison service is reportedly in shock following the murder of former officer Lenny Scott, who was shot and killed by a drug dealer he had previously exposed. Elias Morgan targeted Scott four years after Scott uncovered Morgan's illicit affair with a female officer at HMP Altcourse, which led to threats against Scott and his family. The killing, which occurred long after Scott had left the profession, has been described as unprecedented and has severely damaged morale among prison staff. The case highlights the extreme risks officers face, even after leaving their jobs, and raises questions about how threats are managed within the prison system.</p>

          <p>Star defensive player Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, where he signed a historic four-year, $188 million contract. The deal makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history and ends what Parsons described as the "hardest four months of my life" due to a contract stalemate with Dallas. The Packers sent two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to the Cowboys to acquire the elite pass rusher. Parsons expressed excitement about his new team, aiming to build a legacy in Green Bay similar to franchise legends like Reggie White.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis explores the tactical reasons behind Manchester United's struggles under manager Ruben Amorim, highlighted by a recent loss to a lower-league team. The article examines Amorim's rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which aims to create numerical overloads but is often neutralized by opponents using man-to-man marking. The team's reliance on specific, pre-planned passing patterns, such as the 'up-back-through' routine, becomes predictable and less effective against disciplined defenses. The analysis suggests that Amorim's system, successful at his previous club, may require adaptation to the higher standard of the Premier League to achieve consistent results.</p>

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the government's plan, which allows for rapid deportations without a full hearing before a judge, must still afford individuals due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. The policy aimed to apply to migrants who have been in the country for less than two years, a significant expansion from its previous use near the border.

After the Republican-led legislature in Texas redrew its electoral maps to create five new GOP-leaning districts, California's Democratic lawmakers responded by initiating a process to redraw their own maps to add five Democratic-leaning seats. This "political arms race" is spreading to other states like Missouri, as both parties seek to maximize their advantage ahead of the midterm elections. The practice, known as gerrymandering, is shaping up to be a key factor in determining the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a celebrated but controversial home run bat flip has been sold at auction for $9,882. Rocco was initially ejected and suspended for the celebration, but a judge's intervention allowed him to continue playing. The incident gained national attention, and the auction was held to benefit Rocco's local program, Haddonfield Little League. The family expressed their happiness that the event could ultimately give back to the organization that has been a significant part of their son's life.</p>
