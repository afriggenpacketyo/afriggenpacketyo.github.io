          <p>Bernard Kerik, who led the New York Police Department during the 9/11 attacks and later faced imprisonment for tax fraud before receiving a pardon, has died at the age of 69. Kerik, an Army veteran, was initially hailed as a hero after 9/11 and was even considered for the role of head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. However, his career took a downturn when he pleaded guilty to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2010, leading to a three-year prison sentence.

          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case involving seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona, ordering a new trial without specifying a date. The decision was prompted by the resignation of one of the judges, Julieta Makintach, due to criticism surrounding her involvement in a documentary series about the case. The prosecutor had raised concerns about Makintach's impartiality after a trailer for the documentary showed her filming inside the courthouse, leading to allegations of judicial ethics violations.

Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economists Forum, suggests Washington might initially target specific Chinese entities before gradually expanding the scope to potentially exclude China from the US dollar system. He notes that implementing full-blown sanctions, such as cutting China off from the Swift system, would be difficult and could undermine the system itself. If China were excluded from Swift, countries with trade and investment ties to China might shift to using the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America". This attack follows a court ruling against Trump's tariffs, which the president attributes to the judges' dislike of him. Trump expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, claiming it provided poor advice on judicial nominations and is controlled by Leo. Despite Leo's previous role in advising Trump on Supreme Court picks, the president now views him negatively, potentially due to disagreements over legal theories and judicial appointments.

          <p>A federal appeals court has granted a temporary pause to a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Trump administration argued that the trade court's ruling should be halted for the duration of the appeals process. This pause provides the administration with some time to argue its case, although Trump officials have indicated they have alternative methods for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail. The initial ruling had destabilized a key aspect of Trump's economic agenda, and the administration views the legal challenge as a threat to presidential power. (not investment advice)</p>
