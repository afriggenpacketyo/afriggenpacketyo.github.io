        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record $16.3 billion in April, an 86% increase from March and more than double the amount from a year prior, according to the Treasury Department. This surge in revenue is attributed to President Trump's trade war policies, including the 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports initiated on April 2. While the U.S. continues to operate with a substantial budget deficit, the tariff influx helped to reduce the imbalance in April, a month typically seeing a surplus due to income tax filings. High interest rates continue to pose a significant budgetary challenge, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion for the month.</p>

          <p>According to President Trump, China has agreed to "open itself up to American business" following trade negotiations between Washington, D.C., and Beijing. Trump told reporters at the White House that the arrangement was arguably the most significant development stemming from the trade negotiations. Plans have yet to be finalized, but Trump said that China is on board with the agreement. He said that it would be fantastic for American businesses if they could compete with China, creating jobs for both countries. Other topics covered in the Fox News Politics newsletter include the release of American hostage Edan Alexander, Trump's defense of Qatar's jumbo jet offer, and a plunge in southern border apprehensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the announcement of a U.S.-China trade deal, retailers and logistics executives anticipate a surge in trade from China to the U.S. due to a 90-day pause on the steepest tariffs implemented by President Trump. While the details of the pact are still emerging, the suspension of reciprocal tariffs is expected to drive importers to move forward with shipments. However, reduced tariffs at 30% will still come amid expectations of rising costs in the supply chain as more companies look to frontload orders again. The uncertainty surrounding a permanent deal and the timing of holiday shipments will also contribute to increased front-loading, potentially leading to higher prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>Six Bulgarians have been sentenced to prison in the UK for operating a Russian spy ring, conducting "industrial-scale" surveillance on behalf of the Kremlin. The sentences range from just over five to nearly 12 years. The ringleader, Orlin Roussev, was sentenced to 10 years and eight months for posing a serious risk to Britain's national security. The spies operated across borders, surveilling journalists, dissidents, and Ukrainian soldiers being trained at a US military base in Germany. They were motivated by money and found spying for the Kremlin "exciting and glamorous."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ethics experts are raising concerns about the potential implications of the Trump administration accepting a luxury plane from the Qatari government, citing potential violations of the Constitution's Foreign Emoluments Clause. The clause forbids public office holders from accepting gifts from foreign states. The gift is especially concerning because of Trump's personal business dealings in Qatar, including a recent deal to build a luxury golf resort. Experts say the gift is unprecedented, as presidents typically receive gifts like cufflinks and bottles of wine, which are turned over to the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>A plane carrying White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport after the Trump administration granted them refugee status in the United States. The group, including families with children, was greeted by U.S. officials who cited "egregious discrimination" against them in South Africa, which the country's government denies. The Trump administration alleges that White South Africans, particularly Afrikaners, have faced discrimination, including through a controversial land seizure law. The South African government argues that the law respects private property rights and targets unused land. A refugee group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, declined to help resettle the South Africans, citing moral opposition.</p>

          <p>President Trump's potential acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar has ignited controversy over the legal and ethical implications of what would be the largest foreign gift ever received by the U.S. government.

          <p>Indian and Pakistani military leaders held talks to extend a cease-fire that has halted the most expansive fighting in decades between the two nuclear-armed states, a sense of normalcy began to return on both sides of their border. Stock markets in both countries jumped, and India announced the resumption of civilian flights at over 30 airports. President Trump said he threatened both nations with trade restrictions to push them to cease hostilities. Military leaders from both sides discussed troop reduction from the borders and forward areas.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South African refugees arrived in the U.S. under President Trump's executive order mandating they be prioritized for resettlement. The 59 Afrikaners underwent expedited reviews, were brought to the U.S. on a government-chartered flight, and were greeted by federal officials. Their admission has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies facing budget cuts. The Episcopal Church announced it would terminate its partnership with the government to resettle refugees, citing moral opposition to resettling white Afrikaners. Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said the action aligns with the administration's efforts to limit the broader refugee program and prioritize victims of racial persecution.</p>

          <p>China and the United States retreated from an emerging economic crisis, agreeing to reduce tariffs on one another for 90 days, providing welcome news for investors and retailers. The temporary truce will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%, starting Wednesday. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still hit American consumers in the coming weeks.

The Education Department can garnish up to 15% of a borrower's disposable pay, leaving them with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage per week. The Treasury Department will send notices to 5.3 million defaulted borrowers, and the administration will begin seizing portions of federal benefits, including Social Security retirement checks, as soon as June.

          <p>New images from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal Jupiter's dazzling auroras in unprecedented detail, showcasing their intensity, which is hundreds of times brighter than those seen on Earth. These auroras are triggered when high-energy particles from space collide with atoms of gas in the atmosphere near Jupiter's magnetic poles. Scientists analyzing the photos, taken on Christmas in 2023, observed the auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second. The images have also opened doors to new questions about the universe, as certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts.</p>

Cuomo still received $1.5 million in public matching funds. The board decided to withhold the funds because there was “reason to believe” that the television commercial was “not independent of the Cuomo campaign.”</p>

While the field is debated, graphologists assert that the way a person's letters slant or curve and the direction of their pen strokes can reveal a lot about anyone. Experts noted that the letters largely look the same, so it’s difficult to make out the individual characters in his signature, implying that he keeps the real him more private. The angles in his signature show that he’s analytical and intelligent, but it also signifies a sharpness and shortness.</p>
