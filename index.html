        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is reviewing President Trump's deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles to assist federal immigration authorities. The legal challenge questions whether the president exceeded his authority under Title 10, which outlines specific circumstances for federalizing the National Guard, such as invasion or rebellion. A lower court had ruled against the deployment, stating that protests against immigration raids did not constitute a rebellion. The Trump administration argues that courts should not second-guess the president's military judgments, while California officials claim the deployment infringes on the state's authority over its National Guard. Optimism surrounding the ruling is low as the potential consequences of the ruling could have far-reaching implications.</p>

          <p>Many Americans struggle with medical debt due to high healthcare costs, high deductibles, and unexpected bills. The article outlines several strategies for relief, including negotiating directly with healthcare providers for lower rates or payment plans, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care, and using a medical bill advocate to identify errors. Additionally, debt consolidation or debt management programs can help manage medical debt alongside other debts, and debt settlement is presented as a last resort, despite potential credit score damage. Taking action early and exploring all available options are emphasized for achieving a positive outcome when dealing with medical debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In 1989, Jeff Pelley was suspected of murdering his father, stepmother, and two stepsisters in Lakeville, Indiana, allegedly due to an argument over prom restrictions. Although initially lacking forensic evidence, the case was reopened in 2002, leading to Pelley's conviction in 2006 based on circumstantial evidence and timeline analysis. Prosecutors argued that Pelley committed the murders within a narrow window of time before attending prom, while the defense disputed the timeline and motive. Despite his conviction, Pelley's case continues to navigate through the courts, with ongoing appeals for post-conviction relief. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to decriminalize abortion for women in England and Wales, removing the threat of prosecution for ending their pregnancy. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill addresses the small percentage of abortions that occur after 24 weeks due to "desperate circumstances". While the new clause does not alter existing laws regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, it aims to provide care and support rather than criminalization for women in difficult situations. Campaigners and abortion providers have welcomed the decision, while groups opposing abortion rights have expressed concerns.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that the U.S. now has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran," a statement that contrasts with previous assertions that Israel's offensive against Iran was conducted without U.S. involvement. He also used threatening language about Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but stated that the U.S. was not planning to kill him, "at least not for now." Vice President JD Vance suggested that the president might take further action to end Iranian uranium enrichment, which has been a concern for the administration. The U.S. has been aiding Israel in defending against Iranian counterstrikes, but maintains that it is not involved in Israel's unilateral actions.</p>
