          <p>Republican and Democratic lawmakers are maneuvering ahead of a potential government shutdown, with both parties preparing separate interim spending bills. The Republican-led House plans to vote on a bill to extend funding through November 21, but it faces a difficult path as it requires near-unanimous GOP support to pass without Democratic assistance. Procedural hurdles in the Senate, including filibuster rules requiring 60 votes, create a significant logjam, making a swift resolution unlikely as the September 30 deadline approaches.

          <p>Shares of Cracker Barrel fell 10% in after-hours trading after the company reported mixed fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the upcoming year.

CEO Julie Masino acknowledged the customer feedback, stating the company has switched back to its classic logo and is refocusing on the guest experience. (not investment advice)</p>

Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, a group of over 50 unions and charities, the march featured signs with slogans opposing racism and Trump's policies. The protest, which moved from Portland Place towards Whitehall, reflects the significant public opposition to the U.S. president's visit and politics on the international stage.

          <p>A report from Bloomberg revealed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent once declared two separate homes in New York and Massachusetts as his "principal residence" on the same day in 2007. This situation is analogous to the allegations President Trump has used in his attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. Bessent's lender, Bank of America, stated it was aware the properties were secondary residences, and mortgage experts indicated no wrongdoing occurred in either Bessent's or Cook's case, highlighting complexities in mortgage paperwork.</p>

          <p>This article presents an analysis arguing that recent tax legislation, including the extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, has riddled the tax code with loopholes benefiting the ultra-wealthy and certain working-class professions. These changes, such as deductions for tipped income and pass-through businesses, create a system where families with similar incomes face vastly different tax bills. The author contends that this erodes the tax base, leaving salaried professionals as one of the last groups paying predictable taxes on their income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A formal state banquet was held at Windsor Castle to honor President Trump's visit, serving as a major diplomatic showpiece. The guest list was heavy on political figures and tech executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, but was notably missing Hollywood celebrities. President Trump was seated between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, at the head of a 47-meter-long dining table in St George's Hall for the elaborate, high-formality dinner.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill aimed at preventing the financial abuse of older adults is advancing in Congress. The Financial Exploitation Prevention Act would empower financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme targeting seniors or other vulnerable individuals. With elder financial abuse estimated to cost victims over $28 billion annually, the legislation seeks to provide new tools to protect this population from theft, which is often perpetrated by someone they know.</p>

          <p>Chrysler has issued a recall for 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025. The recall addresses an issue where trim pieces on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is moving, creating a potential road hazard for other drivers. The problem has been attributed to a vehicle assembly issue rather than a defective part, and dealers will inspect and replace the trim at no cost to owners.</p>

          <p>China's internet regulator has reportedly directed major tech companies, including Alibaba and ByteDance, to stop ordering a specialized high-end Nvidia GPU designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. This move, along with a recent anti-monopoly ruling against a past Nvidia acquisition, creates significant uncertainty for the chipmaker's business in China. The actions suggest Beijing may be gaining confidence in its homegrown chip alternatives or is using Nvidia as a bargaining chip in ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions.

          <p>Dozens of Israeli tanks and military vehicles have pushed into Sheikh Radwan, a major and densely populated residential district of Gaza City, as part of a new ground offensive. The advance, which followed intense preparatory airstrikes, has triggered another mass displacement of residents fleeing south. Israel states the operation's goal is to defeat Hamas in its "last stronghold," but the offensive in a crowded urban area has drawn widespread condemnation from international aid agencies due to the severe humanitarian impact.</p>

          <p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, presented an optimistic view on the global trade disruptions caused by U.S. tariffs. She characterized the challenges as a unique opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new wave of "reglobalisation." Despite widespread predictions of the WTO's decline amid escalating trade battles, she emphasized that the majority of global commerce continues to operate under its rules, arguing that the system is adapting rather than collapsing.</p>
