          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted on federal charges of bank fraud and making false statements, an action that follows public demands from President Trump for the Justice Department to prosecute his political adversaries. The charges relate to a 2023 home purchase, though career prosecutors had previously found no clear evidence of wrongdoing. James has condemned the indictment as a baseless act of political retribution and a weaponization of the justice system, highlighting the president's own statements as evidence of his motive. The case raises significant concerns about the politicization of federal law enforcement agencies.</p>

          <p>The second episode of 'Celebrity Traitors' focused on the escalating suspicion surrounding contestant Kate Garraway, whose behavior was perceived by fellow players and viewers as overly dramatic. Olympic diver Tom Daley was notably skeptical, openly expressing his distrust through pointed reactions. Despite the accusations, Garraway defended her actions at the roundtable by stating she is simply a "massive ham." Meanwhile, Alan Carr, revealed as a Traitor in the first episode, continued to struggle with maintaining his composure while carrying out his deceptive role in the competition, adding to the show's tension and entertainment.</p>

          <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has opened a formal investigation into nearly 2.9 million Tesla vehicles equipped with the Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. The probe follows numerous reports of safety violations, including running red lights and improper lane changes, which have allegedly led to over a dozen crashes and 23 injuries. This inquiry adds to the growing regulatory scrutiny over the safety and marketing of Tesla's automated driving technologies. The investigation's outcome could have significant implications for the company and the future of autonomous vehicle regulation in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump has brokered the first phase of a peace deal between Israel and Hamas, which includes the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners and a partial Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. This achievement offers Trump a potential legacy as a peacemaker but is fraught with peril, as historical ceasefires in the region have often been fragile and short-lived. The deal was reportedly secured with unofficial but critical assistance from Jared Kushner, who leveraged relationships built during the Abraham Accords.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group (UMG) over Kendrick Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the track's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted opinion and were part of the long-standing rap battle between the two artists. Drake's lawsuit had alleged that UMG, the parent label for both artists, had damaged his reputation and brand by promoting the song. UMG expressed satisfaction with the dismissal, stating the suit was an "affront to all artists and their creative expression."</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests President Trump's recent Gaza ceasefire deal was achieved through a unique diplomatic style that differed significantly from his predecessor's. The breakthrough was reportedly catalyzed by an Israeli airstrike in Qatar, which prompted Trump to exert maximum pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu, leveraging their close but complex relationship. Trump's extensive business ties and diplomatic history with Gulf states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia were also crucial in securing Arab backing and convincing Hamas to agree to the terms. This combination of personal relationships and unorthodox tactics allowed Trump to succeed where previous efforts had stalled.</p>

He suggests that this "affective history," or feeling a connection to the past, empowers residents to engage politically and make better choices for their community. His work aims to help people fall in love with the imperfect but real Los Angeles.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Rare Earth Mining Stocks Surge After China Imposes New Export Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of U.S. companies involved in rare earth and critical mineral mining experienced a significant surge after China announced tighter restrictions on the export of these materials. The new rules require licenses for exporting products containing even small amounts of rare earths, a move seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will accelerate investments in domestic supply chains to reduce U.S. dependency on China. The action underscores the ongoing trade tensions and highlights the strategic importance of these materials for national and economic security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai has won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature for his distinct and challenging body of work. Known for his long, labyrinthine sentences and themes of existential dread and political oppression, Krasznahorkai's writing defies easy categorization but has garnered a global cult following. His novels, such as 'The Melancholy of Resistance,' explore social dysfunction and anomie in a way that transcends their specific historical context of Cold War-era Hungary. The Nobel committee's choice recognizes an author whose experimental style powerfully conveys a timeless and universal sense of alienation and resilience.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old man, previously arrested on terrorism charges related to the deadly attack at a Manchester synagogue, has been re-arrested at the city's airport. The new charge is for failing to disclose information that could have helped prevent an act of terrorism. The original attack, carried out by Jihad Al-Shamie, resulted in the deaths of two people before the attacker was shot and killed by police. Authorities have stated that the man has since been released on bail with conditions and that they do not believe there is an ongoing threat to the public.</p>

          <p>The sister of Haverhill police officer Katelyn Tully, who died suddenly, is calling for more transparency from the police department as its chief takes a leave of absence amid multiple controversies. Amanda Tully criticized Chief Alan Pistone for what she described as a heartless and delayed response following her sister's death. The department is already under scrutiny for the in-custody death of Francis Gigliotti, an incident where Officer Tully had reportedly administered CPR. The convergence of these events has led to a letter from officers' families criticizing the chief's leadership and raising questions about the department's internal state.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day ever after the luxury automaker announced disappointing financial guidance and scaled back its ambitions for electric vehicle sales. The company now projects that fully electric vehicles will make up only 20% of its lineup by 2030, a significant reduction from its previous 40% target, citing a client-centric approach and market conditions. The updated revenue and profit forecasts for 2030 also fell short of analyst expectations, causing a sharp sell-off of its shares on both the Milan and New York stock exchanges.

This dual approach highlights the complex and often contradictory nature of the administration's trade policy with Beijing. Trump recalled his past practice of frequently calling Xi to ensure China adhered to its commitments to buy American agricultural products, indicating that this remains a key priority for him.</p>
