          <p>Anthony Albanese has won a second consecutive term as Australia's Prime Minister, marking a historic win for the Labor Party. Despite facing a cost-of-living crisis and changing demographics, Albanese's government improved relations with China, removing trade barriers.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his re-election, emphasizing the enduring alliance and shared values between the two nations. The central bank reduced its benchmark cash interest rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1% in an indication that the worst of the financial hardship had passed.</p>

          <p>In Oakdale, California, residents have shifted from traditional media to online sources, leading to concerns about misinformation and trust.

The New York Times article examines how residents navigate this post-journalism world, with many feeling less informed than before. The town is still able to support a weekly newspaper called The Oakdale Leader, which shares a handful of reporters with nine other local newspapers in the Central Valley.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Tamilore Odunsi, a British nursing student studying in Texas, was found stabbed to death in her apartment just days before her graduation. Police discovered her body after a welfare check. A man was found in another room with stab wounds and was taken to the hospital in critical condition. An online fundraiser has been set up to repatriate her remains to the UK for burial, and has gathered more than £44,000 ($58,000).</p>

          <p>Two commercial jetliners had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter violating safety standards. This incident occurred months after a mid-air collision near the airport between a Black Hawk and a passenger jet that killed 67 people. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called the incident unacceptable and emphasized that safety must always come first. Restrictions were placed on helicopter flights near the airport after the January collision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially raising prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs follow earlier levies on imported cars, aiming to promote domestic manufacturing. However, even cars made in the U.S. often use imported components. The tariffs will not apply to parts from Canada or Mexico that meet North American trade agreement requirements. The move is expected to shrink the supply of less expensive vehicles and create challenges for automakers and suppliers.</p>
