          <p>Kroger's shares experienced a significant increase as the company reported a rise in shoppers seeking lower prices and cooking more at home, leading to an improved sales outlook for the year. The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, driven by growth in pharmacy, e-commerce, and fresh groceries. To cater to value-minded shoppers, Kroger is simplifying promotions, reducing prices on over 2,000 products, and emphasizing its private brands, which have seen faster growth than national brands for seven consecutive quarters. The company is also focusing on modernizing its business and improving the profitability of its e-commerce operations, while planning to open new locations in high-growth areas after closing approximately 60 underperforming stores. Optimism surrounds Kroger's ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences and maintain its competitive edge in the grocery market.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament has approved a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their own lives, marking a significant step towards social change. The bill, which passed by a narrow margin, will now move to the House of Lords for further consideration, where it is expected to face scrutiny and potential amendments. Supporters of the bill emphasize the importance of providing terminally ill individuals with the autonomy to make decisions about their end-of-life care, while critics raise concerns about potential coercion and the protection of vulnerable individuals. The implementation of the bill could take several years, and its passage through the House of Lords is not guaranteed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS Offer in Compromise (OIC) program allows eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt for a reduced amount, providing a potential pathway to financial relief. Eligibility is based on the taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, with the IRS using a specific formula to calculate the reasonable collection potential. Applying for an OIC requires substantial paperwork, including detailed financial statements and documentation, and the review process can take several months. While the OIC can be a life-changing option for those who genuinely cannot pay their full tax debt, it is not available to everyone, and the IRS accepts less than half of all applications.

          <p>Credit card interest rates are continuing to increase despite the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, reaching the highest levels since December. This trend is attributed to card issuers mitigating their exposure against potential borrower defaults and consumers seeking new credit amid economic uncertainty. While the Fed cut its key borrowing rate benchmark three times in 2024 and has held its benchmark steady since December, banks continued to raise credit card interest rates to record levels, higher APRs primarily affect consumers who carry a balance from month to month. Experts suggest that even an eventual Fed rate cut may not provide significant relief from high interest charges, emphasizing the importance of managing credit card debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Securing low student loan rates for the fall 2025 semester requires careful planning and comparison shopping, starting with maximizing federal loan options before exploring private lenders. Federal undergraduate loan rates are decreasing to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 school year, but private lenders may offer more competitive rates, especially for borrowers with good credit or a creditworthy cosigner. Optimizing your credit profile, using a cosigner if possible, and taking advantage of rate discounts and incentives can further reduce borrowing costs. Considering shorter repayment terms can also lead to lower rates, but it's crucial to balance this with affordability.</p>

The plan seeks to cut review times to one to two months by allowing companies to submit the majority of a drug application before final clinical trial results are available. This initiative is designed for companies aligned with national health priorities, such as addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While the plan aims to accelerate the availability of important treatments, concerns remain about the potential risks of speeding up drug reviews and the possibility of political influence in voucher allocation.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers in the House of Commons have voted to pass a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives, following hours of impassioned debate. The bill, which passed by a narrow margin, will now undergo scrutiny by the House of Lords, the upper chamber of Britain's Parliament. The central tenet of the bill is that adults over 18 with less than six months to live could be provided assistance to end their lives, in the form of fatal drugs that they could self-administer, after a series of safeguarding checks. Opponents argue that elderly or disabled people could be manipulated into ending their lives, while supporters emphasize the importance of individual autonomy and choice.</p>

While gold has seen significant gains, silver's lower entry price point makes it an attractive option for a wider range of investors. Silver offers similar benefits as gold, including hedging against inflation and diversifying a portfolio, but at a more affordable cost. Investors should ideally have a mix of precious metals in their portfolio, with silver being a valuable addition for those looking to diversify affordably. (not investment advice)</p>

The court sided with oil and gas companies and Republican-led states, arguing that California's waiver to set tougher standards caused financial harm. While the ruling does not immediately end California's standards, it opens the door for legal challenges that could impact the state's efforts to promote cleaner cars. Environmentalists and California's Democratic leadership have defended the waiver, arguing that it has helped push forward vehicle innovation and reduce greenhouse gases.</p>

          <h2>Assisted Dying: The Heat and Emotion of Today's Significant Vote</h2>

          <p>Today's vote is hugely significant, it now looks highly likely that assisted dying will be introduced in England and Wales. The vote by MPs to approve Kim Leadbeater's bill is arguably the biggest vote regarding bodily autonomy since the legalisation of abortion in Great Britain in 1967. The Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill will now go to the Lords, where it is likely to spend several months undergoing the same line-by-line scrutiny that it did before MPs. There was emotion too. Some carried photos of loved ones who died in pain, while others expressed their fears for the vulnerable in society.</p>
