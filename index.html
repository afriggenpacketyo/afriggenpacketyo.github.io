Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson also expressed "grave concerns," warning that such an "unlawful deployment" could escalate tensions and undermine crime reduction efforts.

          <p>Pierce Brosnan, starring in the film adaptation of Richard Osman's best-selling 'Thursday Murder Club' series, expressed a "huge responsibility" towards the books' millions of fans. Brosnan portrays Ron, an amateur sleuth, alongside Helen Mirren, Celia Imrie, and Ben Kingsley. Directed by Chris Columbus and involving Steven Spielberg's production company, the film has received mixed critical reviews, with some praising its charm and others criticizing its narrative flimsiness. The movie will have a limited cinematic release before streaming on Netflix, a decision Dame Helen Mirren found disappointing.</p>

          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its tenth anniversary, a debate continues over its effectiveness in driving political change. While some historical petitions led to significant civil rights advances, modern campaigns often include humorous or satirical calls. The system allows petitions with over 100,000 signatures to be debated by MPs, with 'Finn's Law' for police dogs being a notable success that swiftly led to legislative change. However, many petitions, including those with millions of signatures, have not resulted in immediate policy shifts, leading some to criticize the system as an "illusion of a feedback loop" that fails to deliver.</p>
