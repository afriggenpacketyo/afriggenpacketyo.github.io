          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce have announced their engagement, sharing heartwarming photos of the proposal set in a rose-filled garden. The couple, who began dating in 2023 after Kelce's public attempt to meet Swift, revealed their news via a joint Instagram post, humorously captioning it, "Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married." Swift also playfully credited Kelce's "New Heights" podcast for their relationship, acknowledging his initial public overtures. Their engagement post features Swift's song "So High School," which fans believe is about Kelce, marking a significant milestone in their highly publicized romance.</p>

A fourth person, a man in his 30s, survived and is in stable condition.

          <h2>Eli Lilly's Oral Weight Loss Drug Orforglipron Nears Approval After Successful Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 14:20:47 EDT</div>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully met its primary goal in a late-stage trial for patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, paving the way for global approval. The oral GLP-1 treatment helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their body weight over 72 weeks and significantly lowered blood sugar levels, with most no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. While existing injections offer greater weight loss, this needle-free option, which requires no dietary restrictions, could expand access and convenience for millions. The company anticipates a global launch around next year, despite some patients discontinuing due to gastrointestinal side effects.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account, offering insights for savers seeking to grow their money safely. While CDs provide fixed interest rates and predictable returns over a set term, high-yield savings accounts feature variable rates that can fluctuate with market conditions. The analysis shows that depending on the term length, either option could yield slightly more interest, but CDs offer guaranteed earnings, appealing to those who prioritize stability over potential rate changes. Savers are advised to carefully calculate potential earnings and consider their liquidity needs before committing to a choice (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>An Italian masterpiece, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, stolen by Nazis from a Jewish art dealer 80 years ago, has been located in an Argentine estate agent advertisement. The painting was photographed hanging in a house near Buenos Aires once owned by a senior Nazi official who fled to South America after World War II. The artwork, part of over 1,100 pieces looted from dealer Jacques Goudstikker, was traced when the official's daughter put the property up for sale. Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate are now working to reclaim the painting, highlighting ongoing efforts to recover art plundered during the Holocaust.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intent to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, accusing her of mortgage fraud, a claim Cook and her attorney vehemently deny. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, stated she has "no intention of being bullied" and plans to file a lawsuit, arguing Trump lacks the legal authority to fire her "for cause" as required by federal law. This move is seen as a significant test of presidential power over the independent central bank, which Trump has criticized for its interest rate policies. The legal battle could set a precedent for the Fed's autonomy and its ability to make independent monetary policy decisions.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian forces have acknowledged that Russian military units have crossed into the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, attempting to establish a foothold, though their advance has reportedly been halted. This marks the first large-scale attack in the region, a significant blow to Ukrainian morale as Russia pushes deeper from Donetsk. While Moscow has not claimed Dnipropetrovsk, unlike other eastern regions, any sustained presence would threaten Ukraine's second-largest heavy industry center. The development comes amidst flagging US-led diplomatic efforts for peace, with President Trump meeting Vladimir Putin, but hopes for a breakthrough have dimmed, as Russia insists on non-starters for the West.</p>

Factors contributing to these losses include declining sales, intense competition from China, the costly transition to electric vehicles, and US tariffs.

          <p>Wall Street giants BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are pioneering efforts to introduce alternative assets, such as private equity and private credit, to individual investors' 401(k) retirement accounts. This move, partly enabled by a recent executive order, aims to democratize access to investments traditionally reserved for the ultra-wealthy, potentially offering enhanced diversification and amplified returns over the long term. However, experts caution that these illiquid and complex assets carry higher risks, emphasizing the need for investors with longer time horizons and a thorough understanding of their risk tolerance. The initiative is also poised to generate significant recurring revenue for these firms through management fees (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite the S&P 500 index's strong performance in 2025, investment experts are cautioning against a concentrated strategy due to the market's narrow growth, heavily reliant on a few technology giants. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks accounted for 26% of the S&P 500's earnings growth, with the top 10 holdings representing approximately 40% of the index. Advisors recommend diversifying into other sectors, international markets, and smaller-cap stocks, or considering equal-weight indices, to mitigate risks associated with this concentration. The article highlights that while long-term index investing remains valid, frequent account checking makes a "set-it-and-forget-it" approach challenging for most investors (not investment advice).</p>

These interdictions occurred in international waters across the eastern Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea over a four-month period. Officials emphasized that the 23 million potential lethal doses of cocaine seized underscore the immense threat posed by transnational drug trafficking to the nation.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign sparked public outcry and a nearly $100 million drop in company value, prompting the restaurant chain to admit it "could've done a better job." Brand experts attribute the backlash to the removal of the iconic "Uncle Herschel" figure and barrel from the logo, which customers viewed as abandoning the brand's cherished folksy, "homestyle country cooking" identity. The incident highlights the emotional investment stakeholders have in legacy brands and the perils of changing core branding elements without adequately honoring that legacy. The company's growth has slowed, leading to a desire for modernization, but this attempt misjudged customer sentiment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has significantly altered the national immigration debate, particularly concerning illegal migration. Government sources suggest Reform has outmaneuvered both Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties in gaining public attention, partly due to Farage's summer crime campaign and the unveiling of their bold illegal immigration strategy. The party's rise in polls, coupled with public anxiety over small boat crossings, has pushed immigration to a top voter issue. Reform's radical proposals, including potentially leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, are seen as driving a more extreme policy discussion, even as questions remain about the practicality and ethical implications of their plans.</p>
