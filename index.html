          <p>The Trump administration is trimming and restructuring the National Security Council, according to sources, weeks after Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. The changes involve reassigning some staff within the administration and placing others on administrative leave. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser Andy Baker is taking a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser. Some former members expressed concern that fewer people would mean less control, while others pointed to the NSC's track record as strained. The restructuring comes after recent staff firings and a perception that Waltz didn't vet staff enough.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have left the firm to start their own law firm.

          <p>Stocks fell on Friday after President Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Apple and the European Union, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all experiencing losses. Trump's threats included a potential 25% tariff on iPhones produced abroad and a "straight 50% Tariff" on the European Union. Analysts predict continued market volatility, especially with upcoming tariff developments. Rising debt and ongoing tariff policies are creating different realities for the equity and bond markets, with the bond market showing more concern about trade tensions and budget deficits.

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant cuts to the White House National Security Council, dismissing dozens of policy experts with the goal of streamlining bureaucracy and eliminating duplication. The NSC's role has diminished, with Trump relying more on cabinet members for foreign policy decisions. The cuts will leave the NSC at approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term. Robert O'Brien, Trump's former national security adviser, had advocated for streamlining the NSC to improve efficiency.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the manhunt for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited debate, with authorities crediting the technology for helping recapture one fugitive. Despite the police department pausing automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A., a private organization operating the cameras, their system was used in the search. Critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise constitutional and privacy concerns about live facial recognition. Project N.O.L.A. operates 200 facial recognition cameras and 5,000 total cameras in New Orleans.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acting as the national security adviser, has revealed a major restructuring of the National Security Council, reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. Andy Baker, Vice President Vanceâ€™s national security adviser, will serve as deputy alongside Robert Gabriel. The downsizing aligns with President Trumpâ€™s preference for top-down foreign policy debates and reflects his distrust of the NSC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to human influence by evolving changes in their beak size and shape due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, and males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbird range has also expanded northward, following the increasing popularity of bird feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. This demonstrates how quickly evolution can occur in response to human activities.</p>
