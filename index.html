          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by masked ICE agents at a federal immigration court while observing proceedings. According to Lander's office, he was taken into custody while escorting individuals out of court to prevent their arrest by ICE, with video footage showing him being handcuffed. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson stated that Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, while Lander claimed the agents lacked the authority to arrest U.S. citizens without a judicial warrant. Following his release, Lander criticized the treatment of undocumented immigrants and accused Donald Trump of targeting Democratic cities to provoke conflict, with Governor Kathy Hochul condemning the arrest as a "sorry day for New York and our country."</p>

          <p>Virginia Democrats have chosen Chris Jones as their attorney general nominee to compete against Republican Jason Miyares in November's election. The Democratic primary for lieutenant governor remains undecided, while Abigail Spanberger will run for governor against Winsome Earle-Sears. Virginia's elections, held the year after a presidential election, are viewed as indicators of voter sentiment before midterm elections, with analysts closely watching for signals regarding President Trump's influence. While Democrats have historically held a strong position in Virginia, recent elections suggest a shift towards swing-state status, although the party of the sitting president typically faces challenges in Virginia's statewide races.</p>

Additionally, the plan focuses on cross-border settlements and the use of the digital yuan, with Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po emphasizing the plan's role in supporting the "go global" drive by mainland companies.

          <p>President Trump's contemplation of joining Israel in strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities has exposed a bitter split among his supporters. While Trump campaigned on ending "stupid endless wars," he also insisted Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons, leading to divisions between isolationist and hawkish factions within the Republican party. Conservative Republican Congressman Thomas Massie joined Democrats in introducing a bill to block unauthorized hostilities with Iran, while figures like Tucker Carlson criticized Republican "warmongers." This internal conflict highlights the challenges Trump faces in balancing his campaign promises with geopolitical realities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals applying for new passports, renewing expired ones, or changing their name or gender designation can choose the gender they identify with, including selecting "X" on the application form. This ruling expands on a previous decision and is in response to a lawsuit filed by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs who claimed the policy was discriminatory. The White House has criticized the ruling, while the Justice Department has appealed Kobick's previous decision, and the State Department has declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering joining Israel in strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, with the subterranean uranium enrichment site at Fordo being a potential target. Fordo is heavily fortified and believed to be critical to Iran's nuclear program, though a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year stated that Iran is not currently building nuclear weapons. The issue was discussed in a meeting with Trump's national security team, with differing opinions among his advisors on how to proceed. While the Trump administration has publicly stated the U.S. is not involved in Israel's offensive, Trump's recent social media posts have raised questions about the extent of U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan asserts that President Trump's leadership has resulted in the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which he claims released the "vast majority" of encountered illegal immigrants into the U.S., while under Trump, none were released. He advocates for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to complete the job and initiate a large-scale deportation operation. Homan's statements highlight a trend of decreased illegal immigration under Trump's policies, attributing it to stricter border enforcement measures.</p>

Judges indicated they might have limited power to rule against the president's authority to deploy troops, with the government arguing Trump acted within his discretion due to violent riots. California's attorney argued the deployment was unlawful and diverted guardsmen from critical work, while the judges seemed skeptical of Congress's requirement for gubernatorial consultation.

          <p>The Defense Department has announced the deployment of an additional 2,000 California National Guard troops to Los Angeles amid the Trump administration's ongoing immigration crackdown. These troops will support the protection of federal functions, personnel, and property in the area. This deployment comes in addition to the existing 4,100 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines already in L.A., and they will undergo training in de-escalation and crowd control before joining the federal protection mission. Local and state officials have criticized the move, arguing that it inflames tensions and that local law enforcement can manage the protests.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials indicate that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible or if President Trump might resort to military action. Despite apparent saber-rattling, U.S. negotiators assess that Iran is in a weak position and could be forced to negotiate a deal to abandon nuclear enrichment. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, positioning itself defensively while keeping options open for assisting Israel in its ongoing offensive. A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying bunker-buster bombs.</p>

Some experts suggest that certain parts of Europe may become too hot for summer tourism in the future, leading to shifts in travel patterns. Resorts are adapting by offering evening markets and indoor activities, while staycations and travel to less traditional destinations like Scandinavia are becoming more popular.</p>
