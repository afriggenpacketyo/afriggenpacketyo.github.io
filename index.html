          <p>A small clinic in Buffalo, New York, is demonstrating remarkable success in treating Hepatitis C, a disease affecting millions of Americans. By using a faster, more accessible single-visit model, the La Bodega clinic has achieved a 98% cure rate among its more than 7,000 patients. This success, aided by new FDA-approved testing and lower drug costs, has made the clinic a national model. Lawmakers are now considering a bipartisan bill to fund a national plan to eliminate the disease, which could save the government billions in long-term medical costs.</p>

          <p>An NTSB investigative hearing into a fatal midair collision over Washington, D.C., highlighted several critical safety failures. Key takeaways revealed the Army helicopter's altimeter may have been off by over 100 feet, and its pilots missed a key command from air traffic control to pass behind the passenger plane. Furthermore, transcripts showed the airliner's pilots were aware of the impending impact just seconds before it occurred. The FAA also acknowledged that its air traffic controller failed to warn the plane about the helicopter's proximity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of a significant slowdown as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, well below economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, and the Labor Department issued sharp downward revisions for May and June, reducing previous job growth estimates by a combined 258,000. Analysts suggest the soft numbers reflect the economic impact of new trade tariffs, increasing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve may consider cutting interest rates in September.

          <p>A new form of psychological trauma, dubbed 'droneophobia,' is affecting Ukrainian soldiers returning from the front lines. The constant, high-pitched whine of FPV drones used in combat has led to acute stress disorders, where everyday mechanical sounds like lawnmowers or air conditioners can trigger intense panic. Psychiatrists report that this auditory-based trauma is a growing mental health injury from the drone-driven phase of the war. The article highlights how this constant threat has transformed the psychological landscape of the conflict for soldiers.</p>

The Granite County Sheriff's Office has identified 45-year-old Michael Paul Brown as the suspect, who is considered armed and dangerous. He was last seen driving a white Ford F-150 pickup truck. Law enforcement, including a SWAT team, has cleared the suspect's house, but he remains at large as the investigation into the motive continues.</p>

          <p>Following the release of a weak July jobs report, President Trump ordered the firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer. The president claimed, without evidence, that the data was being manipulated for political purposes and that the numbers were inaccurate. The move drew immediate criticism from economists and some lawmakers, who warned that politicizing the nation's trusted economic data collection could shake markets and undermine the integrity of federal agencies. The dismissal is seen as a highly unusual step.</p>

          <p>In a late-night session, the U.S. Senate successfully advanced a package of spending bills, breaking a partisan stalemate and taking a crucial step toward avoiding a government shutdown. The passage marks the first time since 2018 that the chamber has passed appropriations bills before September. The package, which includes funding for Veterans' Affairs and agriculture, was a victory for Senate leadership from both parties. However, the bills now head to the House, where they face opposition from Republicans over spending levels.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for tens of thousands of individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the terminations were "preordained" and potentially "motivated by racial animus," citing controversial statements made by the president.</p>

          <p>In a unique act of revenge, an Ohio woman whose car was repossessed discovered the dealership had allowed its business name registration to lapse and promptly registered it under her own name. She then sent the dealer a cease-and-desist letter and sued them for fraud. An appeals court recently ruled that her claim over the trade name is a separate issue from the car purchase and can proceed in court. The case highlights a creative use of public records by a scorned customer.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Florida has found Tesla partly liable in a wrongful death lawsuit concerning a 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. The jury determined that defects in the self-driving technology contributed to the death of a 22-year-old woman and awarded her family over $240 million in compensatory and punitive damages. Plaintiffs' lawyers argued that Tesla misrepresented Autopilot's capabilities, turning roads into test tracks.

During a hearing, judges sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows rulings from another federal appeals court and multiple lower courts that have already blocked the hardline immigration policy from taking effect, setting up a likely Supreme Court battle.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has announced her resignation, creating a vacancy on the central bank's influential Board of Governors. Her departure, effective this fall, gives President Trump the opportunity to nominate a new member to the committee that sets national interest rates.

The opening comes at a time when the president has been publicly pressuring the Fed to lower rates.</p>
