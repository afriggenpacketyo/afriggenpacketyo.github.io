          <p>A tour bus returning from Niagara Falls overturned on Interstate 90 in Upstate New York, resulting in at least four fatalities and dozens of injuries. The vehicle, carrying over 50 people, including one child among the deceased, lost control and ended up in a ditch near Pembroke. Emergency services, including medical helicopters, responded to the serious mass casualty incident, with most passengers identified as Indian, Chinese, or Filipino. New York State Police are investigating the cause of the crash, which did not involve other vehicles.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted for the 1989 murders of his parents, was denied parole by California officials, with the decision primarily based on his behavior in prison rather than the original crime. Parole Commissioner Robert Barton cited Menendez's involvement in fights, drug use, and repeated illicit use of a mobile phone as reasons for the denial. Despite support from numerous relatives and his efforts in prison programs, the board deemed him unsuitable for release. His brother, Lyle, has a separate parole hearing scheduled.</p>

          <p>Ether's price surged, nearing its record high, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's comments on the shifting balance of risks and a possible September rate cut caught many traders off-guard, leading to significant short liquidations in the crypto market. This dovish stance from the Fed, signaling alignment on easing policies, prompted a panicked repositioning among investors. Companies focused on accumulating ether also saw their shares rebound, indicating a renewed market momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A San Bernardino man was arrested on suspicion of molestation after allegedly posing as an animal control officer to lure an 11-year-old girl into his van. Guillermo Cascante reportedly approached the girl, who was searching for her missing dog, in an 'ambulance-style' vehicle. Once inside, he allegedly threatened her with a handgun and sexually assaulted her before dropping her off. Authorities believe there may be other victims and have released photos of Cascante and his vehicle to the public.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to secure comprehensive coverage for its games. NBC is expected to acquire Sunday games and Wild Card playoff games for approximately $200 million annually, while Netflix will secure rights to the Home Run Derby for about $50 million a year. ESPN will gain a new package worth $550 million, including the league's digital out-of-market package, in-market games for five local teams, and a mid-week national game package. These three-year deals will align major media rights to expire after the 2028 season, potentially opening future bidding wars.</p>

          <p>Antisemitic incidents in Germany have risen sharply since the October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks and the subsequent war in Gaza. Police figures indicate a 20% increase in attacks against Jews last year, with many in Berlin fearing to openly display their Jewish identity. This trend reflects growing tensions and divisions within the country. The increase in such incidents highlights concerns about social cohesion and the safety of Jewish communities in Germany.</p>

          <p>A German government spokesman stated that recognizing a Palestinian state now would be 'counterproductive' to efforts for a negotiated two-state solution with Israel. Berlin believes such recognition should come at the end of a peace process, not at the beginning. This position follows calls from countries like the UK, France, and Australia to recognize a Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly. Germany emphasizes that a negotiated solution remains its goal, even if it appears distant.</p>

These plans also include relocating Gaza City's residents, a move humanitarian organizations deem unfeasible due to widespread destruction and lack of infrastructure elsewhere in the enclave.

This guidance, consistent with previous IRS interpretations and legislative intent, requires a payment, such as a nominal downpayment or trade-in, before the deadline.

          <p>The summer of 2025 has been characterized as the 'exhausting summer of nothing,' lacking a unifying cultural theme despite numerous attempts to create one. Unlike previous themed summers, a pervasive apathy and burnout have dominated, preventing any single song or trend from truly taking hold. Cultural commentary suggests that public discourse is increasingly fueled by disdain and quickly devolves into political culture wars, draining joy from shared experiences. This widespread exhaustion hints at a deeper societal numbness that extends beyond the summer season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>'Splitsville,' directed by and co-starring Michael Angelo Covino alongside Kyle Marvin, attempts to satirize modern marriage and male friendship but ultimately falls short. The film, which follows a couple navigating divorce and an open relationship with friends, is criticized for its self-regard and prioritizing the male leads' antics over genuine comedic depth. While Dakota Johnson and Adria Arjona elevate the movie, their characters often feel like manipulated pieces. The film's centerpiece, an extended fight scene, is deemed outlandish and indicative of the movie's struggle to balance humor with meaning.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, have sued the state of Wisconsin, alleging its pro-fossil fuel policies violate their constitutional rights. The lawsuit targets two state laws that prevent the public service commission from considering air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring utilities to increase carbon-free electricity. Lead plaintiff Kaarina, 17, described relocating due to climate-exacerbated flooding, highlighting the personal toll of environmental degradation. The plaintiffs aim to have these laws declared unconstitutional, asserting the state's obligation to protect natural resources for future generations.</p>
