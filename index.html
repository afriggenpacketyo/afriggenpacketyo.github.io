          <h2>Arsene Wenger Proposes Offside Rule Change to Favor Attackers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 07:44:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, now at FIFA, suggests modifying the offside rule. The proposed change would deem an attacker onside if any part of their body aligns with the last defender, excluding hands and arms. Wenger believes this would restore an advantage to the attacker, which he feels has diminished due to VAR implementation. The current rule considers any part of the body beyond the last defender as offside, leading to frequent marginal calls. This adjustment aims to encourage more attacking play and reduce reliance on video technology for tight decisions.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariff Anchoring: How Big Threats Normalize Smaller Ones, Impacting Trade and Consumers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article analyzes President Trump's tariff strategy, suggesting he uses the 'anchoring' effect by proposing extremely high tariffs and then reducing them, making the remaining tariffs seem more acceptable. While investors initially panicked, they've grown accustomed to tariffs as a policy tool. However, the existing tariffs, including a 10% universal tariff on most imports and 25% on specific goods, still significantly impact consumers, who now face an average effective tariff rate of 28%, the highest since 1901. Some companies are absorbing the costs, while others are pausing investments and hiring, with small businesses particularly vulnerable.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan court sentenced four men, including two Belgians, to a year in prison or a $7,700 fine for attempting to smuggle thousands of live ants out of the country. The ants, including giant African harvester ants valued at up to Â£170 each, were destined for European and Asian markets. The court condemned the act as illegal wildlife trade and potential bio-piracy, emphasizing the need to protect all creatures. The Kenya Wildlife Service hailed the ruling as a testament to Kenya's zero-tolerance stance on wildlife trafficking, warning that the demand for rare insect species is growing.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is approaching its policy decision amidst economic uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs and mixed economic signals. The article indicates the Fed is likely to hold steady, awaiting further clarity on trade policies and their impact on inflation expectations. Market expectations suggest a low probability of an interest rate cut in the immediate future, with analysts divided on the timing and extent of potential rate reductions later in the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of interpreting conflicting data, including consumer pessimism and rising inflation expectations, while maintaining policy flexibility.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Diamondback Energy warns that U.S. onshore oil production has likely peaked and will decline due to falling crude prices. Adjusted for inflation, oil prices are at levels not seen since 2004, excluding the pandemic period, leading to cuts in activity levels. Recession fears driven by President Trump's tariffs are weighing on demand, while OPEC+ producers are increasing supply. This decline could jeopardize the nation's position as the world's largest fossil fuel producer and its energy security. U.S. crude oil prices rose following the report, reflecting expectations of declining domestic production.</p>

          <p>Despite negative economic news and concerns over the impact of tariffs, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Interest rates slightly decreased, but demand for conventional loans drove the increase, particularly among move-up buyers with larger loan sizes. Refinance applications also rose, driven by Veterans Affairs loans. The April housing market has been slow, with potential buyers hesitant due to economic uncertainty. The Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting could influence mortgage rates further, but no rate cuts are expected at this time.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the drugmaker projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, expecting a decline in the availability of compounded copycat drugs. The company reported first-quarter net profit that exceeded expectations, although Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst forecasts. The FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling, which previously allowed compounding pharmacies to produce copies of Wegovy and Ozempic, is expected to boost Novo Nordisk's sales. The company also plans to combat copycats by launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has become Germany's chancellor after a rocky start, failing to secure the necessary parliamentary support in the initial vote. He faces the challenge of addressing economic woes, including stagnating GDP growth and divisions over migration and defense spending. Despite a major fiscal package, questions remain about other economic policies and potential budget clashes. Trust within the ruling coalition, comprised of the CDU/CSU and SPD, is crucial for implementing economic reforms. The article notes the need for quick legislative action to address Germany's economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi defended the company's decision to increase in-office requirements and change employee benefits, stating 'it is a risk we decided to take'. Employees will now be required to work in the office three days a week, and eligibility for paid sabbaticals has been raised from five to eight years of service. Some employees previously approved for remote work will also be required to return to the office. Khosrowshahi stated that the changes were made to improve collaboration, innovation, and company culture. The changes have sparked tension between tech workers and management, as companies cut back on benefits and conduct layoffs.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to fund the development of three new nuclear sites through an agreement with Elementl Power. This is part of a growing trend of tech companies investing in nuclear energy to meet the high power demands of data centers. Google will provide early-stage development capital and has the option to purchase power generated by the sites, each with a capacity of at least 600 megawatts. The company is also collaborating with Kairos Power to purchase power from small modular reactors. The move reflects the increasing need for baseload power to support AI and other energy-intensive technologies.</p>

          <p>Disney reported strong fiscal second-quarter earnings, exceeding expectations due to better-than-anticipated subscriber growth for its Disney+ streaming platform. The company raised its fiscal 2025 guidance and reported revenue growth across all three business segments. Disney+ added 1.4 million subscribers, reaching a global base of 126 million. Revenue for the direct-to-consumer business rose 8%, driven by higher prices and increased subscriber numbers. The company expects a modest increase in subscribers in the current quarter.

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. Researchers from BGI-Research, Huazhong Agricultural University, and Yunnan University discovered that removing the HMGB1 gene in irrigated rice promotes longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This could enable rice to thrive in water-scarce environments, enhancing food security. The findings, published in Molecular Plant, highlight the potential to improve crop resilience in the face of climate change.</p>

          <p>A watchdog report reveals that the IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors due to budget cuts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The agency's workforce has decreased by over 11,000 employees, including a significant reduction in revenue agents who conduct audits. This decline comes as President Trump's budget request calls for further IRS budget cuts. The Treasury Department defends the reduced spending, citing cuts to the agency's IT budget. The IRS has processed more than 140 million returns during the 2025 filing season, slightly more than the previous year.</p>

They must convince their side that tariffs are valuable when applied rationally, despite the current administration's policies.
