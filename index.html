        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the anniversary of Labour's election victory, the government is attempting to deflect blame for current challenges onto the previous Conservative administration, a strategy that may have diminishing returns as Labour's own tenure lengthens. The government is highlighting the Chagos Islands deal and the sentencing review as examples of Conservative failures. One proposed idea is to explore mandatory chemical castration for sex offenders. The article also mentions upcoming net migration figures, data on asylum seeker housing, and public sector pay deals, as ministers seek to demonstrate their achievements amidst economic difficulties and declining poll numbers.</p>

The incident, which occurred at the Cheongjin shipyard, involved the vessel becoming stuck and tipping, causing damage.

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism regarding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued institutional interest. The price increase occurs despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially reflecting investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a previous bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The reconstructed roof of the Drum Tower in Fengyang County, China, partially collapsed, leading to an investigation into the quality of recent renovations. Videos showed tiles falling off the roof of the tower, which was originally built in 1375 during the Ming dynasty, though the current structure was rebuilt in 1995 and renovated last year. Questions have arisen regarding the quality and cost of the renovation, with some reports suggesting the 1995 reconstruction was unauthorized. The local government is investigating the cause of the collapse and defending the renovation's cost.</p>

          <p>A landmark review suggests violent prisoners, including those convicted of sexual assault and domestic abuse, could be released after serving only a third of their sentence to ease prison overcrowding. The Independent Sentencing Review recommends managing more offenders in the community and expanding a voluntary chemical castration pilot program. Former Lord Chancellor David Gauke, who chaired the review, stated that reducing sentences is 'the right thing to be doing'. The review also calls for short custodial sentences to be used only in exceptional circumstances and increased funding for the Probation Service.</p>

          <p>UK government borrowing was higher than expected in April, reaching Â£20.2bn, which is Â£1bn higher than April of the previous year. This figure marks the fourth-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Increased tax receipts, driven by higher National Insurance contributions, were offset by rising government expenditure due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs. Borrowing for the financial year ending in March is now estimated at Â£148.3bn, less than initially thought but still above the Office for Budget Responsibility's expectations.</p>

          <p>A South African lobbyist for white rights, Ernst Roets, has gained prominence by promoting the myth that white South Africans are victims of racism. This narrative has been embraced by Tucker Carlson and the Trump administration, which has offered refugee status to 'ethnic minority Afrikaners'. Despite claims of systematic discrimination, white South Africans still hold a significant portion of the country's wealth and land. The author argues that this narrative flips the reality of apartheid and undermines the progress made in South Africa's transition to democracy.</p>

          <p>The House voted to begin debating Republicans' sweeping domestic policy bill as party leaders attempt to unify their ranks and pass President Trump's agenda. Speaker Mike Johnson has been working to win over holdouts with concessions, but several GOP lawmakers remain dissatisfied with the tax and spending cut package. Democrats have denounced the measure as harmful, arguing it would benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs. The bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate, even if it passes the House.</p>

          <p>Russia's reluctance to engage in peace negotiations with Ukraine may eventually be overcome by increasing economic and military pressures at home. Despite potential new offensives, dwindling stockpiles of military equipment and the challenges of further forced mobilization could force Moscow to the negotiating table. While Russia can sustain its current approach for two more campaign seasons, continued operations into 2026 will require difficult political and economic decisions regarding recruitment. The Kremlin has been contacted for a response regarding these comments.</p>

The study highlights that the impact of climate change on mortality is significant, particularly in states like Oregon and California.

          <p>The Senate is expected to vote on revoking three vehicle emissions waivers in California, a move Democrats are calling 'the nuclear option.' These waivers allow California to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than federal regulations, including phasing out gas-powered cars by 2035. Republicans argue that the Congressional Review Act allows them to overturn the waivers, while Democrats contend the vote is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent. The outcome could impact cities and states nationwide that have adopted California's vehicle standards.</p>

Israel cut off power lines to main desalination plants in March, and although aid is now permitted, fuel is not included.
