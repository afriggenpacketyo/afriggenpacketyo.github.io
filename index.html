            <p>Dr. Kevin Hall, a leading NIH researcher on ultra-processed foods, resigned after accusing aides to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of censoring his research. Hall claims he was blocked from interviews and his written answers were edited without his consent after a study showed ultra-processed foods may not be addictive in the same way as drugs. An HHS spokesperson denies the censorship allegations, calling them a distortion of facts. Hall's departure marks the latest in a series of high-profile exits from the NIH and adds to the divide between Kennedy and federal scientists on key priorities.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another widespread power outage, leaving 1.4 million customers without electricity and prompting renewed criticism of the island's aging infrastructure.

LUMA Energy, the private power company responsible for transmission, estimates that restoring power to 90% of customers could take several days. The incident has intensified calls for infrastructure improvements and greater reliability in the island's power grid.</p>

            <p>Clayton Kershaw, Dodgers pitcher, made his first rehab start in triple-A Oklahoma City, throwing three scoreless innings as he recovers from offseason knee and foot surgery. Kershaw's fastball velocity was slightly down, but he reported feeling healthy and saw it as a positive step forward. His return will complicate the Dodgers' starting rotation, with several other pitchers also nearing a return from the injured list. The team is focused on ensuring Kershaw's toe, which underwent surgery, is progressing well.</p>

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could create a "challenging scenario" for the central bank, potentially leading to both higher inflation and slower economic growth. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and will likely have negative economic consequences. While the Fed is currently taking a patient approach, the potential for inflation and economic slowdown raises concerns about the future direction of monetary policy.

Experts say US authorities are not doing enough to stop the flow of guns, which fuels gang violence and instability in Haiti, where a record 5,601 people were killed in gang violence in 2024.</p>
