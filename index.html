          <p>A vehicle plowed into a crowd outside an East Hollywood nightclub, injuring 30 people, with at least three in critical condition. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the scene on Santa Monica Boulevard, where they also discovered one victim with a gunshot wound. The Los Angeles Police Department has launched a major investigation into the incident, which occurred in the early hours of Saturday morning. The circumstances leading to the vehicle ramming the crowd are still under review by authorities.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Wallabies 27-19 in a hard-fought opening Test match in Brisbane, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. The Lions established a dominant early lead, reaching 24-5 shortly after halftime with tries from Sione Tuipulotu, Tom Curry, and Dan Sheehan. However, Australia mounted a strong comeback in the latter part of the game, narrowing the score and making for a tense finish. Despite the victory, the Lions' post-game mood was reportedly subdued, reflecting confusion over how a seemingly comfortable win became a difficult grind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is under multiple yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms, with the Met Office cautioning about potential flash flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions across all four nations. While a more severe amber warning for London and the South East did not result in the feared intense downpours, the risk remains due to ground parched by a recent heatwave. Forecasters note that the dry ground is less able to absorb heavy rainfall, increasing the likelihood of sudden flooding. The unsettled weather is expected to continue into early next week.</p>

          <p>The article details the ongoing tension between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, primarily over interest rate policy. Trump has relentlessly criticized Powell for not lowering rates, which he believes would bolster the stock market, while the Fed has maintained higher rates to combat inflation, partly exacerbated by Trump's tariffs. The administration is reportedly exploring justifications for firing Powell, a move considered legally and constitutionally contentious. This conflict highlights a significant break from the historical precedent of presidential respect for the central bank's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A summer camp for individuals with disabilities in Centre Point, Texas, has reopened thanks to a massive volunteer cleanup effort following catastrophic floods that devastated the region. The camp, located along the Guadalupe River, suffered extensive damage, but a community response, sparked by a social media plea, brought hundreds of volunteers with supplies and machinery to restore the grounds. This effort occurred amidst the broader tragedy of the floods, which have claimed over 135 lives. The camp's reopening is seen as a symbol of hope and community resilience.</p>

Since the forum's inception in 2000, China-Africa trade has increased nearly thirtyfold, and Chinese investment has grown a hundredfold. This economic partnership has been paralleled by expanding military cooperation, with China now being a leading arms supplier to the continent and training thousands of African military officers annually.

          <p>Some federal student loan borrowers could see their monthly payments more than double as a Biden-era interest-free forbearance period for the SAVE plan is set to expire on August 1. The Trump administration announced the end of the relief, meaning interest will begin accruing again for the 7.7 million borrowers enrolled in the now-defunct SAVE plan. Many of these borrowers may need to switch to the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, which calculates payments based on 10-15% of discretionary income, compared to the more generous 5% used by SAVE.

          <p>More than 100 days into President Trump's sweeping tariff policies, economists are assessing their effects on the U.S. economy. Analysts note that the tariffs have generated significant tax revenue and prompted some companies to pledge new investments in U.S. manufacturing. However, they also caution that these corporate commitments are long-term and uncertain, while the tariffs have begun to increase consumer prices for some imported goods, risking inflation. The administration's fluctuating approach, including recent threats of tariffs up to 50% on key trading partners, adds a layer of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Portuguese police have stated they are not treating the deaths of two British men in an Albufeira hotel swimming pool as suspicious. King Edonmi, 29, and Mo Liasu, 27, both from Ipswich, drowned on Tuesday. Mr. Edonmi's sister claimed online that her brother, a non-drinker, died while attempting to save his best friend's life, refuting local reports that the men had been drinking. A fundraiser to repatriate their bodies has surpassed its £25,000 goal, and the families have expressed gratitude for the community's support during this tragic time.</p>

          <p>Leading end-of-life charities Marie Curie and Hospice UK are calling for local councils across the UK to exempt terminally ill individuals from paying council tax. The campaign follows a pioneering move by Manchester City Council, which recently became the first authority to introduce such a scheme for residents with a prognosis of less than 12 months to live. Advocates argue that the exemption provides crucial peace of mind and alleviates financial pressure at a time when incomes often drop and costs increase. The charities are pushing for a more standardized, compassionate policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion column responds to proposals in Europe and by President Trump to eliminate national holidays for economic reasons. The author argues that if the U.S. were to consider such a move, it should start with holidays that have racist or problematic origins, such as Thanksgiving, rather than Juneteenth. The article posits that Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery, represents one of the most significant economic and historical events in U.S. history. It criticizes Trump's suggestion to cut holidays, made on Juneteenth, as being politically motivated rather than economically driven.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have confirmed the first successful breeding of California red-legged frogs in Southern California in 25 years, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence. The threatened species had been reintroduced to the area using eggs from a population in Mexico's Baja Peninsula. After years of waiting for signs of breeding, scientists deployed an AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings from the habitat. The AI successfully detected the male frogs' mating calls, leading to the discovery of a new egg mass and marking a major milestone for the species.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to shoot 450,000 barred owls to protect the threatened spotted owl is facing significant opposition. An unusual coalition of Republican lawmakers and animal rights groups is challenging the cull, arguing it is inhumane, expensive, and unworkable. Recent federal actions, including the cancellation of related research grants, suggest the plan may be in jeopardy. Opponents are exploring a reversal through the Congressional Review Act, while supporters warn that failing to control the more aggressive barred owl population will lead to the extinction of the spotted owl.</p>

          <p>Recent deadly disasters, including the Texas floods and Los Angeles firestorms, are prompting meteorologists to question how to effectively communicate warnings to the public and officials. Despite forecasters issuing alerts days in advance, the scale of the devastation in both events suggests the warnings were not fully heeded, leading to what some call "forecaster regret." Experts point to issues like public complacency and optimism bias as reasons why alerts are sometimes ignored. The disconnect highlights a critical challenge in disaster preparedness: bridging the gap between a forecast and the necessary life-saving actions on the ground.</p>
