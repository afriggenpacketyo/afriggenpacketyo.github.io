          <p>Joseph Neumayer, a 28-year-old with U.S. and German citizenship, was apprehended at JFK Airport after being deported from Israel for allegedly attempting to firebomb the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. According to prosecutors, Neumayer spat at an embassy guard, left a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails outside the embassy, and posted threatening messages against President Trump on social media. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of attempting to destroy the embassy by means of fire or explosives, with authorities emphasizing their intolerance for such violence. The article details the charges against Neumayer and the statements from law enforcement officials condemning his actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kate Shaw, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that the Supreme Court is enabling President Trump to consolidate power within the executive branch. A recent Supreme Court order effectively overruled a nearly century-old precedent, granting the president considerable new authority to remove high-level officials. This decision, made without full briefing or argument, risks assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law. The author suggests that the court's actions undermine lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law and embolden the administration to act outside of traditional constitutional order.</p>

          <p>Despite the completion of a major prisoner exchange, Russia launched a massive barrage of drones and missiles targeting cities across Ukraine, resulting in at least 18 deaths and numerous injuries. Ukraine's air force reported that Russia launched a total of 367 "air attack vehicles," including ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and attack drones, with strikes reported in 22 locations. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks as deliberate strikes on ordinary cities and residential buildings, while Russia's Defense Ministry claimed the attacks targeted Ukraine's military-industrial complex. The U.S. brokered peace talks have so far failed to reach an accord, with both sides accusing each other of undermining negotiations.</p>

          <p>A longtime West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration’s changes to the academy, particularly objecting to the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Parsons criticized Trump for wearing a Make America Great Again hat and making cadets salute him in it, which he viewed as crossing a line. Parsons stated that the administration is telling professional scholars what areas of inquiry are legitimate, calling it a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education. The professor, who focused on military ethics, felt professionally betrayed as his research agenda was effectively banned.</p>

          <p>Despite a pledge to halt funding for fossil fuels, Japan remains a world leader in funding natural gas projects. Japanese public financial institutions provided $93 billion in investments for oil and gas projects between 2013 and 2024, with $56 billion allocated to overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. Japan's strategy involves securing access to LNG for domestic needs and reselling surplus LNG, shifting its role from consumer to exporter. Critics argue that Japan's promotion of LNG as a "transitional fuel" in its Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC) is a form of greenwashing, as LNG involves more emissions than coal when processing and shipping are considered.</p>

This approach emphasizes open communication, acceptance of emotions without judgment, and seeing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents prioritize self-awareness and inner healing to become less reactive, creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves.

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but also discussed his recent experience of having his truck repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and forgot to update his automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in three missed payments and the vehicle being taken. He discovered the repossession when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage, which revealed a tow truck taking his car. Paul was able to regain possession of the truck, finding humor in the situation.</p>

          <p>Fiscal hawks in the US Senate have warned President Trump that they will block his tax-cutting bill unless he addresses government spending and the national debt. Senator Ron Johnson stated that his faction has enough votes to halt the bill, which extends the 2017 tax cuts in exchange for benefit cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. Critics argue that the bill will add trillions to the federal deficit and cause millions to lose health coverage, leading to political challenges for Republicans facing elections. The non-partisan FactCheck.org disputes claims that undocumented migrants are receiving Medicaid, adding to the controversy.</p>

While recognizing opportunities in European markets, Cramer advises against a "sell America" trade and suggests a more selective approach, focusing on domestic companies with pricing power and low credit risk.

The attacks underscore the failure of cease-fire negotiations and the intensification of violence, with Ukrainian civilian deaths rising since February.
