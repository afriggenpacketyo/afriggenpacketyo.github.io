          <p>Following a disappointing performance in the Club World Cup, Los Angeles FC is looking to regain favor with its fans in a crucial rivalry match against the LA Galaxy. The team has since won three consecutive MLS games, but a victory against their crosstown rivals holds special significance. LAFC will be contending with key injuries, including defender Aaron Long who is out for the season, while the struggling Galaxy aims to upset them. The match is framed as a classic derby where current standings and form often become irrelevant due to the intense emotions and stakes involved.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, Deborah Mason, known as 'Gangsta Debbs,' has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating an £80 million cocaine trafficking operation. Mason recruited her four children and other family members into the sophisticated gang, which transported drugs from ports to various cities across the UK. The operation funded a lavish lifestyle, including designer accessories for her cat, while she simultaneously received state benefits. The judge described her as having a "leading role" and corrupting her children, who also received lengthy prison sentences for their involvement in the criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>The Syrian presidency has announced the deployment of a new force to address deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities in the country's south. The clashes have reportedly resulted in over 700 deaths, with government troops previously accused of extrajudicial killings of Druze civilians. Amid the escalating conflict, the US ambassador to Turkey reported that a ceasefire had been agreed upon by Israel and Syria, though neither country has publicly confirmed the deal. The UN has called for an end to the bloodshed, citing credible reports of widespread human rights abuses by multiple armed groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated heavyweight rematch, prominent figures in the boxing world are weighing in on whether Daniel Dubois can defeat Oleksandr Usyk. Dubois aims to become the first undisputed British heavyweight champion since 1999 by capturing Usyk's multiple world titles. While Usyk won their first encounter in 2023, Dubois has since won three consecutive fights and claimed the IBF title, showing significant improvement. Pundits are divided, with most favoring the highly skilled Usyk but acknowledging that Dubois's newfound confidence and power could lead to an upset if the aging champion shows any decline.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The innovative approach allows for the production of anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body, simplifying the complex and expensive conventional process. In a study published in The Lancet, the team reported successfully treating four patients with multiple myeloma, a common blood cancer. This breakthrough has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of the treatment, which currently exceeds one million yuan (approximately $139,200) per patient.</p>

          <p>Parts of the United Kingdom are under an amber weather warning as severe thunderstorms are expected to bring torrential rain and dangerous flash flooding over the weekend. The Met Office has cautioned that some areas could see more than a month's worth of rain in just a few hours, creating a high risk of fast-flowing and deep floodwaters. This threat is exacerbated by a recent heatwave that has left the ground dry and unable to absorb heavy rainfall effectively. The severe weather is likely to cause significant disruption to transportation, power outages, and potential flooding of homes and businesses.</p>

          <p>Italy is grappling with a severe and worsening demographic crisis as its birthrate has fallen to the lowest level ever recorded, with an average of just 1.18 babies per woman. This trend is causing towns like Fregona in northern Italy to empty out, threatening the closure of local schools and businesses. Despite government incentives like cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient to overcome the high costs and lack of accessible childcare. The crisis is forcing a national conversation about the need for more substantial family support services and the role of immigration in sustaining the country's population and economy.</p>

Glasnow pitched six strong innings, allowing only one run and demonstrating a more athletic, less mechanical approach that he hopes will lead to greater consistency. The Dodgers are heavily relying on Glasnow and fellow injured pitcher Blake Snell to bolster their rotation for a potential World Series run. His effective outing, featuring high velocity and six strikeouts, is seen as a crucial step forward for both the player and the team's championship aspirations.</p>

Proponents, including the Treasury Secretary, argue the law will bolster the U.S. dollar's global status and expand access to the dollar economy.

          <p>A recent study by Chinese researchers has found that chemotherapy may have the unintended consequence of speeding up the spread of cancer. The findings suggest that the treatment can awaken dormant cancer cells, potentially causing metastasis in organs like the lungs even after a primary tumor has been successfully treated. This research offers a possible explanation for why some breast cancer patients experience recurrence in distant organs. The team also identified specific drugs that could inhibit this process in mice, and a clinical trial involving breast cancer patients is now underway to explore these potential countermeasures.</p>

The current weapon, a world-first mounted on a ship in 2018, has been limited by its firing power, as stronger currents can liquefy metal components. The new design involves cross-stacking two railguns, which would significantly increase bore pressure and allow it to fire heavier projectiles of up to 30kg at speeds of Mach 7. This innovation aims to overcome existing technological hurdles and enhance the military application of electromagnetic weapon systems.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support for space exploration is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that the vast majority of the public continues to believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile achievement. These views are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, suggesting widespread public backing for ambitious national space exploration goals and the sense of pride they can inspire.</p>

          <h2>China's Open-Source AI Models Challenge Silicon Valley's Dominance</h2>

          <p>Chinese technology firms like DeepSeek and Alibaba are redefining the global artificial intelligence landscape by championing open-source AI models. This approach, which makes source code and model weights publicly available, stands in contrast to the closed-off systems favored by U.S. giants such as OpenAI and Google. The release of powerful, free-to-use Chinese models has spurred a wave of AI innovation in China and gained support from developers worldwide. Analysts suggest that this collaborative, open-source movement presents a serious challenge to the established dominance of Silicon Valley in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The CEO of US tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave after a video of him embracing a woman at a Coldplay concert went viral online. The clip, captured on the stadium's large screen, showed the pair quickly hiding their faces, which, combined with a comment from the band's singer, fueled widespread rumors of an affair. The woman was rumored to be another company executive, though the company has denied this. In response to the online furor, Astronomer's board of directors has initiated a formal investigation and appointed an interim CEO.</p>

          <h2>California's Workplace Safety Agency Critically Understaffed, State Audit Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 21:51:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A state audit has revealed that California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) is too understaffed to adequately protect the state's 19 million workers. The report identified a 32% overall vacancy rate, which has led to critical weaknesses, including failures to conduct on-site inspections and properly address workplace hazards. Auditors found that the overstretched agency sometimes closed cases without sufficient investigation and improperly reduced fines for violations. In response, Cal/OSHA stated it has made strides in reducing its vacancy rate and is working to improve its operational and technological systems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a defamation lawsuit seeking at least $10 billion in damages against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal. The suit alleges that the newspaper published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a sexually suggestive birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003. In a social media post, Trump called the report "FAKE NEWS" and stated he looked forward to Murdoch testifying. The lawsuit targets the media mogul, his companies, and the reporters who wrote the article, accusing them of glaring failures in journalistic ethics to inextricably link the president to the disgraced financier.</p>
