          <p>The UNHCR reports that the number of forcibly displaced people worldwide reached 122.1 million by April 2025, the highest in a decade, with war, violence, and persecution being the major drivers. While the number decreased slightly from the end of 2024 due to Syrians returning home, conflicts in Sudan, Myanmar, and Ukraine continue to cause significant displacement. Sudan now has the most internally displaced people, followed by Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. Despite the rising numbers, the UNHCR faces funding shortfalls as some countries reduce their contributions.

The government's calculations assume councils will implement the maximum increase, contributing to an average 2.3% annual rise in "police spending power" in real terms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that councils are not mandated to raise council tax by the full 5%, but the Spending Review indicates a 1.4% real-terms cut in the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government's budget.

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan to penalize colleges with high student loan debt and poor earnings outcomes, while rewarding those that provide good value to low-income students. The plan would require institutions to reimburse the federal government for a portion of unpaid student loan debt. Colleges could also be penalized when students enroll in income-based repayment plans. The proposal also awards "PROMISE Grants" to colleges that provide low-income students a great value for the money spent on their education.

          <p>A provision in the House-passed "Big, Beautiful Bill" could significantly reduce the retirement income of federal employees. The bill would eliminate a special retirement supplement for those retiring before they're old enough to collect Social Security. This change would affect federal workers who are younger than 57 on January 1, 2028. Critics argue that the cuts are unfair to those who have dedicated their careers to public service, while supporters claim federal retirement benefits are too generous. Some federal workers are retiring early due to fears of layoffs, only to face the prospect of reduced retirement income.</p>

          <p>ICE is employing a new strategy of arresting migrants at immigration courts, often after DHS dismisses their cases, to meet arrest quotas. This tactic has caught judges and lawyers off guard, as it bypasses the legal system and denies individuals a fair day in court. Some immigrants who entered the U.S. legally using the CBP One app are also being targeted. Immigration lawyers argue that this approach violates due process, while ICE defends it as a means to quickly deport those who entered the U.S. illegally.</p>
