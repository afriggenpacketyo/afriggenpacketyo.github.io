        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>S&P Global Ratings now projects China's real estate market will experience a much steeper decline than previously anticipated in 2025, marking a fifth consecutive year of contraction. New home sales are expected to fall by 8% from last year, reaching between 8.8 trillion and 9 trillion yuan, a substantial revision from the earlier 3% drop forecast. This deteriorating outlook is primarily driven by fragile homebuyer sentiment and Beijing's less aggressive policy easing, despite official calls for stronger sector support. The property market has effectively halved in value since 2021, and further price and sales declines are anticipated for 2026, making a market turnaround increasingly elusive.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hargreaves Lansdowne, the UK's biggest retail investment platform, has issued a stark warning to investors, advising against including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in their portfolios. This caution comes despite the recent lifting of a UK ban on retail investors accessing crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) and a ruling allowing them in tax-free ISA accounts. The platform argues that Bitcoin lacks intrinsic value and reliable performance assumptions, making it unsuitable for long-term financial goals. This perspective contrasts sharply with other major institutions and analysts who view digital assets as a potential hedge against volatility and a maturing mainstream investment, highlighting the ongoing debate within the financial sector.

          <p>Ferrari's stock recorded its worst trading day ever after the luxury carmaker unveiled updated full-year and 2030 guidance that significantly underwhelmed analysts' expectations. The company projected net revenue of at least 7.1 billion euros for the current year and around 9 billion euros by 2030, with an EBITDA target of 3.6 billion euros. Crucially, Ferrari also scaled back its 2030 electrification ambitions, now targeting a model lineup of 40% internal combustion engine, 40% hybrid, and only 20% fully electric vehicles, a notable reduction from its prior 40% EV goal. This strategic shift, attributed to client preferences and market evolution, mirrors similar adjustments by several other global automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American trucking industry is grappling with a severe surge in online cargo theft, which has escalated by 1,500% over the past four years, resulting in an estimated $19 million daily loss. These sophisticated fraudsters, often linked to Eastern Europe, exploit identity theft to reroute valuable freight, impacting businesses through doubled insurance rates and potentially higher consumer prices. Industry leaders are urgently appealing to lawmakers to pass the Combating Organized Retail Crime Act (CORCA). This proposed bill aims to establish a much-needed federal task force and a national cargo theft database, addressing the current lack of dedicated law enforcement for these transnational criminal operations.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted to initiate an impeachment trial against President Dina Boluarte, citing her government's perceived inability to effectively address a dramatic surge in crime across the nation. This legislative action was intensified by public anger following a recent shooting at a concert in the capital, highlighting the crisis of rising homicides and extortion. Boluarte, who assumed office in December 2022 after her predecessor's impeachment, has controversially blamed illegal immigration for exacerbating the crime wave. With significant support across nearly all legislative factions, the motion now requires 87 votes to remove her from office, plunging Peru into another period of political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has robustly defended his "golden generation" teammates against recent comments by Steven Gerrard, who suggested their lack of international success stemmed from players being "egotistical losers." On his BBC podcast, Rooney countered that his team worked diligently and "didn't quite manage to get over the line," rejecting the notion of a superior attitude in current squads as disrespectful. He acknowledged the historical difficulty of fostering close relationships between rival club players like those from Liverpool and Manchester United. Rooney emphasized that despite not winning, the players always believed in their ability and gave their all for the team.</p>

Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid as the leading anti-Reform party, appealing to a broader electorate beyond its traditional Welsh-speaking strongholds. While not centering on independence, the party plans to offer "radical" yet fiscally responsible policies, including a payment aimed at tackling child poverty.</p>

The blacklisting is expected to further increase the opaqueness of China's domestic chip industry, as TechInsights was renowned for its detailed analyses of Chinese-made chips and technological advancements.

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly published a policy paper outlining new measures to curb "disorderly price competition" within several key industries. These initiatives aim to mitigate price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting practices, which regulators believe are detrimental to industry development, product innovation, and quality. Authorities will guide industry associations in evaluating average production costs and assist companies in setting reasonable prices. Furthermore, regulators plan to closely monitor market competition, issue warnings for suspected price wars, and conduct cost investigations and price inspections, with violations facing legal enforcement.

          <p>A principal software engineer at Microsoft has resigned after 13 years, stating his inability to "accept enabling what may be the worst atrocities of our time" due to the company's ongoing cloud business with the Israeli military. Scott Sutfin-Glowski's departure follows reports of hundreds of active Microsoft subscriptions held by Israel's military and occurs amidst sustained employee protests, which have previously led to five firings. While Microsoft had reportedly ceased some services to a division of the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Sutfin-Glowski claims the company has also suppressed internal communication channels for employees to voice their concerns. This incident highlights significant ethical dilemmas for tech workers regarding corporate involvement in international conflicts.</p>

          <p>China's chip and AI-related stocks have experienced a robust rally in recent months, fueled by the nation's strategic push for technological self-sufficiency, yet their soaring valuations are now beginning to test investor patience. A key index of Chinese semiconductor shares has surged by 55% since late June, significantly outperforming global counterparts. However, fund managers, such as Ng Xin-Yao of Aberdeen Investments, caution that these high multiples offer minimal margin for error and predict limited market patience if companies fail to meet performance expectations. This market dynamic unfolds amidst Beijing's strong support for domestic tech and directives to avoid Nvidia processors. (not investment advice)</p>

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko reported at least nine people injured, with five requiring hospitalization, and confirmed critical infrastructure targets were hit. Tragically, a seven-year-old child was killed in Zaporizhzhia, as this assault marks a continuation of Russia's strategy to target Ukraine's essential infrastructure as winter approaches.</p>

As of Thursday night, Jerry was positioned approximately 100 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands, moving northwest at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. Tropical storm warnings and watches are currently in effect for several islands in the region, where residents can expect two to four inches of rain and a risk of flash flooding. Swells generated by Jerry are also reaching these islands, posing a threat of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions as the storm progresses.</p>

Duffy commended the majority of controllers who continue to report for duty, asserting that only about 10% are "lashing out." He also clarified that while essential workers are mandated to perform their duties, those who do not show up will not receive retroactive pay, intensifying pressure on federal employees amidst the prolonged political stalemate.</p>
