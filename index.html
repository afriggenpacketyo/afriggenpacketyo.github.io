        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The fire's spread was exacerbated by high winds, and a resulting chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment facility complicated firefighting efforts. This event occurs as smoke from separate Canadian wildfires continues to cause poor air quality across the Upper Midwest, affecting millions. Meanwhile, other fires burn across Arizona and Colorado amid a dangerous heatwave, prompting evacuations and park closures.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has publicly defended its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project against sharp criticism from the Trump administration. In response to accusations of mismanagement and extravagance from the Office of Management and Budget, the Fed launched a webpage explaining the project's necessity for modernizing and preserving historic buildings. The site directly refutes claims about luxury additions, attributing cost increases to unforeseen conditions like asbestos and design changes. This public pushback represents a notable defense by the independent central bank against escalating political pressure from the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are considering the possibility that Elon Musk might move significant parts of his tech empire, including R&D and manufacturing, to China. This speculation arises from escalating tensions with the Trump administration, which has criticized the substantial government subsidies Musk's companies have received. An analyst from the Quincy Institute suggests that conflicts over regulation, subsidies, or taxation could push Musk to leverage China's advanced supply chains. The article notes that Musk's businesses have benefited from approximately $38 billion in U.S. government support, a figure highlighted by his political critics.</p>

          <p>An independent investigation into the conduct of former "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace has substantiated 45 out of 83 allegations made against him. The upheld claims, spanning a 19-year period, primarily involve inappropriate sexual language and culturally insensitive comments, along with one instance of unwelcome physical contact. The report notes Wallace's recent autism diagnosis as potential context but not an excuse for his behavior. In response, the BBC has severed ties with the presenter and apologized for missed opportunities to address the misconduct sooner.</p>

          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is intensifying its efforts to establish the region as a nuclear-weapon-free zone by urging global nuclear powers to sign its 1995 treaty.

This diplomatic push occurs as the U.S. pursues the AUKUS security pact, which involves nuclear-powered submarines in the Asia-Pacific.

The maneuver was not requested by air traffic control, leading to speculation that the pilot may have misinterpreted an instruction intended for a different aircraft.

          <p>This article explores the diverse history of queerness, challenging the modern binary gender model by examining how different societies have treated non-normative identities and relationships. It highlights the acceptance of same-sex love in antiquity, citing examples like the Roman Emperor Hadrian and practices on the Greek island of Lesbos. The text contrasts this with the persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which used biblical interpretations to condemn what it termed "unnatural" lifestyles. The article also discusses the existence of third-gender identities in various cultures and profiles influential LGBTQ+ figures throughout history.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing that the state-owned enterprise could be transformed into an employee-owned mutual organization. This discussion comes as the government seeks a "fresh vision" to reform the institution's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also explore the range of services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking, as high street banks close branches. The goal is to address the Post Office's poor commercial track record and unstable leadership.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, and Wiltshire, effective July 22. The restriction is a response to a prolonged lack of rain and high demand, which have strained water supplies. The ban prohibits activities like watering gardens and washing cars with a hosepipe, with potential fines up to £1,000 for violations. This measure follows similar bans by other water companies and comes as the Environment Agency declares a state of prolonged dry weather in the region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for increasing housing supply by reducing building restrictions, is fundamentally a progressive and populist cause. The author refutes critics who paint YIMBYism as a pro-business, deregulatory agenda, instead framing it as an antitrust effort to break the "regulatory capture" by wealthy landowners (NIMBYs) who restrict housing supply to protect their property values. By blocking new development, these incumbent homeowners create artificial scarcity and drive up costs. The article asserts that building more homes is essential to address the cost-of-living crisis, climate change, and segregation.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the new deadline provides a window for talks, but officials emphasize they must prepare for all outcomes.

          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Inspector General has uncovered thousands of instances of abuse involving the use of restraints on inmates in federal prisons. The investigation found that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) violated its own rules by shackling people for extended periods, sometimes for days or weeks, and using restraints as a form of punishment. The report details disturbing cases, including one inmate who died after being restrained for over two days and another who required an amputation. In response, the BOP has agreed to revise its policies and improve practices.</p>

This policy idea resonates deeply with voters facing the city's exorbitant childcare costs, which average $26,000 a year. The plan, funded by increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy, is seen by supporters as a response to years of grassroots activism and a necessary step for economic equity. While implementing the system faces state-level political hurdles, advocates point to the success of universal pre-K as evidence that such ambitious social programs are achievable.</p>

Simultaneously, he faces condemnation internationally, where he is seen simply as a representative of his country's actions, regardless of his personal activism and anti-occupation stance.

This article explores the contradiction, attributing poor sleep to a combination of behavioral, environmental, and systemic factors. Personal choices like late-night screen use and "revenge bedtime procrastination" play a role, but so do uncontrollable elements like shift work and caregiving duties. Furthermore, systemic issues such as housing insecurity, noise pollution in low-income neighborhoods, and the stress of racial discrimination create significant barriers to restful sleep, contributing to health disparities.</p>

          <p>India's consumer price inflation cooled to a lower-than-expected 2.1% in June, marking its eighth consecutive monthly decline and reaching a new multi-year low. The slide was driven by a continued drop in food prices, which fell into negative territory. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with more room to continue its monetary policy relaxation, potentially leading to further interest rate cuts. Economists anticipate that a good monsoon season and strong cereal production will help keep inflation low, boosting domestic consumption and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
