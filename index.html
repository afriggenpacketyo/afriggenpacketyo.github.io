          <p>Following the daylight assassination of pro-Western Ukrainian politician Andriy Parubiy in Lviv, Ukrainian authorities have arrested a suspect and claimed a "Russian trace" is involved in the meticulously planned crime. The suspect, disguised as a courier, allegedly shot Parubiy eight times before fleeing. This event occurs within the broader context of the ongoing war, where both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of carrying out targeted killings of political and military figures. Parubiy was a prominent figure in Ukraine's pro-European movements and a long-standing advocate for Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify and impose sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. The decision represents a significant legal challenge to one of the administration's core economic policies. However, the court has allowed the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, meaning the tariffs will remain in effect for the time being while the legal battle continues.

          <p>The E3 nations of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have formally triggered the "snapback" mechanism of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA). This powerful diplomatic tool is intended to reinstate all previously lifted UN sanctions on Iran due to its ongoing non-compliance with the agreement's terms. The move initiates a 30-day period for resolution; if no agreement is reached, the sanctions will automatically resume, significantly escalating diplomatic and economic pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic visit to Taipei, U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee, publicly called Taiwan a "free country" with the "right to remain free." The statement was made to signal strong U.S. congressional support for the self-governing island. China's Foreign Ministry swiftly condemned the remarks and the visit, stating they violate the "one-China" principle and undermine China's sovereignty, reiterating Beijing's claim over Taiwan.</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended his administration's decision to issue 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals, pushing back against criticism from some of his own supporters. He argued that denying the visas would be "insulting" to China and highlighted the economic benefits, stating that the students contribute significantly to the U.S. economy and smaller universities. This policy represents a notable shift from his administration's earlier, more hardline stance as trade negotiations with Beijing continue.</p>

          <p>Albania's Prime Minister has announced an ambitious plan to transition the country to a completely cashless economy by 2030, but the vision faces considerable skepticism from experts and citizens. Major obstacles include a large informal economy, particularly in agriculture, a cultural preference for cash transactions, and critical vulnerabilities in the nation's cybersecurity infrastructure. Critics argue that without addressing these fundamental issues first, the goal is not only unrealistic but also potentially dangerous for the country's economic stability.</p>

Businesses in the nightlife, construction, and transportation sectors are being forced to pay "protection" money, leading to the shutdown of major infrastructure projects and creating a climate of fear. According to the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, this growing shadow economy is deeply entrenched, with victims often too afraid to cooperate with police, making the situation "intolerable" for the city.</p>
