          <p>A transgender asylum seeker from Mexico has been released from an ICE detention facility in Washington following a federal judge's order. The woman, who had been detained for over 40 days, was ruled to have been deprived of her liberty without due process. Her attorneys stated she was seeking asylum after being sexually assaulted by cartel members in Mexico due to her gender identity and is now reunited with her family. This case highlights ongoing legal battles concerning the rights and treatment of asylum seekers in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated that Ukraine should not conduct military strikes on Moscow, a clarification following reports that he had privately encouraged such escalations. The White House asserted that the president was merely posing a question during a call with Ukrainian President Zelensky, not advocating for increased conflict. This statement comes as the Trump administration announced it would send more weapons to Ukraine and threatened Russia with severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached within 50 days. The situation reflects the complex and often shifting dynamics of U.S. policy regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia that would impose a 19% tariff on Indonesian exports to the United States. As part of the deal, Trump stated that Indonesia has committed to significant purchases of American energy, agricultural products, and Boeing aircraft, while the U.S. would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets. However, officials in Jakarta have not yet publicly confirmed these terms, creating some uncertainty around the finality of the agreement. This development follows a similar pattern of trade negotiations with other nations, where details are sometimes contested after initial announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Citigroup has reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by a significant jump in revenue from its markets and banking divisions. The bank's net income climbed 25% year-over-year, with total revenue up 8%, and its stock rose following the announcement. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted the strong performance, noting it was the best second quarter for equities trading since 2020 and that banking revenues were up 18%. Despite the positive results, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a deterioration in the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has indicated that Canada might have to accept the inclusion of some tariffs as part of a new trade agreement with the United States. Speaking to reporters, Carney noted that the Trump administration's trade negotiations have consistently involved tariffs and that there is little evidence this approach would change for Canada. The statement comes as the two nations navigate a trade dispute, with the U.S. recently threatening a new 35% duty on Canadian goods. Canada, which sends about three-quarters of its exports to the U.S., is seeking a deal that serves its best interests amid the ongoing tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

While core inflation was slightly softer than anticipated, price increases in sectors like apparel and household furnishings suggest that recently imposed tariffs are starting to impact consumer costs. Analysts believe this growing uncertainty over the full inflationary effects of the administration's trade policies will keep the Fed in a wait-and-see mode for the coming months.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, blocking the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing that conditions in Afghanistan had improved, but the court paused the move for one week to allow for legal briefings. The decision provides a brief reprieve for approximately 11,700 Afghans enrolled in the program, which shields them from deportation and provides work permits. Advocacy groups praised the stay but emphasized the need for a permanent solution for Afghans who fled Taliban persecution.</p>

The event will peak on the nights of August 12-13, though visibility may be partially impacted by a bright moon. The Perseids are known for producing bright fireballs and long wakes of light, created as debris from Comet Swift-Tuttle disintegrates in Earth's atmosphere.</p>

This phenomenon makes catastrophic flash floods more likely and severe, overwhelming infrastructure that was often built based on outdated rainfall data.
