          <p>Colombian presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay was shot in the head during a rally in BogotÃ¡ and is currently in critical condition. The attack, which occurred while Uribe was addressing supporters, has been condemned by both the government and international figures as a threat to democracy. A 15-year-old suspect was arrested at the scene with a 9mm Glock-type firearm, and an investigation is underway to determine the motive behind the shooting. President Gustavo Petro urged Colombians to focus on Uribe's survival, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio blamed the attack on violent leftist rhetoric, though the suspect's motivation remains unknown. </p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that millions of adults have sought chiropractic treatment in recent years, prompting experts to weigh in on the potential benefits and risks. Chiropractors focus on manual spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, while spine doctors undergo medical school and specialized training. While chiropractic care may reduce tension, inflammation, and stress, experts caution that it may lead to complications if used for more serious underlying issues. Transparency and a clear treatment plan are crucial when selecting a chiropractic professional, and patients should feel comfortable throughout the process.</p>

          <p>An NPR and PBS Frontline investigation reveals that communities often fail to rebuild in a way that protects them from future disasters, despite the federal government spending billions annually. The report focuses on areas affected by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina and past storms in Houston, New York, and New Jersey, highlighting the inertia in the construction industry and the undermining of community choices by powerful forces. The investigation found that property owners are often desperate to rebuild quickly, leading to debates about whether to enforce stricter building codes that might protect them from future storms. The lack of a comprehensive plan and the influence of special interests contribute to the cycle of vulnerability and disaster.</p>

          <p>There is a renewed global interest in lunar exploration, driven by the potential for scientific research and the moon's abundant resources. NASA and ESA are collaborating on the Artemis program to establish a permanent base at the moon's south pole, while China and Russia are planning the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's resources, including iron, silicon, hydrogen, and rare earth elements, could be used to support lunar bases and potentially for future Mars missions. Scientific research on the moon will focus on understanding lunar environments, human health in space, and resource extraction.</p>
