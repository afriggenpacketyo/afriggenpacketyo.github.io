            <h2>Puerto Rico Grapples with Island-Wide Blackout Ahead of Easter</h2>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced a widespread blackout affecting 1.4 million customers and 328,000 without water, prompting outrage and calls to cancel contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR. Governor Jenniffer González cut her vacation short, acknowledging the $230 million daily revenue loss caused by such outages. The blackout, the second in less than four months, snarled traffic, closed businesses, and raised concerns for the elderly, highlighting the island's fragile infrastructure since Hurricane Maria in 2017. The cause is under investigation, with officials aiming to restore power to 90% of customers within 48-72 hours, but experts worry about the impact of potential policy changes under U.S. President Donald Trump on renewable energy initiatives.</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The NHS could face legal action if it doesn't update its gender policies following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines 'woman' as biological sex under equalities law. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is set to provide updated guidance for services, including the NHS and prisons, potentially impacting single-sex spaces like hospital wards and changing rooms. Baroness Kishwer Falkner, chairwoman of the EHRC, stated that trans people should advocate for facilities like 'third spaces' for toilets. This ruling has sparked concerns among trans rights campaigners who fear losing access to facilities they've used for years, while the UK government welcomes the clarity it provides for women and service providers.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is proposing a rule change to the Endangered Species Act that would limit the definition of 'harm' to direct actions against animals, excluding habitat destruction. This change could ease logging, mining, and construction on lands vital for endangered species, potentially reversing conservation gains. Conservation experts argue that habitat loss is a primary cause of extinction and that this narrow interpretation undermines the Act's effectiveness. The proposal cites a dissenting opinion from Justice Antonin Scalia, suggesting 'take' should be interpreted literally. The public has 30 days to comment, and the move is likely to face legal challenges.</p>

She credits her department's flexibility for allowing her to manage both professions, emphasizing the importance of empathy in both nursing and acting. Lee sees parallels between her two vocations, noting that they both require 'empathy' and she has even used her ER nursing skills on set to assist injured actors.</p>

            <p>Goldman Sachs reports that US retail investors hold approximately US$370 billion in American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Chinese companies, making them more likely to sell if the US pursues financial decoupling. Companies with high retail exposure, like Alibaba, are particularly vulnerable to sell-offs if forced to delist. The report estimates US institutional investors hold US$830 billion in ADRs, Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks, and China's onshore shares, potentially reaching US$960 billion when including Hong Kong-domiciled companies. This analysis comes amid escalating trade tensions, with Goldman Sachs suggesting a financial decoupling could trigger a US$2.5 trillion sell-off in both Chinese and US markets.

Sinner is currently serving a three-month ban after testing positive for clostebol, a banned substance, twice in March 2024. Williams, who previously claimed discrimination over the frequency of her drug tests, expressed support for Sinner but highlighted the perceived double standard. She joked that a similar case during her career would have put her 'in jail' and become a major scandal.</p>

The piece contrasts this with the US's historical application of the Monroe Doctrine, which has been used to justify interventions in Latin American affairs to protect American business interests.

            <p>The UK government has implemented a temporary ban on travelers bringing meat and dairy products from the EU to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD). The restrictions, effective immediately, apply to items like cured meats and cheeses, regardless of packaging, due to a growing FMD outbreak in Europe. This follows an earlier ban on similar products from specific countries with rising cases. The last UK FMD outbreak in 2001 led to the slaughter of over six million animals, and the National Farmers Union supports the extended ban, emphasizing the need for stricter border controls.</p>

            <p>An increasing number of young, female disabled people are facing challenges and inequalities. The author's book aims to connect with other women navigating chronic health conditions alongside careers and relationships. Disabled women in the UK are increasingly seen as statistics and stereotypes – reduced entirely to our disabilities, or robbed of the dignity of being believed we have one. The marketing also aims to uplift disabled talent: every digital graphic or piece of merchandise is made by a disabled-led small business or creative. The only way the argument for decent support for disabled people – of any age or gender – will be won is when we are seen as people, no less nuanced or worthy than anyone else.</p>

            <p>Chinese developers of drones and flying taxis are setting their sights on the US market despite high import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. These companies are seeking long-term diversification and see strong potential in foreign markets, including the United States, Brazil, and the United Arab Emirates. Shenzhen Zero Zero Infinity Technology, which already sells drones in the US and Europe, plans to maintain its presence in both regions, banking on its technology and competitive pricing. These Chinese companies are looking to capitalize on the expected rise in demand for low-altitude aircraft.</p>

            <p>The aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, was visible across the United Kingdom for the second consecutive night due to a strengthening solar storm. The lights were seen as far south as Devon and Cornwall, which is unusual. While the solar storm has weakened, overall solar activity remains high, suggesting more sightings may be possible in the coming weeks and months. This event provided a rare opportunity for many in the UK to witness the natural phenomenon.</p>

            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a decline as Nvidia cautioned that new export restrictions to China will negatively impact its results, and concerns surrounding President Donald Trump's trade war intensified. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq composite all fell, with losses accelerating after the Federal Reserve chair reiterated that tariffs are larger than expected, which could slow the economy and raise inflation. Nvidia's stock dropped after the U.S. government restricted exports of its H20 chips to China, while Advanced Micro Devices also faced potential losses due to export limits. The World Trade Organization anticipates tariffs will cause a decline in world merchandise trade.</p>

            <p>Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump, becoming the first European leader to have a face-to-face discussion since the U.S. announced, and then suspended, tariffs on European exports. Meloni, in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will act as a bridge between the EU and the US. She will be defending what the EU calls 'the most important commercial relationship in the world,' with annual trade reaching 1.6 trillion euros. Experts suggest Meloni's role is to gain clarity on Trump's goals rather than outright concessions.</p>

            <p>An American-owned company seized by the Kremlin and placed under state control, Glavprodukt, is planned to be used to supply food to the Russian army, potentially threatening Moscow's warming relations with the U.S. The seizure of Glavprodukt, the only American-owned firm to be taken under state control, was reportedly necessary to ensure stable production, including for future supplies to the national guard and defence ministry. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said its treatment will be part of the conversation about resetting U.S.-Russia relations. The company is now under the control of Russia’s federal property management agency Rosimushchestvo, having been seized from Los Angeles-based Leonid Smirnov.</p>

            <p>As Bashar al-Assad's regime neared collapse, he reportedly used a private jet to transport cash, valuables, and confidential documents out of Syria, according to a Reuters investigation. Yasar Ibrahim, Assad's top economic advisor, arranged four flights to the UAE carrying the assets, relatives, aides, and presidential palace personnel. The Embraer Legacy 600 jet made the trips in the 48 hours before the regime's fall, with the final flight departing from a Russian-operated military air base. The operation aimed to secure Assad's wealth and intelligence about his corporate network, with the new Syrian government determined to recover public funds taken abroad.</p>
