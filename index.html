          <p>The article examines the complexities of tariff policies, arguing that while Trump's approach was flawed, tariffs aren't inherently bad.  Targeted tariffs can protect domestic industries from unfair competition, particularly when coupled with other supportive policies.  However, broad, haphazard tariffs, like those implemented by Trump, can be economically disruptive and harm consumers.  The author advocates for strategic tariff implementation to address specific economic challenges.</p>

          <p>A survey reveals a long-term decline in over half of the UK's butterfly species, with 31 out of 59 showing falling numbers since 1976.  2024 marked the fifth-worst year on record for butterfly populations, with only six species showing increases compared to 2023.  The decline is attributed to habitat destruction, pesticide use, and climate change's impact on weather patterns.

          <p>President Trump publicly pressured four Republican senators—Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, Susan Collins, and Lisa Murkowski—to oppose a Senate measure to overturn his tariffs on Canada.  Trump accused the senators of disloyalty and suffering from "Trump Derangement Syndrome." The joint resolution aims to terminate the national emergency declaration justifying the tariffs, which Trump argues are necessary to curb fentanyl trafficking.

          <p>New blood and spinal fluid tests offer improved ways to diagnose Alzheimer's disease by focusing on memory loss rather than solely on amyloid plaques.  The blood test measures levels of a tau protein linked to memory impairment, providing a more direct indicator of cognitive decline.  The spinal fluid test measures a ratio of proteins involved in synapse regulation, predicting potential memory loss years before diagnosis. These advancements could help doctors better identify patients who would benefit from amyloid-clearing treatments.</p>
