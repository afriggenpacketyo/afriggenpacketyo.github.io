            <p>This article examines Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's evolution from a comedian to a wartime leader and the challenges he faces in maintaining international support, particularly with the unpredictability of a potential second Trump term. It highlights Zelensky's initial success in lobbying for Western aid and his ability to navigate changes in European politics. However, the article also notes that Zelensky's rigid messaging and failure to adapt his diplomacy after Ukraine's counter-offensive led to increasing questions about the merits of supporting Kyiv. The article further explores the tensions between Zelensky and Trump, including a strained meeting at Trump Tower and a diplomatic disaster in the Oval Office. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries but escalated the trade war with China by increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to 125%. This decision followed market turmoil and concerns about a potential recession. Trump justified the pause by stating that countries had agreed to negotiate new trade deals, while the increased tariffs on China were a response to Beijing's retaliatory measures. The article notes that the ongoing trade war could significantly reduce trade between the US and China, and quotes the WTO head's warning about the substantial risks associated with further escalation.

            <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to revise the federal definition of “showerhead” in an effort to increase water pressure, fulfilling a long-standing personal grievance. Trump has repeatedly complained about inadequate water pressure in American showers and toilets, blaming federal water-conservation standards. The White House claimed the executive order would “end the Obama-Biden war on water pressure” and “make America’s showers great again”. Experts have noted Trump's continued focus on water pressure, with some suggesting his concerns are outdated.</p>

            <p>At congressional hearings, Democratic lawmakers voiced concerns that President Donald Trump's global tariffs would strain alliances while targeting China. Pentagon and US Army officials sidestepped questions about the tariffs' fallout but pledged to deepen cooperation with Indo-Pacific partners, particularly Taiwan, to counter Beijing's rising military clout. Concerns were raised about the impact of tariffs on relationships with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. One congresswoman noted that Trump's tariff threats had prompted trilateral meetings between Beijing, Tokyo, and Seoul to address the pressure.</p>

            <p>US shares experienced a significant rally after President Donald Trump announced a suspension of steep tariffs on goods from most countries, instead imposing a 10% import tax rate.

Trump's decision came less than 24 hours after the latest round of tariffs had come into force. Levies on goods from China remain an economic challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

The order directs the Attorney General to identify and “stop the enforcement of” state laws that address climate change. The order also targets California’s cap-and-trade program.
