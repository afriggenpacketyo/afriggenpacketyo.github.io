          <p>Germany's Munich airport temporarily closed and cancelled over a dozen flights, affecting nearly 3,000 passengers, after drones were spotted near its airspace. Fifteen additional flights were diverted to other cities. The origin or type of the drones remains unconfirmed, but this incident follows several similar closures at European airports in recent weeks. The situation prompted a leaders' summit in Copenhagen to discuss drone threats, with recent incidents also involving Russian drones near Polish and Estonian airspace, though Russia denies involvement in the European airport closures.</p>

          <p>A new Goldman Sachs study indicates that a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are living paycheck to paycheck, making retirement savings increasingly out of reach. Roughly 42% of Gen Z, millennials, and Gen X report no spare savings after basic expenses, a figure projected to exceed half of Americans by 2033 due to rising costs for housing and healthcare. The article highlights a "financial vortex" where essential expenses consume a larger share of income, rendering traditional advice to "save more" unrealistic for many. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Jim Mackey, the head of NHS England, supported a heart surgeon, Karen Booth, to resume her career despite an internal investigation finding her failures contributed to seven patient deaths and avoidable harm to another. While chief executive of Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals, Sir Jim told a bereaved family that Booth would be "supported" and retrained, rather than sanctioned by the GMC or internal HR. Many surgical colleagues opposed her return, citing patient risk, highlighting concerns about accountability and public safety within the NHS.</p>

          <p>A Florida teenager's alarming claim of being abducted and shot by four "Hispanic" men, which triggered a statewide Amber Alert and online outrage, has been exposed as a hoax by police. Caden Speight, 17, texted his mother with the false story, prompting a massive law enforcement response and a surge of anti-Latino sentiment online. Authorities found evidence that Speight had purchased camping supplies and shot himself in the leg to perpetuate the lie. The sheriff stated that criminal charges are not "off the table" as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The White House is pressuring nine prominent U.S. universities to sign a "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education," which would require them to freeze tuition, ban sex/gender as admissions factors, and cap international student numbers. While non-signatories won't lose all funding, those who agree will receive priority access to federal grants and engagement with White House officials. This initiative, seen by some as a threat to institutional autonomy, is the latest effort by the Trump administration to reshape higher education and enforce its priorities.</p>

          <p>Venezuela has strongly condemned an "illegal incursion" by U.S. fighter jets into its air traffic control area, accusing Washington of a "provocation" that threatens national sovereignty. Venezuelan Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez described the detection of the planes 75 kilometers from their coastline as "military harassment and threat." This incident further escalates tensions between the two nations, following recent U.S. military deployments in the Caribbean, which Washington states are aimed at combating drug trafficking. Venezuela, however, views these actions as attempts at regime change.</p>

          <h2>Altadena Homeowners Face Lead Contamination Concerns After Eaton Fire</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners in Altadena, California, are facing concerns over elevated lead levels in their soil as they attempt to rebuild after the devastating Eaton Fire. Many homes in the area were built before lead-based paint was banned in 1978, and county health reports found significantly higher lead concentrations in fire-affected properties. Exposure to lead poses risks of brain and kidney damage, especially for children and pregnant individuals. While the Army Corps of Engineers scraped some soil, residents are seeking additional testing, highlighting the long-term environmental and health challenges following wildfires.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in PNAS reveals that U.S. rivers are "running hot," experiencing heat waves at an increasing rate, even faster than air heat waves. Researchers assessed over 1,500 American rivers, defining these "riverine heat waves" as prolonged periods of abnormally high water temperatures. This phenomenon, primarily driven by climate-induced changes like warming and dwindling snowpacks, poses a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems, adding stress to cold-water species. Experts emphasize the need for increased public awareness and changes in water management strategies to mitigate these impacts.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown has been swiftly weaponized by the Trump administration, targeting Democratic districts with over $25 billion in project holds and threatening mass firings of federal workers. President Trump views the shutdown as an "unprecedented opportunity" to decimate agencies and punish political enemies, a significant shift from his rhetoric during the 2019 shutdown. This aggressive stance, driven by figures like OMB director Russ Vought, defies ethical guidelines and has created widespread uncertainty, leading some Democrats to reconsider their strategy amidst concerns about the president's authoritarian instincts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a novel legal theory, claiming the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, to justify recent military strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats that killed 17 people. This legal argument, presented to Congress, frames the military actions as part of a sustained conflict against "non-state armed groups" whose actions constitute an "armed attack" on the U.S. The move escalates the government's drug war, increasing military presence in the Caribbean and raising questions about the legality of the strikes and pressure on the Venezuelan government.</p>
