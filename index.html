          <p>A new report finds the UK's National Health Service failed to listen to a family's concerns regarding five-year-old Yusuf Nazir, who died from a lung infection after being sent home from a hospital. The investigation highlighted a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight, leading to a lack of shared decision-making and trust. The boy's family is demanding accountability and changes to prevent similar tragedies, and the health service has accepted the report's recommendations.</p>

          <p>Over 50 Palestinians were reportedly killed and hundreds injured while waiting for food aid near the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency accused Israeli forces of firing on the crowd, while the Israeli military stated its troops fired "warning shots" and was unaware of casualties from its fire. This incident occurs as a US envoy visits Israel amid stalled ceasefire talks and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning of famine conditions.</p>

          <p>A radar-related issue with the UK's air traffic control system caused widespread disruption, leading to over 150 flight cancellations and grounding thousands more. While systems were restored within an hour, the disruption is expected to continue for days as airlines work to clear the backlog during the busy summer travel season. This incident, which the national air traffic service stated was not cyber-related, has prompted criticism from airlines and calls for accountability, echoing a similar major outage in August 2023.</p>

          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, fell sharply after the company reported a larger-than-expected 1.9% decline in second-quarter sales volumes. The drop was primarily driven by underperformance in China and weaker demand in Brazil, overshadowing a 6.5% jump in operating profit which was bolstered by higher prices. Despite revenue growth, analysts suggest the significant volume miss is likely to weigh on the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 peers, including prominent lawyers, has warned the UK government that recognizing a Palestinian state could violate international law. They argue in a letter that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria of the Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single effective government. The government defended its position, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 other UN members already recognize Palestine.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened Canada with trade repercussions after it announced plans to recognize Palestinian statehood in September. Trump stated on social media that Canada's decision would make it "very hard" to secure a trade deal, potentially leading to a 35% tariff on Canadian goods not covered by the existing USMCA pact. This development intensifies trade tensions as an August 1 deadline for a tariff agreement approaches, linking geopolitical diplomacy directly with economic policy.</p>

          <p>An Israeli settler, Yinon Levi, suspected in the fatal shooting of Palestinian activist Awdah Hathaleen, had previously been sanctioned by the Biden administration for violence against Palestinians. These sanctions were subsequently lifted by the Trump administration shortly after it took office in January. Hathaleen, a teacher and activist featured in the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land," was killed in the West Bank. The State Department has deferred to the Israeli government's investigation into the incident.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court is set to hear arguments challenging the legality of President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. The lawsuit, brought by several states and small businesses, contends that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose tariffs without congressional approval. The outcome of this case could significantly impact the administration's leverage in trade negotiations with China and other key partners, as no previous president has used the IEEPA to justify tariffs.</p>

          <p>Russian drone and missile strikes on Kyiv have killed at least six people, including a six-year-old boy, and wounded over 50 others. The barrage damaged numerous locations, including a residential high-rise building where an entire section was destroyed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a demonstrative act of murder in response to peace efforts. The attack occurred despite threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tougher sanctions if Russia does not agree to a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The French government has condemned remarks made by Spain's transport minister, Oscar Puente, who referred to a group of French Jewish teenagers removed from a flight as "Israeli kids." In a joint statement, French ministers called the comment unacceptable and discriminatory, adding it seemed to justify the group's removal from a Vueling flight in Valencia. The incident, where the airline cited safety risks and the group's organizer alleged discrimination, has now escalated into a diplomatic issue between the two countries.</p>

          <p>This opinion article characterizes the recent EU-US trade deal as the "EU's Suez moment," arguing it demonstrates the bloc's subservience to American pressure. The author contends that the EU made all the concessions, agreeing to a 15% tariff on most of its exports to the US, eliminating its own tariffs, and committing to massive US investments and energy purchases. The piece concludes that this one-sided agreement exposes the failure of the EU's ambition to be a geopolitical equal to the United States.</p>

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are showing interest in China's C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing aircraft, according to Malaysia's Transport Minister. The interest is driven by a desire to diversify procurement, long backlogs for Western-made planes, and the potential for faster delivery and cheaper options from Chinese manufacturer Comac. This reflects a growing trend in Southeast Asia to consider new suppliers to meet rising air travel demand in the region.</p>
