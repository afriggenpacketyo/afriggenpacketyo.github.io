            <p>A US Treasury Department report has identified China and Mexico as key players in the financial networks that enable fentanyl trafficking. The report details a sophisticated system involving wire transfers, social media, casinos, and money laundering used to finance the opioid trade. It notes the involvement of Hong Kong-based companies alongside mainland Chinese entities. This report comes as the Trump administration cites fentanyl trafficking as justification for tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada, potentially escalating trade tensions.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil futures experienced a significant rally, jumping over 4% after President Trump announced lower tariff rates for most countries, excluding China. This reversal followed an earlier drop in oil prices triggered by China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. The market's volatility reflects concerns about a potential trade war and its impact on global oil demand, exacerbated by OPEC+'s plans to increase output. The U.S. and Iran are also scheduled to hold talks regarding Iran's nuclear program, which could further influence the oil market.</p>

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that China is the biggest source of trade issues for the United States and the rest of the world. The decision to pause tariffs was made to allow for "bespoke" trade arrangements with other countries, and the pause will not be applicable to China, on which Trump is raising the U.S. tariff to 125%.</p>

            <p>President Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. The new taxes are intended to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries. Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from others are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. Economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.</p>
