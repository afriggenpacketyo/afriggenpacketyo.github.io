          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released on bail after being detained by ICE for six weeks; this article discusses her return to Massachusetts and the circumstances surrounding her detainment. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated, citing an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas as the primary reason for her visa revocation. A federal judge agreed, noting the lack of evidence of criminal activity or violence. Ozturk was welcomed home by Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, who condemned her detention as a violation of free speech.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that "great progress" was made during trade negotiations with China in Geneva, Switzerland. U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and a Chinese delegation discussed many topics and reached agreements, though no major breakthroughs were announced. Trump described the agreement as "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner," emphasizing the desire for China to open up to American business. He has long supported tariffs to address the trade deficit and encourage the return of U.S. manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by targeting lower-tier cities amid sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks saw flat same-store sales, but a transaction increase offset a decline in average spending. The company expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets, adding 665 stores in the past year. This strategy reflects efforts to maintain market share as price competition continues, though the long-term potential beyond wealthier cities remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr announced his retirement from the NFL due to a labral tear and degenerative changes in his right shoulder. The four-time Pro Bowler, who spent 11 seasons in the league, made the decision after consulting with his family and reflecting on his career. Carr's retirement creates an opportunity for rookie Tyler Shough to compete for the starting position, while other quarterbacks on the Saints roster will also have a chance to prove themselves. The Saints are considering bringing in a veteran quarterback through free agency, but are currently focused on developing their younger players.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is bracing for an unusual atmospheric river event that could bring 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated areas potentially seeing up to 12 inches. The National Weather Service forecasts that Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina will be most affected. While atmospheric rivers typically hit the Western U.S., this event is caused by a "cutoff low" diverting the jet stream from the Gulf of Mexico. The precipitation could alleviate recent drought conditions in Florida, but also poses a risk of flooding in low-lying areas.</p>

          <p>Small towns along the US-Canada border are experiencing economic hardship due to the ongoing trade war and strained relations between the two countries. Since President Trump began imposing tariffs, border crossings have decreased by 17%, with Canadian car trips to the US dropping by almost 32%. This has led to a decline in business for restaurants, duty-free shops, and other businesses that rely on cross-border traffic. Border towns are also encouraging Canadians to "Buy Canadian" to support their own economy. These communities are facing a second economic hit after the Covid-19 pandemic shut down border crossings for 19 months.</p>

          <p>This article provides expert insights on how to win the Eurovision Song Contest, considering factors such as song themes, staging, key, and surprises. According to experts, songs of self-empowerment tend to do well, and simple, memorable staging can be more effective than extravagant displays. Minor-key songs dominate the contest, but some artists intentionally use major keys to stand out. Adding a surprise element, like a costume change or key change, can also increase a song's memorability and catchiness.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, returned to Massachusetts after a federal judge ordered her release from a Louisiana detention facility, ending a six-week period in federal custody. Ozturk, a Turkish citizen, had her student visa canceled and faced deportation due to an opinion piece she wrote criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Her supporters argued she was detained in retaliation for her speech, violating the First Amendment. Judge William K. Sessions III said her detention could chill the speech of non-citizens, and the government presented no evidence other than the opinion essay.</p>

          <p>This article compiles anecdotes from autopsy performers detailing unusual anomalies they have encountered, ranging from anatomical variations to unexpected foreign objects. These include cases of situs inversus (organs in mirrored positions), uterine didelphys (a split vagina leading to two cervixes), and the discovery of tumors or missing organs. One account describes a man with a golf ball-sized tumor on his brainstem, while another recounts finding a cardiac valve disc lodged in a patient's renal artery. These stories highlight the surprising and often inexplicable variations found within the human body.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan abruptly declared a cease-fire after four days of escalating conflict, including drone strikes and airstrikes, bringing the two countries to the brink of war. The truce was initially announced by President Trump, though only Pakistan acknowledged an American role. However, reports of cross-border firing continued, with both countries accusing the other of violating the agreement. The conflict was triggered by a terrorist attack in Kashmir, and the intense fighting involved strikes deep into each other’s territories.</p>

          <p>A livestock farmer is planning legal action against East Midlands Airport, claiming that a leaking pipe polluted a brook, leading to the loss of pedigree lambs.

The airport pleaded guilty to exceeding environmental permit limits by releasing water containing chemicals. The airport denies any link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook, but environmental studies show de-icing chemicals can affect water quality.</p>

Putin said Russia was “prepared for serious negotiations with Ukraine” and proposed a meeting in Istanbul on May 15, aiming to “eliminate the root causes of the conflict.” He indicated Russia wouldn’t stop fighting before the negotiations.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan agreed to halt fighting after days of escalating conflict, but reports of continued violence emerged. The cease-fire, announced by President Trump, came after missile, drone, and artillery strikes between the nuclear-armed rivals. Hours after the announcement, both sides accused each other of violating the truce. The conflict stemmed from a terrorist attack in Kashmir, and both countries targeted military bases in the escalating exchange.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic impact of climate change when developing policies and regulations, except when explicitly required by law. This directive effectively suspends the use of the “social cost of carbon,” a metric used to weigh the economic damages from global warming against the costs of limiting carbon pollution. The administration cited “uncertainties” in calculating the figure and questioned the scientific consensus on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, a move criticized by scientists and environmental groups as denying reality.</p>
