          <p>Tom Hartley, a 26-year-old spinner, is juggling his cricket career with managing his family's garden center. Hartley's Nurseries, a sixth-generation business, requires him to wake up early to water plants, supervise staff, and prepare for the next day. Despite the demanding schedule, Hartley feels the stability of the family business reduces the pressure associated with his on-field performance. Knowing there's something for him after cricket helps him cope with bad games or seasons, contributing to his peace of mind and ability to perform well. </p>

          <p>Twenty retailers in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of government-stockpiled rice, following revisions to a scheme aimed at curbing soaring rice prices. The amount requested accounts for over 30% of the 300,000 tons the government plans to release through direct sales contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the ministry aims to dispel public anxiety over rising rice prices and ensure a stable food supply. Aeon plans to sell the rice in stores across Japan from early June, aligning with the government's target price of around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's European sales experienced a significant drop in April, plummeting by 49% year-on-year, even as overall electric car sales rose. This decline is attributed to reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's political activities and growing competition from traditional automakers and Chinese companies like BYD. European consumers are increasingly favoring hybrid electric vehicles, a market segment Tesla does not currently serve. Investors have also voiced concerns about Musk's commitment to Tesla due to his advisory role with former U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

The automotive sector, a crucial part of the Japanese economy, is already facing challenges from U.S. tariffs, with companies like Toyota projecting significant profit losses.

          <p>A Chinese study published in the journal Cell has challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be passed on through generations without DNA changes. Rice plants subjected to cold stress exhibited an adaptive tolerance to low temperatures that was inherited across five generations. This research revives the debate between Darwin's theory of random genetic variation and Lamarck's idea that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The study identifies heritable DNA methylation changes as the mechanism driving cold adaptation, suggesting that Lamarckism may play a role in evolution.</p>

          <p>A new rule requiring teams to use three sets of tires during the Monaco Grand Prix aimed to increase strategic options, but its impact on the race's outcome is debatable. While the rule tested strategy engineers and created diverse scenarios, it also allowed teams to strategically manipulate results, as seen with Racing Bulls and Williams. Some drivers expressed discomfort with these tactics, and the rule made it easier to exploit the controversial red-flag tire-change rule. The fundamental issue remains the difficulty of overtaking at Monaco, a problem that artificial gimmicks cannot fix without track changes.</p>

Analysts expect BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term due to the price reductions, but the company may offset the impact through larger sales scale and lower battery costs.
