        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow thunderstorm warning for much of southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, effective from 09:00 BST to 18:00 BST on Saturday. The agency cautions about potential transport disruptions due to heavy showers, spray, and standing water, which may cause longer journey times and delays to train services. Short-term power losses and damage to buildings from potential lightning strikes are also likely, with the possibility of 10-15mm of rain falling in less than an hour in some areas. This follows a record-breaking dry spring, where England experienced only 32.8mm of rain last month, indicating that rainfall on Saturday could exceed the entire amount from May. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered interest rates by 100 basis points to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling an easing of inflation pressures. The rates had been held at 21% since October of last year, the highest level since the new benchmark rate was introduced in 2013. Inflation in April was reported at 6.2%, down from an average of 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025, indicating a positive shift in the country's economic landscape. Russia's economy has faced immense strain due to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which has impacted prices and necessitated economic re-orientation amidst ongoing conflict.

          <p>Police are investigating whether the sexual orientation of Jonathan Joss, best known for his voice work on "King of the Hill," played a role in his fatal shooting in San Antonio. Joss' husband alleges the shooter yelled homophobic slurs before opening fire, though initial police statements found no evidence of a hate crime. San Antonio Police Chief William McManus has since walked back that statement, confirming that it is now part of the investigation. Friends, actors, and fans have paid tribute to Joss, who also had a recurring role on "Parks and Recreation" and appeared in "Tulsa King."</p>

The RGV Sector BORTAC team, equipped with specialized tools and experience in high-risk operations, will provide advanced search capabilities to the multi-agency effort.

          <p>Ketamine, initially synthesized in the 1960s for surgical and veterinary purposes, has gained traction as a treatment for depression, particularly in treatment-resistant populations, with the FDA approving a ketamine-derived nasal spray in 2019. However, alongside its therapeutic use, there's a rise in recreational ketamine consumption, potentially leading to severe health consequences like kidney and liver damage, memory loss, and paranoia. A study indicates an 82% increase in ketamine use from 2015 to 2019, followed by a 40% rise from 2021 to 2022, suggesting both clinical and recreational factors are driving its increased popularity. Experts emphasize the importance of medical supervision when using ketamine, highlighting the risks of self-medication and the need for caution.</p>

          <p>As stablecoins gain mainstream acceptance, the U.S. Treasury market, particularly short-term securities, could face increased volatility due to their close ties with the cryptocurrency world. Proposed legislation aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially boosting their activity and increasing demand for short-term U.S. government debt. However, concerns arise that a sudden loss of confidence or regulatory pressures could trigger large-scale liquidations, depressing Treasury prices and disrupting fixed-income markets. If passed, the stablecoin bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and short-term Treasury bills, potentially increasing the amount of U.S. Treasuries held by stablecoin issuers.

Jane alleges that Mozenter has been hostile and uncooperative, withholding information about trust assets and finances, while Mozenter has filed a petition in Florida to remove her as co-trustee and representative of the estate. Jane claims that Mozenter's analysis projects a low rate of return for the marital trust, insufficient to cover her annual expenses, while Mozenter reportedly suggested she consider making adjustments or selling her own real estate.

          <p>Elon Musk's feud with Donald Trump over a tax bill has created a dilemma for Republicans, particularly Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, as Trump seeks a legislative victory. Musk branded the "big, beautiful bill" a "disgusting abomination," criticizing its impact on the budget deficit and national debt. Trump, in turn, has seen his popularity decline, with his disapproval numbers exceeding his approval rating, while Musk's influence also appears to be waning. The bill, aimed at raising the debt ceiling and making the Trump tax cuts permanent, faces opposition from within the Republican party, potentially forcing Trump to compromise with Democrats.</p>

          <p>A personal essay recounts a woman's experience with co-parenting, dating, and taking care of a cat she didn't want. The author initially got a cat to promote uniformity between her home and her ex-husband's after their divorce, but she didn't particularly like cats. Over the years, she struggled with the cat's behavior and her own lack of enthusiasm for pet ownership, eventually considering giving the cat away. The author's feelings changed as her daughter grew attached to the cat, but eventually, she reached a point where she wanted to be pet-free, and with her daughter's blessing, she found a new home for the cat.</p>

Smith recounts the challenges of getting the film made and distributed, highlighting the significance of Williams' efforts in bringing it back to audiences.

          <p>Jess Walter's novel, “So Far Gone,” follows Rhys Kinnick, a sixty-something protagonist who has spent seven years in self-imposed exile. Sparked by a 2016 Thanksgiving altercation with his daughter’s husband, a born-again Christian whose adherence to increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories, Rhys’ attempts to improve the home his grandfather once envisioned as a thriving sheep farm have stalled, but he has managed to read more than 900 books during his stay. He's startled out of his oblivion when his grandchildren show up on his door, and Rhys must awkwardly rebuild bridges with friends and family in a series of adventures and misadventures. Throughout the novel, Rhys references Kant, De Beauvoir, Sartre, Virginia Woolf and Epictetus, among others, using knowledge as a balm and escape hatch.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Public Health is moving to suspend the licenses of seven Southern California nursing facilities that have been repeatedly cited for contributing to patients’ deaths. The facilities, all located in Los Angeles County, have received at least two “AA” violations within the last two years, indicating a failure that contributed substantially to the death of a resident. The state investigations found failures and oversights that contributed directly to residents’ deaths, and facilities in violation frequently resolve citations through appeals, settlements, or other alternate routes that lower the severity level of their violation.

          <p>Recreational salmon fishing is resuming in California this weekend after a two-year shutdown aimed at helping the population recover, but with strict limits in place. While commercial fishing remains canceled for a third consecutive year, fishery regulators have allowed a limited recreational season with quotas. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is limiting ocean fishing under quotas in two windows in the summer and fall, with the first opening this weekend and allowing up to 7,000 salmon to be caught statewide. Biologists attribute the decline in salmon populations to dams, habitat loss, and global warming, and those in the fishing industry are hopeful for responsible water management and restoration efforts.</p>

          <p>A contributor to the Los Angeles Times suggests that Donald Trump's cultural critiques resonate because he addresses issues that polite society avoids, such as uncontrolled immigration, violent crime, and foreign adversaries exploiting American weakness. However, while Trump identifies these problems, his solutions are often morally indefensible and exacerbate the issues, as evidenced by his policies on refugees and immigration. The author argues that Trump thrives by projecting dominance, while his opponents appear hesitant and indecisive, but that he lacks the desire to govern effectively, preferring spectacle and demolition over building and statesmanship.

The scale of agriculture in this northerly location, which is not a major population center, is surprising, especially given the challenging growing conditions and the availability of wild rice nearby. The find highlights the advanced agricultural practices of Native Americans before European colonization and may represent just the "tip of the iceberg" in terms of previously underestimated agricultural landscapes.</p>
