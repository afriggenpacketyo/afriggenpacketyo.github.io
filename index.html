          <p>A Kyiv resident recounts a night of intense Russian shelling following the end of a supposed Easter ceasefire, highlighting the disconnect between the reality on the ground and proposed peace agreements. The author criticizes Donald Trump's apparent willingness to prioritize a deal with Putin at the expense of Ukrainian interests. The author fears that any peace agreement reached under these conditions would be a form of punishment, leaving Ukraine vulnerable and without guarantees of lasting peace. The piece underscores the human cost of the conflict and the challenges of achieving a just resolution.</p>
