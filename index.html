          <p>Court hearings have revealed that Erin Patterson, recently convicted of murdering three relatives with poisoned mushrooms, allegedly made multiple previous attempts to kill her estranged husband, Simon Patterson. These allegations, which were suppressed during the trial to avoid prejudicing the jury, include incidents where he became severely ill after consuming food she prepared. Mr. Patterson detailed several near-death experiences, leading him to suspect a years-long poisoning campaign, a fear he had communicated to his family before the fatal lunch.</p>

          <p>The constant pull of smartphones is a significant challenge for many, with studies showing that a phone's mere presence can diminish a person's cognitive capacity, even when it is silent. Cultural critics and producers discuss how this "attention economy" has led some to revert to simpler "dumbphones" in an attempt to reclaim their focus and mental energy. The conversation highlights that overcoming phone addiction is less about individual willpower and more about intentionally creating situations, such as spending time in nature or with friends, that offer a more compelling connection than a digital screen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers" are providing scientists with clues on how to combat cognitive decline associated with aging. These people, aged 80 and older, possess memory capabilities comparable to those 20 to 30 years younger, and their brains shrink at a much slower rate. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program are studying this cohort to understand the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to their remarkable brain resilience. Their findings could offer new pathways for preventing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.</p>

          <p>After a period of relative quiet, the market for space-related Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed signs of life, with several companies like Karman Holdings and Firefly Aerospace making successful debuts on the stock market. This trend marks a shift from the previous reliance on SPAC mergers for space firms to go public, signaling renewed investor confidence in the sector's long-term growth potential. Analysts suggest that while geopolitical volatility presents risks, companies aligned with national priorities and innovation are well-positioned to succeed, though competition in the private launch market could create downward pressure on costs.

          <p>The United States is threatening to revoke Kenya's status as a Major Non-NATO Ally, a designation that provides significant military and economic benefits. This move comes after Kenyan President William Ruto praised China's role in a "new world order" during a state visit to Beijing, where he secured major infrastructure and trade agreements. The U.S. Senate is now considering a review of the ally status, demanding a detailed report on Kenya's military and financial ties with China, highlighting the escalating geopolitical tug-of-war between Washington and Beijing for influence in Africa.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed a steep 39% tariff on Swiss imports, citing a significant trade deficit that it argues is unfairly advantageous to Switzerland. A major point of contention is the inclusion of Switzerland's massive gold refining industry in the trade calculations, which Swiss officials argue heavily distorts the figures since the value added in Switzerland is minimal. Despite Swiss efforts to negotiate, including a visit from President Karin Keller-Sutter, the tariffs have been enacted, posing a major threat to Swiss exporters of luxury goods, watches, and pharmaceuticals.

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, has elaborated on China's goal to build a "world-class" military by the middle of the century. The piece explicitly uses the "most powerful military," a clear reference to the United States, as the benchmark for this ambition. The objective is for China's armed forces to match its global power status, dominate in military competition, and stay at the forefront of development in areas from weaponry and training to military theory.</p>

          <p>Shares of Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group surged by 13%, marking their best single-day performance in five years and hitting a new record high. The rally was fueled by a fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen, which far exceeded analyst expectations and marked a sharp turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. The strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, thanks to positive results from portfolio companies like Grab Holdings and Indian food delivery service Swiggy.

          <p>Research published in Science Advances quantifies how human-caused climate change has significantly altered California's fire season, causing it to start earlier and last longer across the state. In some northern regions like the Cascade Range, the season now begins an average of 46 days earlier than it did in the early 1990s. The study attributes this shift primarily to climate-related factors, such as earlier snowmelt and the increased drying of flammable vegetation due to rising average temperatures, rather than an increase in human-ignited fires.</p>

This move escalates the long-running pressure campaign against Maduro, whom the U.S. government indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020.
