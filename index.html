The court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 decision. This ruling is based on the assessment that the government's earthquake evaluation did not provide sufficient grounds for immediate countermeasures, leading to criticism from shareholders who sought damages.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China is leading to a surge of cheap exports, causing concern among Asian economies but potentially easing global inflation. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts due to weak domestic demand, benefiting consumers in markets like Australia with limited manufacturing. Economists suggest this influx of low-cost goods could provide relief to central banks, allowing them to balance inflation control with economic growth. Nomura predicts potential rate cuts across Asia as central banks decouple from the Federal Reserve due to subdued inflation and emerging growth risks. (not investment advice)</p>

The report indicates that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages in AI-exposed occupations. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The study also found that wages of workers with AI skills are significantly higher, and employer demand for formal degrees is declining in AI-exposed jobs, creating broader opportunities.

A leading criminologist attributes the increase to resourcing issues from police force cuts in the 2010s.

          <p>Today's newspaper headlines focus on the resignation of Reform UK's chair, Zia Yusuf, and the escalating feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. The Daily Telegraph reports a "civil war" within Reform UK following Yusuf's departure, while the Financial Times notes his statement that the position was not a "good use of my time." The Times and other papers cover Musk's claim that Trump appears in the Epstein files, signaling a significant escalation in their conflict. Several papers also highlight Labour's ban on bonuses for water company executives due to sewage pollution concerns.</p>

          <p>A new Ipsos poll reveals that people across Europe believe their countries are in decline and society is broken, with negative sentiment growing in major economies.

Brits are more likely to support a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to fix these problems. The U.K.'s governing Labour Party faces pressure from the right-wing Reform UK party, but limited fiscal space may restrict the government's ability to address these issues effectively.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban has been implemented amidst a series of stringent immigration restrictions, including the suspension of the asylum system and the termination of temporary legal residency for various groups. This ban, affecting foreign nationals from 19 countries, is part of a broader effort to tighten immigration policies. While the new ban includes exemptions and a delayed implementation, it is expected to face legal challenges and further disrupt families seeking refuge.
