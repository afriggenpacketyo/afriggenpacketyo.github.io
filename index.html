          <p>Former President Trump has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA, citing a review of prior associations. Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, was initially selected to head NASA, but the White House spokeswoman stated that the next leader must align with Trump's "America First" agenda. Musk expressed his support for Isaacman, calling him competent and good-hearted, however, the White House will announce a new nominee soon who will be mission aligned and put America First in Space. Isaacman had previously stated that he would help usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the late George Wendt's accidental impact on Ohio politics during John Boehner's 1990 congressional race. Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a scandal during an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show," while campaigning for his brother-in-law, Greg Jolivette, who was running against Boehner. Despite the gaffe, Boehner won the election and later became Speaker of the House. Boehner acknowledged the incident after Wendt's death, recalling Wendt's apology and their conversation.</p>

The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow for the rescue operation, and the public was advised to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>The Hollywood film and TV industry in California is facing concerns about its survival due to job losses and declining production.

The level of health spending will determine whether cuts are made to unprotected areas outside the NHS, defense, and schools.

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is tied to his willingness to adapt and contradict himself. The author argues that Trump's flexibility reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional. The willingness to swerve and backpedal and contradict himself is a big part of what keeps the president viable, and the promise of chickening out is part of Trumpâ€™s implicit pitch to swing voters. The author suggests that seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>
