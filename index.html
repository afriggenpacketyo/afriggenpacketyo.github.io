The championship match featured American Amanda Anisimova against Poland's Iga Swiatek in their first-ever professional meeting. The Princess of Wales, who is a patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, was expected to present the winner's trophy. Her attendance marks a return to the event after her recovery from cancer prevented her from attending the previous year, adding a notable royal presence to the prestigious tournament.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated widespread layoffs, cutting over 1,300 civil and foreign service positions as part of a major reorganization under the Trump administration. The plan, which aims to streamline the department by eliminating and merging offices, has drawn significant criticism from Democratic lawmakers and foreign service associations. They argue the cuts, which heavily impact bureaus focused on human rights and refugee assistance, could undermine U.S. foreign policy and national security. The administration defends the move as necessary to remove redundancy and focus on core responsibilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has declared its intention to impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1st. President Trump communicated the decision in letters to the leaders of both trading partners, citing persistent trade deficits and a need for a more reciprocal relationship. The announcement warns that any retaliatory tariffs from the EU or Mexico would be met with equivalent increases above the new 30% rate. This move marks a significant escalation in global trade tensions, following similar threats to other major U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A preliminary report on the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, found that the fuel supply to both engines was cut off shortly after takeoff. Relatives of the victims have expressed their heartbreak and called for a full investigation to determine the root cause and ensure accountability. The report's findings have been described as incomplete by family members, who are struggling to find closure without understanding why the fatal incident occurred.

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian gang leader known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons smuggling charges. Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His agreement marks a significant moment for Ecuador, making him the first citizen to be extradited under a new law aimed at combating organized crime. The move is seen as a major victory in President Daniel Noboa's declared war against the country's powerful drug mafias.</p>

          <p>In response to rising trade war costs, U.S. companies are increasingly using Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce tariff payments on imported goods. These customs-sanctioned areas allow businesses to store and even assemble products duty-free, with taxes only applied when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. However, a recent executive order by President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which previously allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on finished products. This change has increased costs for manufacturers who rely on imported components. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation found that FEMA repeatedly granted appeals to remove dozens of buildings at Camp Mystic, a Texas girls' summer camp, from its 100-year flood map designation in the years leading up to a catastrophic flood that killed 27 people. This reclassification loosened safety regulations and insurance requirements for the camp, which was located in a high-risk area known as "flash flood alley." Experts question the decision to grant exemptions for a facility responsible for children's safety, especially as the camp expanded its operations.

          <p>Military experts suggest that Russia's recent escalation in drone and missile attacks on Ukraine is a strategic effort to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and demoralize the public ahead of a potential new summer offensive. Russia has significantly ramped up its domestic drone production, reducing its reliance on foreign suppliers and enabling massive, combined assaults on Ukrainian cities. Analysts believe Putin's dual aims are to cripple Ukraine's military-industrial complex and exert psychological pressure on the government through civilian terror.

The author, who transitioned as an adult, argues against forcing children to wait, citing the concept of survivorship bias and the immense pain of enduring the wrong puberty.

          <p>Russia has escalated its aerial attacks on Ukraine, launching hundreds of drones and cruise missiles that killed at least six people and injured dozens more across the country. The overnight barrages targeted multiple regions, including Chernivtsi in the southwest and Lviv in the west, a key hub for foreign military aid. Ukraine's air force reported shooting down a significant number of the projectiles, but the attacks caused widespread damage. This intensified bombing campaign coincides with a major Russian push along the front line, placing Ukrainian forces under severe and increasing pressure.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Coconino County, Arizona, have confirmed that a local resident has died from pneumonic plague, marking the state's first recorded death from the disease since 2007. While rare in humans, the bacterial infection, known historically as "The Black Death," persists in rodent populations in the western U.S. and is typically transmitted by fleas. Pneumonic plague is the most severe and easily spread form of the disease, though it is treatable with modern antibiotics if caught early. Officials have not released further details about the victim out of respect for the family.</p>

Frizell contributed extensively to his wife's new memoir, expressing anger at the lack of support available for families dealing with the disease. Phillips, who previously hosted GMTV, has a family history with Alzheimer's and has made documentaries on the subject to raise awareness.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American man was reportedly killed in the West Bank after being beaten by Israeli settlers, according to his family. The incident occurred amid rising violence in the region and ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza, where recent airstrikes killed at least 28 Palestinians, including women and children. The man's family has called for a U.S. State Department investigation into his death, which they claim was exacerbated by settlers preventing medical aid from reaching him. The Israeli military stated it struck numerous Hamas targets in Gaza over the past 48 hours.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly overhauls the U.S. federal student loan system, reducing the number of repayment plans and setting new borrowing caps. The legislation phases out several existing plans, including the SAVE plan, and introduces two new options: a standard 10-25 year fixed plan and an income-driven plan with a 30-year term. The law also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants and imposes new limits on Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans, aiming to simplify the system. These changes will have a major impact on current and future borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

Lara has taken on a public role similar to Ivanka's, working to soften Donald Trump's image and championing him as a supporter of women.

The shift is attributed to advancements in security technology, such as the rollout of CT scanners that provide more detailed 3D images of carry-on items.

Thai officials have detected dangerously high levels of arsenic and other hazardous metals in the Kok and Sai rivers, which feed into the Mekong. The pollution, linked to mines controlled by an armed ethnic militia, has rendered the water unsafe for bathing, farming, and fishing, impacting communities and ecosystems.
