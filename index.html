        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending bill is facing resistance from House Republicans due to concerns over spending cuts, particularly to Medicaid, and state and local tax deductions. Four right-wing lawmakers are pushing for steeper cuts to avoid increasing the national debt, while others object to the proposed cap on local tax deductions. Speaker Johnson has promised minor modifications to address some concerns, but disagreements remain, and the Senate is planning its own adjustments to the legislation. The 1,116-page bill has cleared the budget committee but faces a tough path to passage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada have issued strong condemnations of Israel's plans to escalate the war in Gaza and its blockade of humanitarian aid, calling the actions "disproportionate" and "egregious." Britain has suspended free-trade talks with Israel, while the three countries demanded an end to the renewed military offensive and restrictions on aid. Prime Minister Netanyahu defended Israel's actions, accusing the allies of rewarding Hamas, but the growing death toll and humanitarian crisis in Gaza are straining diplomatic support for Israel.

          <p>An unusual alliance is emerging in the United States, pushing for restrictions on the weedkiller atrazine, which has been linked to reproductive problems and cancer. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is leading a "Make America Healthy Again" commission that aims to highlight the dangers of pesticides like atrazine. This effort has garnered support from environmental groups, some members of the Trump administration, and men's rights influencers, creating an unwieldy coalition against the powerful agricultural and chemicals lobby.

          <p>President Trump intervened to urge House Republicans to support his legislative agenda, specifically telling them not to "mess with Medicaid" and to approve the current tax bill. This comes as hard-liners are pushing for stricter Medicaid cuts and a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. Trump expressed impatience with Republican holdouts, but some remain unconvinced, seeking further changes before the bill goes to the House Rules Committee. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the bill, calling for the committee meeting to be rescheduled for debate in daylight.</p>

The move comes as Google faces increasing competition from AI-driven platforms and antitrust pressures, and the company is trying to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors can.

While rapid compensation was expected, only 100 people have received payouts so far, prompting concerns about the slow progress and flaws in the compensation scheme.

Opposition from the "SALT Caucus" threatens to derail the legislation, which Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson hope to pass before Memorial Day weekend. A proposal in the bill calls for the deduction to be raised to $30,000, but this is not enough for some GOP lawmakers from high-tax states.

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden’s recent diagnosis of "aggressive" prostate cancer, doctors have provided insights into what it means for the cancer to be "hormone-sensitive." The designation indicates the cancer may respond to hormone therapies, a common treatment that decreases the body's level of testosterone. While most prostate cancers are initially hormone-sensitive, they can eventually become hormone-resistant, meaning they no longer respond to hormone therapy. Monitoring disease progression involves PSA blood tests and imaging studies, with the "ultimate test" being observation of cancer behavior after lowering testosterone levels.</p>

Guidelines advise against screening after age 70, as many men have slow-growing cancers that pose no threat.

Experts caution against overestimating the power of the PSA test and emphasize the potential harms of treatment, including impotence, incontinence, and radiation damage.

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that he intends to reduce his political spending, a significant change after his major support for President Trump's campaign. Musk, who spent over $250 million on Trump's campaign, told an economic conference in Qatar that he plans to do "a lot less" spending in the future. He also affirmed his commitment to leading Tesla for another five years. This announcement follows his decision to step back from leading the controversial White House effort to slash federal spending, known as Doge.</p>

          <p>A new law in Washington state requiring priests to report child abuse disclosed during confession has sparked conflict between the Catholic Church and the federal government. The Archdiocese of Seattle has threatened to excommunicate priests who comply with the law, while the Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation, calling the law "anti-Catholic." The law mandates clergy to report child abuse without exemptions for information learned during confession, which was previously considered privileged. The church argues the law violates constitutional protections for religious freedom.</p>

The book also alleges that Beau remained in office as Delaware's attorney general despite showing signs of deterioration and undergoing treatments under an alias.

UCLA presented the West Coast premiere Sunday of Tod Machover’s “Schoenberg in Hollywood” at the Nimoy Theater. The opera is basically a phantasmagoria of how Schoenberg got to Hollywood, and it is a clever series of short flashbacks of Schoenberg’s life, with film accompaniment. The performance by the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music ensemble, conducted by Neal Stulberg, makes the high/low dichotomy irrelevant, leading us to a profound middle ground.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, who was the biggest presidential campaign donor in 2024, said on Tuesday that he plans to scale back his political spending. Musk, the world's richest person, funneled nearly $300 million into the campaign of President Trump, becoming a top political donor and a symbolically potent ally of the president. Musk has appeared alongside the president in the Oval Office to tout his work with the U.S. DOGE Service, an initiative aggressively focused on trimming federal government spending, having laid off thousands of government employees and helped to unwind entire agencies. Musk said on Tuesday he will be attending a dinner with Trump on Wednesday, proof that the executive is still in Trump's inner circle, even if his prominence appears to be waning.</p>

          <p>Britain has struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, showing it can engage with both major partners. However, these deals required painful concessions and highlight Britain’s diminished position post-Brexit. While the deals offer benefits, such as reduced tariffs and easier travel, they do not fully compensate for the economic losses incurred by leaving the EU. To secure the deals, Britain made politically fraught concessions, such as allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters and granting greater access to American agricultural products.</p>

The 30-page treaty lays out a framework for preventing pandemics from even starting — by boosting surveillance of animals to lower risk of viruses spilling over to humans — as well as responding more effectively once pandemics do come, for example by providing protective equipment to health care workers and aligning regulatory systems to help expand access to treatments. Before the treat goes into effect, 60 countries must ratify the agreement internally — an in-country vote.</p>

Williams faces 10 counts of principle to simple escape and malfeasance in office. The public official in charge of the jail, Orleans parish sheriff Susan Hutson, has since said faulty locks and cell doors, along with well-documented staffing shortages at the jail, were among the key factors in the breakout.</p>
