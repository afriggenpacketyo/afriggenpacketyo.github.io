          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has commenced a four-day visit to Vietnam and the Philippines, aiming to strengthen security and economic cooperation amidst China's growing regional influence. This marks Ishiba's third visit to Southeast Asia since assuming office. Discussions will encompass defense equipment provision to Vietnam under Japan's "official security assistance" program, and potential intelligence-sharing pacts with the Philippines. Ishiba also intends to address concerns from Japanese companies operating in these countries, given the potential economic impacts of U.S. tariffs on the fast-growing ASEAN bloc. Japan views Southeast Asia as geopolitically important and the world's engine of growth amid increasing international uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, once projected as a high-round pick, was selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round of the NFL draft, a significant drop attributed to concerns raised during scouting combine interviews. Despite questions about his work ethic and ability to process complex NFL schemes, Sanders now faces the challenge of proving his worth in a competitive quarterback room. He must adapt to the Browns' offensive system, known for its complexity, and demonstrate his commitment to hard work and team play. Sanders' college success was achieved despite a struggling offensive line, showcasing his resilience, but his NFL journey requires a shift from calling the shots to adhering to a system.</p>

          <p>George Clooney claims he and his wife, Amal, have never argued in their 11 years of marriage, prompting reflections on the role of wealth and beauty in relationships. The author muses on whether a life free from material problems eliminates the grounds for arguments, contrasting this with the reality of ordinary couples who navigate everyday grievances. Arguments, when respectful, can be productive tools in relationships, particularly in addressing imbalances in household chores. The author advocates for clear communication of boundaries and the willingness to walk away if those lines are crossed, regardless of the presence of relationship experts or luxury items.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's policies, including government job cuts, hiring freezes, and attacks on diversity programs, are undermining the Black middle class, which has historically relied on federal employment for stability and upward mobility. Black workers are disproportionately represented in the federal workforce, making them particularly vulnerable to these changes. Federal jobs have traditionally offered benefits and career advancement opportunities that are harder to find in the private sector. Experts worry that the dismantling of DEI programs will further marginalize Black federal employees, potentially impacting their career prospects and the economic well-being of Black communities.</p>

While acknowledging Trump's unique capacity to inflict harm, the author suggests that his hubris, greed, and policy failures will create instability. Despite challenges to US democracy and the international order, the author believes Trump's own actions, such as his tariff war and pursuit of corrupt deals, will be his undoing. Ultimately, Trump's greatest enemy is himself, and his instability will lead to his destruction.</p>
