          <p>Former New York Giants linebacker Micheal Barrow was arrested at a Florida airport following a family altercation that turned physical. According to reports, during a verbal disagreement, Barrow's fist inadvertently struck his wife, causing her to fall to the ground.

          <p>Parents and health experts in the UK are raising alarms over a lack of dedicated children's continence services, leading to a ten-year high in hospital admissions for constipation. The article highlights distressing cases, including a toddler whose condition became life-threatening before being properly diagnosed, illustrating a systemic failure to take the issue seriously. Charities report a spike in calls for help, citing that the absence of specialized bladder and bowel services creates a postcode lottery for care.

          <p>Four former Milwaukee hotel workers involved in the 2024 death of D'Vontaye Mitchell, who died after being held down in a dogpile, have been sentenced to probation and time served, avoiding further imprisonment. The incident, which drew comparisons to the killing of George Floyd, ended after Mitchell was pinned down for eight to nine minutes. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide by suffocation, with cocaine and methamphetamine as contributing factors. The sentences have brought an end to a case that highlighted issues of accountability and excessive force.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 268,000 Venezuelan migrants who were covered under a 2021 designation. This move revokes their legal status and work permits, making them eligible for deportation unless they can secure other legal means to remain in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security argued that TPS acts as a magnet for illegal immigration and that its termination is necessary for border security. Affected individuals are being urged to use a government app to arrange for self-deportation.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov survey indicates that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the national economy, with most describing it as "uncertain" and "struggling." Persistently high prices are a primary driver of this sentiment, as two-thirds of respondents report that prices are still rising and expect them to continue to do so. While personal financial ratings vary by income, the overall outlook remains pessimistic, with a majority believing the economy is worsening and a quarter anticipating a recession.

The new deals will provide millions of subscribers with access to C-SPAN's unfiltered coverage of government proceedings.

In her decision, Judge Allison Burroughs stated that while Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism, the government used the issue as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault."

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have charged six people with terrorism offenses related to encouraging support for Palestine Action, a group proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The charges stem from an investigation into public gatherings in London, Manchester, and Cardiff, as well as online meetings held over the summer. The arrests were made in London, Cumbria, and South Yorkshire ahead of another planned demonstration. Since Palestine Action was banned in July, membership or showing support for the group is an offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests China's recent military parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, sends a clear message to the U.S. about a new center of global power. This display, combined with a recent economic summit where Chinese, Russian, and Indian leaders met, illustrates how President Trump's "America First" tariff policies may be pushing nations to form new alliances. The article posits that Trump's mercantilist approach, intended to protect U.S. industry, is creating geopolitical risks. These risks are compounded by domestic legal challenges that could dismantle the new tariff regime, potentially leaving the administration's strategy with all risk and no reward.</p>

          <p>In an interview, seven women who were sexually exploited by Jeffrey Epstein have made a public plea to Congress and the Trump administration for the release of all remaining files related to his case. They argue that full transparency is necessary to reveal the scope of his crimes and allow victims to heal, rather than letting conspiracy theories flourish. The survivors also responded to President Trump's dismissal of the transparency push as a "hoax," with one Republican survivor offering to meet with him to explain the personal cost of delayed justice and the weaponization of their trauma.</p>

Rubio stated such strikes may continue, raising concerns in Mexico about potential unilateral U.S. actions against cartels on its own territory.

          <p>With a government funding deadline less than four weeks away, congressional leaders are already engaged in a partisan blame game over a potential shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson accused Democrats of pushing for a shutdown, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer claimed Republicans are refusing to work in a bipartisan manner. A key point of contention is the Democratic demand to reverse Medicaid cuts from President Trump's recent legislative package in exchange for their votes on a stopgap funding measure. The White House's recent move to claw back foreign aid has further complicated negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The projected cost for expanding the Los Angeles Convention Center has risen again, now reaching $2.7 billion, a $483 million increase in just six months. City officials are increasingly concerned that the project's first phase may not be completed in time for the 2028 Olympics and that crucial revenue from proposed digital billboards is in jeopardy. Without that advertising income, the city's general fund would face an average annual cost of $111 million through 2058 to cover the debt. This massive financial risk is causing some council members to question the affordability of the current plan. (not investment advice)</p>

While the U.S. has designated the Tren de Aragua cartel as a terrorist organization, experts told BBC Verify this does not automatically make its members lawful military targets under the UN charter or the law of the sea.</p>

The announcement drew immediate criticism from physician groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, who warned that the move is dangerous, reckless, and could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>
