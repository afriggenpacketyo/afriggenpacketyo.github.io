        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck in the Drake Passage, triggering a tsunami warning for Chile's Magallanes region and parts of the Chilean Antarctic Territory, as well as precautionary measures in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego. Thousands were evacuated to higher ground, including residents of Puerto Williams and Puerto Natales in Chile, and approximately 2,000 people from the Argentine coastline. Chilean President Gabriel Boric called for evacuation of the coastline, and authorities advised residents to remain in safety zones. There have been no reports of damage or injuries so far, and Chile is frequently affected by earthquakes due to its location at the convergence of three tectonic plates.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has expressed his wish for reconciliation with the Royal Family, stating he is "devastated" after losing a legal challenge regarding his security in the UK. In an emotional BBC interview, the Duke of Sussex mentioned his father "won't speak to me because of this security stuff" and voiced concerns about bringing his wife and children back to the UK due to safety issues. Despite disagreements, he stated he has "forgiven" his family and hopes for a resolution, especially given King Charles's health, but feels "let down" by the Royal Household's influence on security decisions.</p>

          <p>The remedies trial in the U.S. government's antitrust case against Google regarding its advertising technology is scheduled to begin on September 22, following a ruling that Google held illegal monopolies in online advertising markets. Judge Leonie Brinkema determined Google willfully acquired and maintained monopoly power by tying its publisher ad server and ad exchange. This follows an earlier ruling that Google holds a monopoly in internet search, making it a significant antitrust case in the tech industry. Google is simultaneously navigating antitrust allegations and increasing competition in the generative AI market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposed budget for the 2026 fiscal year calls for $163 billion in cuts to federal spending, according to the White House. The cuts would affect the Department of Education, the Department of Health and Human Services, USAID, and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others. The budget proposal includes a 13% increase in defense spending, bringing it to $1.01 trillion, and allocates $175 billion towards the southern border.

          <p>Trade tensions between the United States and China are escalating, with communication so strained that the two nations cannot agree on whether negotiations are even taking place. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent downplayed President Trump's claim of a call from President Xi Jinping, while China's foreign ministry denied holding consultations on tariffs. The Trump administration, focused on reaching trade deals with other countries, has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to a minimum of 145 percent, prompting retaliatory measures from China. The IMF has lowered growth outlooks for both countries, warning that the tariffs have made a downturn more likely.</p>

The index has gained over 5% since the start of the year, driven by defensive giants like healthcare and energy, and supported by a high dividend yield. Analysts suggest the UK's neutral trade status and robust corporate results have contributed to the rally, with potential for further gains if defensive stocks remain in favor. However, risks such as geopolitical tensions, revived tariffs, and a stronger pound could impact the index's upward momentum.</p>

Dr. Girish Kulkarni stresses that blood in the urine, even if it occurs only once, should never be ignored and requires thorough assessment. Other signs include pain or burning during urination, frequent and urgent urination, and experiencing symptoms despite no signs of infection. Smoking is identified as the number one risk factor, with occupational exposures to chemicals also contributing to the risk.</p>

          <p>The expiration of the de minimis tariff loophole, which allowed low-value packages to enter the U.S. duty-free, is set to make cheaper goods from China more expensive for U.S. consumers. Retailers like Shein and Temu, who relied on this loophole, are expected to raise prices, while American shoppers will face higher costs for imported goods. The change could also cause delays in shipments as U.S. Customs and Border Protection face the challenge of inspecting millions of additional packages daily. While U.S. manufacturers may benefit, consumers are likely to see a diminished market and potentially turn to resale platforms to stretch budgets.</p>

Buzzi's career included stage, television, and film appearances, but she was most recognized for her character Gladys, a spinster who warded off unwanted advances with her purse. Her character was a vivid, and hilarious, representative of the confusion that reigned among an older, more conservative generation surprised by the sexual revolution. In addition to her role on "Laugh-In," Buzzi also appeared on "Sesame Street" and in celebrity roasts, where she continued to wield her purse as Gladys.</p>

Trump's tariff policies are blamed for the economic downturn, and consumer confidence has plummeted. Despite promises to end wars in Ukraine and Gaza, those conflicts continue, and his expansionist threats to other countries have yielded little success.</p>

This discovery could lead to the creation of a universal antivenom, addressing a dire global health problem that affects millions of people each year. The researchers found that two powerful antibodies from Friede's blood, when combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. The team plans to test the treatment in Australia and hopes to identify another component to extend full protection to all 19 snake species.</p>

While local authorities claim there is enough water, environmentalists argue that over-extraction could lead to contamination and that water-intensive industries should not be allowed in Brandenburg.
