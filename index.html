          <p>Luxury carmaker Porsche will be removed from Germany's DAX blue-chip index due to a significant slump in its share price. The company has been heavily impacted by U.S. tariffs on European autos, which have contributed to weakened demand and a slower transition to electric vehicles. Despite the setback, which has seen company shares fall by over a third in the last year, Porsche's CEO has stated the company aims to rejoin the prestigious index as soon as possible.</p>

This move occurs amidst escalating trade tensions, including new Chinese tariffs on U.S. optical fiber products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Women who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell are publicly calling for the complete release of all Justice Department files related to the case. Speaking on Capitol Hill, survivors argued that transparency is essential for justice and to hold all responsible individuals, regardless of their status, accountable for their actions. Their plea comes after a partial release of documents, which they deemed insufficient and heavily redacted, while President Trump has dismissed the calls as a "hoax."</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that the Chinese public's view on global leadership is more nuanced than often perceived in the West. Conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre, the survey found that a plurality of respondents (48%) believe China is interested in a shared leadership role with the U.S., implying a preference for peaceful coexistence. This contrasts with the common American belief that China seeks to displace the U.S. and create a new world order.</p>

          <p>A new federal immigration detention facility has opened within the Louisiana State Penitentiary, also known as Angola, a prison with a notorious history. The facility is intended to house undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes, with officials stating its infamous reputation was a factor in its selection. This "Louisiana Lockup" is part of a partnership between the Trump administration and the state to expand detention capacity for the administration's large-scale deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>A BBC analysis suggests that China's massive military parade serves as a clear message to the world, and particularly to the U.S., about its rising global power. The article connects this display to President Trump's "America First" trade policies, which may be inadvertently pushing nations like China, Russia, and India closer together. This geopolitical shift, combined with domestic legal challenges to the tariffs, presents significant risks to the administration's high-stakes economic strategy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to revoke approximately $2 billion in research grants from Harvard University. The ruling stated that the government violated the university's First Amendment rights, suggesting the administration used claims of antisemitism as a pretext for an ideologically motivated attack. The White House has vowed to appeal the decision, which represents a major legal victory for the Ivy League institution.</p>
