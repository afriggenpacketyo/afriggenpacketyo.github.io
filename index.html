          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, humanitarian agencies warn that it is insufficient to prevent a famine in the coming weeks. The United Nations reports delays in dispatching supplies due to security clearance issues and logistical problems caused by bombings and destroyed roads. While hundreds of trucks are ready behind the border, movement to distribution points is slow, with supplies piling up due to ongoing conflict and lack of resources. The situation is dire, with the majority of Gaza's population facing severe food insecurity, necessitating at least 500 trucks of aid daily to avert a famine. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico despite fears of harm.

The judge criticized the lack of due process and noted the man poses no security threat, highlighting the administration's controversial deportation policies.

          <p>President Trump used his West Point commencement address to congratulate cadets and take credit for the United States' military power.

Trump also touted the end of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at military academies, focusing the military on crushing adversaries and defending the American flag. While claiming a new peacetime recruiting record, CBS News found that military records show enlistments began rebounding before Election Day, likely due to recruitment reforms introduced during the previous administration. </p>
