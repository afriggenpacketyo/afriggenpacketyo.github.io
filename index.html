        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia is reviving its Soviet-era "Intervision" song contest as a direct response to being banned from Eurovision following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Positioned as a platform for "traditional values," the event explicitly counters Eurovision's pro-LGBTQ+ stance and aims to foster national identity among participating nations, including BRICS members. With a significant cash prize, organizers hope to attract a large international audience, showcasing a cultural and geopolitical alternative to the popular Western competition. The contest highlights the deepening cultural divide between Russia and Europe.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released by the Taliban after being detained in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for decades, were reunited with their daughter in Qatar before returning to the UK. While the Taliban cited violations of Afghan law for their detention, no specific reasons were ever disclosed. The release was secured following negotiations brokered by Qatar, with UK officials expressing gratitude for the diplomatic efforts involved.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested an Article 4 consultation with NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets allegedly violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The incursion prompted Italy, Finland, and Sweden to scramble their own jets in response, highlighting the heightened state of alert along NATO's eastern flank. Russia has denied the violation, but the incident follows similar breaches reported by Poland and Romania. This move underscores the escalating tensions in the region as NATO countries are forced to focus on their own territorial defense amid Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

France, however, faces significant challenges with key players suspended or injured, including Manae Feleu and Lina Queyroi. The match represents a chance for France to achieve a historic first World Cup final appearance, while England aims to solidify its era of dominance.</p>

At least three rounds hit a window of the station on Friday afternoon, though fortunately, no injuries were reported among the staff inside. Police have not yet identified a suspect or a motive for the attack, which they have deemed unacceptable and an attack on media partners. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the incident, stating that any act of violence toward journalists is an attack on democracy itself.</p>

          <p>A leading Japanese defense researcher has warned that weakening ties between the United States and India, coupled with waning U.S. interest in regional alliances, are creating a strategic vacuum that China could exploit. The expert specifically pointed to the reduced engagement in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which includes Japan, Australia, India, and the U.S. President Trump's decision not to attend a recent Quad summit is seen as a sign of deteriorating partnership, which could undermine the collective effort to maintain a strategic balance against China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, an executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and a colleague were convicted of importing hundreds of kilograms of fentanyl precursors into the United States, often disguised as everyday goods, and laundering the proceeds through cryptocurrency. This case marked the first time the U.S. charged Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country, rather than to cartels in Mexico. The prosecution highlights a key focus of U.S. efforts to combat the deadly fentanyl crisis.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals Widespread Fraud and Counterfeit Goods on Walmart's Online Marketplace</h2>

          <p>A recent investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party online marketplace. Shoppers have received fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements and beauty products, from sellers who used stolen identities of legitimate businesses to create their accounts. The report suggests that in its push to compete with Amazon, Walmart relaxed its seller vetting processes, creating an environment described as the "Wild West." In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly begun to tighten its verification requirements for sellers in certain categories.</p>

          <p>Recent threats of regulatory action against ABC have raised questions about the powers of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Created in 1934, the FCC is an independent agency that regulates interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. While it holds significant authority over local broadcast stations, including the power to grant and, in theory, revoke licenses, it has limited jurisdiction over cable channels or online content. The FCC is led by five commissioners appointed by the president, with no more than three from the same political party, and is legally barred from engaging in censorship.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have approved a deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. The reported agreement would see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing the app to continue operating in the country. While Trump described the call as productive, official Chinese state media offered a more reserved confirmation, stating Beijing welcomes negotiations. A key point of contention remains the ownership and control of TikTok's powerful algorithm, which pushes content to its 170 million American users.</p>
