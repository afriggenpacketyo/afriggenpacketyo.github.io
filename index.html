          <p>Emergency services in eastern Germany are continuing to combat significant forest fires, particularly in the Gohrischheide region on the border of Saxony and Brandenburg. Hundreds of firefighters have been deployed to the area, where the situation remains challenging. In the nearby state of Thuringia, however, authorities report that a separate large fire has been stabilized and brought under control, preventing it from spreading further overnight. The Thuringian government described it as the largest fire of its kind in over 30 years.</p>

          <p>Alice Weidel, leader of Germany's far-right AfD party, has condemned a push by the center-left SPD to consider a constitutional ban on her party, comparing it to dark periods in German history. This comes as the AfD's domestic intelligence assessment cites extremist tendencies, a label the party is challenging in court. Separately, the left-wing populist BSW party, led by Sahra Wagenknecht, has indicated an openness to holding talks with the AfD, drawing criticism from other parties for potentially normalizing the far-right.</p>

          <p>The western German city of Cologne is expecting hundreds of thousands of attendees for its annual Christopher Street Day (CSD) Pride parade, one of Europe's largest LGBTQ+ events. The celebration, held under the motto "For queer rights. Many. Together. Strong.," is expected to draw around 60,000 active participants and 90 floats. Meanwhile, smaller Pride events in eastern Germany, such as in the town of Falkensee, were met with peaceful counter-demonstrations from far-right groups, highlighting ongoing social tensions within the country.</p>

          <p>Actress Candace Cameron Bure has expressed concern over current Hollywood weight-loss trends, such as the use of drugs like Ozempic, calling them potentially "scary" and triggering.

          <p>A new clinical trial has shown that a single gene therapy injection can reverse a form of congenital deafness within weeks. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, restoring the function of a protein crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial, which included children and adults, showed considerable hearing improvement, with one seven-year-old girl regaining nearly her full hearing. Researchers are hopeful this method can be adapted for other genetic forms of deafness.</p>

          <p>A shop owner in Durham, UK, has criticized the justice system after a man who stole a crate of beer from his store avoided criminal charges. The owner, Andrew Board, personally apprehended the thief, who was then dealt with through a community resolution, requiring only that he pay for the stolen goods and be banned from the shop. Board argues that this lack of meaningful punishment fails to deter criminals and reflects a broader national issue where most shoplifting reports do not lead to court action.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made his first public appearance since the start of the recent 12-day war between Iran and Israel. He attended a religious mourning ceremony in Tehran, ending speculation that he was in seclusion in a bunker, particularly after US-led bombings targeted key Iranian nuclear sites. The appearance comes amid high tensions, with Iran having suspended cooperation with the UN's nuclear watchdog and confirming over 900 deaths in the conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ordered a new, robust investigation into MI5 after finding that the security service provided false and misleading evidence to three different courts. The case centers on MI5's attempts to conceal its relationship with a violent, misogynistic neo-Nazi who was working as a state agent, even after the BBC uncovered his abuse of women. The court ruled MI5's internal inquiries were "deficient," raising the possibility of contempt of court proceedings against individuals for the deception.</p>
