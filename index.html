          <p>Analysis by the University and College Union reveals that UK universities have announced over 12,000 job cuts in the past year, with further savings equivalent to 3,000 more jobs planned. The union is balloting for strike action over a low pay offer, while employers cite severe financial challenges, with four in ten English universities now in deficit. The cuts are causing significant stress for staff, who face career uncertainty, and are impacting student services and morale.</p>

          <p>Amid significant political instability that has seen five prime ministers in under two years, France is facing comparisons to Italy's past turmoil, prompting discussions about appointing a technocratic government. The outgoing prime minister suggested the next leader should be disconnected from the 2027 presidential race to focus on solving the country's immediate problems, including passing a difficult budget. While a non-political government led by an expert, such as the head of the central bank, could reassure investors, the idea faces strong resistance from the French public, which is known for its deep political engagement.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's path to becoming Japan's first female prime minister is in jeopardy after the Komeito party reportedly quit the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The split, which ends a political alliance in place since 1999, stems from Komeito's dissatisfaction with the LDP's handling of political funding issues. This development leaves the LDP as a minority government and complicates the parliamentary vote to confirm Takaichi, a hardline conservative and proponent of 'Abenomics', as the new prime minister.</p>

          <p>China has strongly criticized Taiwanese President William Lai's recent speech, labeling him a "warmaker" for promoting what it calls "fallacies of Taiwan independence." A mainland foreign ministry spokesman warned that Lai's plans to significantly increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2030 would drag the island into a dangerous conflict. Beijing reiterated its firm opposition to US arms sales to Taiwan and stressed that maintaining peace requires upholding the one-China principle and rejecting Taiwanese independence.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese warships have arrived in Cambodia for a friendship and training visit, a move that comes during a period of diplomatic sensitivity in Southeast Asia. The visit aims to strengthen cooperation between the two close allies, though it occurs amid lingering tensions from a recent border conflict between Cambodia and neighboring Thailand, which has expressed concern over Beijing's arming of Cambodia. To ease political concerns, the ships docked at a commercial port rather than the Ream Naval Base, which the U.S. suspects is becoming a de facto Chinese military outpost.</p>

          <p>Roy Lee Ward, 53, was executed by lethal injection in Indiana for the 2001 sexual assault and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne. This marks the state's third execution since resuming capital punishment last year after a long pause. Ward had exhausted his legal appeals over two decades, and his execution proceeded despite concerns raised by his attorneys about the state's lethal injection drug protocol. The victim's family expressed that justice was carried out for the devastating loss they have endured.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's stock suffered its worst trading day in history after the luxury automaker's updated financial guidance for 2030 fell short of analyst expectations. The company also scaled back its electrification goals, now aiming for only 20% of its lineup to be fully electric by 2030, down from a previous target of 40%. The disappointing forecast and revised strategy, attributed to a "client-centric approach" and changing market conditions, prompted a more than 15% drop in its share price.

          <p>The free speech director for England's higher education watchdog, the Office for Students (OfS), has warned that universities could face sanctions if pro-Palestinian protests lead to the harassment or discrimination of Jewish students. The regulator, which has the power to issue fines and revoke degree-awarding abilities, is prepared to act if universities fail to protect students from antisemitic harassment. This warning follows a series of campus protests on the anniversary of the October 7th Hamas attack, which raised concerns about rising antisemitism.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has significantly downgraded its forecast for China's real estate market, predicting an 8% drop in new home sales for 2025, much steeper than the previously expected 3% decline. This extends the industry's slump to a fifth consecutive year, primarily due to fragile homebuyer sentiment and what analysts see as insufficient government support. The report notes that with sales potentially halving from their 2021 peak, a market turnaround remains elusive, and it anticipates a further 6-7% sales decline in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

While Gerrard claimed the team lacked unity, Rooney argued that the players worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line" in major tournaments. Rooney suggested that intense club rivalries made relationships difficult but insisted it did not affect their effort on the pitch, contrasting it with the more collegial atmosphere among today's players.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has found evidence that over 1,000 Airbnb listings in London are duplicates created by landlords to bypass the city's 90-night annual limit for short-term lets. This rule is intended to protect the long-term housing supply, but landlords are creating multiple ads for the same property to continue renting them out year-round illegally. While one local council called the practice a "mockery" of the law, Airbnb stated that it has an automatic counter and acts on reports from authorities when hosts evade the rules.</p>
