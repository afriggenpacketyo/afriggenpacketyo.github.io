          <p>Federal and local authorities are investigating the incident where a Mexican tall ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, leading to the deaths of two individuals and injuries to several others. The ship's masts snapped upon impact as sailors were performing a ceremonial departure. Senator Schumer has raised concerns about potential impacts of budget cuts on Coast Guard operations, specifically questioning the functionality of the vehicle traffic service (VTS). The NTSB has dispatched a team to investigate the crash, while officials confirm the bridge's structural integrity remains intact.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones.

Mr. Biden's cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade cancer. Since leaving office, Mr. Biden has largely kept a low profile, though he has participated in interviews to push back against claims that he suffered from mental decline.</p>

          <p>After 25 years with Bayern Munich, Thomas MÃ¼ller bid farewell to fans, responding to rumors of a move to LAFC in the MLS with "uno nunca sabe" (you never know). MÃ¼ller's potential arrival could see him joining Lionel Messi, Luis SuÃ¡rez, and other European stars in the MLS. This comes as MÃ¼ller's contract with Bayern was not renewed, potentially ending his career-long association with the club. The FC Bayern celebrated their Bundesliga championships in Marienplatz, marking MÃ¼ller's last official appearance with the team.</p>
