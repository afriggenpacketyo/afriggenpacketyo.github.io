          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell publicly clashed over the costs of renovating the Fed's headquarters. During a site visit, Trump claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, stating it included a building completed five years prior. This confrontation occurs amidst ongoing tension, with Trump criticizing Powell's interest rate policies and previously suggesting the renovation's expense could be grounds for his dismissal. The project, complicated by historic preservation needs and rising material costs, is a focal point for the president's criticism of the Fed's leadership and independence.</p>

          <p>A senior Department of Justice official is scheduled to meet with Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking network. The meeting, confirmed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, aims to gather any information Maxwell might have about other individuals involved in Epstein's crimes. This development comes as the Trump administration faces increasing pressure to release files related to the case, following a recent DOJ memo stating no "client list" exists. Meanwhile, a House subcommittee has voted to subpoena the DOJ for the files and has also subpoenaed Maxwell to testify.</p>

          <p>Thousands of EE and BT customers across the United Kingdom experienced a significant network outage, leaving them unable to make or receive voice calls. The disruption also temporarily affected some users' ability to contact emergency services, although the government confirmed that 999 call functionality was restored. BT, which owns EE, acknowledged a technical fault was responsible for the issue and later announced the problem had been resolved with services returning to normal. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is in contact with BT to determine the full scale and cause of the widespread service interruption.</p>

          <p>Job postings mentioning artificial intelligence skills have surged, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years, significantly outpacing general job growth. A recent Brookings Institution report highlights that AI-related listings more than doubled in the past year alone, reflecting increased adoption of the technology by companies. While concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, these higher-paying jobs are spreading to other regions and non-tech sectors like finance and marketing. Experts note that while AI's impact is visible, it currently constitutes a small fraction of the overall labor market.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a rescissions bill to claw back $9 billion in previously allocated government funding, a rare legislative maneuver. The package targets approximately $8 billion from foreign assistance programs, including USAID, and about $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR and PBS. The measure faced contention in Congress, with some Republicans expressing concern over cuts to global AIDS programs and rural broadcast stations, leading to some adjustments in the final version.

          <p>The Trump administration is dismantling protections for unaccompanied migrant minors, creating a less visible but potentially more insidious form of family separation, according to an analysis by The Atlantic. Instead of separating families at the border, the new approach targets the system designed to move children out of enforcement and into the care of Health and Human Services. By cutting funding for legal aid and imposing stricter requirements for sponsors to claim children, the administration is causing minors to be detained for longer periods. This strategy pressures families and creates a deterrent, effectively using the child welfare system for immigration enforcement.</p>

The ruling, which leans heavily on a 2022 Supreme Court decision, argued that historical regulations cited by the state were not analogous to California's recurring background check system.

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has made a remarkable return to his best bowling form, culminating in his first five-wicket haul in a Test match since 2017. After undergoing knee and hamstring surgeries, there were doubts about his ability to bowl again at the highest level, but his dedicated rehabilitation has paid off. During the current series against India, Stokes has taken the most wickets of any bowler and is bowling at his fastest average speed since 2019. His resurgence as a potent all-rounder, capable of turning matches with crucial wickets, has been a significant boost for the England team.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that the Jeffrey Epstein case is "not a hoax" and called for "full transparency," pushing back against President Trump's framing of the issue. Johnson's comments come as the Trump administration faces bipartisan pressure to release more information about the late sex offender, with some Republicans joining Democrats in demanding the release of Justice Department files. The DOJ's recent conclusion that no "client list" exists has failed to satisfy many, fueling political division. Johnson acknowledged the public's concern and expressed his desire for anyone involved in Epstein's crimes to be brought to justice.</p>

          <p>Multiple Republican county clerks in Colorado have reported receiving alarming requests from a political consultant, allegedly working with the White House, to allow federal access to their voting equipment. The consultant, Jeff Small, reportedly told clerks he was working to implement a presidential executive order on election security. The clerks, including El Paso County's Steve Schleiker, refused the requests, noting that allowing such unauthorized access would be a felony and a violation of state law. The outreach has raised serious concerns among election officials about a murky, unofficial effort to gain access to sensitive election systems.</p>

          <p>A review of Tesla's finances reveals that its decision to sell 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 cost the company billions in potential profits. The electric vehicle maker sold the majority of its crypto assets when the market was near its low point, converting about $936 million worth of Bitcoin to cash. Had Tesla held onto its original $1.5 billion investment, the stash would be worth an estimated $5 billion today, given Bitcoin's subsequent surge. While the company's current digital assets of $1.24 billion still provide a boost to profitability, the sale represents a significant missed financial opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

He later reinvented himself as the villainous "Hollywood Hogan," leading the influential New World Order faction. Beyond wrestling, Hogan was a pop culture figure who starred in movies and television shows.

The university agreed to install a vice provost to ensure "balanced" Middle East programs and hire more faculty for Israel and Jewish Studies. While these changes may address existing biases, enshrining them in a government agreement gives the administration a template to pressure other universities and pursue ideological purges on campuses nationwide.</p>

In one case, a family was held at gunpoint after their Colorado plate was mistakenly matched to a stolen motorcycle from Montana.
