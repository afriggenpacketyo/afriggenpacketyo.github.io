          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill stated that the company's return to profitable growth will "take a while," acknowledging the process is not linear. Since taking over, Hill has shifted strategy away from a sole focus on direct-to-consumer digital sales, re-engaging with wholesale partners to regain lost shelf space. The company is also restructuring internally to focus on individual sports categories to spur innovation. These efforts come as Nike's stock has fallen approximately 12% over the last year, with the company also facing macroeconomic pressures like an estimated $1.5 billion in tariff costs.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has officially updated its immunization schedules, shifting its COVID-19 vaccine guidance to an "individual-based decision-making" model. This change, stemming from recommendations by a new advisory panel, moves away from broad recommendations for all, even high-risk individuals. The update also advises a standalone chickenpox vaccine for toddlers instead of the combined MMRV shot to reduce a slight risk of febrile seizures. These new guidelines diverge from the recommendations of major medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, raising concerns among some experts about potential public confusion.</p>

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' sentencing to over four years in prison on federal prostitution charges, his former protégé Aubrey O'Day issued a public warning. O'Day, a member of the Diddy-formed group Danity Kane, advised young artists to walk away immediately from anyone in a position of power who oversteps boundaries. In her statement, she emphasized that no dream is worth the potential pain and exploitation, noting that victims often suffer more than their abusers are punished. The judge in Combs' case rejected the notion that the events were consensual, stating the rapper had abused his power and control over women.</p>

While the victim had injuries consistent with a dog attack, the medical examiner has yet to determine if the injuries occurred before or after his death. Miami-Dade Animal Services confiscated 11 dogs from the property, though their involvement in the man's death has not been confirmed pending the official investigation.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered a significant, multi-year agreement to purchase gigawatts of AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a move seen as a major challenge to Nvidia's dominance in the sector. The deal, which AMD expects to generate tens of billions in revenue, caused AMD's stock to surge while Nvidia's saw a slight dip. OpenAI, which also has a major investment deal with Nvidia, stated the need for immense computing power to meet demand for its AI products like ChatGPT.

          <h2>Analysis Shows Minimum Payments on a $10,000 Credit Card Balance Primarily Cover Interest</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card interest rates currently at 22.25%, making only the minimum payment on a significant balance like $10,000 can be a costly long-term strategy. An analysis of common minimum payment formulas shows that a large portion of the payment goes toward interest, barely reducing the principal debt. For example, a typical calculation of 1% of the balance plus interest would result in only $100 of the initial payment reducing the principal. Financial experts warn this practice is designed to keep consumers in debt for years, potentially costing them more in interest than the original amount borrowed.</p>

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a federal lawsuit to block the Trump administration from federalizing and deploying the National Guard to the city. The complaint argues there is no insurrection or rebellion to justify such a move, which it claims violates the Posse Comitatus Act prohibiting domestic use of the military for law enforcement. The lawsuit alleges that Illinois is being targeted because its leadership has politically fallen out of favor with the president. This legal action follows similar challenges from other states, like Oregon, against what they term unconstitutional federal overreach.</p>

          <p>Newly qualified resident doctors in England have voted overwhelmingly in favor of strike action due to a severe shortage of available training positions. The British Medical Association (BMA) reports that thousands of doctors are unable to secure jobs as they advance in their careers, with this year seeing 30,000 candidates for only 10,000 available posts. The union argues it is absurd to have skilled doctors unemployed while patient waiting lists remain high. This mandate for industrial action adds a new point of contention to ongoing negotiations with the government, which have thus far focused on pay and working conditions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops from California to Portland, Oregon. The ruling came after California and Oregon filed for the order, arguing the deployment was an unconstitutional use of military force for domestic law enforcement. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, stated there was no evidence to justify the necessity of federalized troops to handle protests in the city. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of using the National Guard in cities led by political opponents.</p>

          <p>Doan's Bakery in Los Angeles is voluntarily recalling its White Chocolate Coconut cake, famous for being actor Tom Cruise's annual holiday gift to friends and colleagues. The recall, which also includes the bakery's Carrot Bundt cake, was initiated after a routine inspection discovered the products contained undeclared wheat and milk. According to the FDA, these undeclared allergens pose a serious risk to individuals with specific food allergies. The bakery has since updated its labeling and stated that no illnesses or allergic reactions have been reported in connection with the issue.</p>

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is seeking to strengthen its relationship with the Trump administration and the broader MAGA movement in the United States. AfD deputy chair Beatrix von Storch recently met with Trump administration officials in Washington, discussing shared positions on issues like migration, "woke culture," and freedom of speech. While some in the AfD have historically been skeptical of the U.S. and shown interest in Russia's authoritarianism, the party sees ideological alignment with Trump's illiberal vision. This rapprochement is seen as a way for the AfD to gain domestic political legitimacy.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones stated that he believes current market conditions are primed for a massive rally, similar to the speculative frenzy that preceded the dot-com bubble burst in 1999. He noted that today's combination of loose fiscal and monetary policy makes the situation even more "potentially explosive" than that era. Jones warned that while the greatest price appreciation in a bull market often occurs in its final 12 months, investors must be nimble to avoid the inevitable "really, really bad end."

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries issued a public challenge to Speaker Mike Johnson for a live, primetime debate on the House floor regarding the ongoing government shutdown. In a letter, Jeffries argued a debate would provide transparency for the American people and give Johnson an opportunity to defend his "my way or the highway" approach. Johnson quickly dismissed the challenge as "desperate pleas for attention" and political theatrics, stating that the issues had already been debated before the House passed a funding bill that has since stalled in the Senate. The exchange highlights the deep partisan divide preventing a resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is distinguished from previous ones by particularly bitter partisan dynamics and a profound lack of trust between the parties. Democrats are using the shutdown to demonstrate a more forceful opposition to the Trump administration, focusing on healthcare subsidies and the president's use of executive power. Conversely, the Trump administration views the shutdown as an opportunity to push for deeper cuts to the federal workforce and spending in Democratic-run areas. This intractable stalemate, fueled by mutual accusations and a fragile U.S. economy, makes a clear path to resolution difficult to foresee.</p>

The test aims to improve methods for counting historically underrepresented populations. However, the effort is shadowed by concerns from a government watchdog and lawmakers that uncertain funding and a federal hiring freeze have put the bureau behind schedule. Local officials in some test sites also report a lack of communication from the agency, raising questions about the bureau's readiness for this critical preparatory phase.</p>

The inquest also revealed that hard-wired smoke alarms in the home had been removed and skylights in the room had been nailed shut, complicating rescue efforts.</p>
