        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Phillip C. Saunders and Joel Wuthnow of the New York Times, President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials, including high-ranking officers in the Rocket Force and General He Weidong, casts doubt on China's ability to successfully invade Taiwan by 2027. The dismissals, potentially related to corruption or ideological differences, raise questions about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil and lack of battlefield experience among officers may weaken Xi's appetite for war, offering Taiwan and the United States time to bolster their defenses.
