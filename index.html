          <p>The offshore yuan experienced a surge against the US dollar amidst ongoing US-China trade discussions, fueled by optimistic reports of potential breakthroughs. The currency moved from 7.24 to 7.22 per US dollar, reflecting market anticipation of constructive outcomes from the Geneva negotiations. These talks, the first formal discussions since increased tariffs by both nations, aim to alleviate trade tensions that have disrupted global supply chains and heightened recession risks. Both sides have indicated 'substantial progress,' raising hopes for a joint statement detailing the agreements made during the meeting, which could lead to a reduction in tariffs. Optimism has increased as the world awaits news of potential agreements which may be announced soon.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctors' offices to the lowest price paid by other nations. This initiative, dubbed the 'most favored nation' policy, aims to address complaints about high U.S. drug prices compared to other wealthy countries. The proposal, which would primarily affect drugs covered by Medicare Part B, faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could stifle innovation. Similar attempts by Trump during his first term were blocked by courts, citing procedural issues, and the Biden administration later abandoned the plan due to stakeholder concerns. The proposed policy is likely to only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office, such as infusions that treat cancer and other injectables.</p>

          <p>Investors reacted optimistically to reports of progress in US-China trade negotiations, although specific details remained undisclosed. Meetings between US and Chinese officials in Geneva concluded with both sides claiming 'substantial progress' and calling the talks 'candid, in-depth, and constructive.' The meetings marked the first formal negotiations since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Analysts at Wedbush Securities described the talks as a 'positive step in the right direction,' anticipating a potential initial agreement involving reduced tariff levels. The escalating trade war has raised concerns about a possible economic downturn, particularly in Asia, where economies heavily rely on trade with both China and the United States.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing scrutiny for considering accepting a luxury Boeing jet from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One, sparking ethical concerns. Critics, including far-right allies and Democratic lawmakers, have condemned the potential gift, citing rules on presidential gifts and Qatar's alleged funding of groups hostile to the U.S. The Democratic National Committee accused Trump of using the White House for personal financial gain, while others labeled the move as 'wildly illegal' and 'corruption in plain sight.' The 'flying palace' would be the most expensive gift ever received by the American government. Despite the backlash, Trump defended the idea, calling it a 'very public and transparent transaction'.</p>

The plane, a Boeing 747-8, would need to undergo security checks before being accepted and might be donated to the future Trump presidential library near the end of his term. The potential transfer is under review by both Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres has urged the Government Accountability Office to investigate the potential gift, citing ethical concerns. Trump defended the idea, calling it a 'free of charge gift' to replace the aging Air Force One, while Qatar's Media AttachÃ© disputed that the plane would be gifted during the upcoming visit.</p>

NWS fly maggots can burrow into the flesh of living animals, causing serious and often deadly damage. The USDA said NWS was recently detected in remote farms as far north as 700 miles from the U.S. border. The U.S. and Mexico are collaborating to eradicate NWS, employing strategies including field surveillance, animal movement control, and sterile insect dispersal. The suspension will continue monthly until containment is achieved.</p>

This action comes as Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) intensifies efforts to promote the island's indigenous identity while gradually eroding its historical and cultural ties with the mainland. The revised web page now states that Taiwan's registered population is 2.6% indigenous, 1.2% foreign, and 96.2% other population, prompting criticism from the KMT party for denying history.</p>

The system, ensuring affordable medical care through capped out-of-pocket costs, is now subject to rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures, analysts warn. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government aims to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased burdens on high medical cost patients. The government has since frozen the hikes, pushing the deadline for a new plan after the upper house election, indicating the system's vulnerability to political influence.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay, an idea that was blocked in court during his first term. The proposal, which he calls a 'most favored nation' pricing model, is likely to be subject to challenges in court, especially without action by Congress. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it. In his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a version of this idea for Medicare, but a federal court blocked it.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's scheduled visit to the Middle East. The release is also intended to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade for 70 days. Hamas stated that the release is part of broader efforts to achieve a ceasefire and allow food, medicine, and other supplies into Gaza. The Israeli prime minister's office acknowledged being informed by the US of Hamas's intention to release Alexander as a gesture towards the Americans, with expectations that it would lead to further hostage negotiations.</p>

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday evening that the two sides had made what he called 'substantial progress,' but that more details would be announced Monday. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng said the atmosphere had been collegial and professional, and the meeting had been an important first step to resolving differences through dialogue. The next concrete steps will include the creation of a new consultation mechanism that will involve senior officials from both countries.</p>

The boxes, sent by the German embassy in Tokyo to Argentina in 1941, contained postcards, photographs, and propaganda material from the Nazi regime. The discovery was made by court staffers preparing for a Supreme Court museum. The court has transferred the boxes to a secure room and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to participate in their preservation and inventory. Experts will examine the materials for clues about unknown aspects of the Holocaust, including international financing networks used by the Nazis.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, a decision that will force many Americans to switch medications despite research showing Zepbound results in more weight loss. This move highlights the consequences of secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, where employers pay lower drug prices but workers are blocked from getting competing treatments. Caremark claims the decision will lower drug prices for employer clients by 10 to 15 percent. Doctors prefer Zepbound for most patients but will now have less ability to tailor prescriptions. The change has sparked criticism from patients and doctors, who argue it limits treatment options and prioritizes cost over patient outcomes.</p>

Sales of these products are rising, with 8.3% of food product launches in early 2025 making protein claims. While high-protein diets are beneficial for muscle building, personal trainers emphasize whole foods over processed snacks. Manufacturers often use protein as a marketing tool, adding protein-rich ingredients to reach required levels for labeling claims. Nutrition experts caution that many of these products are ultra-processed and may not be as healthy as advertised, advising consumers to be mindful of calorie content and processing levels.</p>

          <p>A group of 49 white South Africans departed for the United States after being offered refugee status by the Trump administration under a new program. The group, including families and small children, was relocated after Donald Trump accused South Africaâ€™s Black-led government of racial discrimination against them. The South African government denies that Afrikaners are being persecuted. Refugee groups have questioned why the white South Africans are being prioritized ahead of people from countries wracked by war and natural disasters. The Trump administration says the South African government is pursuing racist, anti-white policies through affirmative action laws and a new land expropriation law it says targets Afrikanersâ€™ land.</p>

          <p>A head-to-head trial of weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has shown that Mounjaro is more effective. Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks exceeded the 14% from Wegovy. Researchers said both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may help those with more weight to lose. The trial, paid for by Mounjaro's manufacturer, involved 750 obese people and showed that 32% of people lost a quarter of their body weight on Mounjaro, compared to 16% on Wegovy.

          <p>The nomination of Jeanine Pirro as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia has drawn mixed reactions after Edward Martin's nomination collapsed. Pirro, a Fox News personality and ardent Trump loyalist, replaces Martin, a 'Stop the Steal' advocate. The selection of Pirro has triggered criticism from some Democrats, but the implosion of Martin's nomination softened some of the backlash. While Congressional Democrats issued waves of statements and comments criticizing Martin, the response to Pirro's selection was more muted in its first 48 hours. Martin will instead be assigned to a Justice Department task force and will serve as a pardon attorney.</p>
