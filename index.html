          <p>Former President Joe Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis, categorized as aggressive with metastasis to the bone, has raised questions about screening practices. A spokesperson stated Biden had never been diagnosed with prostate cancer prior to the recent discovery. Experts suggest that prostate cancer screenings are not routinely recommended for men over 70, which may explain why Biden, now 82, did not undergo screening during his last medical checkup in February 2024. The diagnosis came after Biden saw a doctor for urinary symptoms, underscoring the importance of tailoring medical decisions to the individual.</p>

          <p>The UK has escalated its response to the Gaza offensive by suspending trade deal talks with Israel, summoning the Israeli ambassador, and imposing sanctions on West Bank settlers. Foreign Secretary David Lammy condemned the military escalation as "morally unjustifiable," citing concerns about starvation in Gaza and pressure from MPs and the public. The UK's actions follow a joint statement from the UK, Canada, and France urging Israel to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel's foreign spokesman responded defiantly, stating that external pressure will not deter Israel from defending its existence.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has postponed its annual Women's Conference following advice related to the Supreme Court's ruling on the legal definition of a woman. The ruling, which defines a woman based on biological sex, prompted concerns about the conference's inclusivity and potential legal challenges. A leaked advice paper suggested restricting attendance to biological women, leading to fears of protests and security risks. The NEC voted to delay the conference and elections to the National Labour Women's Committee, pending a wider review of positive action measures, sparking condemnation from trans rights advocates and gender critical activists alike.</p>

Jason Corbett was killed in 2015 by his wife, Molly Corbett, and her father, Tom Martens, a former FBI agent, who claimed self-defense. Martens told a 911 dispatcher that he intervened in a fight between Jason and Molly, saying, "He's bleeding all over, and I, I may have killed him." Both Molly and Tom were convicted of second-degree murder in 2017 but were later granted a new trial. In 2023, they pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter and were released from prison in June 2024.</p>

Libby, who has been critical of Maine's policy on transgender athletes, was barred from speaking on the chamber floor.

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s recent diagnosis of aggressive prostate cancer has raised questions about screening guidelines, which advise against screening after age 70. Experts say that even men who test diligently may develop an aggressive cancer after a recent checkup showed no issues. Fast-growing and aggressive prostate cancers can suddenly appear between screenings, or arise without any hint on the PSA test. Medical experts and organizations are cautious about screening due to potential harms, including false-positive results and overtreatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump's complaint about Walmart blaming tariffs for price increases has ignited a debate over corporate pricing practices. While economists generally believe companies pass along tariff costs, some populist thinkers suggest companies have more pricing power than acknowledged. Factors like competition and consumer sensitivity influence pricing decisions, but some argue companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices. The debate highlights differing views on whether companies are simply responding to cost increases or engaging in price gouging.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump announced plans for the Golden Dome missile defense system, which includes putting weapons in space. The "cutting-edge missile defense system" will include "space-based sensors and interceptors." Trump stated the Golden Dome "should be fully operational by the end of my term." The system, styled after Israel's Iron Dome, aims to detect and stop missiles at all points of attack. Trump has allocated $25 billion to begin construction, with the total cost estimated at $175 billion, although the Congressional Budget Office estimates space-based components alone could cost up to $542 billion over the next 20 years.</p>

Consumers who lived in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland for at least three months during the specified period and bought goods or services from UK businesses accepting Mastercard are eligible to claim.

          <p>President Trump has unveiled plans for a futuristic "Golden Dome" missile defense system, stating it will be operational by the end of his term. The system aims to counter next-generation aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.

While an initial sum of $25 billion has been earmarked, the government estimates the system will cost much more over decades.
