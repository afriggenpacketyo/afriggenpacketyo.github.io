          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her duties pending a case for her dismissal. The action follows public outrage over a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, which conservative lawmakers argued undermined the nation's military. Deputy PM Suriya Jungrungruangkit will serve as acting leader, while Paetongtarn, the third member of the powerful Shinawatra clan to face removal from power, has 15 days to present her defense. This political turmoil adds to the challenges of a weak economy and her falling approval ratings.</p>

          <p>Former Democratic Representative and NFL player Colin Allred has officially launched his 2026 campaign for the U.S. Senate in Texas. This sets the stage for a high-profile race, with Allred potentially facing the winner of a contentious Republican primary between incumbent John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton. In his announcement, Allred positioned himself as a candidate focused on lowering costs and combating political corruption. The race is a key target for Democrats aiming to expand their Senate map, though the party has not won a statewide race in Texas since 1994.</p>

          <p>Research published in The Lancet medical journal projects that the Trump administration's decision to cut over 80% of U.S. foreign humanitarian aid funding could lead to more than 14 million additional deaths by 2030. The study estimates that a third of these potential premature deaths would be among children, warning of a shock to low- and middle-income countries comparable to a pandemic. The cuts, overseen by an initiative led by Elon Musk to shrink the federal workforce, have been widely condemned by humanitarian groups. The report highlights the reversal of two decades of health progress funded by USAID.</p>

          <p>Philip Lane, the chief economist for the European Central Bank, has stated that the institution's recent cycle of monetary policy interventions aimed at controlling inflation is now "done." He noted that the primary goal of reducing inflation from its peak back toward the 2% target has been accomplished, with the May rate at 1.9%. While this phase is over, Lane cautioned that the ECB must remain prepared to address new economic shocks and ensure price stability in the medium term. Other officials suggested that any future rate adjustments are more likely to be cuts to support Europe's slow growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the victory of socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is a dire warning for the American political right. The author posits that Mamdani's success with a platform of populist economic promises, such as price controls and a high minimum wage, should caution conservatives against adopting their own brand of right-wing populism. The piece contends that by legitimizing large-scale government intervention, the right creates a political environment where more radical left-wing populists will ultimately prevail. It calls for a return to traditional conservative principles of limited government and free enterprise.</p>

This development comes as Beijing's anti-dumping investigation into European brandy, which is mainly produced in France, nears its conclusion. According to a source, producers must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices to qualify for the refund. The move is seen as an attempt to resolve the trade dispute before the temporary tariffs of up to 39% potentially become permanent after the July 5 deadline.</p>

The announcement follows a parliamentary committee report that labeled the UK's system as one of the worst in the developed world.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the most significant single-month decline since February 2023. The slowdown may reflect weaker demand following April's changes to stamp duty, which reduced tax relief for many buyers. Despite the monthly drop, the annual growth rate was still positive at 2.1%, though this was the slowest yearly increase in nearly a year.

          <p>The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, has strongly condemned the BBC for broadcasting a Glastonbury performance by the band Bob Vylan in which the singer led the crowd in chants of "death, death to the IDF." Sir Ephraim labeled the incident a "national shame" and criticized the broadcaster's response, stating it brings confidence in its ability to handle antisemitism to a "new low." In response, the BBC expressed regret, admitting that with hindsight, they should have cut the live stream. Avon and Somerset Police have since launched a criminal investigation into the performance for a potential public order offense.</p>

Xi urged party members to remember that all power is granted by the people and called for increased public and media oversight to ensure accountability and uncover abuses.

          <p>A new Iowa law that took effect Tuesday makes it the first U.S. state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, eliminating non-discrimination protections for transgender and nonbinary residents in areas like housing and employment. The law also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents individuals from changing the sex designation on their birth certificates. Governor Kim Reynolds stated the move was necessary to secure "genuine equal protection for women and girls." The law, which also ends Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care, represents a significant rollback of LGBTQ+ rights in the state.</p>

It discusses the challenge for UK government pension policy in setting appropriate savings benchmarks, as targets that are too high can discourage lower earners, while low targets can mislead higher earners. The analysis reviews different adequacy measures, from "pounds and pence" benchmarks like those from the PLSA to relative measures like target replacement rates.

          <p>China is preparing for a major military parade on September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, where it is expected to showcase its most advanced weaponry. While the event's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe the display will serve as a strong message to the self-ruled island. The People's Liberation Army is likely to feature new equipment developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind, including fifth-generation fighter jets and new carrier-based aircraft. This display of military might, coupled with a keynote speech by President Xi Jinping, will signal China's military direction and foreign policy stance.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: French Cinema is Finally Depicting Its Colonial Crimes, But Faces Invisibility</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while French cinema has been slow to confront the nation's history of slavery and colonialism, a new wave of films is finally addressing these subjects. The author contrasts the historical absence of such stories in French media with the prevalence of American films like "12 Years a Slave." The article highlights recent films like "No Chains No Masters," "Fanon," and "Zion" for their powerful portrayals of enslavement, anti-colonial struggle, and the modern-day legacy of colonialism in French territories. Despite finding audiences, these films struggle for mainstream recognition, suggesting the French establishment is not ready to fully embrace these narratives.</p>
