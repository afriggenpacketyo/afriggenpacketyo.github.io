          <p>Detroit Police Sergeant Shannon Jones, inspired by photos of missing persons, initiated Operation UNITED, exhuming unidentified crime victims to obtain DNA for solving cold cases. Partnering with FBI agent Leslie Larsen, they navigated dusty files and utilized advanced DNA technology to identify remains buried in "paupers' graves." This initiative has led to 33 positive identifications, bringing closure to grieving families, including Kristina Morris, whose father's murder was solved after his remains were identified. Other cities are now seeking to replicate Operation UNITED, underscoring its potential impact on resolving missing persons cases nationwide. The success of Operation UNITED highlights the importance of restoring victims' humanity by giving them back their names and stories. </p>

This has led to the growth of a cottage industry centered around hanfu, traditional Chinese clothing, with tourists renting and wearing the costumes for photoshoots at historical sites. This industry employs costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers, providing new job opportunities for young people like Chang Youli, a hanfu stylist who now runs her own studio. Last year, Xian saw 306 million tourist trips, generating 376 billion yuan in tourism income, highlighting the economic impact of this cultural trend.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly ended his trip to the G7 summit in Canada, citing escalating tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Iran. He stated he needed to return to Washington to address important matters, amidst reports of airstrikes and missile attacks between the two nations. Trump affirmed he was aware of messages from Iran indicating their desire to de-escalate, but insisted they should have pursued a deal earlier. While the U.S. is not directly involved in Israel's strikes, they have provided assistance in intercepting Iranian missiles, and Trump has urged Iran to negotiate a nuclear agreement. The U.S. has also warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region.</p>

The Senate version also aims to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Trump's first term permanent. The proposed changes differ significantly from the House-passed version, potentially leading to a clash between the two chambers. The Senate's proposal to permanently extend the $10,000 SALT deduction contrasts with the House's plan to increase it to $40,000, drawing criticism from House Republicans.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fiona Havers, the scientist in charge of overseeing the CDC team that collects data on Covid and RSV hospitalizations, resigned, citing a lack of confidence that the data would be used objectively for evidence-based vaccine policy decisions. Her resignation came before a meeting of a new vaccine panel put in place by Robert Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, after he fired all 17 members of the CDC’s independent vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy also dropped a recommendation to get the Covid shot for healthy children and pregnant women. Havers stated that the Covid and RSV data collected by her team had been used in numerous peer-reviewed manuscripts and reports.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are competing to bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada for the first time since 1993, facing the Florida Panthers in the final series. Despite a strong start, the Oilers lost Game 5, putting them in a precarious position as they head to Miami for Game 6. The repeated losses have fueled a sense of national unity among Canadians, who are eager to end the 30-year drought. The rivalry with the U.S. has intensified due to trade tensions and political jabs, adding extra significance to the Oilers' quest for the Cup.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee unveiled its version of President Trump's tax bill, which includes an extension of the 2017 tax cuts, a debt limit increase, and Medicaid cuts, potentially setting up a clash with the House. Key differences include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, with the Senate proposing to keep it at $10,000 while the House aims for $40,000. Senators claim the $10,000 cap is merely a placeholder, but some House Republicans have threatened to vote against the bill if the deduction is lower than $40,000. The Senate bill also features Medicaid work requirements and adjustments to the child tax credit.</p>
