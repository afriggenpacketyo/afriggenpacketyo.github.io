          <p>This article discusses the potential earnings from opening an 18-month certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment. Despite recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, 18-month CDs can still offer substantial returns. The article provides examples of potential earnings based on different deposit amounts and interest rates, ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. It also highlights the benefits of an 18-month CD, including protection against market uncertainty and more favorable rates compared to alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>This article reviews the horror film "Dangerous Animals," directed by Sean Byrne. The film stars Hassie Harrison as Zephyr, a surfer who is kidnapped by a boat captain named Tucker, played by Jai Courtney, who intends to use her in a twisted film involving sharks. The review criticizes the film for its predictable narrative and lack of thematic depth compared to Byrne's previous works. While Harrison's performance is praised, Courtney's portrayal of the villain is considered underwhelming, making the film a disappointing entry in the horror genre.</p>

          <p>The article advises homeowners considering a home equity loan to lock in an interest rate in June 2025. It argues that home equity loan rates have stagnated recently, and the Federal Reserve is unlikely to cut rates significantly in the near future. Locking in a rate now can protect homeowners from potential rate increases and is still cheaper than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards.

The report, ordered by General Secretary Sharon Graham, highlights "unusual relationships" between former senior staff and Unite's customers and suppliers. It also points to a culture that did not challenge financial transactions and failed to ensure appropriate financial reporting. This relates, in part, to the union spending Â£112m on building a hotel and conference centre in Birmingham, which has since been valued at a fraction of that sum.</p>

          <p>The number of measles cases in the U.S. this year has quadrupled compared to 2024 and is nearing a 30-year high. As of Friday, there have been 1,168 confirmed measles cases across 33 states nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says 95% of the nationally confirmed cases are among people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. At least two school-aged children have died. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions, according to Texas health officials said.</p>

          <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by the U.S. and Israel, is failing to deliver aid effectively due to logistical issues and a lack of trust for experienced relief groups. The organization was founded recently and lacks a realistic plan for delivering goods from distribution centers to residents. It also hired the Boston Consulting Group, which withdrew after violence broke out, and has been criticized for having too few distribution centers, leading to overcrowding and security risks. The article argues that the lack of planning and reliance on inexperienced organizations has hindered the delivery of much-needed aid to Palestinians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Alex Warren's hit song "Ordinary" has achieved its 12th week at number one in the UK, marking the longest chart reign since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in 2017. The song, written for Warren's wife, has been streamed 107 million times in the UK and is also number one in the US. Despite its success, changing media habits mean the song hasn't become a ubiquitous phenomenon in the same way as previous long-running number ones. The song's popularity has also led to the release of a Wedding Version.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the falling-out between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, highlighting the clash of egos and the underlying ideological differences. Musk's opposition to Trump's tax bill, driven by fiscal conservatism, contrasts with Trump's nationalist conservatism and Bannon's vision of a muscular state. The article argues that both Trump and Musk have damaged their respective brands, with Trump dismantling the qualities that once made the U.S. attractive and Musk turning Twitter into a platform for bigotry and lies. The division illuminates a fault line in the right, between fiscal conservatives and nationalist conservatives.</p>
