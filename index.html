          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. The bill, known as the PELOSI Act, saw Republican Senator Josh Hawley join with Democrats for an 8-7 vote to move it out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. This measure is more restrictive than the existing STOCK Act and faces an uncertain future for a full Senate vote. The proposed law would also apply to the president and vice president.

          <p>The town council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, near Stuttgart, has ordered the demolition of a mosque that is nearly finished. The decision was based on the Cologne-based Islamic association's failure to complete construction by a contractually obligated 2014 deadline. After a legal battle that reached Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, the council voted to revoke the building permit and mandate the demolition by the end of the year. The association has stated it will not comply with the order, while the city has offered to help find an alternative site for a new building.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that seven more people have died from malnutrition, bringing the total to 154 since the conflict began. This comes as UN-backed experts warn of a famine "currently playing out" in the territory. Aid delivery remains a critical issue, with the UN stating that at least 600 trucks are needed daily, while only a fraction are getting through and are often looted. The conflict, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, continues to create a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady in the 4.25%-4.5% range, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump for aggressive cuts. The decision was not unanimous, with two governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, marking the first multiple-governor dissent since 1993. The committee's statement noted a moderation in economic growth and acknowledged that uncertainty remains elevated. This decision comes alongside a stronger-than-expected GDP report, reinforcing the central bank's cautious stance on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major automakers are currently absorbing the significant financial impact of tariffs on imported materials and vehicles rather than passing the costs on to consumers. Companies like General Motors and Volkswagen have reported tariff-related costs exceeding a billion dollars, yet new car prices have seen smaller-than-average increases. This strategy is partly due to a desire to attract buyers in a market where consumers are already stretched thin. However, executives have indicated that these costs will eventually lead to higher prices for 2026 models and less favorable financing deals. (not investment advice)</p>

This article outlines that eligibility is typically limited to those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, which can be documented. Borrowers with significant unsecured debt, often $10,000 or more, are also strong candidates, as creditors may see a settlement as the best recovery option. Those who have already fallen behind on payments often have more leverage in negotiations than those still managing to make minimum payments. (not investment advice)</p>

These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme environments characterized by immense pressure and a lack of sunlight. Scientists believe these creatures survive not on falling organic matter, but by harnessing chemical energy from carbon that has accumulated in the trenches over time. This discovery opens new avenues for research into how life adapts to such harsh conditions and how carbon cycles in the deep ocean.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its benchmark interest rate has direct consequences for American consumers' finances. Because the Fed's rate influences borrowing costs, rates for credit cards, auto loans, and home equity lines of credit are expected to remain elevated near their current record highs. While this is challenging for borrowers, it benefits savers, as high-yield savings accounts continue to offer returns above the rate of inflation. Mortgage rates, which are tied more to Treasury yields and economic outlook, have also remained in a narrow, elevated range amid ongoing uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake off Russia's east coast, tsunami warnings across Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast have been downgraded to advisories as the threat of major flooding has passed. The quake triggered evacuations in Hawaii, where waves reached nearly six feet, and prompted advisories along the Pacific coast of the U.S. and Canada. While the initial danger of catastrophic waves has receded, authorities continue to caution the public to stay away from the water due to the risk of strong and unpredictable currents that can persist for hours or days after the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on all goods from India, effective August 1, along with an unspecified additional "penalty." He justified the move by citing India's high tariffs on U.S. goods and its significant purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia. This action is part of Trump's broader strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and use tariffs as leverage in foreign policy. The announcement creates further uncertainty in global trade, particularly for major partners like India that rely on Russian energy. (not investment advice)</p>

Bove, a former federal prosecutor, played a key role in Trump's defense during his Manhattan criminal trial. He has defended his impartiality, stating he is "not anybody's henchman," while his supporters praise his legal mind and defense of the Constitution.</p>

The jury could not reach a verdict on the alleged assault of a male officer by Amaaz and his brother.

          <p>This article explores whether seniors who already receive Social Security benefits should also purchase annuities to supplement their retirement income. Annuities can offer a guaranteed income stream for life, providing a hedge against outliving savings and diversifying income sources beyond Social Security. However, they require a significant upfront investment, which reduces liquidity, and can come with complex terms and fees. The decision depends on individual circumstances, such as health, risk tolerance, and overall financial stability, making it a choice that requires careful consideration and professional advice.

          <p>A group of eight Senate Democrats is invoking a federal law to compel the Trump administration's Justice Department to release its investigative files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Citing a statute that allows five members of the Homeland Security Committee to request such information, the senators have set an August 15 deadline. This move escalates pressure on the administration, which Democrats accuse of reneging on promises to provide transparency regarding the Epstein case. The request for the full case files goes beyond the grand jury transcripts the DOJ has recently sought to unseal.</p>

Local officials noted that the sea was unusually rough, with a yellow flag warning in place, and that the incident occurred after lifeguards had finished their shifts for the day.

This trend has created more of a renter's market, with the largest rent declines seen in formerly hot markets in the South and Mountain West, such as Austin, Texas.

Critics, including the shadow home secretary and the lead of the 2014 Rotherham inquiry, argue that SYP should not investigate its own officers to avoid conflicts of interest.
