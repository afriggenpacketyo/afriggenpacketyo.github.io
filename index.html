          <p>Ukraine claims a large-scale drone attack, "Operation Spider's Web," destroyed 40 Russian military bombers, while Russia reports explosions causing bridge collapses and train derailments. The Ukrainian security sources said that the attack took over a year and a half to execute and was personally supervised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy stated that 117 drones were used in the operation and claimed it was headquartered out of an office next to the local FSB headquarters. The drone attack came as Kyiv announced a Russian military strike killed at least 12 soldiers at an army training site. Meanwhile, Ukrainian and Russian delegations are set to meet in Istanbul for ceasefire talks, with priorities including a complete ceasefire and the return of prisoners and abducted children. </p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing to accept the pardon and is attempting to return it. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and whitewashing of the events of that day. She has sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally reject the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill has engaged in debates with other January 6th defendants over her views on the events of that day, and she expects her protest to garner attention from the former president. </p>

          <p>A strong geomagnetic storm is forecasted, potentially making the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., even as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm is spurred by a coronal mass ejection, which can disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Federal officials indicate a G3 (strong) or G4 (severe) geomagnetic storm is possible, while the Space Weather Prediction Center notes elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event. The northern lights are typically best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning. </p>

Delegates expressed mixed opinions on whether California's brand of liberalism can succeed nationally, but largely agreed on the importance of continuing to champion progressive values. The convention focused on preparing for the upcoming midterm elections and stopping Trump's agenda. </p>

          <p>Exit polls in Poland's presidential election indicate a very close race between conservative historian Karol Nawrocki and Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. Initial polls showed Trzaskowski ahead, but later polls reversed the result, leading to uncertainty. Trzaskowski had already claimed victory, while Nawrocki expressed hope for a win. The outcome could have significant implications for Poland's relationship with the EU and the balance of power between the government and president. </p>
