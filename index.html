        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced that ten Israeli hostages are expected to be released from Gaza very soon. This development is part of a broader effort to secure a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a proposal that includes the return of these hostages and the remains of eighteen others. In exchange for the releases, Israel would free an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amidst ongoing diplomatic efforts, including a recent visit by the Mossad director to Washington to discuss the potential relocation of Palestinians from Gaza.</p>

          <p>Argentine actor Juan Pablo Di Pace, known for his roles in “Mamma Mia!” and “Fuller House,” has made his directorial and screenwriting debut with the film “Before We Forget.” The movie explores a first love between two young men at an Italian film school, drawing from Di Pace's own personal experiences. Co-directed with his childhood friend Andrés Pepe Estrada, the film is described not as a genre piece but as a tender story about the heart and memories. Di Pace, who publicly came out in 2019, aimed to create a universal love story where the characters' gender is incidental.</p>

          <h2>Environmental Protection Agency to Reduce Workforce by 23% and Close Research Office</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:44:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced a significant restructuring that includes a 23% reduction in its workforce, affecting over 3,000 employees. As part of this federal streamlining effort, the agency will also close its Office of Research and Development, replacing it with a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions. The Trump administration stated these measures will save $748.8 million and better focus the agency on its core mission. However, the move has drawn sharp criticism from the government employees' union, which warns that closing the research office will devastate public health protections.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the Vietnam War, has brought to life a vision that helped him survive: a carousel in a mountain meadow. During the war, a music box from his sister inspired daydreams of this peaceful image, providing a mental escape from the brutality. After struggling with PTSD for years, Harrison began building the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, in 1986, a project that took 26 years to complete. Now a nonprofit, the carousel has delighted over a million visitors and has been instrumental in Harrison's own healing journey.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States, specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The legislation, which received bipartisan support, creates consumer protections and allows banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins backed by U.S. dollars. Supporters believe this will facilitate faster and lower-cost financial transactions, strengthening the dollar's role in the digital economy. The administration views this as a significant step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system, calling it a massive validation for the crypto community.

While stablecoins serve as a primary gateway into the broader crypto ecosystem, their nature generates new risks that financial regulators must address.

          <p>A general contractor in Los Angeles reports that President Trump's intensified immigration enforcement is causing significant labor shortages in the construction industry. Many undocumented but highly skilled workers are reportedly staying home out of fear of ICE raids, leading to project delays and increased labor costs. This shortage is particularly acute as the region needs to rebuild over 12,000 homes destroyed in recent fires. A UCLA Anderson Forecast report supports these concerns, finding that increased deportations will deplete the state's construction workforce, which heavily relies on foreign-born labor, ultimately leading to higher costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have filed murder and assault charges against Brycson Gaddis, 20, for allegedly beating his ex-girlfriend's 5-year-old son, Elyjiah Hearn, to death. The boy's body, which had suffered massive injuries, was discovered in a dumpster in Panorama City a day after the alleged killing. The case highlights Gaddis's recent legal history, including a dismissed carjacking charge and an active arrest warrant for a separate domestic violence incident. The district attorney's office described the case as "heartbreaking and horrific" and is seeking to hold the defendant fully responsible for the vicious crime.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists report that the United Kingdom is experiencing a significant increase in wasp populations this summer, likely due to a very warm and dry spring. While scientific data is still pending, anecdotal evidence points to a strong year for social wasps, which can be a nuisance at picnics and in gardens. Despite their unpopularity, experts emphasize the crucial ecological role wasps play as apex predators and natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, the public is advised to avoid agitating the insects and to distract them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from human activity.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking show MasterChef is in crisis after both of its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were sacked in quick succession.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new theatrical production in Liverpool, titled "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, co-creator of "Motherland," the show is an affectionate, comedic homage to the famous couple. The plot is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid story about Coleen allegedly throwing away her engagement ring, merging the urban myth with a classic quest narrative. The play is presented as a deliberately over-the-top and lighthearted tribute to the couple's resilience in the public eye.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination program is being expanded to include premature babies, who will be offered a long-acting injection starting this autumn. RSV is a highly infectious virus that can cause serious respiratory illness, especially in young children, and is a leading cause of hospitalization for infants. The new Nirsevimab injection offers about 80% protection with a single dose, a significant improvement over the previous multi-dose treatment. This initiative aims to protect vulnerable infants who are born too early to benefit from the maternal RSV vaccine given during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the remarkable 2005 incident where a 12-year-old Ethiopian girl was rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to reports, three lions chased off her captors and then stood guard over her until she was found by police. Wildlife experts at the time speculated that the girl’s whimpering may have resembled the sound of a lion cub, which could explain the pride's protective behavior. The event is still remembered in Ethiopia as a miraculous intervention.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced the cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” with its final season concluding in May 2026, signaling a potential decline for the traditional late-night talk show format. While network executives cite financial losses as the primary reason, the timing has raised questions, as it follows Colbert's criticism of parent company Paramount's settlement with President Trump. The show, while still the most-watched in its category, has faced declining ad revenue and a shrinking young audience, a trend affecting all network late-night programs as viewers shift to streaming and social media for topical content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the body cannot properly regulate an immune-activating protein called STING. This leads to an overreaction to harmless gut bacteria, causing chronic inflammation in the colon. This breakthrough helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific inflammatory pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>

The R&A, the sport's governing body, explained that the rules require a penalty if video shows the ball's movement was discernible to the naked eye, regardless of whether the player saw it.
