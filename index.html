          <p>During a Cabinet meeting, President Trump expressed his appreciation for Elon Musk's contributions and invited him to stay as long as he wished. Trump acknowledged that Musk had been treated unfairly but emphasized the respect and appreciation most Americans hold for him, thanking him for opening eyes to what could be achieved. Musk responded by expressing his honor in working with the Cabinet members and thanking them for their collaboration. The meeting differed from previous sessions, as Musk did not extensively discuss the Department of Government Efficiency, and was more of an informal discussion of their relationship.</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, a New York Times article explores the enduring impact of the Vietnam War on American culture, politics, and the lives of veterans. Veterans recount witnessing the chaotic evacuation and the city's fall, highlighting the trauma and lasting psychological effects they experienced. They emphasize that the war's lessons about intervention, trust, and the treatment of veterans seem to have been forgotten, citing parallels in subsequent conflicts like Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. The article emphasizes how the war shaped distrust in government and influenced political discourse for decades.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is implementing significant cuts to minority health offices within the department, potentially widening health disparities. These cuts affect offices at the HHS, FDA, CDC, CMS, HRSA, and SAMHSA, leading to layoffs of staff and directors. Experts warn that this could negatively impact underserved communities, worsen health outcomes, and strain the healthcare system. While the Affordable Care Act prevents complete closure of these offices, their scope and resources may be significantly curtailed, potentially undoing years of progress.</p>

          <p>The Senate is expected to vote on a resolution to block President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs amid concerns about their potential impact on the U.S. economy. Led by Senators Wyden and Paul, the resolution aims to terminate the national emergency declaration used to impose the tariffs. While passage in the Senate is uncertain, the measure is unlikely to pass the House, making the vote largely symbolic. The article notes growing anxiety over the tariffs' economic consequences, particularly after a report showing slowed economic growth in the first quarter.</p>

          <p>This article from CBS News discusses the costs and benefits of annuities as a retirement planning tool. It explains that while annuities offer a guaranteed stream of income, they also come with fees like administrative charges, mortality and expense risk charges, investment management fees, surrender charges, and rider fees. The article weighs the advantages of guaranteed income and tax deferral against the disadvantages of complexity and limited financial flexibility, concluding that annuities can be valuable for some investors but require careful consideration of individual financial situations and goals.

          <p>President Trump attributed the recent contraction in GDP to his predecessor, Joe Biden, and defended his tariff policies, stating that the promised economic "boom" will "take a while". He claimed the negative GDP was a result of imports made before his tariffs took effect and a decrease in government spending. This article contrasts Trump's claims with the Commerce Department's report, which cited increased imports ahead of tariffs and reduced government spending as factors. Experts suggest that uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariffs has contributed to shrinking payroll numbers and decreased consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General Rob Bonta issued a warning to immigration detention centers in the state, citing the need for significant improvements to meet ICE's detention standards. A report found that all six privately-operated facilities are falling short in providing adequate mental health care for detainees, with deficiencies in recordkeeping, suicide prevention, and use of force. The report highlights concerns about the impact of increased populations and reduced federal oversight on detainee well-being, particularly in light of the Trump administration's deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>Etsy shares experienced a significant drop after the company reported mixed results for the first quarter, with earnings per share falling short of expectations despite revenue exceeding projections. The company's net loss was attributed to an impairment charge from the sale of Reverb. Concerns over the impact of President Trump's sweeping tariffs on the e-commerce sector also contributed to the decline, though Etsy's CEO stated the company is less dependent on products from China compared to other retailers.</p>
