          <p>Thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City's Zeitoun neighborhood due to intense Israeli bombardment, which the local municipality describes as catastrophic. The conflict has led to significant casualties and a dire humanitarian situation, with the UN warning of widespread malnutrition and potential famine. In Israel, a general strike is planned to protest the government's military strategy, with hostage families arguing it endangers the lives of those held by Hamas. The ongoing war, initiated by the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in over 61,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has ordered an end to the strike by Air Canada's flight attendants, compelling both parties into binding arbitration to resolve their contract dispute. The work stoppage, which lasted less than 12 hours, caused significant disruption, stranding thousands of travelers and leading to hundreds of flight cancellations during the peak summer season. The flight attendants' union criticized the government's swift intervention as a violation of their right to strike, while business groups praised the move for mitigating economic damage. The dispute centers on disagreements over pay and compensation for unpaid work.</p>

          <p>An undercover sting operation at a Phoenix Chili's restaurant in 2015 proved crucial in capturing Bryan Patrick Miller, the man responsible for the 1990s 'canal murders'. A cold case detective, posing as a security consultant, met with Miller under the pretense of a job offer to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. At the time, the detective was skeptical that the mild-mannered father, known locally for his 'Zombie Hunter' character, could be the killer. However, the DNA from the glass was a perfect match to evidence found on victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, leading to Miller's immediate arrest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a previous ban, allowing tech companies Nvidia and AMD to sell specific, less advanced AI chips to Chinese firms. This decision came after meetings with tech CEOs and includes a novel "revenue-sharing" agreement where the companies will give 15% of their related revenue to the U.S. government. The move has sparked criticism from trade experts who fear it sets a dangerous precedent of selling export control licenses, potentially compromising national security for financial gain. The legality of what critics call an "export tax" is currently being reviewed by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's National Museum in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, focusing on his connection to Russian culture. The collection, featuring 48 oil paintings and 44 sketches from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is curated to emphasize the artist's 'Russianness' throughout his career. This presentation comes amid a cultural dispute, as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition's design in Beijing intentionally evokes the classical architecture of St. Petersburg, where Repin studied and worked.</p>

          <p>A long-standing principle in U.S. traffic engineering, the '85th percentile rule,' is being reconsidered by some states and federal agencies amid rising road fatalities. This rule suggests that speed limits should be set based on the speed that 85% of drivers naturally travel at or below, assuming most drivers choose a safe speed. However, critics argue this creates a feedback loop where speeding leads to higher limits, especially in urban areas with pedestrians and cyclists. The Federal Highway Administration has recently clarified that this is a guideline, not a strict rule, encouraging communities to also consider road usage and safety risks.</p>

The method creates what is described as an 'ionic glassy tissue' that preserves the organ's original shape and enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used for highlighting cells. This advancement produces highly accurate and vivid three-dimensional images of organs without compromising their structural integrity. The prepared tissues can also be stored long-term at low temperatures, maintaining their transparent, glass-like state for future study.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are exploring an innovative aircraft design featuring a single, rotating 'scissor wing' for a potential hypersonic drone carrier, reviving a concept once studied by NASA. This design aims to optimize performance across different speeds by adjusting the wing's angle relative to the fuselage. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient 'waverider'. This approach could solve the long-standing aerodynamic challenge of balancing low-speed lift with high-speed drag, a problem that conventional and swing-wing aircraft must compromise on.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been found guilty of murdering his wife, Angela Craig, by poisoning her with arsenic and cyanide. The investigation began after a colleague at his dental practice reported a suspicious delivery of potassium cyanide. Prosecutors argued that Craig laced his wife's daily protein shakes with poison, motivated by an affair and a $3.4 million life insurance policy, while he was facing significant financial debt. The defense claimed Craig was suicidal and had purchased the poisons for himself, but he was ultimately sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <h2>Couples Therapist Identifies Five Common Psychological Triggers for Infidelity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 21:35:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A couples therapist and executive counselor explains that people who engage in affairs are often not malicious but are driven by deep-seated psychological factors. Common triggers include a lifelong pressure to always be 'good' and follow societal expectations, leading to a mid-life identity crisis. Other factors are the burnout from perfectionism, which often stems from childhood trauma, and having poor boundaries developed from being 'parentified' as a child. Additionally, being in an emotionally withholding or abusive marriage can make an affair feel like a reprieve, while a recent significant loss can trigger a re-evaluation of life priorities.</p>

          <p>A small private plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego on Saturday afternoon following reported mechanical issues. The aircraft was en route from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. The successful landing on the highway resulted in no injuries to the pilot or anyone on the ground, though it caused a significant traffic shutdown for several hours.
