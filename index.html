          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with stories about a new Â£5bn trade deal between India and the UK, with some criticizing it as a 'two-tier' agreement due to exemptions for Indian migrants from National Insurance payments.

Lugo faces multiple charges, including contacting a minor with intent to commit a sexual offense and possession of obscene material depicting a minor.

          <p>President Trump has claimed that his tariff policies have spurred record investment in the United States, totaling nearly $9 trillion, and that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years. However, these claims lack supporting evidence, as some investments cited by the White House were announced before Trump's reelection, and the comparison to the Biden administration is misleading due to differing methodologies in tracking and reporting investments. Experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action, and it's too early to directly tie new investments to policies of the Trump administration.

Experts express skepticism, noting potential retaliatory responses from the Houthis and the group's demonstrated ability to disrupt the global economy.

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing ongoing delays and cancellations, attributed to an air traffic controller shortage and exacerbated by inclement weather. The union representing air traffic controllers reports that multiple members are on trauma leave following a recent equipment failure that caused a temporary loss of communication with pilots. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is expected to announce plans to overhaul the nation's aging air traffic control system. Senator Schumer is demanding an investigation and the local mayor is calling for increased federal investment.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are collaborating with police and a charity to protect at-risk children by providing vital information on child exploitation. The Night Light initiative has received numerous reports from these women, leading to the arrest and prosecution of child sex offenders and the identification of children at risk. Sex workers have been able to provide support and identify underaged girls who were vulnerable and at risk. The trust built between the sex workers and the Night Light team has been key to its success.</p>

          <p>A woman who fled an abusive relationship had to barricade herself into her rented home every night for more than six months because her council failed to fix her broken door lock. North Kesteven District Council admitted a "significant failing" and offered Jane Â£100 in compensation for failing to secure her home in a timely manner. The domestic abuse commissioner for England and Wales said "patchy" target hardening meant many victims were "living in daily fear" of their abuser turning up at their home. The government said it was increasing domestic abuse funding.</p>

This move is intended to shield East and Southeast Asian countries from financial volatility caused by President Trump's global tariff war. The scheme is part of a broader currency swap arrangement known as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM) and may represent a longer-term shift towards a regional monetary mechanism less reliant on the dollar, giving China a more significant role.
