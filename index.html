          <p>Venmo is gaining traction in the peer-to-peer payment market, while Cash App is facing challenges, according to recent quarterly results from their parent companies. PayPal, which owns Venmo, reported strong earnings and maintained its financial outlook for the year, with Venmo's revenue increasing by 20% due to the growing adoption of features like debit cards and instant transfers. Block, the parent company of Cash App, experienced a decline in its stock value after missing revenue expectations and providing a disappointing forecast. Venmo's monetization per user is improving, and its role in e-commerce is expanding, as evidenced by the surge in Venmo debit card payment volume and Pay with Venmo volume.</p>

          <p>New York Times reports that scientists have identified antibodies capable of neutralizing the venom of multiple deadly snake species, marking a significant step toward creating a universal antivenom. This breakthrough stems from the work of Tim Friede, who over 18 years injected himself with escalating doses of venom from 16 snake species, building immunity and allowing scientists to isolate powerful antibodies from his blood. These antibodies, combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species from various regions. This research offers hope for treating snakebites, which affect millions globally, particularly in poor rural areas with limited access to treatment, where current antivenoms are often species-specific and can cause severe allergic reactions.</p>

          <p>Block's first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations, leading to a significant drop in the company's stock price. Revenue decreased by about 3% compared to the previous year, and gross profit, while up 9%, also missed analysts' forecasts. The company issued a weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and the full year, citing challenging economic conditions, including the impact of President Donald Trump's recently announced tariffs on imported goods. Gross payment volume through Square and Cash App was also lower than anticipated, though the company expects a pickup later in the year due to the expansion of the Cash App Borrow program.

          <p>The New York Times reports that Senator John Fetterman's former chief of staff expressed serious concerns about the senator's mental health and erratic behavior in a letter to his doctor. Adam Jentleson, the former chief of staff, warned that Fetterman's condition could cost him his life, citing instances of conspiratorial thinking, recklessness, and failure to adhere to his medical plan. Other former aides reported being frightened by the senator's amped-up moods and warned against riding with him due to dangerous driving habits. Fetterman, who spent six weeks in treatment for clinical depression in 2023, has dismissed the concerns as a ‚Äúhit piece‚Äù sourced from disgruntled staffers.</p>

Harry stated that he would love reconciliation with his family but feels that the security dispute is the last remaining obstacle. He acknowledged the divisiveness of his memoir ‚ÄúSpare‚Äù but hopes King Charles can help resolve the security issue, which he sees as impacting his ability to bring his family to the UK safely.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, fascinated by snakes since childhood, has willingly been bitten by venomous snakes approximately 200 times over nearly a quarter of a century, in an effort to develop immunity and contribute to the creation of a broad antivenom. In a new paper in the journal Cell, researchers say they've done just that, thanks in large part to the antibodies that Friede has developed over nearly a quarter century of self-envenomation. Researchers have identified antibodies in his blood that neutralize neurotoxins from multiple snake species, leading to a new antivenom cocktail that offers mice complete protection against 13 species and partial protection against six more. This research represents a significant step forward in addressing the global health problem of venomous snake bites, which cause tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities annually, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

          <p>Gun training courses are experiencing a surge in sign-ups as more Americans seek to learn how to properly use firearms, driven by concerns about crime, defunding of police, and uncertainty following natural disasters or pandemics. More than 40% of US households own a gun, but experts emphasize that owning a gun is not the same as knowing how to use it, and proper training is essential. Training courses cover a range of skills, including shooting at targets, navigating simulated scenarios, and understanding the responsibility that comes with owning a firearm. The increased interest in gun training reflects a shift in attitudes towards firearms, with more people, especially women, feeling comfortable being associated with them.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Patterson, former chief investment strategist at Bridgewater, warns that foreign investors are increasingly worried about America's reliability as a partner due to tariff policies and concerns about the potential weaponizing of capital markets. This has led to a gradual reduction in exposure to U.S. assets, potentially impacting U.S. markets. Even a small reduction in global participation could result in a significant capital outflow from the U.S., as investment committees take months to implement changes. While U.S. stocks have underperformed global equities this year, Patterson suggests this trend reflects a slow bleed of support from U.S. markets.</p>

Mahdawi calls for Americans to support peace and democracy and to speak out against the killing of children and what he describes as a genocide in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry expressed his devastation over losing a court battle for security protection in the United Kingdom and reiterated his hope for reconciliation with his family. He stated that the ongoing security issue is the primary obstacle to repairing his relationship with the Royal Family and that he feels his family is not keeping him safe. Harry also noted that his father, King Charles, is no longer speaking to him because of the security battle and expressed concern about the King's health. The UK judge's ruling upheld a 2020 decision that denied his family automatic taxpayer-funded police protection while in Britain.</p>

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Bundesamt f√ºr Verfassungsschutz (BfV), has formally designated the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as extremist following a three-year investigation. The BfV concluded that the AfD's actions contravene the constitution's core principles, including human dignity, democracy, and the rule of law, based on the party's platform, statements, and connections to right-wing extremist actors. Despite capturing a significant share of votes in recent elections, the AfD remains politically isolated, with mainstream parties shunning the group and denying it governing coalition roles. The intelligence agency's designation is expected to strengthen efforts to keep the AfD out of key parliamentary roles.</p>

          <p>Major footwear brands, including Nike and Adidas, are urging President Donald Trump to grant them an exemption from his reciprocal tariffs, arguing that these tariffs pose an ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù to the footwear industry. The Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America trade group, representing 76 brands, sent a letter to the White House warning that many companies making affordable footwear for lower and middle-income families cannot absorb the high tariff rates. The group also cautioned that the tariffs will not result in bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and may lead to shortages of footwear inventory for U.S. consumers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a plan to cut $6 billion from NASA's budget while reallocating $1 billion to Mars-focused missions. The proposed changes aim to prioritize beating China back to the Moon and putting the first human on Mars, potentially benefiting SpaceX, which has long sought to launch a manned mission to Mars. The budget cuts would lead to workforce streamlining, termination of multiple missions, and reductions in scientific activities. Key programs like the SLS rocket, Orion spacecraft, and Gateway programs would be retired, but this may benefit SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin, who would continue to conduct launches.</p>
