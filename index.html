          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 19:00:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simmering debate over the limits of free speech in the UK is reaching a boiling point, fueled by high-profile cases and criticism from figures like Nigel Farage and Elon Musk, who have compared the country's speech laws to authoritarian regimes. This article explores the tension between protecting expression and preventing harm, examining how social media has amplified extreme views and created dilemmas for law enforcement. Unlike the US First Amendment, the UK's Human Rights Act treats free speech as a "qualified right," allowing for restrictions that are "necessary in a democratic society." The piece delves into the lack of public consensus on what constitutes prosecutable hate speech versus merely offensive commentary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air traffic at Copenhagen Airport has resumed after being suspended for approximately four hours on Monday evening due to the sighting of several large drones in the vicinity. The closure, which began around 8:30 PM local time, forced the diversion of at least 35 inbound flights to other airports and halted all take-offs and landings. Authorities have launched an investigation into the incident, which caused significant delays and cancellations. The airport has advised passengers to check with their airlines for the latest information on their flight status as operations gradually return to normal.</p>

In the financial sector, he named Capital One, American Express, and Citigroup as attractive options. Cramer also identified potential value in the healthcare and technology sectors with companies like Incyte and Dell, as well as in industrials such as Caterpillar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal health officials have announced that the FDA is approving the drug leucovorin to treat speech-related deficits associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Previously used for cancer patients and to treat anemia, leucovorin is a form of folate that has shown promise in small studies for improving communication skills in some children with autism. The label update will allow state Medicaid programs to cover the drug for this purpose, and the NIH plans to launch further research into its safety and effectiveness. Experts caution that it is not a cure and should be administered under medical supervision, noting its potential benefits for a specific subset of children with ASD.</p>

          <h2>Trump Signs Executive Order Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:45:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially designating the decentralized anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization." The move, announced in the wake of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's killing, fulfills a pledge from his first term, though no evidence has linked the suspected assassin to antifa. Legal and extremism experts have questioned the president's authority to make such a designation, as no formal legal framework exists for labeling domestic groups as terrorist organizations due to First Amendment concerns.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new health guidelines on Monday, making the unproven claim that the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy is linked to autism. The president stated that the FDA would be notifying doctors of this purported risk, a long-standing goal of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of promoting discredited links between medical products and autism. Trump falsely claimed that parts of the world too poor to afford the drug do not have autism. Tylenol's parent company, Kenvue, strongly disagreed with the comments, emphasizing that sound science shows no causal link and highlighting the drug's importance for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking residents across the region. The quake's epicenter was located just east of Berkeley, and shaking was felt as far as 100 miles away. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), thousands of people reported feeling the tremor just before 3 a.m. While the event caused some minor disruptions, such as broken windows and merchandise falling from shelves, there have been no reports of major damage or injuries. The incident serves as a reminder of the seismic risks in the region and the importance of preparedness.</p>

Charities including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation have severed ties, deeming it "inappropriate" for her to continue in her role. A spokesperson for the duchess stated the email was sent to appease Epstein amid legal threats, but the revelation has caused significant damage to her public profile.</p>

The administration also announced FDA approval for the drug leucovorin as a treatment for some autism-related symptoms, amidst a broader, contentious effort to identify environmental causes of the condition.

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing federal funding for animal testing, having canceled nearly $28 million in grants as part of a broader push to phase out research on animals like monkeys, dogs, and cats. This effort, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is supported by an unusual coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan members of Congress. While proponents champion the move as ethical and a way to cut spending, it has sparked a fierce debate over the future of medical research. Scientists and patient advocates warn that animal models have been crucial for developing life-saving treatments, and that alternative testing methods are not yet advanced enough to fully replace them.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has closed a federal bribery investigation into Tom Homan, the president's "border czar" and former acting ICE director. The probe was initiated after Homan was reportedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen, in exchange for promises to help them secure government contracts. The White House denied Homan accepted the money and characterized the investigation as politically motivated entrapment by a "weaponized" DOJ. The closure of the case, despite the reported existence of an audio recording, adds to growing concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent announcement linking Tylenol use during pregnancy to autism is based on contested and limited scientific evidence, according to a detailed analysis. While some observational studies have suggested a possible association, larger and more robust research, including a study of 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no such link after accounting for confounding factors like genetics. This article explains that the scientific consensus points to a complex mix of factors as the cause for rising autism diagnoses, which are also influenced by increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria. The administration's focus on a single, unproven cause has been met with alarm from many researchers.</p>

In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation" and that the decision to return was made after "thoughtful conversations" with the host.

          <p>The Trump administration has launched a new immigration pathway, dubbed the "Trump Gold Card," which allows wealthy foreigners to gain permanent residency by making a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This program effectively creates a pay-to-play system for EB-1 and EB-2 visas, which have historically been reserved for individuals with "extraordinary ability." Unlike the existing EB-5 investor visa program, which requires investment in American businesses, the Gold Card funds will be used more broadly to "promote commerce" or pay down national debt.

          <p>Despite expectations of a hostile "bearpit" atmosphere from New York fans, the 2025 Ryder Cup is beginning on a note of camaraderie between the opposing captains. Europe's Luke Donald and the USA's Keegan Bradley, who are neighbors and business partners in Florida, emphasized their deep mutual respect and friendship in opening remarks. This friendly tone contrasts with the anticipated intensity of the event at Bethpage Black, where Team Europe will face a challenging environment. To prepare, European players have been given virtual reality headsets to simulate the sights and sounds of the notoriously vocal American crowd.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for companies applying for H-1B visas, which are used to hire foreign workers in specialized fields like technology and healthcare. The administration argues the steep increase is necessary to prevent abuse of the program and encourage the hiring of American workers. The move has caused confusion and concern, particularly in the tech industry, which relies heavily on the program to recruit global talent. Economists and advocacy groups warn the policy could stifle innovation and lead to a "brain drain," while officials from countries like India have expressed concern over the humanitarian disruption for families.</p>

          <p>The two elk hunters who went missing in southern Colorado and were found after a six-day search died from a lightning strike, the county coroner has confirmed. Andrew Porter and Ian Stasko, both 25, were not hit directly but were close enough to a nearby strike to be electrocuted, according to the coroner's report. The men were reported missing on September 12 in the Rio Grande National Forest, and an extensive search operation concluded with the discovery of their bodies on Thursday. The fiancé of one of the hunters shared that the men were likely trying to return to their vehicle as storms moved in.</p>

          <p>Deion Sanders appeared to confirm reports that his son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders, turned down opportunities to be drafted by the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles before being selected by the Cleveland Browns. Speaking on the "New Heights" podcast, the elder Sanders explained that his son questioned the logic of sitting behind established young MVP-caliber quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson and Jalen Hurts. He defended Shedeur's desire for an opportunity to play rather than develop on the bench, which ultimately led him to Cleveland in the fifth round. Deion Sanders expressed confidence that his son will get a chance to play for the Browns this season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Sacramento district attorney has stated there is "circumstantial evidence" suggesting the recent shooting at the KXTV ABC10 affiliate station was politically motivated. The suspect, a former lobbyist, was arrested after firing at the building, and investigators found handwritten notes that may link the act to the recent suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". A note found in his car referenced "hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags" and named top law-enforcement officials, adding to the evidence of political animus. The case connects the broader national debate over media and politics to an act of local violence, raising concerns about escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>The future of the Reel Inn, a beloved seafood shack on the Pacific Coast Highway, remains in limbo months after it was destroyed in the Palisades fire. Initially, California State Parks, which owns the land, informed the owners they could not rebuild and could only bid to operate a temporary food truck nearby. Following a public outcry, the agency has reversed its stance, stating its intent to partner with the owners and "bring back the Reel Inn" as part of a redeveloped site. However, the state has not provided a timeline or concrete plan, leaving the owners uncertain about when or if they can return to their historic location.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to allow the firing of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter to proceed, pending a full review of the case. Slaughter, a Democrat, was fired by the president in March, but lower courts had blocked her removal, citing a 1935 precedent that protects members of independent agencies from being fired without cause. The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision temporarily sets aside those rulings and schedules the case for arguments in December to decide whether to overturn this long-standing precedent. The move could have significant implications for the independence of federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have reportedly reached a basic agreement on the ownership structure of TikTok, which would place the app's U.S. operations under a new joint venture based in the United States.

Software company Oracle will be responsible for providing comprehensive security, including monitoring the algorithm's behavior and managing American user data. This new arrangement aims to address national security concerns while allowing the popular app to continue operating in the country.</p>
