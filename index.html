          <p>In a dramatic turn of events at Wimbledon, Grigor Dimitrov was forced to retire from his fourth-round match against world number one Jannik Sinner after sustaining an injury while leading by two sets. Dimitrov collapsed after serving an ace in the third set, appearing to injure his right pectoral muscle. Despite receiving medical treatment, he was unable to continue and left Centre Court in tears to a standing ovation, marking another unfortunate chapter in his career plagued by injuries. Sinner, who had also taken a medical timeout earlier, advanced to the quarter-finals under the somber circumstances.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose steep tariffs on imports from at least 14 countries, with the new rates taking effect on August 1. In letters posted to social media, President Trump detailed plans for duties ranging from 25% on goods from Japan and South Korea to 40% on those from Laos and Myanmar. This move largely reinstates the high tariff levels first proposed in April before a 90-day pause was issued. The administration argues the tariffs are necessary to protect American businesses and correct trade deficits, though the announcement prompted a downturn in U.S. financial markets.

          <p>Tesla's stock price dropped nearly 7% following CEO Elon Musk's weekend announcement that he has formed a new political party called the 'America Party.' This move, which followed President Trump signing a major spending bill Musk opposed, has reignited investor concerns about the CEO's political entanglements distracting from the company. Analysts note that shareholders are exhausted by Musk's political ventures, especially during a precarious time for Tesla, which has seen a recent decline in sales. Musk has not provided details on the party's formation, a legally complex process, but suggested it would target key swing districts.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is pioneering solutions on a single 'cool block.' The initiative by GreenRoots involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures aim to combat dangerously high temperatures, which can be 15-20 degrees hotter in dense urban areas compared to greener ones. As climate change intensifies heat waves, this project serves as a practical urban laboratory and a potential template for other cities seeking to protect vulnerable residents.</p>

          <p>After five consecutive weeks of decline, the average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to 6.75%, providing a slight reprieve for homebuyers. Whether this downward trend will persist through July is uncertain and depends on several economic factors. The upcoming inflation report and the Federal Reserve's next meeting will be critical, as any indication of cooling inflation or future rate cuts could influence lenders to lower their rates further. While a formal Fed rate cut is unlikely this month, lenders may preemptively adjust their offers, making it a crucial time for potential buyers to monitor the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>

          <p>Wage garnishment, a debt collection tactic where creditors take money directly from a person's paycheck, can be a significant source of financial stress. The duration of garnishment typically lasts until the entire debt, including interest and fees, is fully paid, which can take years. Federal law generally limits the amount to 25% of disposable income, though rules differ for debts like student loans or taxes. Individuals facing garnishment have options, such as challenging the order in court, negotiating a settlement with the creditor, or filing for bankruptcy, which can provide immediate relief through an automatic stay.</p>

          <p>AC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has confirmed that Croatian midfielder Luka Modrić will join the Italian club in August. The announcement comes after the 39-year-old superstar revealed he would be ending his illustrious 13-year career with Real Madrid after the current Club World Cup. Modrić, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, has won 28 major trophies with the Spanish giants, including six Champions League titles. His move to AC Milan marks a significant new chapter for both the player and the Serie A team under Allegri's returning leadership.</p>

          <h2>New Senior Tax Deduction May Not Eliminate Federal Taxes on Social Security for Most</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent bill passed by the Trump administration includes a new $6,000 'bonus' deduction for seniors, which the Social Security Administration claimed would eliminate federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. However, tax experts argue this is misleading, as the legislation does not directly change how benefits are taxed. While the deduction may reduce taxable income for some middle-income seniors, it is unlikely to eliminate their tax liability entirely and will not benefit the lowest or highest earners. Furthermore, critics note the change will reduce tax revenue, potentially accelerating the Social Security trust fund's insolvency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Waymo, the autonomous driving technology company owned by Alphabet, has announced it will begin testing its vehicles in Philadelphia. The initial phase will involve a limited fleet of cars operating with human safety drivers behind the wheel, focusing on manually navigating complex areas like downtown. This 'road trip' allows Waymo to collect crucial mapping data and assess how its autonomous system handles the city's unique traffic patterns and infrastructure. The expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to roll out its paid ride-sharing service, Waymo One, to more major U.S. cities.</p>

President Lula stated that Brazil is a sovereign nation that will not accept foreign interference and that 'no one is above the law.'

          <p>An editorial commentary argues that the UK government's planned reforms for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) must avoid the mistakes of past policy debacles. The piece stresses the need for the education secretary to engage closely with parents and advocacy groups, ensuring transparency and building trust. It suggests that good policy should not be rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines and calls for a better understanding of funding trends, which are pushing local councils toward insolvency. The author advocates for a national funding system and a cross-party consensus to protect vulnerable children from being 'weaponized' for political gain.</p>

          <p>In a satirical commentary, The Atlantic critiques the media's tendency to frame normal, everyday activities as alarming new workplace trends attributed to Gen Z. The piece humorously rebrands sleeping as 'Microdeath,' taking a lunch break as a 'Microvacation,' and using the bathroom as a 'Microspa.' Through this exaggerated lens, the author pokes fun at the breathless reporting on phenomena like 'quiet quitting,' which simply describes doing one's job within contracted hours. The article highlights how mundane behaviors are often sensationalized, creating unnecessary panic and misunderstanding about the younger generation's work ethic.</p>

Authorities responded by closing roads into the capital, Nairobi, and clashing with protesters, using tear gas to disperse crowds.

          <p>The deadly flash floods in central Texas were the result of a disastrous convergence of geographical, climatic, and systemic failures. The region, known as 'flash flood alley,' is naturally prone to sudden inundations, a risk now amplified by climate change, which allows storms to carry and dump more moisture. This article explores how these factors combined with critical gaps in the emergency alert system to create the catastrophe. Warnings were issued late at night when many were asleep, and parts of the affected county lacked effective warning sirens, leaving residents and campers with little time to react.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced its worst first-half performance since 1973, tumbling nearly 11% against global peers and hitting its lowest point since early 2022. The decline is attributed to a combination of headwinds, including U.S. policy volatility, swelling national debt, and the prospect of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This has fueled discussions about the potential end of dollar hegemony, as global central banks increase gold purchases to diversify their reserves. While some analysts believe fears are overblown, the trend has significant implications for global trade and investment, even as a weaker dollar benefits U.S. exporters. (not investment advice)</p>
