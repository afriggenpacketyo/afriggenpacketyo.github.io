          <p>Russell Brand appeared in Southwark Crown Court to address charges of sexual assault, including one count of sexual assault, one of indecent assault, one of oral sexual assault, and two additional counts of sexual assault. The alleged incidents involve four women and are reported to have occurred between 1999 and 2005. Brand, dressed in a dark suit and unbuttoned shirt, remained silent as he entered the court for the plea and trial preparation hearing. This hearing precedes a potential trial at a later date, during which Brand is expected to formally enter his plea to the charges. The court proceedings mark a significant step in addressing the serious allegations against the comedian and actor.</p>

          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered safeguard called the "diamond ring" to prevent catastrophic collapses. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, this toroidal device uses nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to detect grid instability in real-time. This measure was prompted by recent outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as instability in China's Xinjiang region due to renewable energy fluctuations. The "diamond ring" serves as a high-precision sentinel for power lines, addressing the challenges posed by the increasing reliance on weather-dependent renewable energy sources.</p>

          <p>Miao Hua, a high-ranking Chinese admiral and member of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is under investigation for suspected "legal violations," suggesting more severe wrongdoings than initially reported. Previously, Miao was expelled from the top legislature in March for "suspected serious violations of discipline and law." This marks the first official acknowledgement of possible legal misconduct by Miao, who formerly headed the CMC's political work department. The sensitive nature of military investigations in China means that no further details have been disclosed. The case is being handled by the military justice system, which operates with greater opacity compared to civilian institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. foreign tax bill known as Section 899, included in the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," has raised concerns on Wall Street. The bill proposes significant changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S., potentially allowing the U.S. administration to weaponize the American tax system. According to Deutsche Bank, this could transform a trade war into a capital war by using taxation on foreign holdings of U.S. assets to further U.S. economic goals. The bill targets entities from "discriminatory foreign countries" that impose levies affecting U.S. companies, such as digital services taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts could reduce home care services, leading to more children taking on caregiving roles for adults with disabilities or chronic conditions. Studies show that young caregivers often experience declines in health and academic outcomes. While some find benefits like increased self-confidence, many report higher rates of depression, anxiety, and stress. Schools in several states are beginning to recognize and support caregiving students, offering resources and flexibility. The potential reduction in Medicaid funding threatens to place additional burdens on young people already balancing school and caregiving responsibilities.</p>

The exodus of thousands of employees, particularly from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), has raised fears about the vulnerability of American agriculture. The loss of experienced veterinarians, technicians, and other key staff could compromise the government's ability to respond to crises and maintain a competitive advantage. The USDA has allowed over 15,000 employees to resign, leading to worries about the agency's capacity to protect the U.S. food supply from pests and diseases.</p>

The brothers, who were previously arrested in Romania on similar charges, deny all allegations.

Renewed uncertainty over Donald Trumpâ€™s trade agenda has provided some support for gold's haven appeal.

          <p>An opinion piece challenges the notion that travel is a great unifier, arguing that despite record levels of global tourism, bigotry, prejudice, and narrow-mindedness persist. The author suggests that many tourists fail to engage meaningfully with local cultures and realities, limiting the potential for transformative experiences. The piece points to rising nationalism, opposition to immigration, and protectionism as evidence that international travel has not effectively inoculated against prejudice.

          <p>The German central bank, the Bundesbank, anticipates that inflation will remain on target at around 2%. In April, the annual inflation rate fell to 2.1%, the lowest rate since October, largely due to cheaper energy costs compared to the previous year. With oil prices remaining low, no significant change is expected for May's annual inflation rate. The Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) is expected to release its initial data on the May inflation rate, providing further insight into the country's economic stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, calling him a "bad person" who "probably hates America." Trump's remarks came after a court panel, including a Trump appointee, ruled against his tariffs. Trump also expressed disappointment with the Federalist Society, suggesting they provided bad advice on judicial nominations. Leo, who previously advised Trump on Supreme Court picks, responded by expressing gratitude for Trump's transformation of the Federal Courts. Trump's attacks are notable given Leo's long-standing alliance with the president and his role in shaping the conservative legal movement.</p>

The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was responsible for dive-bombing attacks on about 50 people. The falconer, Wayne Housden, has been training the bird and has built an aviary for it. The hawk's behavior was likely hormonal or territorial, and Housden believes it was a captive-bred bird that had lost its falconer. The falconer plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to let it fly loose in the autumn.</p>

          <p>A New York court ruled the blanket "reciprocal" import taxes imposed by the US president were illegal, but a day later an appeals court said they could continue to be collected ahead of the case being argued, with the next hearing on 5 June. Regardless of what the outcome of the case is, the impact on the UK-US tariff pact is actually not as much as you might think. The tariffs that the US court has ruled illegal do not include those on cars, which make up the bulk of what the UK exports to the US, and steel and aluminium, which are the other UK industries most affected. The government said it was working to implement the deal as quickly as possible and that Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds would press the case for speedy implementation when he meets US representatives at a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development think-tank in Paris next week.
