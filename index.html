          <p>Eric Spofford, former CEO of Granite Recovery Centers, was arrested for allegedly conspiring to stalk journalists who published an investigation detailing sexual misconduct allegations against him. Spofford allegedly hired Eric Labarge to vandalize the journalists' homes with threatening messages, paying him $20,000 to carry out the harassment. Labarge then hired others who were charged, convicted, and sentenced for their involvement. Spofford had previously sued the radio station for defamation after the article led to financial and professional setbacks, but his lawsuit was dismissed in 2023, and now he faces federal charges related to the stalking campaign.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing one of its driest springs in the last century, impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and potentially leading to increased retail prices. The situation is particularly dire in the north and northeast, with topsoil exceptionally dry, hindering plant growth and increasing wildfire risks. Experts warn that even if rain falls, the parched soil's inability to absorb water effectively means groundwater recharge remains a challenge. While Germany's overall water consumption has decreased in recent years, the increasing frequency of droughts due to global warming necessitates better water retention strategies and drought-resistant agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has departed from his role as the Doctor in Doctor Who after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler. The BBC's press release acknowledges the Doctor's regeneration but teases the mystery behind Piper's return. Gatwa reflected on his unforgettable journey and the role's lasting impact, while Piper, known for her roles in Secret Diary of a Call Girl and Scoop, previously expressed doubt about playing the Doctor herself. This marks the shortest tenure for an actor in the role since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005.</p>

          <p>Senator Joni Ernst faced a hostile crowd at a town hall in Iowa, fielding tough questions about her support for a bill that proposes cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP. When confronted with concerns that people would die as a result of the cuts, Ernst responded, "Well, we all are going to die," sparking further outrage from the audience. The bill, which includes tax cuts for the wealthy and increased national debt, is undergoing a reconciliation process in the Senate. Ernst defended her position, claiming the cuts would only affect ineligible recipients, while clashing with voters over Trump's governing style.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Bulgarians protested in Sofia and other cities against the country's planned adoption of the euro, demanding a referendum on the issue. Critics fear the euro will harm Bulgaria's economy, fueled by distrust in institutions and disinformation campaigns. Surveys show nearly half of Bulgarians oppose joining the eurozone, with concerns particularly prevalent in rural areas. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev also opposes the euro, citing inflation and purchasing power concerns, but parliament rejected his referendum proposal, accusing him of acting on behalf of Russia.</p>

          <p>Hamas has responded to the latest U.S. ceasefire proposal, reiterating demands for a permanent ceasefire, complete withdrawal from Gaza, and continuous humanitarian aid. The group's hostage exchange proposal involves releasing 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have reportedly killed dozens of Palestinians in Gaza over the past 24 hours. U.S. Envoy Steve Witkoff deemed Hamas's response "completely unacceptable," insisting on adherence to the U.S. framework before talks, while Israel's defense minister warned Hamas to accept the deal or face destruction.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England and Wales is reportedly denying obese patients hip and knee replacements based on their BMI, contradicting NICE guidance. Patients are required to lose weight before being eligible, but NHS weight loss programs have long waiting lists or have been shut down. The Royal College of Surgeons criticizes the policy, arguing that denying care can worsen patients' health, and a former health minister calls for government action to address the obesity crisis. This practice is deemed unfair and discriminatory, especially since many patients cannot access adequate weight management support.</p>

          <p>The classic New York City bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich has seen a price increase at a Brooklyn bodega due to rising costs of ingredients like eggs, bacon, and cheese. The owners of El Vacilon Grocery, Freddy and Yovanna Melo, had to raise the price for the first time since 2019 to maintain their profit margin. Despite the challenges, the bodega remains a staple in the neighborhood, serving up to 60 sandwiches a day and relying on rent from apartments above the store to stay afloat. The bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, known as a "bandera" at El Vacilon, is a ubiquitous symbol of the city's bodega culture.</p>

          <p>Scientists criticize Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, arguing that genetic research has demonstrated a strong genetic component. They express concern that Kennedy's approach could divert resources from promising genetic therapies and create confusion for families. Experts emphasize that the increase in autism rates is largely due to broader diagnostic criteria and increased awareness, rather than a single environmental factor. They fear that Kennedy's search for a silver-bullet answer may be a false promise.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is facing a lead poisoning crisis in its schools, with several buildings closed due to contamination. The city's efforts to address the crisis have been hampered by the Trump administration's decision to eliminate the CDC's lead exposure team. This has left Milwaukee without federal expertise and support, highlighting the challenges cities face when the federal government reduces its role in public health emergencies. Local officials express concern about their ability to respond to future health threats without federal assistance.</p>

The suspension comes amid concerns about the genre of "narco-corridos" and their impact, although Grupo Firme has recently distanced itself from such content. The U.S. Embassy has not provided specific details due to confidentiality laws, while violence against musicians in Mexico remains a concern.</p>
