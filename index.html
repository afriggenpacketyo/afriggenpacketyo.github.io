          <p>Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren have requested an ethics investigation into President Trump's planned dinner with top investors of his $TRUMP meme coin. The senators are concerned that offering exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for investment in Trump's business ventures may constitute "pay to play" corruption. The value of the coin surged after the announcement, raising concerns about the Trump family profiting from political influence. The senators are urging the Office of Government Ethics to determine if federal ethics rules were violated.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that another delay to higher tariffs on China is unlikely, pressuring Beijing to offer substantial concessions in trade negotiations. Trump stated he would not drop tariffs unless China offers something significant in return, particularly opening its economy, though he expressed doubt that Beijing would agree to this. He believes financial markets are adjusting to his tariff policy, downplaying recent market volatility. This stance comes amidst ongoing trade disputes and uncertainty regarding future trade relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>American consumers are feeling the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, with Amazon sellers hiking prices on nearly 1,000 products by an average of 30%. The price increases affect a range of items, from tech accessories to women's clothing. Other e-commerce sites like Shein and Temu have also announced price hikes after the U.S. closed a loophole allowing duty-free entry for goods under $800. While Trump claims negotiations are ongoing, Chinese officials deny active talks, creating uncertainty for businesses trying to plan their supply chains.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested and charged with obstruction for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.

Dugan's lawyer said she regrets the arrest and insists it wasn't in the interest of public safety. The incident occurred after an immigration judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, who was facing misdemeanour battery counts; Flores-Ruiz was later apprehended after a foot chase.</p>

Collaborative AI systems can rank ideas and make research connections, potentially speeding up discovery, but the technology is limited by the availability of high-quality training data.

          <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin held three hours of "constructive" talks in Moscow, according to a Putin aide. Discussions focused on the possibility of resuming direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. President Trump hinted that the two sides were close to reaching a deal, while Ukrainian President Zelensky urged allies to apply more pressure on Russia. Reports suggest the US peace plan proposes Russia keeps gained land, a condition favoring Moscow.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reversed its cancellation of over 1,500 student visas held by international students. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced a shift during a court hearing, stating a new system for reviewing and terminating visas would be implemented, with no further revocations until the process is complete. The initial cancellations had caused panic among students, some of whom had already left the country. The reversal followed a wave of lawsuits filed by students who said their legal right to study in the U.S. was rescinded.</p>

          <p>George Santos, a Republican, initially presented himself as a successful Wall Street figure with compelling personal connections. However, his background was revealed to be largely fabricated before he was even sworn into Congress. He eventually pleaded guilty to a range of crimes. He was ultimately expelled from the House of Representatives.</p>

          <h2>Posthumous Publication of Joan Didion's Therapy Notes Sparks Debate</h2>

          <p>The posthumous publication of Joan Didion's therapy notes, titled *Notes to John*, has ignited debate about the ethics of publishing a writer's unpublished work after their death. The notes, meticulous accounts of sessions with her psychiatrist, focus on her adopted daughter's alcoholism. While the publication offers further insight into Didion's life and pain, it raises questions about whether she would have welcomed such intimate, unedited journals seeing the light of day.</p>

          <p>Swampbuster, a federal provision that has required American farmers to preserve wetlands on their properties to remain eligible for federal crop insurance and other government programs for 40 years, is under threat. While conservationists see an essential guardrail against habitat destruction, Jim Conlan sees government run amok. The provision has been credited by environmentalists with keeping countless acres of vulnerable land unplowed.</p>
