        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hamas has announced its intention to release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as part of ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement with Israel, a move intended to facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East. The Israeli PM's office has acknowledged the planned release, attributing it to military pressure on Hamas. The release of Alexander, who was captured during the October 7 attack, is seen as a potential catalyst for broader negotiations regarding the remaining hostages held in Gaza, with hopes that it will lead to a comprehensive agreement to end the war.</p>

          <p>Former members of UK Special Forces have come forward with eyewitness accounts of alleged war crimes committed by colleagues in Iraq and Afghanistan, detailing instances of unarmed people being murdered and detainees, including children, being executed. The veterans described how the laws of war were being regularly and intentionally broken, with killings becoming routine and some soldiers displaying psychopathic traits. The Ministry of Defence has stated its commitment to supporting the ongoing public inquiry into the alleged war crimes and urged any veterans with relevant information to come forward. The testimonies also reveal that senior commanders were aware of these issues.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned to its rightful owner, concluding a long-standing dispute that strained relations between the two countries. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea after the South Korean Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, resolving a lawsuit filed by a South Korean temple claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The artifact, designated as a cultural asset, is expected to be stored at a museum after a ceremony at the temple.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have unveiled a proposal to cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid to help cover the cost of $4.5 trillion in tax breaks, triggering a major political battle over healthcare. The legislation introduces new work and eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which Democrats argue will cause millions of Americans to lose coverage. Republicans claim these changes will eliminate waste and abuse, while Democrats warn of dire consequences for hospitals, seniors, and overall healthcare access. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.</p>

          <p>A US-brokered ceasefire between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region has been met with skepticism by foreign policy experts and diplomats, who believe it will take much more to address the long-term distrust between the two countries. While the ceasefire marks the end of the worst military confrontation in 25 years, analysts suggest that it may not lead to enduring peace. Despite mutual accusations of violations, the ceasefire is likely to hold in the short term due to international pressure and both countries' recognition of the costs of escalation. The US, Saudi Arabia, and Iran played key mediating roles.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing new plans to control migration levels, requiring spouses, siblings, parents, and grown-up children of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad, as the government seeks to seize the narrative from Reform UK. The white paper will tighten legislation that currently allows courts to grant asylum to foreign criminals and illegal migrants under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

          <p>Johnny Rodriguez, the first Mexican American country music star, has died at the age of 73. He was best known for the 1970s hits “I Just Can’t Get Her Out of My Mind” and “Ridin’ My Thumb to Mexico.” He released six singles that reached No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart, and nine others reached the Top 10.

          <p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad predicts that U.S. President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs will harm Americans more than the targeted countries. He argues that the U.S. cost of living will increase as American products cannot compete with cheaper products from the rest of the world. Mahathir suggests that ASEAN can weather the impact of the tariff hikes with intergroup trade and business with countries other than the United States. He also advocates for peace through negotiation rather than retaliation.</p>

The fire in May 2024 destroyed 1,400 small businesses, with many of the staff there being members of Warsaw's Vietnamese community.

The protection of our animals and safety of our nation's food supply is a national security issue of the utmost importance.
