            <p>Yan Anlin, a prominent advisor to Beijing on Taiwan affairs, suggests that complete reunification is still in the early stages and is likely to take another five to ten years through peaceful means. He emphasizes that this timeline is contingent on avoiding extreme actions by Taiwanese independence advocates, which could lead to rapid escalation and non-peaceful resolutions. Yan's assessment underscores the cautious approach of mainland China towards cross-strait relations, prioritizing gradual momentum over immediate, potentially destabilizing actions. He highlights the ongoing preparatory phase as crucial for achieving long-term stability and reunification.</p>

He anticipates similar challenges at the upcoming race in Miami, expressing concern about the rest of the year. Hamilton's struggles contrast sharply with his sprint race victory in China, leaving him searching for answers and improvements.</p>

            <p>Tyler Glasnow experienced lower leg cramping during the Dodgers' game against the Rangers, leading to his early exit after four innings.

The Dodgers have already placed Blake Snell on the injured list and are monitoring Blake Treinen's forearm sprain, making Glasnow's health crucial for their pitching rotation. While the diagnosis suggests nothing serious, the Dodgers are proceeding cautiously, awaiting further assessment from team doctors.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court issued an overnight order temporarily blocking the removal of alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador. Solicitor General John Sauer criticized the order as "unprecedented" and argued that the plaintiffs have no standing to seek an injunction. Sauer implored the justices to limit the order to only a pause on AEA removals, not any removals of Venezuelan alleged gang members. The court's action and the government's response highlight the ongoing legal battles surrounding immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee suggests Trump's tariffs could cause a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start due to preemptive purchasing. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are buying big-ticket items in anticipation of the tariffs. Goolsbee believes this could inflate economic activity in April but lead to a slowdown in the coming months. Sectors like the auto industry, which rely on imported components, are likely to be heavily affected. (not investment advice)</p>
