          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Merck revealed plans to cut $3 billion in costs by the end of 2027, a move to offset the upcoming 2028 patent expiration of its cancer drug Keytruda. The company reported second-quarter revenue that missed Wall Street estimates, partly due to a significant drop in sales for its Gardasil vaccine in China. As part of its restructuring, Merck will eliminate some positions while reinvesting savings into new product launches and its drug pipeline. The company also narrowed its full-year 2025 earnings and revenue guidance, factoring in impacts from U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Midtown Manhattan shooting that killed four people reportedly carried a rambling three-page note claiming he suffered from CTE. Police sources indicated the note, found on 27-year-old Shane Tamura, also contained vague references to the National Football League. Tamura, who had a history of mental health issues and played high school football, asked in the note for his brain to be studied for the degenerative disease. The shooting occurred in a building that houses the NFL's headquarters, and one of the league's employees was among the injured.</p>

          <p>A report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) confirms a worst-case famine scenario is now occurring across the Gaza Strip, with thresholds for acute malnutrition and food consumption being met. The analysis highlights that conflict, displacement, and severely restricted aid access have led to widespread starvation and a surge in hunger-related deaths, especially among children under five. Despite a partial easing of Israel's blockade, essential resources remain scarce, and local food systems have collapsed. The report urgently calls for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to prevent further widespread death.</p>

          <p>A fierce competition for top-tier artificial intelligence talent is underway, with major tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google offering massive compensation packages to lure experts away from startups. Meta has been particularly aggressive, reportedly offering multi-million dollar deals and investing heavily in its new Meta Superintelligence Labs. This trend is causing a cultural shift in Silicon Valley, as large firms cherry-pick key individuals rather than acquiring entire startups, putting smaller companies at a disadvantage. The high demand and salaries reflect the strategic importance of AI, even as the technology's ultimate applications remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A significant policy conflict is emerging within the Trump administration between Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement and the EPA's deregulatory agenda. While Kennedy's HHS aims to reduce Americans' exposure to toxins like pesticides and "forever chemicals," the EPA under Lee Zeldin is relaxing regulations on these same substances. Supporters of the MAHA movement are growing frustrated, pointing out the contradiction between their public health goals and the administration's actions that favor corporate polluters. This internal clash highlights the challenge of enacting health-focused reforms within a political coalition allied with industrial interests.</p>

This marks the first earnings report under new CEO Stephen Hemsley, who faces the task of restoring investor confidence after a challenging period that included a major cyberattack and Department of Justice investigations.

Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of leader Kim Jong Un, indicated that while the personal relationship with President Trump is "not bad," using it to pursue the old goal of denuclearization would be a "mockery." This statement signals Pyongyang's hardened stance, suggesting it will not negotiate away its nuclear arsenal, which has advanced since previous talks stalled in 2019.

This exclusion risks worsening known health disparities affecting the LGBTQ+ community, which includes higher rates of suicide attempts and substance use disorders. The author contends that deliberately excluding a population from research weakens evidence-based care and repeats historical mistakes that have led to poorer health outcomes for marginalized groups.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing cultural and political fixation on testosterone, particularly within right-wing circles, using HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s unsubstantiated claims about declining levels as a case study. It traces the history of the hormone, from its synthesis in 1935 to its modern role as a symbol of masculinity, despite the biological reality that it exists in and is crucial for all sexes. The analysis argues that testosterone has become a commodified way for some men to quantify their manliness in an era of fluid gender roles. This creates a paradox where its "naturalness" is asserted while simultaneously being sold as a supplement to be maximized.</p>

In the Zaporizhzhia region, a glide bomb strike on a correctional facility killed at least 17 inmates and wounded over 80 others. In the Dnipro region, missile strikes killed four people and damaged a maternity hospital. The attacks continue despite President Trump's recent warning to Moscow, in which he shortened a deadline for Russia to halt the violence or face new sanctions and tariffs.</p>

          <p>In a horrific incident in Nigeria's northern Zamfara state, kidnappers killed at least 35 of their hostages, even after receiving ransom payments for their release. The victims were among 56 people abducted from Banga village in March. A local official reported that the gunmen, known locally as bandits, released 18 women and a boy after being paid but then "slaughtered" the remaining captives. This tragedy highlights the escalating kidnapping-for-ransom crisis in the region, where criminal gangs frequently abduct citizens, and families often feel compelled to pay despite laws criminalizing such payments.</p>

The children are from the Poonch district in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, an area heavily affected by the cross-border shelling and drone attacks. According to the local Congress party unit, Gandhi will sponsor the children's education through their graduation. The move comes as he takes on a more prominent role as the leader of the opposition in India's lower house of parliament.</p>

India's Home Minister Amit Shah stated that the three men, identified as Pakistani nationals and members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, were killed in a gunfight in the Dachigam area. Forensic evidence reportedly linked their weapons to the April attack, which killed 26 people and triggered a severe military conflict between India and Pakistan in May.

          <p>South Korean AI chip startup Rebellions has secured a new investment from tech giant Samsung as it prepares for a potential IPO. Rebellions, which merged with rival Sapeon last year, is positioning itself as a major domestic competitor to Nvidia, focusing on chips for AI inferencing. The company is currently in a funding round aiming to raise up to $200 million and is collaborating with Samsung's foundry business to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip. This partnership could be a strategic win for Samsung as it seeks to grow its chipmaking division and compete with industry leader TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding its key short-term interest rate steady throughout 2025, consumer borrowing costs have seen little movement. The average rate for credit card balances has hovered around 20.1%, while auto loan rates have been similarly stable. Mortgage rates, which are more closely tied to 10-year Treasury yields, have fluctuated in a narrow band. While President Trump has argued for rate cuts to ease borrowing for consumers and businesses, experts note there is no guarantee a Fed cut would translate to lower rates for products like mortgages, which are influenced by broader economic factors.

The hardest-hit areas are the suburban districts of Beijing, where the floods have damaged roads, cut power, and trapped residents.

          <p>Hezbollah's extensive financial network is facing unprecedented pressure from a combination of Israeli military action, a new Lebanese government, and the U.S. administration. The Iran-backed group, which runs both licit and illicit enterprises to fund its operations, has seen its leadership and infrastructure battered. Lebanon's new government is cracking down on Hezbollah-linked entities and reasserting control over ports of entry. However, analysts note that dismantling the group's deep-rooted, cash-based shadow economy remains a formidable challenge, as it is politically and socially embedded within parts of the country and still receives support from Iran.</p>

          <p>UK utility company Anglian Water will pay £62.8 million in investments and community funding after a regulator, Ofwat, found a "serious breach" in its management of sewage works. The investigation uncovered excessive spills from storm overflows, which is deemed unacceptable. Instead of a direct fine, Anglian Water agreed to invest £57 million to improve its wastewater network and pay £5.8 million into an environmental fund. The company, which is owned by an overseas consortium, has been criticized for underinvestment while paying out dividends, and its customers face significant bill hikes to fund necessary infrastructure upgrades.</p>

          <p>Natural disasters have caused over $131 billion in global economic losses in the first half of 2025, with $80 billion of that being insured, according to a report from insurance company Munich Re. The Los Angeles wildfires were the year's costliest event so far, causing an estimated $53 billion in losses. The report highlights the increasing role of climate change in the frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters like wildfires and storms, which accounted for 88% of overall losses. Experts warn that as development continues in high-risk areas, damages and insurance costs will likely continue to climb.</p>

          <p>The severe hunger crisis in Gaza could have devastating, long-term health consequences that span generations, according to health experts. Widespread malnutrition, especially in children and pregnant women, can stunt physical and cognitive development and lead to chronic diseases later in life. Furthermore, scientists point to the field of epigenetics, suggesting that the trauma of starvation can cause heritable changes in how genes are expressed, potentially affecting the health of survivors' children and grandchildren. This long-term biological impact compounds the immediate suffering from the hunger crisis, which has been exacerbated by severely restricted aid access.</p>

The lawsuit stems from a Journal report about the alleged birthday greeting, which Trump insists is fake. This legal battle pits two titans of the American right against each other, straining a long-standing alliance of convenience between the former president and Murdoch's media empire.</p>
