          <p>Authorities are investigating a fatal Cessna 550 plane crash near San Diego's Montgomery Field Airport, examining whether foggy conditions and technical glitches contributed to the accident. The airport experienced issues with its Automated Surface Observing Station and runway lighting system at the time of the crash, which occurred in a residential neighborhood. The plane struck high-tension power lines before crashing, resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board is working with the FBI to collect evidence and determine the cause, with a preliminary report expected in 30 days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meteorologists are raising concerns about the impact of budget cuts to the National Weather Service's weather balloon program, which provides crucial data for forecasting. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has cut or reduced at least 13 balloon sites, leading to gaps in data, including areas prone to severe weather, such as Northern Michigan and Tornado Alley. Meteorologists warn that the cuts compromise the accuracy of forecasts, especially during extreme weather events like ice storms and tornadoes, as balloon data cannot be adequately replaced by satellites or radar. Former NWS leaders have also warned of potential loss of life due to understaffing and program cuts.</p>

          <p>Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, experienced a large-scale missile and drone attack by Russia, resulting in explosions and machine gun fire throughout the city.

The debris of intercepted missiles and drones fell across several city districts, requiring medical care for six people and sparking fires. The prisoner swap involved the return of 390 Ukrainians, with further releases expected.</p>

          <p>The White House is restructuring the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff and reassigning roles. Vice President JD Vance's national security adviser Andy Baker will take a top role in the restructured NSC as deputy national security adviser, along with White House deputy chief of staff Robert Gabriel. About 20 people have been placed on administrative leave as part of the changes, which come weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio replaced Mike Waltz as national security adviser. Some former members of the NSC express concern that fewer people means less control of the bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including Karen Dunn, Bill Isaacson, Jeannie Rhee, and Jessica Phillips, have announced their departure from the law firm to start their own practice. This move follows criticism of Paul Weiss for reaching a deal with the Trump administration to avoid an executive order that would have restricted its business. The deal, brokered by firm chairman Brad Karp, has been widely criticized by associates, lawyers, and Democrats, especially since Karp has been a major fundraiser for Democrats and previously opposed Trump. The departing partners did not directly address the deal in their announcement.</p>

The negotiators agreed on the need to conclude a trade deal as soon as possible, although securing major concessions for Japan appears unlikely.

Trump's threat of a 25% tariff on Apple if it didn't shift iPhone production to the U.S. and a "straight 50% Tariff" on the European Union led to swift market reactions, including declines in European markets.

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant reductions to the White House National Security Council, resulting in the dismissal of numerous policy experts. The goal is to streamline operations and eliminate duplication, with many functions returning to their respective departments and agencies. The NSC will be reduced to approximately the same size it was at the end of Trump's first term. Trump has been relying more on cabinet members like Secretary of State Marco Rubio for foreign policy decisions, diminishing the NSC's role.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology in the search for 10 escaped inmates from a New Orleans jail is under scrutiny, with authorities crediting the technology for aiding in the recapture of one fugitive. The cameras, operated by Project N.O.L.A., scanned crowds in the French Quarter, leading to the arrest of one escapee. Civil rights organizations and politicians from both parties have raised concerns about the use of live facial recognition, citing privacy and constitutional issues. The New Orleans Police Department had recently paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. until its use of the technology could be fully assessed.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also serving as the national security adviser, announced a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff by at least half. The changes involve officials returning to their original agencies and others being placed on administrative leave. This downsizing aligns with President Trump's view of foreign policy decision-making, favoring a top-down approach. The NSC has a core staff of presidential appointees supported by specialists from other government departments.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the use of hummingbird feeders in the western United States has changed the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks. The study, published in Global Change Biology, found that the beaks became longer and more slender, allowing them to access more nectar from the feeders. The range of the hummingbird also expanded northward, influenced by the increasing popularity of bird feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. The study highlights how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of organisms.</p>
