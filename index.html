            <p>A recent BBC article explores why men are less likely to visit doctors compared to women, citing data from the NHS and ONS Health Insight Survey. The article highlights that men often delay seeking medical treatment due to societal pressures of appearing tough and self-reliant. Factors such as appointment systems not fitting work patterns and a lack of targeted check-ups for younger men also contribute to this issue. The piece emphasizes the importance of men overcoming embarrassment and seeking medical help to prevent serious health consequences and highlights the emergence of support groups to help men connect and share their experiences.</p>

Aboard the RRS Discovery, researchers are collecting data to forecast hazards and map the hydrothermal system, assessing how seawater mixing with magma affects explosivity. The research aims to provide data for Greece's Civil Protection Agency and inform local residents about volcanic activity, especially after recent earthquakes caused concern. This work is crucial for understanding the behavior of underwater volcanoes, which are often under-monitored despite their potential for destructive eruptions.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The court's order prevents removals until further notice, ensuring detainees have a chance to argue their case in court. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely and without sufficient evidence. The ACLU raised concerns that the men were being targeted due to alleged gang affiliations and faced potential mistreatment in El Salvador's prisons.</p>

            <p>Professor Yan Anlin, a prominent Taiwan studies expert in mainland China, assesses the current state of cross-strait relations and the progress towards reunification. Yan believes that the process is still in the early stages and may take another five to ten years to achieve peaceful reunification. However, he cautions that if Taiwanese leaders push for independence too aggressively, peaceful reunification may become unfeasible, potentially leading to a rapid escalation of the situation. He is frequently consulted by Beijing on cross-strait policymaking.</p>

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 1-0 victory over the Texas Rangers, but the win was overshadowed by Tyler Glasnow's early exit due to leg cramps. Despite Glasnow's departure after just four innings, the Dodgers' bullpen stepped up to maintain the shutout, with contributions from several rookie pitchers. Freddie Freeman's sacrifice fly in the eighth inning provided the lone run of the game. The Dodgers expect Glasnow to make his next start, but his history of injuries raises concerns about his long-term health.</p>
