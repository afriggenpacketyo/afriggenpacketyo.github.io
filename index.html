          <p>The US decision to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those in critical fields or with Communist Party connections, has drawn strong backlash. The Chinese embassy in Washington lodged a formal diplomatic protest, denouncing the move as politically motivated and discriminatory. Critics within the US have also accused the government of xenophobia. The State Department defends the decision as crucial for protecting US national security, citing concerns about exploitation of US universities and theft of US research.</p>

          <p>Lian Ping, a prominent Chinese economist, suggests that financial sanctions could become a new arena for conflict between the US and China. While he believes full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, he warns that the US might gradually target specific Chinese entities, potentially excluding China from the US dollar system. Lian notes that such measures could damage the Swift system and prompt a shift towards China's CIPS, impacting Swift's global importance. His remarks highlight growing concerns that trade tensions could escalate into a broader financial war.</p>
