        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is discontinuing $1 billion in federal grants for school mental health programs, arguing that the Biden administration's awards violated federal civil rights law. These grants, part of the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, funded mental health professionals in schools. The Department of Education claims recipients used the funding for race-based actions, while critics argue the focus was on evidence-based mental health support. This decision has sparked concern among educators who relied on the funds to support students' mental well-being, potentially leading to layoffs and reduced services.</p>

          <p>Kinney County, Texas, has retained $1.7 million in bail from migrants who were deported before their court dates, a New York Times article reports. These migrants, often escaping poverty, were arrested for trespassing under Governor Abbott's Operation Lone Star. Kinney County officials argue they are deterring illegal crossings and compensating landowners, while critics call the practice unfair, likening it to punishing individuals who cannot attend court due to deportation. The county's aggressive enforcement has led to increased revenue, funding new trucks for the sheriff's department and raises for county officials, and even though some judges felt it was unfair to forfeit bail for deported migrants, their requests to work with ICE were denied.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, which aims to overhaul the student loan system. The plan proposes two repayment options: fixed payments over 10 to 25 years or an income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP). Under RAP, monthly payments would range from 1% to 10% of a borrower's income, varying with their earnings. The proposal seeks to generate savings for President Trump's tax cuts, significantly altering the repayment landscape for millions of borrowers.</p>

While ICE claims this targets individuals with deportation orders and criminal histories, critics warn of civil rights violations and financial burdens on localities.

          <p>Automakers such as Ford, Hyundai, and Kia reported significant U.S. sales increases in April, driven by consumers buying new vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs. This "tariff fear-buying" was supported by automakers offering discounts or promising to hold prices steady. However, demand slowed later in April as inventories tightened and prices rose, suggesting the sales surge may be short-lived. The introduction of tariffs on imported vehicles and expected levies on auto parts are likely to impact the market in the future.</p>

          <p>Oman's Foreign Minister announced that the latest round of US-Iranian nuclear talks, scheduled for this weekend, has been postponed for logistical reasons. The talks aim to limit Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting some economic sanctions. The postponement comes amid heightened tensions between Iran and the US, with Iran accusing the US of "contradictory behavior and provocative statements" after Washington imposed new oil-related sanctions and warned Tehran of consequences for supporting Yemen's Houthis.</p>

          <p>McDonald’s reported mixed quarterly results, with U.S. same-store sales declining by 3.6%, the largest domestic drop since the onset of the Covid pandemic. This decline is attributed to bad weather and cautious consumer behavior, particularly among low- and middle-income diners. Despite the challenges, McDonald’s is focusing on value meals and menu items, like the return of snack wraps, to attract customers. The company plans to keep its $5 meal deal for the rest of 2025 and is also experiencing success with new menu items such as McCrispy Chicken Strips.</p>

The editorial calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimate election and some effective policies.
