            <h2>Warren Warns of Market Crash if Trump Fires Fed Chair Powell</h2>

            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren cautioned that U.S. markets would experience a "crash" if President Trump were able to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Warren, a vocal critic of Powell, emphasized the importance of the Fed's independence from political influence for maintaining market stability. She argued that allowing a president to manipulate key economic levers would undermine the infrastructure supporting the stock market and the global economy, making the U.S. resemble a dictatorship. A White House official downplayed Trump's remarks, stating there were no plans to terminate Powell's term early.</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop after the company lowered its annual profit forecast, citing higher medical costs within its Medicare Advantage plans. This development has raised concerns among Wall Street analysts about the potential impact on other insurers offering similar Medicare plans. The increased medical costs are attributed to more seniors seeking previously delayed medical procedures, a trend that has affected the insurance industry. Analysts suggest that companies with a strong presence in Medicare Advantage markets may face greater challenges, while those that have exited certain markets may be less affected.

            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni met with President Trump at the White House, carrying the hopes and anxieties of European leaders regarding potential trade tariffs. European leaders hope Meloni can act as a bridge between the Trump administration and the EU, which Trump has criticized. The EU faces a 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S., though Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days, leaving a 10% universal rate in place. Meloni has urged the EU to avoid retaliatory measures, advocating for negotiations to reach a constructive resolution.</p>

The WHS was implemented to make golf more inclusive, allowing players without club memberships to obtain handicaps usable worldwide. The system allows for scores from general play to be submitted, increasing the need for honesty among golfers. The R&A is collaborating with golf organizations in Great Britain and Ireland to raise awareness about the responsibilities within the rules of handicapping.</p>

            <p>A recent CDC study indicates that 1 in 31 children, or more than 3% of kids, have been identified with autism, marking a significant increase. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has cited these figures as evidence of a growing autism "epidemic," a claim criticized by experts. CDC scientists suggest that the rise in diagnoses may reflect improved screening and access to services. The study also notes higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to factors like preterm birth and lead poisoning.</p>

            <p>President Trump has once again urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even hinting at the "termination" of Chair Jerome Powell. Trump criticized Powell's report as a "complete mess," arguing that lower rates are needed despite falling oil and grocery prices and rising tariff revenues. A White House official clarified that Trump's post should be seen as a reiteration of his frustrations with Powell, not a threat to fire him. The comments follow Powell's recent speech where he noted the administration's tariffs put the central bank in a difficult position.</p>

Judge James Boasberg demanded that officials "assert custody" over those deported after he ordered them not to be. The administration denies wrongdoing, depicting the deportees as "terrorists and criminal illegal migrants." Experts suggest a showdown between the judicial and executive branches is likely, potentially leading to fines, penalties, or even criminal contempt charges.</p>

            <p>President Trump met with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni at the White House amidst a tariff standoff with the European Union. The talks followed Trump's meetings with Japanese officials and discussions with Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum. Trump stated that "every nation" desires to meet on tariffs, including China, although immediate negotiations with China seem unlikely. Trump also criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, expressing frustration over Powell's expectation that Trump's tariff policy would cause higher inflation and slower economic growth.</p>

            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has warned that the NHS will face legal action if it fails to update its gender policies to align with a recent Supreme Court ruling. The ruling defines "woman" as biological sex under equalities law, potentially impacting single-sex spaces like hospital wards. The EHRC expects its updated guidance to be in place by the summer, and has indicated it will pursue the NHS if changes are not made. The NHS has stated that it is reviewing guidance on same-sex accommodation and will consider the Supreme Court ruling.</p>

            <p>President Trump has criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates, stating that Powell's "termination cannot come fast enough!" Trump's criticism comes ahead of a potential interest rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB). He claims that oil and grocery prices are down and that the U.S. is getting rich on tariffs, warranting lower interest rates. ECB President Christine Lagarde defended Powell, emphasizing a steady relationship among central bankers.</p>

            <p>Texas is considering banning most THC products just a few years after legalization created a multibillion-dollar industry. The Texas Senate passed a bill to ban nearly all consumable hemp products with THC, citing abuses and safety issues. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick argues the products are being marketed to children and fueling a public health crisis. Opponents argue for more regulation rather than a ban, suggesting measures like age requirements and distance restrictions from schools and churches.</p>

They recognize the importance of knowing their neighbors and building connections to foster resilience in the face of climate collapse and other crises.
