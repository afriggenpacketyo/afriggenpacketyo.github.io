          <p>Governors in the eastern United States are increasingly critical of PJM, the organization responsible for managing the electrical grid across 13 states and the District of Columbia, as energy costs rise significantly. The frustration is escalating in state capitals as officials grapple with the impact on residents and businesses. The governors are seeking greater accountability and solutions to mitigate the financial strain caused by the energy cost surge, potentially leading to policy changes or increased regulatory oversight of PJM's operations in the near future. This situation underscores the challenges of balancing energy affordability with grid reliability and sustainability goals. The stability of the grid and the prices of energy are at odds, and this situation must be addressed. Optimism score is based on the relatively manageable and non-tragic nature of the event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Official figures indicate that UK companies are hesitant to hire new staff or replace departing employees, leading to a decrease in job vacancies. The estimated number of available jobs has fallen to 736,000 over the three months to May, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.6%, the highest in almost four years. This slowdown in hiring activity is attributed to increased employment costs, including a rise in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers and a minimum wage increase. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce the Spending Review, which will allocate funding for public services and infrastructure, with the NHS and defense expected to be major beneficiaries.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faced questioning from the House Appropriations Committee's Defense Subcommittee regarding military deployments to Los Angeles. Representative Betty McCollum pressed Hegseth on the budgetary implications and resource allocation of these deployments, particularly in light of protests and civil unrest.

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a court order that would allow hundreds of noncitizens deported to El Salvador to challenge their detentions. A judge ruled that these individuals, deported under the Alien Enemies Act, have the right to contest the legality of their detentions. The administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime authority, to deport alleged gang members, arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua poses a national security threat.

          <p>A provision within the House-approved "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could complicate access to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for low-income families. Starting in 2028, the measure would require pre-certification of each qualifying child for those claiming the EITC. Policy experts suggest this new rule could create burdens for eligible filers, potentially deterring them from claiming the credit and delaying tax refunds. The aim is to prevent erroneous claims, but concerns are rising about the IRS's capacity to process the increased documentation, especially given existing resource constraints.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied that his government's revised policy on winter fuel payments was a result of political pressure, attributing the change to an improved economy. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of Â£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government's initial decision to withdraw the payments from all but the poorest pensioners was made to address a Â£22bn black hole in the economy. Better-than-expected growth figures and trade deals have allowed the government to increase the eligibility threshold for the payment, which is expected to cost around Â£1.25bn.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, due to comments they made regarding Gaza. The sanctions include a ban from entering the UK and a freeze on any assets held in the UK, with the foreign secretary stating that the ministers had "incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights." In response, Israel has criticized the move as outrageous, while the UK has emphasized that the measures are in response to rising violence and intimidation by Israeli settlers against Palestinian communities in the West Bank. The UK's decision reflects growing pressure to take action against the Israeli government's operations in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has substantially increased its military spending in response to recent clashes with India, raising next year's defense budget by roughly 20%.

The increased military spending is viewed as necessary to ensure sufficient resources following the conflict with India, but it could also lead to cuts in other areas, such as welfare. The move reflects the country's focus on national security amidst ongoing regional tensions.</p>

There are 1.2 million families with three or more children in the UK, and around 370,000 of these are households on universal credit.
