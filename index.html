          <p>On Tuesday, some ChatGPT users experienced outages, with nearly 2,000 reports logged on Downdetector. OpenAI acknowledged the issue, reporting "elevated error rates" that had persisted for seven hours, though performance was said to be recovering. Users encountered messages such as "Too many concurrent requests" or found that the chatbot was unresponsive to questions. The incident highlights the challenges of maintaining consistent service availability for AI platforms experiencing high demand, with the company working to address the degraded performance and restore full functionality to all users. This incident is a reminder of the complexities involved in managing AI services at scale. The incident underscores the need for robust infrastructure and proactive monitoring to ensure reliable access to AI tools. Optimism is tempered by the reminder that technology can be fallible.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would consider invoking the Insurrection Act in response to protests in Los Angeles, claiming they were fueled by "paid insurrectionists" without providing evidence. He asserted that without the National Guard, Los Angeles "would be burning," referencing past wildfires. However, California Governor Newsom refuted Trump's claim that they spoke, emphasizing the lack of communication despite the deployment of Marines. The article highlights the tension between the federal government and state authorities regarding the response to protests and immigration issues, with Trump's rhetoric escalating the situation. The conflicting accounts raise questions about the accuracy of the president's statements and the motivations behind the federal intervention. The situation reflects ongoing political divisions and the complex dynamics of federal-state relations.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has formally requested clarity from UEFA regarding Crystal Palace's qualification for the Europa League, citing concerns over potential breaches of multi-club ownership rules. The issue centers on American businessman John Textor, who owns a significant stake in both Crystal Palace and Lyon, both of whom have qualified for the competition. UEFA regulations prevent any individual or entity from holding a majority stake in two clubs participating in the same European tournament, aiming to prevent collusion. Forest, who could benefit from Palace's disqualification, has voiced its reservations, while Palace insists it operates independently and achieved its qualification through merit by winning the FA Cup.</p>

This action follows previous attacks and comes despite President Trump's earlier announcement to halt U.S. military strikes against the Iran-backed group.

Vague laws in Britain grant police excessive power to arrest individuals for offensive online speech, and anti-protest laws are becoming increasingly restrictive.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in President Trump's tax bill, known as Section 899, could allow the federal government to impose taxes on foreign-parented companies and investors from countries deemed to have "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. This measure could deter international companies from expanding into the U.S. due to concerns about facing steep taxes. An analysis suggests the provision could cost the U.S. jobs and reduce GDP, potentially offsetting gains from the overall tax cuts. The tax reflects a tension in Trump's policy agenda, as he simultaneously seeks foreign investments while imposing higher taxes on imports and foreign profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, stated that the US is no longer pursuing the goal of an independent Palestinian state. He suggested that any future Palestinian entity could be carved out of a Muslim country, rather than requiring Israel to cede territory. This marks a significant shift from long-standing US Middle East policy, with analysts describing it as an explicit abandonment of a two-state solution. The comments have drawn criticism and raised concerns about the impact on diplomatic efforts and the future of Palestinian aspirations.</p>

          <p>The deployment of 700 active-duty U.S. Marines to Los Angeles amid ongoing immigration protests is facing criticism due to a lack of coordination with local officials. California officials insist federal help is unnecessary, and the LAPD chief stated the deployment poses a "significant" challenge. The Marines are expected to join the National Guard in protecting federal agents and buildings. Meanwhile, protests continue, with clashes between protesters and law enforcement, and ICE raids are ongoing in the area.</p>

          <p>A Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled that Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented Mexican immigrant who was detained after being falsely accused of threatening President Trump, can be released on a $7,500 bond. The judge cited a lack of evidence that Morales-Reyes is a danger to the community. While DHS did not oppose the bond request, they emphasized their commitment to deporting illegal aliens. The case highlights the complexities of immigration enforcement and the potential for wrongful accusations.</p>
