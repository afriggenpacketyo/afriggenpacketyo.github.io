          <p>Shares of Deliveroo experienced a significant jump after the British food delivery company confirmed a $3.6 billion takeover bid from DoorDash. The announcement led Deliveroo to immediately halt its £100 million share buyback program. Deliveroo's board indicated it was inclined to recommend the offer to shareholders, pending further discussions. This potential acquisition comes after Deliveroo's stock faced challenges post-IPO due to concerns about market growth and competition, while DoorDash aims to expand its global footprint beyond the US and Canada.

          <p>Dividend stocks are gaining traction as a potentially stable investment option amid increasing volatility in both the stock and bond markets. With over 100 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, investors are drawn to the income component derived from corporate cash flow. While passive dividend funds remain popular due to lower costs, actively managed dividend ETFs are emerging, aiming to identify higher-quality dividend payers for a blend of capital appreciation and yield.

          <p>U.S. agriculture exporters are reporting significant financial losses due to the ongoing trade war and retaliatory tariffs, particularly from decreased Chinese purchases of U.S. farm products.

Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture reveals China's largest cancellation of pork orders since 2020.

          <p>Real Madrid defender Antonio Rüdiger is facing a potential ban after throwing an object, believed to be an ice cube, at a referee during the Spanish Cup final, leading to his dismissal. The incident occurred amid heightened tensions between Real Madrid and the referee, Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, who had previously discussed the impact of verbal criticism on referees. Rüdiger has since apologized for his actions, but condemnation has been widespread, with calls for the German FA to take disciplinary action. This is not the first time Rüdiger has been in trouble this year, having previously faced UEFA sanctions for a gesture made during a Champions League match.</p>

Mark Carney, the new Liberal leader, capitalized on this shift by presenting himself as the leader best equipped to manage the economic crisis imposed by Trump.
