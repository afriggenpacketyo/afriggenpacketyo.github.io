          <p>England has announced its squad for the first Test match against India, recalling Jacob Bethell and including Jamie Overton. Bethell returns to the squad after missing the Zimbabwe match due to IPL commitments, though his place in the final XI is not assured. Gus Atkinson is out with a hamstring injury, joining other sidelined fast bowlers, while Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse return. Overton is in the Test squad for the first time since the 2022 tour of Pakistan, and Josh Tongue and Sam Cook are also included, with Matthew Potts missing out. The series opener is scheduled for June 20 at Headingley. The optimism score for this article is neutral, as it simply reports team selections and injury updates. </p>

          <p>This article reports that athletes participating in the World Cup, individuals holding dual citizenship, and those with existing visas will be exempt from the Trump administration's new travel ban. The ban, which restricts entry into the United States for nationals from specific countries, includes exceptions to accommodate international events and pre-existing legal permissions. This ensures that the World Cup can proceed without disruption and that individuals with established ties to the U.S. are not unduly affected. The article focuses on the exceptions rather than the ban itself, providing a balanced perspective on the policy's implementation. </p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius stated that Germany needs to recruit up to 60,000 additional service personnel to meet NATO's updated defense requirements amidst growing tensions with Russia. Germany is adapting its military posture in response to NATO's plans for collective defense, shoring up its eastern flank following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Pistorius has proposed a model relying on voluntary service, with the option to make conscription compulsory if needed, where 18-year-olds would receive a questionnaire about their interest in the army and physical condition. Germany had conscription for young men until 2011, when it was scrapped. </p>

          <p>British money transfer firm Wise announced its plan to move its primary listing location to the U.S., which is a blow to the London stock exchange. Wise stated in its full-year earnings statement that it will move to a dual listing, shifting its main listing hub to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. This move would allow Wise's shares to trade on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, and shares of Wise traded 7% higher during early morning deals Thursday. The company's decision reflects a broader trend of firms seeking more favorable listing environments. </p>

Senior executives from Chinese EV makers were summoned to Beijing to "self-regulate," while the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers criticized BYD for initiating the latest round of discounts. The government-linked body warned of risks to profit margins and consumer safety, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology plans to increase regulation of non-productive competition.

Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, saving parents £500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund the change up to 2029 and pledged £13 million to food charities to fight food poverty.

While the Army has met its recruiting goal for the year, officials believe the parade will inspire a new generation to serve, and Representative Derrick Van Orden defended the parade spending.

          <p>Burundi is holding parliamentary elections where the ruling CNDD-FDD party, led by President Evariste Ndayishimiye, is expected to maintain power due to the effective sidelining of the main opposition, CNL. The CNL was suspended in 2023 over alleged irregularities, and its leader, Agathon Rwasa, was ousted in a government-orchestrated move. With Rwasa barred from participating, the ruling party faces little electoral threat amidst a deep socio-economic crisis, including widespread shortages and soaring inflation. The elections are likely to reinforce the ruling party's grip on power as it faces mounting internal pressure over economic mismanagement and political repression. </p>

          <p>The US-China trade truce is showing signs of unraveling, with Donald Trump accusing Beijing of breaching the deal to cut tariffs, while China claims Washington has imposed discriminatory measures. The deal, reached after negotiations in Geneva, slashed tariffs on both sides, but tensions have resurfaced over US access to rare earths and other issues. Confusion remains over the specifics of the agreement, particularly regarding export licenses for rare earths, and the US seeks to cut its trade deficit with China and secure further economic reforms. A potential call between Trump and Xi Jinping is anticipated to address the deadlock. </p>

          <p>Citigroup announced plans to cut around 3,500 technology positions in China as part of a broader effort to streamline global operations and reduce costs. The job cuts, affecting the China Citi Solution Centers in Shanghai and Dalian, are expected to be completed by the start of the fourth quarter this year. Some of the roles will be moved to Citi's technology centers elsewhere, and the layoffs are part of a plan to reduce 10% of its workforce globally. Citi's CEO Jane Fraser has undertaken a sweeping reorganization to improve profitability, and other major global banks are also trimming costs due to a deteriorating global economic outlook. </p>

          <p>Kelly Ramsey, a veteran wildland firefighter, recounts her experiences battling wildfires as a member of an elite hotshot crew, highlighting the physical and mental demands of the job. Prolonged droughts and unpredictable weather patterns have intensified fire behavior, making the work increasingly dangerous.

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss jabs to use effective contraception, as it's uncertain if the medicines could harm an unborn baby. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese women, due to side effects like vomiting and diarrhoea. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward, ranging from one to two months depending on the drug. The warning comes amid concerns that the growing popularity of these injections means many women are not using the drugs safely. </p>

She argues that the progressive explanation for this age gap is progress, with younger generations being more relaxed about sex and sexuality. However, Rustin contends that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist, as women are more disadvantaged by these changes. She suggests that consciousness of sexual difference accumulates across the life-course, influencing views on gender identity. </p>

          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein have experienced a significant drop in U.S. demand following President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the de minimis loophole. Temu's U.S. daily active users (DAUs) decreased by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs fell by 25%, and monthly active users (MAUs) also declined. These declines are reflected in both platforms' Apple App Store rankings, and the user drop-off coincides with reduced U.S. advertising spending by both Temu and Shein since the tariff announcements. Trump ended the "de minimis" tariff exemption on May 2, which allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free. </p>
