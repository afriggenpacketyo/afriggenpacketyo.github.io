Chinese markets were particularly active following President Xi Jinping's speech at a World War II anniversary parade, attended by leaders like Putin and Kim Jong Un. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined despite stronger-than-expected Q2 GDP growth, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw modest gains. Japanese markets also experienced declines, with government bond yields increasing across various maturities.</p>

          <p>Ben Griscti, a player for the Adelaide 36ers, is recovering from a fractured vertebra after a basketball backboard collapsed during a practice session. The incident, which occurred after a teammate's dunk, has sidelined Griscti for the start of Australia's National Basketball League season. Despite a hospital being nearby, an ambulance took approximately 90 minutes to arrive due to other emergencies in the territory. Griscti is reported to be in stable condition, and the injury is not expected to require surgery, with no current timetable for his return to play.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that the world faces a choice between "peace or war" and "dialogues or confrontation" during a large military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II's end. The event in Beijing was attended by 26 world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. U.S. President Donald Trump, in a social media post, urged Xi to acknowledge U.S. contributions in WWII while accusing Beijing of conspiring against Washington. Xi also reiterated China's commitment to bolstering its military capabilities, implicitly referencing Taiwan's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than anticipated in the second quarter, achieving its fastest growth rate since September 2023. The country's GDP increased by 1.8% year-over-year, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 1.6% and the previous quarter's 1.3%. This growth was primarily fueled by domestic spending, including household and government consumption, with net trade also contributing positively. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and noted an easing of financial conditions, though it revised down its full-year economic growth forecast due to a lower outlook for productivity.</p>

The president stated he was highly active over the Labor Day weekend, engaging in media interviews and visiting his Virginia golf course. He expressed frustration that his brief absence from public appearances led to questions about his well-being. This article notes that speculation intensified on social media, partly fueled by a vice-president's interview suggesting preparedness to step in if needed.</p>

          <p>California legislators have approved a bill mandating that schools notify families and teachers when immigration enforcement agents are present on campuses. This measure, authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, aims to inform and empower school communities amid the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaigns. The legislation, which awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, would apply to K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges, creating a system similar to existing emergency alerts. Supporters emphasize the importance of students feeling safe to learn, citing concerns over immigration agents arresting individuals near schools.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'Power and the Palace' by Valentine Low, has revealed several anecdotes about the British royal family, including Queen Camilla's experience of fighting off a sexual assault as a teenager. The book recounts Camilla telling Boris Johnson in 2008 how she used her shoe to defend herself and ensured the perpetrator's arrest. This revelation aligns with Queen Camilla's public campaigning against domestic abuse and violence against women. The article also touches on Queen Elizabeth II's private views on Brexit, royal funding negotiations, and the government's push for a 'maximalist' Coronation ceremony.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a U.S. strike on what he described as a Venezuelan gang's drug-carrying vessel resulted in 11 deaths. Speaking at the White House, Trump claimed the boat contained "a lot of drugs" and posted a video of a vessel exploding on Truth Social. Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested the drugs were likely headed to the Caribbean. Trump alleged the Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, was controlled by President Nicolas Maduro, a claim Venezuelan officials deny, stating the gang was dismantled in 2023. This article reports the first U.S. military operation of its kind in the southern Caribbean.</p>

          <p>Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, spewing lava 330 feet into the air from its summit crater. This marks the 32nd eruption episode since December 2024, with all lava currently contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma continuously rises from the Earth's interior, building pressure until it forces out older, degassed magma, creating the dramatic fountains. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and while scientists can predict eruptions days in advance, the ultimate duration or changes in its activity remain uncertain.</p>

          <p>A Nottingham-based charity, the Safer Living Foundation, which had a remarkable success rate in preventing sex offenders from reoffending, has been forced to close due to a lack of funding. The scheme provided a safe space and support for individuals with sexual convictions, achieving a 2% reoffending rate compared to the national average of 15.1%. Despite evidence of its effectiveness in protecting potential victims, the organization struggled to secure necessary funds in a tough financial climate. This article raises critical questions about society's approach to rehabilitation versus punishment for sex offenders.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who intentionally fail to prevent fentanyl and other synthetic opioid trafficking. Sponsored by Representative Andy Barr, the legislation also facilitates sanctions on Chinese manufacturers and distributors of fentanyl precursors that do not implement credible steps against opioid trafficking. Barr emphasized targeting the source of precursors in China to combat the fentanyl crisis. While supporting the bill, Representative Gregory Meeks stressed that sanctions alone are insufficient, advocating for active partnership and diplomacy with nations like China and Mexico.</p>

Daskalakis, who gained recognition for leading the mpox outbreak response, has publicly criticized Kennedy's actions.
