          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) plans. This move is seen as a victory for the alternative asset industry, which has advocated for access to the trillions of dollars in retirement funds. While proponents argue it offers diversification, the inclusion of such assets, known for higher fees and less transparency, introduces new risks for individual retirement savers.

          <p>President Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, a past critic of the Federal Reserve, to its Board of Governors. Miran, who previously served in the Trump White House, would fill a term expiring in January 2026. His nomination is notable due to his past advocacy for devaluing the dollar and his strong pro-crypto stance. The appointment requires Senate confirmation, which is unlikely before September, and would place him on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

          <p>Dean Cain, known for his role as Superman in the 1990s TV series "Lois & Clark," has stated he will be sworn in as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent. The announcement followed ICE's decision to waive age limits for new applicants as it seeks to fill 10,000 vacancies. Cain, who has previously served as a reserve police officer and sheriff's deputy, framed his decision as a way to support first responders. His move has drawn attention, particularly after his recent criticism of the new "Superman" film's portrayal of the character as an immigrant.</p>

Pathway's technology helps doctors get AI-powered answers to questions about medical guidelines, drugs, and trials by synthesizing information from a vast dataset of medical literature. The acquisition aims to integrate Pathway's robust backend data, which scored 96% on a U.S. medical licensing exam benchmark, into Doximity's existing platform.

While a trilateral meeting remains the administration's stated preference to end the war in Ukraine, this shift signals a new flexibility in diplomatic approaches. The Kremlin had previously claimed a meeting between Trump and Putin was already arranged. Zelenskyy has maintained that Ukraine and Europe must be integral participants in any peace negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Air Force has confirmed it will deny early retirement benefits to transgender service members with 15 to 18 years of service who are being separated under the current administration's policy. Instead of being allowed to retire, these individuals will be offered a lump-sum separation payment typically given to junior troops. This decision reverses a previous notification to about a dozen service members that their applications for an exception to policy had been approved. The move enforces the broader policy of removing all transgender personnel from the service unless they receive a specific waiver.</p>

          <p>This article explains that while a debt collector can legally freeze a bank account, they cannot do so arbitrarily. They must first file a lawsuit and obtain a court judgment against the debtor, a process that takes months and allows the individual to respond. Even with a judgment, federal and state laws protect certain funds from garnishment, including Social Security, disability, and veterans' benefits. If an account is frozen, individuals have options, such as filing an exemption claim with the court or negotiating a payment plan with the collector to have the freeze lifted.</p>

          <p>The cybersecurity sector experienced a sharp sell-off, triggered by a 25% plunge in Fortinet's stock after its earnings report indicated a key sales cycle was slowing. This dragged down peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, even though their business models differ. Some analysts argue this reaction is overblown, creating a potential "buy the dip" opportunity for fundamentally strong companies unaffected by Fortinet's specific issues. The article notes that the market often penalizes entire sectors due to bad news from one company, regardless of individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fashion designer Willy Chavarría and Adidas are facing accusations of cultural appropriation for their new "Oaxaca Slip On" sneaker, which combines a modern sole with the leather weave of traditional Mexican huaraches. Critics on social media have pointed out that the shoe, named for a Mexican state, is made in China and fails to credit or benefit the Indigenous artisans who originated the craft. The government of Oaxaca is reportedly considering legal action over the design and the unauthorized use of its name. The controversy has sparked a broader conversation about representation and compensation in the fashion industry.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates President Trump's overall and economic approval ratings remain negative, with 51% of the public disapproving of his job performance. The poll also shows negative ratings on his handling of key issues like inflation and federal spending. However, the survey simultaneously reveals a historic low in the Democratic Party's favorability rating, which has sunk to a net -32 points. This suggests public dissatisfaction extends across the political aisle, creating a complex political landscape with conflicting crosscurrents among voters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Americans get an average of 55% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods. These foods, such as sandwiches, sweet bakery products, and savory snacks, are typically high in salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats while being low in fiber. The consumption rate is even higher among young people, at nearly 62%. The findings are concerning as previous research has linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods to an increased risk of 32 damaging health outcomes, including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee stated that any decision by Israel to take full control of the Gaza Strip is one that "only the Israelis can make." He emphasized that it is not the role of the United States to dictate Israel's actions but that the president would offer advice if asked. Huckabee also commented that he believes ceasefire negotiations with Hamas have "broken down completely" because he asserts the group is not serious. His remarks come as the Israeli Prime Minister has publicly stated an intention to take control of all of Gaza.</p>

The proposal would allow state lawmakers to help determine district boundaries for the next three election cycles if the Texas measure passes. Proponents frame it as a necessary step to fight back against what they see as an attempt to "steal the 2026 election."</p>

The article posits that the resulting hunger crisis has not weakened Hamas's negotiating position but has instead prompted global outrage, leading key allies to support Palestinian statehood and alienating factions within the U.S. The author attributes the policy to Prime Minister Netanyahu's political dependence on far-right coalition partners who favor ever-harsher measures, even at the expense of Israel's long-term security and standing.</p>

The statement was made as new U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries took effect. An extension of the truce would temporarily pause the escalating trade conflict between the two economic superpowers, which has seen both sides impose steep tariffs on each other's goods throughout the year.

This move would have massive repercussions for the apportionment of congressional seats and federal funding.
