        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is emphasizing the importance of advanced manufacturing for China's economic self-reliance, a strategy that contrasts with U.S. President Donald Trump's desire to boost domestic high-tech production. Xi's recent visit to Henan province underscored his commitment to manufacturing-led growth, which has been criticized by the U.S. and trade partners for contributing to global trade imbalances. Experts suggest China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing strategy due to its connection with Beijing's pursuit of self-reliance, particularly in high-tech sectors. The "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform China into a leading manufacturer in areas like electric vehicles and semiconductors.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has attacked Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies, branding them as 'fantasy' economics akin to Liz Truss's, warning they could lead to an economic meltdown and increased mortgage costs. Starmer accuses Farage of pledging unfunded tax cuts that could destabilize the economy, drawing parallels to Truss's mini-budget in 2022 which caused financial market turmoil. Reform UK's proposals include tax breaks for married couples, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, and restoring winter fuel payments for all pensioners. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates Reform's income tax policy could cost between Â£50 billion and Â£80 billion a year, raising concerns about funding.</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs in a major blow to his economic policies, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court said the US Constitution gave Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, blocking tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada related to drug and illegal immigration concerns. The White House has criticized the ruling and plans to appeal, while global markets have responded positively. The ruling could lead to refunds for businesses that paid the tariffs, but the case will need to go through the appeals process before any changes occur at the border.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Secretary of State Marco Rubio, plans to 'aggressively revoke' visas of Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in 'critical fields.' The State Department will revise visa criteria to 'enhance scrutiny' of future applications from China, including Hong Kong, raising concerns among the roughly 275,000 Chinese students in the United States. This move is part of a broader crackdown on elite universities and international students, coinciding with heightened tensions between the United States and China over trade and security. American universities and research labs have benefited from talented students from China, and many rely on international students paying full tuition for a substantial part of their annual revenue.</p>

          <p>A federal court in New York has blocked President Donald Trump's plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs. The tariffs had overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, and raised the risk of higher prices and recession. The ruling is being appealed, but it has already created uncertainty for companies and countries negotiating trade deals with the U.S.</p>

          <p>This Kyodo News digest covers several key updates, including Japan's plan for small shops to sell reserve rice to combat price surges. It also notes that Japan's defense equipment outlays may help ease the U.S. trade gap, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in tariff talks. Toyota's April global sales rose by 10% ahead of the U.S. tariff impact, and Nissan is soliciting early retirements in the U.S. as part of its turnaround efforts. NTT Docomo plans to acquire SBI Sumishin Net Bank to diversify its operations, and Elon Musk announced his exit from the Trump administration.</p>

The explosions occurred during piling work for a new house in Edogawa Ward, which had been a parking space for about 40 years. Police believe workers drilled into the cylinder, causing its acetylene gas to ignite. The cylinder was found with a hole measuring about 6 centimeters in diameter and was covered in rust.</p>

          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of Americans joining the Israeli military, questioning the motivations behind their radicalization and involvement in war crimes. The author highlights the case of Edan Alexander, an American Israeli soldier held captive by Hamas, and notes that thousands of Americans serve in Israeli ranks. The article suggests a social apparatus exists through which young Americans are radicalized, citing Zionist summer camps and a 'fierce commitment to the Jewish state.' The author contrasts this with Americans fighting against occupation in Ukraine and calls for more attention to the radicalization of young Zionist men and women.</p>

She criticizes Israelâ€™s new aid delivery system, facilitated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, arguing it is insufficient and incompatible with humanitarian principles.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales in April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of anticipated negative effects from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, an all-time high for April. While Toyota stated it would not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts believe the company will face pressure to do so if the tariffs remain long-term. The company expects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen.</p>

          <p>A federal court has undermined President Trump's core economic policy by blocking his sweeping tariffs, leading to potential constitutional crisis. The US Court of International Trade found the tariffs unlawful, ruling that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This decision affects tariffs imposed on almost all US trading partners, including China, Mexico, and Canada. While the administration plans to appeal, the ruling creates uncertainty and could undermine Trump's negotiating tactics, as he uses tariffs as a revenue generator and negotiating tool.</p>

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has been mulling sanctions for months, with momentum accelerating after Britain joined France and Canada in condemning Israel's expansion of military operations in Gaza. However, the recent deadly shooting of Israeli embassy employees in Washington has given pause to some British officials. Britain is likely to wait to see if Israel allows a measurable increase in aid to Gaza before making a decision.</p>

Despite legal guarantees and pressure from civil society, segregation persists, often justified by language, behavior, or parental choice. The Slovak government has introduced reforms, but these measures often reinforce segregation rather than eradicate it.

          <p>President Trump is asserting that Harvard University is to blame for his administration's actions against it, including the suffocation of federal funding. Trump claims Harvard is 'treating our country with great disrespect' and must 'behave themselves,' framing his actions as looking out for both the country and Harvard. This narrative reflects Trump's broader worldview that opposition to him is the fault of those who push back, not his own actions. Making an example of those who dissent is paramount for Trump, sending a message that no dissent will be tolerated.</p>
