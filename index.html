        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is investing Â£102 million to upgrade and expand over 1,000 GP surgeries across the country, marking the largest public investment in facilities in five years. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that these upgrades aim to address long waiting times and improve patient access, with projects set to begin this summer. The funding is intended to modernize facilities and create additional space for doctors to see more patients, shifting care from hospitals to community settings. This initiative is part of broader plans to overhaul the health service and tackle the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments, with nearly 45% of GP appointments occurring on the day they are booked.

          <p>Senator Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA following ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have resulted in hundreds of flight delays and cancellations. Schumer attributes the issues to a nationwide air traffic controller shortage, cuts at the FAA, and outdated technology. He also criticized the FAA for offering bonuses to air traffic controllers at some towers but not to those in Washington, Philadelphia, or New York. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark due to the disruptions, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area."</p>

          <p>A scheduled Central Park performance by R&B singer Kehlani was canceled by the City Parks Foundation after pressure from New York City officials, citing security concerns.

Mastro warned the foundation that its license to stage concerts could be at risk if the event proceeded, leading to the cancellation. The foundation emphasized that the safety and security of guests and artists are of utmost importance.

          <p>Michael Rogers, the FDA's top official overseeing drug and food safety inspections, has abruptly retired after more than three decades with the agency. His departure comes amid reported frustration among inspectors regarding sweeping cuts ordered by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the FDA's new commissioner, Dr. Marty Makary. Makary's plans to expand foreign surprise inspections while cutting the length of foreign inspection trips have perplexed officials, who argue it's not possible to increase inspections without cutting corners on oversight. Officials also warn of a drain on morale for the agency's workforce due to long-running challenges with hiring and retaining investigators.</p>

          <p>Travelers coming in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport are experiencing major delays and cancellations due to staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction. The FAA has issued ground delays and stops, with arriving flights delayed up to six hours at one point. The main issue is a shortage of air traffic controllers in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is based. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from Newark's schedule, and lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo from U.S. intelligence agencies contradicts President Trump's claim that the Venezuelan government controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify deporting Venezuelans to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's actions in the United States. This release further undermines the administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage on the issue.</p>

          <p>The National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) has begun terminating grant funding to arts organizations after President Trump's proposed budget called for shutting down the agency. Local theaters, literary groups, and organizations are receiving full and immediate withdrawals of federal funding. The NEA stated that it is updating its grant policies and priorities to focus funding on projects that reflect the nation's rich artistic heritage and creativity as prioritized by the President. The agency will now prioritize projects that "elevate the Nation's HBCUs and Hispanic Serving Institutions, celebrate the 250th anniversary of American independence, foster AI competency, empower houses of worship to serve communities, assist with disaster recovery, foster skilled trade jobs, make America healthy again, support the military and veterans, support Tribal communities, make the District of Columbia safe and beautiful, and support the economic development of Asian American communities."</p>
