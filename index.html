          <p>Residents of Starbase, Texas, home to Elon Musk's SpaceX, have been warned that they may "lose the right to continue using" their property as the town considers a new zoning ordinance and citywide map. The proposed "Mixed Use District" would allow for residential, office, retail, and small-scale service uses. Starbase, officially formed after a local election, is run by SpaceX employees and former employees, with a population of around 500. The town includes the launch facility for SpaceX's Starship rocket and company-owned land. The new zoning ordinance could significantly impact the residents' current property rights.</p>

          <p>Opinion columnist David Brooks expresses his anger towards the Trump administration, drawing inspiration from Bill Buckley's advice to write about what angers him most. He criticizes Patrick Deneen and JD Vance for suggesting soldiers don't fight for ideals, but rather for their unit or home. Brooks argues these statements reveal the moral rot at the core of Trumpism, which he sees as an attempt to reduce people to primitive tendencies. He believes Trumpism disgraces the country by amputating the highest aspirations of the human spirit.</p>

          <p>West Point's decision to replace "duty, honor, country" with "Army Values" in its mission statement is facing renewed criticism, with Judicial Watch alleging a "cover up" related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. Documents obtained by Judicial Watch reveal that officials were instructed to avoid saying the phrase was "removed" or "replaced". While West Point maintains "duty, honor, country" remains its motto, critics argue the change reflects a DEI agenda. West Point's superintendent emphasized that the change was not politically motivated and that "country" is reflected in the term "loyalty."</p>

          <p>The National Association of the Deaf (NAD) has filed a federal lawsuit against the White House for not providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters during press briefings. The NAD argues that the absence of interpreters violates Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as well as the First and Fifth Amendments. Two deaf men joined the suit, stating that English closed captions are insufficient for understanding the briefings. The NAD says the White House has ignored repeated requests for ASL interpretation, affecting over 48 million deaf or hard of hearing Americans.</p>

Musk's presence in the White House, given his companies' ties to the government, raised conflict of interest concerns. His work also led to the elimination of most USAID programs, reflecting an "America First" approach.

          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness is often used interchangeably with debt settlement, but it's important to understand the nuances. Credit card debt forgiveness can occur through debt settlement, bankruptcy, or a debt management program. Qualifying typically requires a debt balance of $5,000 to $10,000, being behind on payments, and demonstrating financial hardship. Borrowers should carefully review all debt relief options and understand the qualifications to make an informed decision about regaining financial freedom (not investment advice).</p>
