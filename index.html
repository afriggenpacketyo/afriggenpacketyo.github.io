          <p>China's second-ranked military general, He Weidong, has been expelled from the Communist Party and is now under investigation for corruption. This action is particularly significant as He is the first serving member of the current Politburo, the party's top decision-making body, to face such a probe. His removal marks the third dismissal of a Central Military Commission member since 2022, indicating a persistent and high-level anti-corruption campaign within China's leadership.</p>

          <p>The potential transfer of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine has become a key factor in diplomatic maneuvering, reportedly motivating Russia's agreement to a summit between Presidents Trump and Putin. While President Zelenskyy views the long-range weapons as a significant boost to Ukraine's war effort, U.S. officials express caution about depleting scarce American stockpiles. The discussion highlights a strategic shift, using the threat of advanced weaponry as leverage in high-stakes diplomacy to end the conflict.</p>

Analysts suggest Trump's perspective has shifted due to Ukraine's battlefield successes and a growing disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he recently called a "paper tiger." This evolving dynamic, coupled with Ukraine's potential role in drone technology development, may lead to more substantive and cooperative discussions about U.S. support.</p>

          <p>A suicide car bomber affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban attacked a security forces compound in northwestern Pakistan, near the border with Afghanistan. The initial explosion was followed by an intense shootout, which resulted in the deaths of three militants. The attack occurred in Mir Ali, a city in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, and comes amid heightened tensions and a recent surge in militant violence that has strained relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government.</p>

          <p>The Taiwanese government has banned its officials from participating in events hosted by China to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's "retrocession" from Japanese to Chinese rule. Taipei accused Beijing of distorting history to support its territorial claims and undermine the sovereignty of the Republic of China, which is Taiwan's formal name. The move reflects ongoing tensions between the two governments over historical narratives and their competing claims of legitimacy following the Chinese Civil War.</p>

          <p>Authorities have ended the large-scale search for Gus Lamont, a four-year-old boy who went missing from a remote homestead in the South Australian outback nearly three weeks ago. Despite a meticulous operation involving police, the Australian Defence Force, and volunteers covering 95 square kilometers, no new evidence of the boy was found. Police do not suspect foul play but have transitioned the case to a recovery operation, acknowledging the harsh terrain and challenging weather conditions.</p>

          <p>An injection to prevent HIV, administered every two months, has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales, aligning policy with Scotland. The long-acting shot, cabotegravir, offers an alternative to daily PrEP pills and is intended for high-risk individuals for whom oral medication is not practical. Health experts hope this new option will help achieve the UK's goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030 by increasing access and convenience for vulnerable populations.</p>
