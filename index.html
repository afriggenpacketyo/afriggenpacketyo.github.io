          <p>Federal prosecutors have begun their closing arguments in the sex trafficking trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, asserting that he used his power and influence to operate a criminal enterprise. The prosecution, which called 34 witnesses over seven weeks, alleges Combs orchestrated abusive sexual encounters and then used his resources to conceal his actions. Combs has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including racketeering and sex trafficking, and faces a potential sentence of 15 years to life in prison if convicted. The defense will present its closing arguments on Friday, with jury deliberations expected to begin next week.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to announce significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill following a large-scale rebellion from over 100 of its own Labour backbenchers. The deal is expected to protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit from cuts. This move represents a major climbdown for the prime minister, who faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons. While most rebels seem satisfied with the changes, ensuring the bill's passage, the financial implications for the government's budget, which had factored in Â£5 billion in savings, remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors announced the arrest of Jamil Bahlouli, an Iranian man living illegally in the U.S., who was taken into custody in Austin, Texas. Bahlouli was subject to a 2020 removal order and had previously self-deported to Canada in 2021 before illegally re-entering the country. Authorities located him after he failed to report to an ICE office in San Antonio as required following a prior conviction for illegal entry. He is now charged with failure to deport after he allegedly resisted arrest by slamming a door on officers, an action designed to hamper his removal.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of an exoplanet, a planet outside our solar system, since becoming operational. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be similar in mass to Saturn and orbits a young star named TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, a technique crucial for detecting faint objects like planets. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a previously unknown planet, potentially shaping its star's debris disk.</p>

          <p>Californians will face higher prices for their Fourth of July cookouts this year, with the cost for a gathering of ten people averaging $90.06, well above the national average of $70.92. According to an American Farm Bureau Federation survey, staples like ground beef, chicken, and pork chops are all more expensive in the state. The price hikes are attributed to several factors, including Trump administration tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, reduced cattle availability, and disruptions to the agricultural workforce. These increased grocery costs highlight the economic pressures affecting both consumers and farmers in the region.</p>

Key provisions, including restrictions on Medicaid provider taxes, have been flagged for violating Senate rules, complicating efforts to secure the necessary votes.

          <p>Nike reported a significant 12% drop in sales and an 86% fall in profits for its fiscal fourth quarter, though these figures still beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. The sneaker giant attributed the decline to its ongoing turnaround plan, which involves clearing out old inventory and resetting its digital and wholesale channels. Despite the steep quarterly declines, Nike's finance chief confirmed this period represents the largest financial impact of the restructuring, with headwinds expected to moderate. The company remains focused on winning over female shoppers and is preparing for a delayed but anticipated product launch with Kim Kardashian's Skims line. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tragic collision in Gary, Indiana, resulted in the deaths of five people from the same family after their vehicle was struck by a South Shore Line train.

At a Pentagon briefing, Hegseth staunchly supported the assertion that Iran's nuclear facilities were "obliterated," dismissing a leaked preliminary intelligence assessment that suggested a more limited impact. The defense comes after the CIA Director and Director of National Intelligence also released statements confirming the program was "severely damaged." However, questions remain regarding how far the strikes set back Iran's capabilities and whether nuclear material was moved beforehand.</p>
