            <p>The IRS and Department of Homeland Security have established a data-sharing agreement allowing ICE to access taxpayer information of immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status who have final removal orders. This agreement, based on existing legal authorities, aims to streamline immigration enforcement efforts under the Trump administration. While the Treasury Department emphasizes the commitment to protecting taxpayer data of law-abiding individuals, IRS veterans have raised concerns about the unprecedented use of tax data and its potential impact on tax collections. The policy could discourage undocumented immigrants from paying taxes. </p>

The World Food Programme warns these cuts could lead to a "death sentence for millions" facing starvation.

            <p>China has responded to Vice President JD Vance's remarks about the U.S. borrowing money from "Chinese peasants" to buy goods, calling them "ignorant and impolite." This comes as President Trump escalates trade tensions with China, imposing a 104% tariff on Chinese goods. Vance defended the tariffs as a necessary measure to counter a "globalist economy" that has not benefited ordinary Americans. Economists have raised concerns that the tariffs will increase the price of everyday goods and could slow economic growth.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration, allowing the deportation of accused members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act. Federal officials describe the gang as a national threat, but experts believe the gang's presence is overstated. The government relies on clothing and tattoos for identification, but experts argue these symbols are common among Venezuelans and not definitive proof of gang membership. While acknowledging the gang's presence, experts say criminal cases are mainly concentrated in states with large Venezuelan migrant populations.</p>

            <p>President Trump has touted falling oil prices and borrowing costs as positive signs resulting from his tariff policies.

While lower oil prices and borrowing costs may provide some short-term relief to consumers, they are unlikely to offset the potential economic pain caused by a downturn. The experts suggest these indicators should be viewed with caution as potential warning signs.</p>

            <p>Augusta, Georgia, is still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which caused significant damage and loss of life. Augusta National Golf Club, home of The Masters, has played a crucial role in the city's recovery, providing financial support and resources to the community. The club's efforts have fostered renewed goodwill with local residents, contrasting with their reaction to a previous ice storm. The hurricane also significantly altered the course itself, removing many trees and changing the landscape.</p>

            <p>House GOP leaders are preparing to vote on the Senate's budget resolution, despite facing significant opposition within their own party. Deficit hawks and fiscal conservatives argue that the Senate version does not include enough spending cuts. The intra-party dispute threatens Republican plans to use a budget tool to pass key agenda items, including border security spending and tax cut extensions. The outcome of the vote will test the strength of Speaker Johnson's leadership and the conference's loyalty to President Trump.</p>

The price drop adds to steep losses incurred since the announcement of the tariffs, with analysts citing a "toxic cocktail" of recession fears and increased oil production. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent maintains that China is in a losing position in the trade dispute, while the oil market faces significant uncertainty.</p>
