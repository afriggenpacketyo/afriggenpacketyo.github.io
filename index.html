        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked a massive social movement, the article examines the backlash and retrenchment facing racial justice activists. While initial protests saw widespread support, the political climate has shifted, with a focus on white grievance gaining prominence. The Justice Department has scaled back oversight of police forces accused of racial bias, and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives are under attack. Despite these challenges, some lasting impacts remain, such as police body cameras and enhanced data collection on police brutality, and grassroots resistance to the rollback of DEI is emerging. The author's tone is of concern, as he reflects on the regression of racial progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article introduces 'emotionally safe parenting,' a framework emphasizing emotional attunement and building resilience in children. It encourages parents to accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. The framework also stresses the importance of parents doing their own internal work to become less reactive and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves reflecting on personal triggers, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through healthy repair after conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to diplomatic sources, a joint statement by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin omitted wording that could antagonize Japan. China reportedly requested the removal of references to "maintaining the security of Northeast Asia" and investment in a special economic zone on disputed islands claimed by Japan, signaling an effort to stabilize relations with Japan amid tensions with the United States. The released document did urge Japan to learn from its past actions and distance itself from militarism, but the changes suggest a nuanced approach to regional diplomacy.</p>

She worked with the local Western Union office to personally deliver telegrams and provide comfort to widows. Now, service members notify families in person and offer ongoing support, a testament to Moore's lasting impact and the sacred mission of providing solace to grieving families.</p>

          <p>A biologically male transgender athlete has qualified for the California girls' track and field state championship in the long jump and triple jump, sparking controversy. The athlete's success has led to backlash from parents and scrutiny from the U.S. Department of Education, which is investigating the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) for allegedly violating federal civil rights law. One athlete who finished third in the long jump medal ceremony did not show up and accept the third place medal next to the trans athlete. The Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD) maintains it is following state law and CIF policy, which allows students to participate in athletics consistent with their gender identity.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's beloved pav bread, a staple for the working class, faces potential extinction due to a government ban on wood-fired bakeries aimed at curbing pollution. While these bakeries contribute a small percentage to the city's overall pollution, they are being targeted for easier solutions. Bakers argue that switching to cleaner fuels would significantly increase the cost of pav, impacting its affordability for the working class. The wood-fired baking method also contributes to the unique flavor and cultural heritage of Mumbai's cosmopolitan cuisine.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes Donald Trump's efforts to dismantle American democratic institutions by reverse-engineering them. The author argues that Trump is repurposing liberal institutions designed to restrain leaders like him, such as the judicial and legislative apparatus, federal bureaucracy, and law enforcement, to serve his own interests. This approach involves turning these institutions against themselves, creating an "autoimmune disorder" within American democracy. The author contends that Trump's actions are not random but are part of a deliberate strategy to undermine the social contract and establish a new social order.</p>
