          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law that prohibits citizens from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying property in Texas, excluding US green card holders and citizens. The law, which takes effect September 1, allows visa holders from those countries to purchase property only for use as a primary residence, not for investment purposes. Critics are planning a lawsuit challenging the bill's constitutionality, setting up a potential legal battle. Abbott has publicly expressed his support for the bill on social media. The implications of this law could have far-reaching effects on international relations and economic investment in Texas.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is "at war with Iran's nuclear program," not with Iran itself, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. He asserted that the strikes have significantly set back Iran's nuclear program, potentially by years, and while he could not definitively confirm the complete destruction of all Iranian nuclear facilities, he expressed confidence that Iran is further from developing nuclear weapons. Vance also mentioned that the administration would address the issue of Iran's highly enriched uranium and engage in conversations with the Iranians. He warned that any retaliation from Iran would be met with "overwhelming force," while clarifying that the Trump administration is not seeking regime change in Iran.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump reportedly authorized U.S. military strikes on key Iranian nuclear facilities after attempts to negotiate a diplomatic resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict failed. According to reports, Trump worked with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan to arrange high-level talks between U.S. and Iranian officials, even offering to meet with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian himself. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was unreachable and did not approve the meeting, leading to the U.S. military action. Trump stated that the U.S. knows where Khamenei is hiding, but is choosing not to eliminate him for now, but he also warned against further missile attacks on civilians or American soldiers.</p>

A poll shows most Japanese are worried about the Mideast war's impact on daily lives, and two Japanese men have been released by Belarus, and Chinese ships were spotted near the Senkaku Islands for a record 216th straight day. A minor earthquake occurred near the Tokara Islands, and Mt. Shinmoe in southwestern Japan erupted.</p>

Cotton also noted that a full damage assessment of the strikes is underway, but that Iran's critical nuclear infrastructure has been severely damaged. While not ruling out any potential targets, Cotton advised Iran's Supreme Leader to heed Trump's warning and avoid targeting Americans, while clarifying that regime change in Iran is not the military objective of the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran, with Israel stating they were in "full co-ordination" with the U.S. in planning the strikes. General Dan Caine said Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 U.S. military aircraft, including seven B-2 stealth bombers, targeting Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The U.S. used GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) on the Fordo nuclear site, which is located deep underground. Initial assessments indicate severe damage to all three sites, with satellite imagery showing fresh craters at Fordo, while Iran has downplayed the damage, claiming evacuation of materials prior to the attack, and Iran launched missiles which hit parts of Tel Aviv and Haifa.</p>

While acknowledging a small chance of a best-case scenario, he emphasized that the history of U.S. military involvements in the region suggests a more likely worst-case outcome. Himes outlined a potential worst-case scenario involving dead soldiers and sailors, the relocation of nuclear material, and the construction of a nuclear device.</p>

          <p>Americaâ€™s attacks on Iran have amplified an ongoing debate in Tehran regarding the country's future and the role of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Prior to the strikes, a group of Iranian figures began developing a plan to govern Iran without Khamenei, potentially through a leadership committee to negotiate with the U.S.. The extent of the damage from the U.S. strikes is contested, with some insiders seeking a deal with Trump, while others advocate for retaliation. Iran had prepared for potential American intervention, but its options are limited, as regional allies are unlikely to join the conflict, and some suggest openly pursuing nuclear weaponization.</p>

Maersk announced a temporary suspension of port calls to Israel's largest container port, Haifa, and freight rates from Shanghai to Jebel Ali have surged.

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites, Iran is considering its response, balancing the need to retaliate against the U.S. with the potential for further escalation. Possible strategies include retaliating swiftly against U.S. interests in the Middle East, delaying retaliation for a surprise attack later, or avoiding retaliation altogether to prevent further U.S. attacks. Retaliation could involve targeting U.S. bases, launching swarm attacks on U.S. Navy warships, disrupting commercial shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, or engaging in cyber warfare. The decision will be influenced by the need to maintain the Islamic Republic regime's survival and the risk of further conflict.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has warned of a "risk of escalation" to the Middle East and beyond, following the US bombing of Iranian nuclear sites, and called for a return to negotiations. He stated that the UK is doing everything possible to stabilize the situation and find a diplomatic solution, while emphasizing that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. The UK government has taken measures to protect its interests and personnel in the region, although there was no UK involvement in the US action. The prime minister had previously met with President Trump to push for de-escalation, and a UK defense source said British military personnel in the Middle East are on their highest level of alert.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday following the United States' entry into the war between Israel and Iran and strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down 0.3%. Egypt's benchmark EGX30 was a major gainer, closing 2.7% higher, while Bahrain issued a "work from home mandate" to maintain public safety. Analysts suggest the Gulf has distanced itself from the conflict and is supporting a peaceful resolution, which has helped to isolate it from any significant short-term market impact, with a net mid-term positive outlook.</p>

          <p>A bulletin from the National Terrorism Advisory System warns of a "heightened threat environment in the United States" following U.S. military strikes on Iran's nuclear sites. The bulletin notes the potential for low-level cyber attacks against U.S. networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists and cautions that the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could motivate violent extremists. U.S. law enforcement has disrupted multiple potentially lethal Iranian-backed plots in the United States since 2020, and the likelihood of violent extremists mobilizing in response to the conflict would likely increase if Iranian leadership called for retaliatory violence. Law enforcement officials in New York City are deploying additional resources to religious, cultural, and diplomatic sites as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, wounding at least 21 people, after the U.S. joined Israel's attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Iranian missiles impacted multiple sites across Israel, including Haifa and Tel Aviv, with searches underway for people trapped under collapsed buildings. The Israel Defense Forces reported that Iran launched about 30 missiles at Israel, while Israel struck dozens of missile and drone sites in Iran. The Iranian assault occurred hours after President Trump announced U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear sites. Since the beginning of Israel's "Operation Rising Lion" against Iran, Iran has fired hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel.</p>

He accused the Trump administration of having "betrayed diplomacy" and said the U.S. bears full responsibility for the consequences of its actions. Iran's ambassador to the United Nations condemned the strikes as "unprovoked and premeditated acts of aggression" and requested an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The decision by President Trump to order the bombing of nuclear sites in Iran without congressional approval has been criticized as a violation of the Constitution and a weakening of American democracy. The lack of a congressional vote deprives citizens of the opportunity to lobby their representatives and hold them accountable for the outcome. Past instances, such as the authorization for the Iraq War, demonstrate the importance of congressional debate in educating lawmakers and the public. The absence of a vote leaves citizens with no recourse to express their dissent through official democratic channels, potentially leading to radicalization.</p>

          <p>Parenting expert Reem Raouda shares five phrases that can hinder cooperation in children and offers alternative phrases to promote better communication and behavior. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while respectful language fosters autonomy and cooperation. The recommended phrases focus on explaining decisions, providing agency, validating emotions, problem-solving, and encouraging self-reflection. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>
