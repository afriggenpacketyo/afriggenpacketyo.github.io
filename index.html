          <p>Sly Stone, the innovative force behind Sly and the Family Stone, has died at the age of 82, leaving behind a legacy that redefined pop, funk, and rock music in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Stone's pioneering work blended soul, psychedelic rock, and gospel, creating a fervent and uplifting sound that became a cornerstone of 1970s funk. The band's music was known for its multifaceted approach and socially conscious songwriting, which resonated across generations and cemented Stone's place as a key progenitor of the funk sound, influencing countless artists to come.

Israeli authorities have dismissed the vessel as a "selfie yacht" and stated that the passengers are at Ben Gurion Airport, ready to return to their respective countries. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which operated the vessel, confirmed that its campaigners were being processed and transferred into Israeli custody, anticipating their departure from Tel Aviv soon.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to anti-ICE protests has been criticized as an authoritarian overreach. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as intentionally inflammatory, accusing Trump of terrorizing communities and endangering democracy. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands suggests that these actions are part of a broader effort to test the limits of public tolerance and normalize the use of military force against citizens. The ACLU has likened the deployment to a declaration of war on Californians, raising concerns about the erosion of constitutional checks and balances.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in Canada in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, is expected to visit Washington for further negotiations on Trump's tariffs. Japan seeks the removal of U.S. tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, including a 10 percent baseline levy and a 14 percent country-specific portion, though they are considering accepting reduced tariff rates. Both countries aim to reach a deal promptly, with Ishiba emphasizing the need to boost investment and job creation in the United States, while Trump seeks to reduce the trade deficit with Japan.

          <p>A voluntary recall of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded to Class II by the FDA due to a serious health risk, as cans labeled "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in regular Dr Pepper. The mislabeled cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, have the product code XXXXRS05165 and a "best by" date of February 16, 2026, and were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Customers who purchased the affected cans are urged to return them for a full refund or discard them, as the mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as excessive sugar intake can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal ketoacidosis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting loopholes in European law to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for salt during transit, as highlighted by a case at Brussels Airport where a consignment of medical ketamine was replaced with salt. This exploitation takes advantage of ketamine's classification as a legal medicine in some countries, such as Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands, to transport it across multiple borders with less scrutiny. Belgian investigators have uncovered at least 28 similar consignment switches involving an estimated 28 tonnes of ketamine since 2023, with criminal gangs now earning more from ketamine than from other illegal drugs like cocaine, leading to an epidemic of misuse. The challenge for law enforcement is compounded by ketamine's legitimate use as an anaesthetic, making it difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal shipments.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to reduce elevated rice prices. The release will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from about 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks earlier this year. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi aims to quickly deliver the stockpiled rice to consumers at lower prices, targeting smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops, in addition to major retailers, with applications being accepted starting Wednesday.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about potential UK "complicity" in Israel's conduct in Gaza were told that if they profoundly disagreed with government policy, they could consider resigning. The staff letter, sent to Foreign Secretary David Lammy last month, questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they called a "stark… disregard for international law" by Israel. Senior civil servants in the Foreign Office responded by stating that while healthy challenge was welcome, the "ultimate recourse" for those with profound disagreements was resignation. This response has been met with frustration, with some officials feeling that the space for challenge is being further shut down.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a warning about an unprecedented decline in world fertility rates, attributing it to the prohibitive costs of parenthood and a lack of suitable partners. UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, revealing that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The survey highlighted financial limitations as a significant barrier, with 39% of respondents citing it as a reason for not having children, while only 12% attributed it to infertility. Demographers note that this marks a shift in the UN's focus, as the agency has historically emphasized issues related to women having more children than desired.</p>

Sizewell C is projected to create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the "landmark decision" as a catalyst for economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband emphasized the investment's necessity to usher in a "golden age of clean energy." However, critics like Alison Downes, director of Stop Sizewell C, argue that ministers have not been transparent about the project's total cost, citing incomplete negotiations with private investors.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with fatal overdoses plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024, according to provisional CDC data. This trend is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens and young adults. A study found that the number of teens abstaining from substance use grew to its highest level in 2024, with experts suggesting that the devastation caused by fentanyl has led to a preference for safer drugs like cannabis and psychedelics. Despite this progress, sustaining the recovery may be challenging, particularly for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential cuts to federal funding for addiction services could jeopardize these gains.</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to numerous arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops. President Trump's decision to send troops has sparked outrage from Democrats, with California Governor Gavin Newsom suing the administration for acting without the state's permission. The protests began after ICE officers conducted raids in Latino areas, resulting in vehicles being set on fire, a major freeway being shut down, and reports of looting. The National Guard's role is to protect federal agents and property, but the deployment has raised concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A man in Texas, Justin Anthony Banta, has been charged with capital murder after allegedly slipping an abortion drug into his pregnant girlfriend's drink, leading to the loss of her baby.

She also stated that he had offered to cover the cost of an abortion after she disclosed her pregnancy, but she expressed her desire to keep the baby. Banta has also been charged with tampering with physical evidence, as police discovered that crucial evidence relating to the case had been deleted from his mobile phone.</p>
