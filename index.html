          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:21:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' significantly alters the federal student loan system by consolidating seven repayment plans into two distinct options. Starting July 1, 2026, new borrowers will select either a standard fixed-payment plan or a new income-driven repayment plan. The legislation also modifies Pell Grant eligibility, restricting it for students with full scholarships while expanding it for those in workforce training programs. Furthermore, the law introduces new borrowing limits for Parent and Grad PLUS loans and will eliminate economic hardship deferments beginning in 2026, aiming to simplify the system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought has intensified criticism against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, vowing to investigate alleged cost overruns in the renovation of the Fed's headquarters. Vought accused Powell of mismanagement and misleading Congress about the project's $2.5 billion expense, labeling the building a 'palace'. This move is seen as part of President Trump's broader campaign against Powell, whom he has frequently criticized for not lowering interest rates. The accusations could potentially be used to build a case for dismissing Powell for cause, a move that would challenge the central bank's traditional independence.</p>

          <p>Russia has significantly increased its drone and missile attacks on Ukraine throughout the week, escalating the conflict's intensity. This surge in aerial assaults coincides with President Trump's expressed frustration over Russian President Vladimir Putin's apparent reluctance to engage in peace negotiations. In a related development, Trump has signaled that the United States would resume previously suspended weapons shipments to Ukraine. The renewed attacks and shifting diplomatic pressures create a volatile and uncertain situation for the ongoing war.</p>

This chart dominance comes as the band begins a series of sold-out homecoming shows in Manchester, part of a world tour that started after brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher reconciled.

The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling routine tasks like code updates, with plans to deploy hundreds or even thousands of these AI agents. This move signals a shift towards 'agentic AI,' where programs can execute complex, multi-step jobs with minimal human supervision. The initiative is expected to substantially boost worker productivity but also raises questions about the future of tech jobs in the financial sector.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a severe backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting it to ask some laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to a new review process implemented by the Trump administration's DOGE initiative, which required extra permissions and created significant bureaucratic hurdles. The stalled funds affect numerous critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and resources for HIV care providers. The department is now rushing to process applications, potentially shortening review periods and raising concerns about the thoroughness of the grant-awarding process.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers with $10,000 are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). While short-term CDs presently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, long-term CDs ultimately generate significantly more interest due to the extended compounding period. For example, a 5-year CD at 4.20% could earn nearly $2,300, whereas a 1-year CD at a higher rate of 4.40% would only yield $440. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and their willingness to lock up funds for a longer duration to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

First spotted in July by the ATLAS survey telescope in Chile, this is only the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system.

          <p>President Trump's 'big beautiful bill' introduces a potential tax surprise for high-income earners due to a phaseout of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The law temporarily raises the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 but this benefit is reduced for those with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) between $500,000 and $600,000. This phaseout creates a 'SALT torpedo,' where individuals in this income bracket could face an effective federal tax rate as high as 45.5% on that portion of their earnings. Tax professionals advise that taxpayers near this income threshold should seek advice to potentially manage their MAGI and avoid the steep penalty. (not investment advice)</p>

Under UEFA regulations, two clubs with the same influential owner cannot compete in the same tournament.

The author suggests that expanding access to and insurance coverage for male-specific infertility treatments could be a politically viable way to address declining birth rates.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating the ongoing trade dispute. In a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and the flow of fentanyl as reasons for the new levy, warning that the rate could increase if Canada retaliates further. This move adds to existing tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, and autos, and throws the ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries into further jeopardy. The policy is expected to have a significant impact on the deeply integrated economies of both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is traveling to Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that killed at least 121 people, including many children at a summer camp. The Guadalupe River in Kerr County rose 26 feet in under an hour, causing immense devastation, with over 170 people still missing. Trump's visit occurs as local officials face scrutiny over their warning and response efforts. In a notable departure from his reactions to other disasters, the president has refrained from criticizing the Republican state leadership, instead emphasizing his close relationship with Governor Greg Abbott and promising federal support.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques race-based affirmative action by examining the case of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who identified as 'Black/African American' on a past college application. The author argues that Mamdani, who is of Indian descent but was born in Uganda, exemplifies how the system's rigid racial categories can be manipulated and are fundamentally arbitrary. The article contends that affirmative action should focus on socioeconomic disadvantage rather than race, which would prevent a-gaming of the system and better serve its original purpose of redressing specific, historical discrimination rather than promoting nebulous concepts of diversity.</p>

Ramsey stated that the idea that most people pay off their balance each month is a 'great lie,' citing data that 78% of users carry a balance. He contends that even for disciplined users, swiping plastic leads to spending 12-18% more than using cash because it doesn't trigger the same psychological 'pain' of payment.
