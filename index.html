          <p>Scottie Scheffler took the lead at the US PGA Championship after a round of 65, putting him at 11 under par. Scheffler finished his last five holes at five under, giving him a three-shot advantage heading into Sunday's final round at Quail Hollow. Alex Noren of Sweden is in second place at eight under, and Jon Rahm and Bryson DeChambeau are tied for third. This puts Scheffler in a strong position to potentially secure his third major win, after converting 54-hole leads into victories at the Masters in both 2022 and 2024.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine but restricted its use to older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This decision limits access for healthy individuals under 65 and mandates further studies on potential heart conditions linked to the vaccine, potentially costing Novavax millions. Experts like Dr. Camille Kotton have expressed disappointment, noting the ongoing hospitalizations and deaths from Covid, and Dr. Paul Offit believes Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goal is to make vaccines less available and more feared. The new restrictions mark a departure from previous Covid vaccine approvals, raising questions about the F.D.A.'s framework for evaluating Covid shots.</p>

The race was notable for the absence of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty, who was held back to prepare for the Belmont Stakes.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to assess Russia's commitment to ceasefire talks in Ukraine. The call followed the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in three years, which resulted in a prisoner swap agreement but no ceasefire. Rubio expressed concerns about Russia potentially using the talks to "buy time," while emphasizing the importance of ending the conflict. President Trump plans to speak with both Putin and Zelenskyy, with Rubio suggesting a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin as the only way to move the talks forward.</p>

Walmart stated it would work to keep prices low while navigating the reality of small retail margins.

The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing a more complex anatomy than previously understood for radiodonts.
