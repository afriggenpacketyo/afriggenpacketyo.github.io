          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing across the UK after Storm Floris caused significant travel disruption and power outages. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is working to restore power to approximately 50,000 homes, describing the event as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Network Rail reported 119 incidents on train lines in Scotland, with teams working to clear debris and fallen trees. While some disruption is expected to continue, emergency meetings have been held and support, including free hot food, is being provided to affected communities.</p>

          <p>Tennessee is set to execute Byron Black, who has a working implantable defibrillator, a situation believed to be a first in the U.S. Legal challenges from his attorneys, who argued the device could cause unnecessary pain and prolong the execution, were ultimately rejected by the courts. Black was convicted for the 1988 murders of his girlfriend and her two young daughters. The case highlights complex ethical questions at the intersection of capital punishment and medical technology, as most medical professionals consider participation in executions a violation of their ethics.</p>

          <p>As the new Fantasy Premier League season approaches, several FPL experts have shared their top strategies for managers aiming for a high rank. Key advice includes planning transfers in blocks of fixtures, balancing premium players across positions, and quickly rectifying mistakes. Experts also recommend saving free transfers to allow for significant team changes without point deductions and watching full matches to gain context beyond statistics. The guidance emphasizes a long-term, strategic approach over reactive, week-to-week decisions to navigate the increasingly competitive fantasy game.</p>

          <p>Students in parts of Scotland are facing delays in receiving their physical exam certificates due to widespread disruption caused by Storm Floris. While email and text results for Nationals, Highers, and other qualifications are unaffected, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) confirmed that Royal Mail deliveries are delayed in the Outer Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland. The storm brought gusts of up to 80mph, impacting travel and logistics across the country. Officials have advised affected students to contact their schools or colleges for their results and utilize a dedicated helpline for guidance.</p>

          <p>As England looks ahead to the Ashes series in Australia, their chances of success are seen as heavily dependent on the fitness and performance of captain Ben Stokes. The team has a poor recent record in Australia, having not won a Test there in 14 years, and Stokes is central to reversing this trend with his all-around contributions and leadership. The article highlights that much of the current squad lacks experience playing in Australia, making Stokes's presence even more critical. A potential victory down under is framed as what would be his greatest achievement, given the historical challenges and his own recent injury struggles.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest amid an ongoing trial for allegedly plotting a coup to stay in power after his 2022 election defeat. Justice Alexandre de Moraes issued the order, stating Bolsonaro had violated previous precautionary measures by communicating with supporters through his sons' social media during a protest.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 3-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals after a late-game collapse by their bullpen nullified an excellent start from pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Glasnow pitched seven strong innings, allowing only one run, while Cardinals' starter Sonny Gray was equally dominant, also giving up just one run over seven innings. The game was decided in the final frames after both starters departed, with the Dodgers' relievers conceding two runs, including the go-ahead run in the ninth inning. Despite a solo home run from Freddie Freeman, the Dodgers' offense couldn't capitalize, sealing the narrow defeat.</p>

In Croatia, it is celebrated as a heroic military victory that reclaimed occupied territory and is marked with a national holiday and military parades. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass expulsion of approximately 200,000 ethnic Serbs and numerous unprosecuted war crimes.

          <p>An opinion piece in The Guardian argues that Poland is experiencing a resurgence of right-wing populism less than two years after the Law and Justice party was voted out of office. The authors contend that the new liberal democratic government, led by Donald Tusk, has failed to present a compelling future vision, instead getting bogged down in reversing its predecessors' policies and adopting some of their nationalist rhetoric. This has led to public frustration and a slump in Tusk's popularity, serving as a cautionary tale for other democracies. The article warns that without an inspiring, forward-thinking agenda, such liberal victories may only be brief interludes in a longer populist trend.</p>

This design suggests Beijing remains committed to this type of surveillance and command aircraft, even as other militaries like the U.S. have shifted strategies.

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan in a landmark defense deal valued at 10 billion Australian dollars ($6.5 billion). The agreement, which marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II, will see Mitsubishi Heavy Industries supply the stealthy, next-generation vessels. This purchase is a key part of Australia's military restructuring aimed at enhancing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's expansion in the Indo-Pacific. The deal signifies a tightening strategic partnership between Australia and Japan, with the first three frigates to be built in Japan and the remainder in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The lawsuit claimed that UPS sent corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials from 140 of its locations to local landfills not equipped to handle such waste. According to the Riverside County District Attorney's office, UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>Wildlife experts are advising California residents that tarantula sightings will become more common as the spiders' mating season begins, lasting from August through December. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, often traveling long distances and becoming more visible, especially at dusk. While their appearance can be startling, officials note that native tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Common sighting locations include Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and various state parks in the Southern California region.</p>

          <p>A nationwide shortage of volunteer firefighters is straining emergency services and could force more communities to switch to paid departments, a move that would significantly increase taxpayer costs. Volunteers constitute nearly 70% of the U.S. firefighting force, saving an estimated $46.9 billion annually. However, their numbers have declined by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as the shortage threatens the safety and financial stability of many small towns across the country.</p>

The discovery, part of the Ingleborough Cave Archaeology Project, sheds new light on the area's prehistoric life during the Bronze Age. The team, working with local cavers, also found evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. This project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, highlights the crucial role of experienced cavers in uncovering archaeological finds in inaccessible underground locations.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) analyzes Taiwan's vulnerability to a potential military blockade by China's People's Liberation Army. Based on 26 wargaming scenarios, the study concluded that Taiwan's natural gas reserves would be depleted in just 11 days, with coal lasting seven weeks and oil for 20 weeks. However, the report also suggests that a blockade would not be a low-cost or low-risk option for Beijing. The scenarios indicated a high probability of the conflict escalating, potentially drawing in the United States and leading to strikes on mainland China, Guam, and Japan.</p>

Critics argue that the tracing process is too difficult, particularly for those who were gifted bonds as children or only have old paper records. While NS&I states it has paid over 99% of prize winners since 1957, some are calling for reforms to make it easier to claim winnings with basic personal information.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is warning hunters and the public after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. Laboratory tests confirmed the discoloration was caused by exposure to diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide. The pigs likely consumed the bait directly or ate other animals that had ingested it. CDFW is urging pesticide applicators to use methods that prevent non-target wildlife from accessing bait and is advising hunters to avoid consuming any game animal that shows signs of such contamination.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that increased screening for colorectal cancer among people aged 45-49 is leading to more early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates in this demographic rose 62% from 2019 to 2023. This correlated with a sharp rise in the detection of localized, earlier-stage cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers called the findings promising, they noted that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and that significant disparities exist based on education and insurance status.</p>
