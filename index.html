            <p>Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., was recorded in a heated argument with a voter at a supermarket. The exchange, filled with expletives and insults from both sides, was sparked by a question about Mace's next town hall. Mace later posted the video on X, stating she wouldn't back down. The confrontation escalated when Mace mentioned her votes for gay marriage, leading to further insults and Mace calling the voter "crazy." Mace's office has not yet commented on the incident.

Trump views this as a way to attract wealthy immigrants and boost the economy. While the concept of selling citizenship is controversial, many countries offer similar programs.

            <p>An Israeli military investigation into the killing of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza last month concluded that there were "professional failures," leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander. The investigation found that the deputy battalion commander misidentified the ambulances as belonging to Hamas militants due to poor visibility, despite the vehicles having flashing lights and visible logos. The incident resulted in the deaths of eight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defense workers, and a U.N. staffer, with their bodies later bulldozed into a mass grave. Israel has accused Hamas of hiding fighters in ambulances, which Hamas denies.</p>

            <p>Tom Homan, Trump's White House border czar, defended the administration's decision to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, alleging he is an MS-13 member and a threat to public safety. Homan claims the administration does not have the authority to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return. Homan also criticized Sen. Chris Van Hollen for meeting with Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his MS-13 affiliation.</p>

            <p>British fighter jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying close to NATO airspace in separate incidents this week. The RAF Typhoons were scrambled to intercept a Russian intelligence aircraft over the Baltic Sea and another aircraft leaving the Kaliningrad airspace. The intercepts were part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, working alongside Sweden. This mission underscores the UK's commitment to NATO and its ability to defend the alliance's airspace amid growing Russian aggression.</p>

            <p>The article questions the reliability of commonly cited recession indicators, such as spending at hair stylists or men's underwear sales. It argues that there's little empirical evidence to support these metrics, and even traditional indicators like consumer sentiment or GDP can be contradictory or fail to identify underlying problems. The author suggests focusing on actual data from retailers, banks, and payroll companies to assess the economy's health, as these sources provide real-time insights into consumer behavior, capital flow, and labor market conditions.
