          <p>Ryan Routh, charged with attempting to assassinate Donald Trump, is representing himself in federal court and plans to call only three witnesses. Prosecutors, who spent seven days questioning 38 witnesses, allege Routh plotted for weeks before aiming a rifle at Trump's Florida golf course. Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges including attempted assassination and assaulting a federal officer. The trial, presided over by Judge Aileen Cannon, is moving faster than anticipated, with closing arguments expected soon.</p>

          <p>Following the UK's recognition of a Palestinian state, alongside Canada, Australia, and Portugal, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has warned Israel against annexing parts of the West Bank. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the move aims to revive hope for a two-state solution and stated Hamas would have no role in a future Palestinian state. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the recognition, calling it a reward for terrorism, while the Palestinian Authority welcomed the decision as a step towards peace.

          <p>Selfless patrons at a New Hampshire country club prevented a greater tragedy by intervening during a shooting at a wedding event. Hunter Nadeau, a 23-year-old former employee, allegedly opened fire, killing 59-year-old Robert DeCesare Jr. and wounding two others. Witnesses reported Nadeau saying "Free Palestine" during the incident, though investigators are still determining a motive. The quick actions of individuals, including one who struck the shooter with a chair, were credited with saving lives.</p>

Adam Smith, the delegation emphasized the importance of communication between the two nations' militaries, alongside discussions on trade and geopolitical tensions. This rare visit since 2019 aims to strengthen relations despite ongoing issues like Taiwan, Beijing's support for Russia, and South China Sea claims.

          <p>A new study from Florida Atlantic University indicates that lifestyle changes effective in reducing heart disease risk can also significantly slow cognitive decline and dementia. Researchers found that habits such as regular physical activity, healthy diets (Mediterranean and Dash-style), cognitive stimulation, and social engagement led to meaningful improvements in global cognition over two years. The article highlights that losing cognitive function is not an inevitable part of aging, offering powerful, evidence-based tools beyond medication for brain health. These findings have potentially enormous implications for public health and government policy.</p>

          <p>Australian telecommunications giant Optus is facing "significant consequences" after a systems outage last week prevented hundreds from calling emergency services for 13 hours, reportedly linked to multiple deaths. The company's chief executive apologized for the "unacceptable" failure, which occurred during a network upgrade. The Australian Media and Communications Authority (Acma) is investigating Optus for its delayed public notification and failure to inform regulators promptly. This incident marks the second such outage for Optus in two years, intensifying scrutiny and calls for accountability from government officials.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk, who had a public falling out months prior, met and shook hands at the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The two sat together in the stands, with video shared by Musk on his platform X. Musk, a former advisor and significant donor to Trump's campaign, had criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to an extraordinary feud. Their reconciliation at the event, where Musk posted a picture captioned "For Charlie," suggests a potential mending of their relationship.</p>

          <p>Dominican Republic authorities have recovered 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat destroyed by the US Navy in a joint anti-drug trafficking operation. The vessel, allegedly carrying 1,000 kilograms of drugs, was targeted south of Isla Beata, marking the first such joint operation against "narcoterrorism" in the Caribbean. This action is part of a larger US naval deployment in the southern Caribbean, which the Trump administration says aims to fight drug trafficking. However, human rights groups have raised concerns, calling previous similar strikes extrajudicial killings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that media moguls Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell, could be involved in a deal to bring TikTok's US operations under American control. Oracle founder Larry Ellison is already confirmed as a participant, with the goal of ensuring US data security and control over the app's algorithm. This comes after Trump's "very productive call" with China's Xi Jinping regarding the deal, which aims to prevent a ban on TikTok in the US. Trump, who previously became a "fan" of TikTok, emphasizes the patriotic involvement of these prominent individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are concerned about the return of a "warm blob" in the North Pacific, an expansive area of unusually high sea surface temperatures that reached a record 68 degrees Fahrenheit in August. This anomaly, linked to human-driven climate change, has significant implications for marine life and could influence winter weather patterns by inducing a ridge of high pressure. Previous occurrences of the blob have devastated fishing industries and marine food webs, causing widespread wildlife mortality. The article highlights the increasing intensity and frequency of marine heat waves, underscoring the urgent need to reduce planet-overheating pollution.</p>
