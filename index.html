          <p>The Trump administration has officially lifted economic sanctions on Syria through an executive order, a move intended to support the nation's path toward peace and stability under its new government. The action follows a promise made in May and aims to give Syria's interim government, led by former insurgent Ahmad al-Sharaa, an opportunity to rebuild. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, it retains targeted restrictions against former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Officials emphasized the goal is not nation-building but to encourage normalization with neighbors, including potential inclusion in the Abraham Accords.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has delayed the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was erroneously deported and then returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges. The delay was requested by his own lawyers due to conflicting statements from the Trump administration about whether he would be immediately detained and deported again upon his release from Justice Department custody. This case highlights ongoing complexities in U.S. immigration policy, as Abrego Garcia holds a legal status meant to protect him from removal to El Salvador due to threats from local gangs. He will remain in federal custody until a mid-July hearing.</p>

          <p>Meta's stock price surged to a new all-time high, reflecting strong investor confidence in the company's focus on artificial intelligence. The rally is fueled by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive hiring campaign to build a new AI superintelligence group, which has included poaching top talent from rivals like OpenAI and acquiring key executives from other AI firms. This strategic push involves significant investments, such as a $14.3 billion deal involving Scale AI, as Meta competes with other tech giants in the race for AI dominance. The company's focus on superintelligence, a technology that surpasses human capability, is driving its market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dating app Tinder is testing a mandatory facial recognition feature for new users in California to combat fraud and enhance user safety. The "Face Check" system, powered by FaceTec technology, requires users to submit a short video selfie to verify they are a real person and that their appearance matches their profile photos. This initiative aims to reduce the prevalence of bots, spoofed accounts, and romance scams, which have become a significant issue on dating platforms. While photo verification was previously optional, this pilot makes it a requirement for account creation in the state, with no current plans for a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>Shortly after beginning deliberations in the sex trafficking trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, the jury sent a note to the judge expressing concerns about one juror's ability to follow legal instructions. The judge, after consulting with both legal teams, chose to remind the entire jury of their obligations rather than single out the individual. The jury is currently weighing federal charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking, which could result in a life sentence for the music mogul if convicted. This development occurred after seven weeks of testimony that included graphic details and video evidence of alleged abuse.</p>

However, the author contends it is poor policy that could undermine financial transparency and national security by pushing billions of dollars into unregulated channels like cryptocurrency. The piece suggests the tax would also harm diplomatic relations and destabilize communities in countries like Mexico that rely heavily on these funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's reconciliation bill contains provisions that could lead to substantial cuts in Medicaid, potentially causing millions of Americans to lose health coverage. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the Senate version of the bill would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion and leave an additional 11.8 million people uninsured by 2034. A key provision imposes 80-hour monthly work requirements on many recipients, which experts warn could disproportionately affect older adults who face health issues or age discrimination in the workforce. Health policy analysts also caution that the cuts could force the closure of rural hospitals. (not investment advice)</p>

These options include negotiating a settlement for a lower lump-sum payment, using a debt management plan through a credit counseling agency to reduce interest rates, or consolidating debts with a lower-rate loan. For those facing severe financial hardship, inquiring about assistance programs or, as a last resort, considering bankruptcy are also presented as potential pathways. (not investment advice)</p>

The new service's website states it will operate over all three major U.S. carrier networks, including AT&T, raising questions about the timing of the president's public complaints.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is moving toward a final vote on President Trump's large-scale tax and immigration bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," as Republicans aim to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The process has been marked by intense partisan debate, including a marathon "vote-a-rama" session where Democrats introduced numerous amendments to highlight their opposition to cuts in programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Despite some Republican defections on procedural votes and vocal opposition from Senator Thom Tillis over Medicaid changes, the GOP leadership remains confident it can secure passage. The bill would then return to the House.</p>

Azerbaijan's Ministry of Internal Affairs claimed Sputnik was operating through "illegal financing" after its accreditation was revoked earlier in the year. Russian authorities condemned the raid as an "unfriendly act" and an "illegal arrest of Russian journalists," further straining the already simmering diplomatic relations between Moscow and Baku.</p>

          <p>The White House has declared that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney "caved" to pressure from President Trump after Canada announced it would scrap its digital services tax (DST). The proposed 3% tax would have affected large U.S. technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Meta. After Trump threatened to raise tariffs and halted trade deal negotiations in response, Canada reversed its position, with officials stating a preference for a multilateral agreement on digital taxation. The White House framed the reversal as a "big victory" for American companies and a result of President Trump's tough negotiating tactics.</p>

          <p>Recent polling from multiple sources indicates that a majority of Americans oppose President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," the large-scale tax and policy package currently moving through Congress. A Quinnipiac poll found 55% of voters oppose the bill, while a Fox News poll showed 59% opposition. However, public opinion is more divided on some of the bill's specific provisions. For example, polls show that Americans are nearly evenly split on proposed work requirements for Medicaid recipients. There is also significant support for extending certain tax cuts, particularly for lower and middle-income individuals.</p>

          <p>An 82-year-old woman, Karen Diamond, has died from injuries she sustained during an attack on a pro-Israel gathering in Boulder, Colorado, on June 1. Following her death, prosecutors announced they will upgrade the charges against the suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, to include first-degree murder. Soliman is accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at the group in what federal officials have labeled a "terrorist attack," allegedly telling police he wanted to "kill all Zionist people." The incident occurred at a "Run for Their Lives" event meant to raise awareness for Israeli hostages, and Diamond was one of several people injured.</p>

          <p>A chaotic scene unfolded in a Sherman Oaks neighborhood when a tow truck driver, attempting to steal a pickup truck, fled and caused a destructive crash captured on camera. The incident began when the driver was confronted while trying to load the pickup onto his flatbed. He then sped away with the truck hanging precariously off the back, lost control, and launched the vehicle into another parked truck. The chain reaction ended with a utility pole being knocked down, cutting power to the area. The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the incident as an attempted auto theft and a hit-and-run.</p>
