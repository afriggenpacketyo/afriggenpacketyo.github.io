          <p>North Korea has confirmed that it sent troops to Russia to aid in the war against Ukraine, marking its first acknowledged military involvement in the conflict. Kim Jong-un ordered the troop deployment last year under a defense cooperation pact with Russia, stating their mission was to help regain the Kursk region. The North Korean troops reportedly displayed heroism in defeating Ukrainian forces, and a monument will be built in Pyongyang to honor their efforts. The deployment signifies a deepened alliance between North Korea and Russia amid ongoing international tensions.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's policies, including tariffs, could harm the U.S. auto industry by isolating it from global innovation. While tariffs aim to protect domestic automakers from foreign competition, other policies threaten to cut them off from advancements in electrification, digitization, and automation. The author suggests that this combination risks leaving U.S. automakers unable to compete effectively, potentially impacting the economy and national security.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's decision to close its airspace to Indian airlines has led to altered routes and increased costs for carriers linking India to Europe, North America, Central Asia, and the Middle East. Indian airlines must now operate longer flights, potentially requiring refueling stops or route cancellations. While the airspace closure stems from heightened tensions between the two nations, analysts suggest that airfares may not significantly increase as a result. IndiGo has stated that around 50 routes may be impacted, while flights to Almaty, Kazakhstan and Tashkent, Uzbekistan have been temporarily suspended.</p>
