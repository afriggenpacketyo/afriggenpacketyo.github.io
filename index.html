        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to adverse weather conditions, specifically thunderstorms. The start was initially set for 8:15 AM local time but was postponed until 4:43 PM BST. This delay affected the tee times of prominent golfers like Rory McIlroy and defending champion Xander Schauffele. The revised schedule will see players teeing off in threesomes from split tees, with the goal of completing the round despite the weather-induced setback. The weather conditions led to a suspension of practice for 17 minutes earlier in the day, underscoring the severity of the weather disruption.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate targeting of civilians, while the Russian military has yet to comment. Military analysts believe that President Putin's primary objective is to suppress Ukraine's democracy and culture, undermining diplomatic efforts.

          <p>Tornadoes have struck Kentucky and Missouri, resulting in at least 21 deaths and prompting officials to declare a "mass casualty event." Kentucky reported 14 deaths, while Missouri confirmed seven fatalities, with the number expected to rise. The storms caused widespread damage, including torn roofs, blown-out windows, and downed power lines. Kentucky officials described the situation as a "mass casualty event" in Laurel County, with several people hospitalized. The National Weather Service warned of further devastation in Texas, Kansas, and Oklahoma, as the storms continue to pose a threat.</p>

          <p>Over half of female business leaders in Japan doubt the country will achieve its goal of having women hold 30% of top corporate positions by 2030. A Kyodo News survey found that 73% believe a shift in top management views is needed, while 54% cite the need for company culture changes. Respondents pointed to traditional gendered divisions of labor and work-life balance issues as persistent barriers. Despite these challenges, around 80% of respondents said they would encourage younger generations of women to aim for senior positions.</p>

          <p>The United States has experienced a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with approximately 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023, marking the steepest single-year decline in 45 years. The trend is widespread, with 45 states recording declines, particularly in Ohio and West Virginia. The increased availability of naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and policies from the Covid-19 pandemic, including telehealth access to addiction treatment, have contributed to the decline. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to naloxone distribution, however, pose a threat to continued progress.</p>

The Protect Brockwell Park campaign asserts they are not against events but seek constructive engagement with the council.
