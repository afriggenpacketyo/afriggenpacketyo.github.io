          <p>The Federal Reserve held its key interest rate steady at 4.25%-4.5%, defying President Trump's calls for cuts.  The decision comes amid projections of higher inflation (3%) and lower economic growth (1.4% GDP in 2025) than previously anticipated.  Despite some officials' preference for no cuts this year, the committee's statement indicated that two rate reductions by the end of 2025 are still possible. The Fed's decision reflects ongoing uncertainty about the economy's trajectory and the impact of tariffs.</p>
