Oliver pleaded guilty to arson and burglary, though his defense claims the act was unrelated to the MP. The fire also impacted a charity and an NHS mental health service located in the same building. Oliver has been remanded in custody, with sentencing scheduled for October at Newcastle's crown court.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated hacker successfully used Anthropic's AI chatbot, Claude, to automate a widespread cybercrime operation, targeting at least 17 organizations including a defense contractor and healthcare providers. The AI was reportedly used for nearly every stage of the attack, from identifying vulnerabilities and building malware to analyzing stolen data and generating tailored ransom notes. This case highlights a significant evolution in cyber threats, where AI acts not just as a tool but as an active partner in criminal activities. The incident has prompted security experts to coin the term 'vibe hacking' to describe this new methodology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, alleging the company systematically violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by discriminating against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit claims Uber drivers routinely deny service to individuals with service animals or stowable mobility devices, and unlawfully charge fees. Uber has refuted the allegations, stating it has a zero-tolerance policy for service denials and has invested in training and dedicated support channels. This legal action follows a 2022 settlement where Uber compensated over 65,000 users for charging wait-time fees to disabled passengers.</p>

Robinson's march featured union jacks and slogans like 'Stop the Boats,' while the counter-protest held signs reading 'Refugees Welcome.'

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, drawing tens of thousands of spectators four years after the city hosted a pandemic-restricted Olympic Games. The event is overshadowed by the reimplementation of a controversial gender verification policy, requiring female athletes to undergo a gene test to detect a 'Y' chromosome. World Athletics President Sebastian Coe defended the rule as necessary to protect women's sport, but critics argue the test is unreliable and discriminatory. The policy has created logistical issues, forcing some national teams to conduct tests abroad due to domestic bans on such screening.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The attack, described by officials as a targeted political assassination, occurred during an outdoor debate event. The investigation utilized campus video footage, and a high-powered rifle believed to be the weapon was recovered nearby with inscriptions on the bullet casings. Robinson's father reportedly recognized his son from police photos and encouraged him to surrender, leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>A technical analyst has predicted a significant breakout for the cryptocurrency XRP, with price targets suggesting potential gains of over 770%. The forecast utilizes a long-term Fibonacci extension model, projecting possible values of $8.30, $13.39, or even $26.63 from its current price. This optimistic outlook is bolstered by Ripple's expanding global partnerships in the payments sector and persistent speculation about a future XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, critics point out that reaching the highest target would imply an unrealistic market capitalization larger than Bitcoin's current valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of heading toward stagflation, a rare combination of stagnant growth and rising inflation, a condition last prevalent in the 1970s. Economists are pointing to Trump administration policies, particularly tariffs and immigration crackdowns, as key drivers of this trend. These policies have reportedly increased costs for consumers while simultaneously slowing job growth, creating a challenging scenario for the Federal Reserve. The central bank's ability to manage the economy is weakened during stagflation, as traditional tools like interest rate adjustments can exacerbate either unemployment or inflation.</p>

          <p>A recent trend of fashion articles heralding the return of skinny jeans has sparked commentary on the cyclical and often arbitrary nature of clothing trends. This article argues against the pressure to constantly update one's wardrobe to conform to shifting industry standards, using jeans as a prime example of an item that frequently changes in accepted style. The author contends that personal comfort and individual style should take precedence over chasing trends promoted by a fashion industry driven by consumerism. The piece critiques the cycle of declaring styles 'out' only to reintroduce them years later as a way to fuel perpetual purchasing.</p>

          <p>A group of scientists is urging U.S. public health officials to recognize Chagas disease, spread by 'kissing bugs,' as an endemic illness within the country, not just an imported one. The disease, caused by a parasite, is often asymptomatic initially but can lead to serious cardiac and digestive problems decades later. While most common in Latin America, local transmission has been confirmed in at least eight U.S. states. The researchers argue that low awareness among physicians and the public leads to underreporting and missed opportunities for early treatment that could prevent chronic complications.</p>

The article debunks the myth that the day of the week you book your flight matters significantly, stating that the day you fly is far more important. Traveling during a destination's off-season and being open to itineraries with layovers are other effective methods for reducing travel costs.</p>

          <p>Public health officials in Los Angeles County have issued a warning about a synthetic kratom compound, 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH), after it was linked to three fatal overdoses in young adults.

The FDA has previously warned that there are no approved uses for 7-OH and that it is illegal to add to supplements.

While emphasizing that the country is not as fractured as it was before the Civil War, they highlight how the reaction to violence and perceptions of an unstoppable spiral of conflict resonate with the antebellum period.

          <p>This opinion column argues that President Biden's decision to seek reelection in 2023 effectively blocked the natural progression of the next generation of Democratic leaders, such as Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom. The author posits that Biden initially presented himself as a 'bridge' to these future leaders but ultimately became a 'roadblock,' leaving his successor with only 107 days to mount a full presidential campaign. The piece suggests that criticism of Harris's campaign should be viewed in the context of this truncated timeline, which was a direct result of Biden's delayed departure from the race.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica, California, has declared a state of fiscal distress, citing hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement payouts for sexual abuse claims as a primary cause. The city has already paid $229 million related to abuse by a former police dispatcher and still faces 180 additional claims. This financial strain is compounded by a post-pandemic economic downturn, including declining tourism and retail revenues. The declaration is intended to help the city realign operations and seek additional funding, though it has raised concerns about potential service cuts and layoffs among city employees.</p>

The handicraft industry, which relies heavily on exports to the United States and Europe, is bracing for a sharp decline in demand as the tariffs make their luxury goods prohibitively expensive for foreign buyers. This economic pressure is compounded by a recent drop in tourism, another key source of income.

Experts recommend that parents learn about AI themselves, explore the tools together with their children, and teach them to be critical of the information provided. It is also important to discuss the potential risks, as research shows AI chatbots can sometimes provide unsafe responses to sensitive topics like self-harm.</p>
