          <p>The Syrian government has agreed to cooperate with the United States in the search and return of Americans missing in the country, signaling improved relations between the two nations. U.S. envoy Thomas Barrack conveyed this "power step forward" after meeting with Syrian President Ahmed Sharaa, emphasizing the importance of closure for the families of Austin Tice, Majd Kamalmaz, and Kayla Mueller. This announcement follows the Trump administration's decision to grant Syria sanctions exemptions, aimed at enabling the new government to foster conditions for the Syrian people to thrive and defeat ISIS. Barrack also commended President al-Sharaa's commitment to counter-ISIS measures and relations with Israel, reflecting a mutual interest in regional stability. The current administration is hoping to provide the Syrian people with the ability to not only survive, but thrive, with the new exemptions and government. </p>

          <p>During a Southern Conference tournament game, the Mercer baseball team walked off the field in protest after a Samford player, Michael Gupton, taunted them following a home run. Gupton's demonstrative celebration, which included leaping and yelling at Mercer's shortstop, led to heated exchanges and ejections of players and coaches. The game was paused for nearly 30 minutes, with the Southern Conference commissioner intervening to restore order, and the mother of one of the ejected players was asked to leave the stadium. Samford's victory secured their spot in the Southern Conference championship game against East Tennessee State, while Mercer's actions sparked controversy and highlighted the tensions surrounding sportsmanship in collegiate athletics. The other team continued on to the championship as a result of the forfeit.</p>

          <p>Russia launched one of its largest air assaults on Ukraine, involving nearly 370 missiles and drones, resulting in at least 12 deaths and numerous injuries across the country. The Ukrainian Air Force reported shooting down approximately two-thirds of the missiles and most of the drones, but the attacks underscored the failure of cease-fire negotiations to alleviate violence against civilian areas. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, calling for increased pressure on President Putin, and emphasized that the world cannot ignore the ongoing war. The attacks have intensified since February, with civilian deaths rising monthly, and the international community is struggling to find a breakthrough in the conflict, leading to increased civilian casualties and infrastructure damage. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News criticizes CNN's Jake Tapper for relying on insider sources who allegedly deceived him and the public, rather than trusting the evidence seen with his own eyes regarding Joe Biden's fitness for office. The author argues that journalism has become too focused on sourcing and access, leading to a confusion of agendas and a reliance on anonymous sources with their own biases. The piece suggests that the media's framing of political coverage as a battle between lying governments and intrepid reporters is often inaccurate, and that journalists should prioritize accurate reporting and analysis of known events. The author concludes that the coverage of Joe Biden's decline has been poor journalism, as reporters like Tapper were convinced there had to be something deeper than what was plainly visible.</p>

          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was forced to divert to Seattle after a passenger attempted to open the plane's exit doors mid-flight. The passenger was restrained by fellow passengers and crew members before the plane landed, and was later evaluated by Port of Seattle Police who determined he was having a medical crisis and transported him to a local hospital. A second unrelated incident occurred while the plane was on the tarmac in Seattle, resulting in another passenger being removed by police. The flight eventually continued to Houston, and the airline affirmed that the safety of passengers and crew remains their top priority.</p>

The Israeli army has increased its operations in Gaza in recent days, with strikes carried out in Khan Younis, Jabalia, and Nuseirat, and has moved all of its regular infantry and tank brigades into the Gaza Strip. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced plans to take control of the entire Gaza Strip, with the military aiming to release hostages and destroy Hamas. Since the ceasefire collapsed on March 18, at least 3,785 people have been killed in the territory, bringing the total since the start of the Gaza war to over 53,900.</p>

          <p>President Trump has again criticized Harvard University regarding its international students, asserting that their home countries are "not at all friendly to the United States" and "pay NOTHING toward their student's education." This follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order that blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The university had argued that the revocation was a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" and punished the school for rejecting government demands to control its governance and curriculum. International students comprise about 27% of Harvard's student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>

Parsons added that the administration is telling professional scholars what ‚Äúareas of inquiry are legitimate and illegitimate,‚Äù which is a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education, as the message to cadets was that dissent is not acceptable.</p>

Republican senators, including fiscal conservatives, have expressed reservations about the bill due to soaring deficit concerns and signaled plans to modify it. Johnson rejected the CBO analysis, asserting that it was "dramatically overstated" and that the bill would stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing U.S. manufacturing.

          <h2>Analysis: Trump Administration Profiting From Presidency Exceeds Previous Scandals</h2>

          <p>An analysis highlights how the Trump administration has monetized the presidency to a greater extent than any previous administration, normalizing activities that would have previously provoked outrage and investigations. The Trump family has collected millions in fees from a new cryptocurrency, brokered overseas real estate deals, and opened an exclusive club in Washington charging exorbitant membership fees. The normalization of these moneymaking schemes, coupled with the dismantling of ethical boundaries and accountability measures, has raised concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest and the erosion of public trust. While some critics are focusing on the president's activities, they have struggled to gain traction without the usual mechanisms of official review.</p>

          <p>Esai Morales reprises his role as Gabriel, the main antagonist, in the latest "Mission: Impossible" film, "The Final Reckoning," marking the first time a Latino has played the lead villain in the series. Morales views Gabriel as the star of his own movie and strives to portray the character with as much humanity as possible, despite his death-defying mission to make Tom Cruise's life impossible. The actor acknowledges the film's production challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Hollywood strikes, and considers its release a momentous occasion, and he hopes his work will lead to meaningful roles that enhance the human condition, even if he's playing the bad guy. Morales also reflects on his role in ‚ÄúLa Bamba,‚Äù noting that he is proud to be Puerto Rican, but that he doesn't need to wear his banner on his head.</p>

The Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained, while the sheriff's office reports the Camp House Road Fire has destroyed more than 150 structures, and donations are being accepted to support relief for Lake County and St. Louis County community members.

The move is intended to emphasize Canada's uniqueness and traditions, distinguishing it from being seen as a "51st state," and it comes at a consequential time for Canada, as Carney heavily campaigned on standing up to Trump. The invitation also works to tie Canada closer to Europe, a key objective of Prime Minister Carney, and the visit will be the King's first to Canada as reigning monarch, marking a significant moment between the Head of State and the Canadian people.</p>

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that while she would like to promise lower fares, the day-to-day running of trains is already heavily subsidized by taxpayers. The focus will instead be on improving services and infrastructure, but some members of the public questioned the point of renationalising train operators if it did not reduce prices. Current government plans are to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services in England by 2027, and the first SWR service under public ownership featured the new GBR livery.</p>
