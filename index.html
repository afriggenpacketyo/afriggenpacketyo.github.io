          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake occurred in Bergen County, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across parts of the state and in New York City. The United States Geological Survey reported the event was centered several miles below Hasbrouck Heights. While the shaking was felt up to 60 miles away, there have been no reports of any injuries or structural damage. This event follows other minor seismic activities in the region, including a notable 4.8 magnitude earthquake earlier in the year, which was one of the largest on the East Coast in a century.</p>

          <p>Political observers are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming World War II victory parade. Some experts, like Vijay Prashad of Tricontinental, argue that his attendance could provide a valuable opportunity for a tripartite meeting with Russia to help resolve ongoing China-India border disputes. However, the general consensus among most analysts is that Modi is unlikely to participate in the Beijing event. This speculation occurs despite a recent, albeit fragile, thaw in diplomatic relations between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>In a comprehensive television interview, convicted serial killer David Berkowitz, known as the "Son of Sam," discusses the 1976-1977 murder spree that terrorized New York City. Berkowitz, who is serving six life sentences, reflects on what led him to kill, claiming he was walking in darkness and serving demonic forces. He describes his current life in prison as a born-again Christian, where he works in the library and finds refuge in the chapel. The article revisits the climate of fear in the city at the time and includes perspectives from survivors and investigators.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly scuttled a potential bipartisan deal aimed at advancing a block of his administration's nominees through the Senate. The agreement would have reportedly involved the White House unfreezing certain withheld funds in exchange for Democrats allowing the nominations to proceed. In a social media post, Trump called the offer "embarrassing" and urged Republicans to reject it, telling them to tell Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to "GO TO HELL." Schumer later stated that Trump's refusal to cooperate left both parties wondering what had happened.</p>

          <p>More than three decades after the brutal 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, the case remains unsolved. After initial convictions were overturned due to new DNA evidence, focus has shifted to a persistent theory involving two unidentified men seen in the shop just before closing. Multiple witnesses described the men, who reportedly did not buy anything, as looking out of place. Despite extensive investigations, these two individuals have never been identified, leading defense attorneys and former investigators to believe they may hold the key to solving the crime.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) has confirmed it is investigating former special counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. This non-criminal investigation follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's prosecutorial activities against Donald Trump were politically motivated and intended to influence the 2024 election. The Hatch Act is a federal law that prohibits government employees from engaging in certain forms of political activity. The OSC is an independent agency separate from the special counsel role previously held by Smith.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare capability using a swarm of drones. According to a research paper, the system can create a protective electromagnetic bubble, or "storm eye," for friendly forces on the battlefield. By coordinating their signals, the drones can jam enemy communications and radar systems while simultaneously creating a null zone where allied signals are unaffected. This targeted approach marks a significant evolution from traditional, indiscriminate jamming methods that often disrupt friendly and enemy electronics alike.</p>

This collective trauma, which the article suggests has never been properly atoned for by the Japanese government, still influences the country's psyche and its foreign policy.

In a social media post, Trump claimed the numbers couldn't be trusted and that the commissioner would be replaced.

This major commitment signals a clear shift in the team's focus and leadership. The move also intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James, who is 40 years old and has only one year remaining on his contract. While the Lakers' front office expressed positive interactions with James's camp, his long-term role with the team now appears more uncertain than ever.</p>

          <p>The rapid melting of glaciers and permafrost in the Alps is increasing the risk of catastrophic landslides, threatening to wipe out historic mountain villages in Switzerland. The recent destruction of Blatten, whose residents were evacuated just days before a mountain collapse, highlights the growing danger. Climate scientists warn such events are becoming more frequent and unpredictable due to rising global temperatures. This has sparked a national debate over the immense cost of protecting and rebuilding these communities versus the painful option of permanent relocation.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man faces multiple felony charges after allegedly commandeering a transportation cart at Buffalo Niagara International Airport and going on a destructive joyride. Authorities said the man was visibly intoxicated when he drove the cart through the terminal, causing extensive damage to the airport's moving walkways. Video of the incident, which circulated widely on social media, shows the cart crushing metal and shattering glass as it is driven down a walkway too narrow for the vehicle. The damage is estimated to be worth thousands of dollars.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the early death of his stepfather was the pivotal event that prompted him to quit his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. In a BBC radio interview, Hill explained that he felt unsuited for medicine and was at the end of his tether with the profession. Seeing his stepfather pass away at age 54, before he could enjoy retirement, made Hill realize he did not want the same fate. He described leaving his hospital job as a moment where a great weight was lifted.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for approximately £30 million, just two years after signing him. While Hojlund has expressed his desire to stay with the club, his potential departure is linked to United's interest in signing RB Leipzig forward Benjamin Sesko. The club needs to sell players to remain compliant with the Premier League's profit and sustainability rules. If a new forward were to arrive, Hojlund would likely become marginalized, making a sale a practical option for the team.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it will adopt a more careful approach to its open-source strategy. This shift in thinking contrasts with China's current trajectory, where companies are aggressively pushing ahead with advanced open-source AI models. Some experts, like Andrew Ng, suggest that China's vibrant and highly competitive open-source ecosystem is creating a "Darwinian" environment that could help it surpass the U.S. in AI development, even as top proprietary models remain American.</p>
