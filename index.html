          <h2>German Automakers See Hope for EU Tariff Breakthrough Following US-Japan Trade Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:35:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European car manufacturers' shares surged after the U.S.-Japan trade deal, which lowered tariffs on Japanese autos, sparked optimism for a similar agreement with the European Union. The agreement, described by former President Trump as "massive," reduced U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles and parts to 15% from the existing 25% rate, a significant drop. This precedent has led economists to suggest it could influence ongoing negotiations with the EU and South Korea, as auto tariffs were reduced without an export cap for a major auto-exporting country. While European automakers have substantial investment plans in the U.S., the figures do not come close to Japan's commitment, yet the markets are reflecting strong hopes for a potential deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have misled lawyers in South African courtrooms by inventing non-existent case citations, leading to serious consequences for legal proceedings. Judges have ruled against plaintiffs and criticized lawyers for placing "false trust" in AI-generated research, deeming it negligence and potentially misleading to the court. This growing problem underscores the critical need for legal professionals to use generative AI responsibly and ethically, as highlighted by multiple reported instances in South Africa. Legal experts are calling for clear guidelines and potential amendments to the profession's code of conduct to address the risks of excessive reliance on AI, which can weaken the judicial process by creating mistrust regarding accuracy.</p>

          <h2>Germany's Shadow Economy Surges to Nearly Decade-High Amid Economic Shrinkage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 04:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's shadow economy, encompassing undeclared work, is experiencing a significant boom, projected to reach €511 billion in 2025, marking the highest level in nearly a decade. This surge occurs despite the official economy shrinking for over two years, with undeclared work now exceeding the entire government budget. Experts attribute this rise to a decline in "tax morale," as citizens perceive high taxes coupled with unsatisfactory public services like crumbling infrastructure. The increase is also linked to economic struggles, as people seek to supplement income, and heated debates over welfare support, with critics arguing that the "Bürgergeld" (citizen's income) may incentivize undeclared work.</p>

          <p>Following a new trade framework agreement with Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump has now directed his attention towards upcoming trade negotiations with the European Union. Pressure is mounting for a deal before August 1, when 30% levies on U.S.-bound EU imports are set to take effect, with potential retaliatory tariffs from Brussels. The U.S.-Japan deal, which lowered auto tariffs to 15% without an export cap, has generated positive sentiment among experts who believe it could serve as a precedent for EU talks. The EU is keen on securing exemptions for key sectors, particularly road vehicles, which are among its top exports to the U.S., as European markets show an initial positive reaction.</p>

          <p>New DNA analysis of 131 skeletons from the Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey, dating back 9,000 years, strongly suggests a society centered around women. Researchers discovered that individuals buried under the same houses were often related through their mothers, indicating a matrilineal household structure where men moved in with the woman's family. Furthermore, female bodies were found with up to five times more grave goods than male ones, reinforcing the theory of an elevated societal position for women. This groundbreaking research, published in the journal Science, utilized advanced DNA extraction from inner ear bones, offering crucial insights into ancient social structures and highlighting a society that valued equality.</p>

          <p>China's economy faces challenges beyond intensifying deflationary pressures, with economists emphasizing the urgent need for deeper institutional reforms to boost productivity. As Beijing prepares its "15th five-year plan" for 2026-2030, experts like Liu Qiao of Peking University highlight the necessity of increasing total factor productivity, which has been declining since 2006. This requires not just technological innovation but significant institutional changes, particularly in how government officials' performance is evaluated, moving beyond GDP growth to include debt levels. Policymakers are expected to signal a lower growth target around 4.5-5%, prioritizing consumption over investment to address issues like industrial overcapacity, though fundamental adjustments will be difficult and slow.

          <p>China is significantly outperforming the U.S. in developing power capacity crucial for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure, according to a report by Anthropic, a San Francisco-based AI firm. Last year, China added 400 gigawatts of power capacity, while the U.S. managed only a fraction of that, just "several dozen" gigawatts, amounting to one-tenth of China's total. Anthropic notes that the U.S. AI sector alone will require at least 50 gigawatts by 2028, making the current disparity in power capacity with China "concerning." This imbalance suggests a potential strategic disadvantage for the U.S. in the global AI race, driven by its struggles with energy constraints.</p>

Western allies, who helped establish these anti-corruption bodies as a key precondition for aid, have expressed concern, viewing the move as a "serious step back" for Ukraine's democratic governance and its application to join the EU.

Post-mortem examinations have begun to determine the cause of death, following Scotland's biggest mass stranding in nearly 30 years last summer. Despite noticeable decomposition, initial findings indicate the whales were healthy but had not been feeding recently. Experts note an increasing frequency of deep-diving species like bottlenose whales, usually found at 800ft below sea level, appearing in warmer, more southern waters. While the reason for this shift from their natural habitat remains unconfirmed, climate change is strongly suspected as a contributing factor.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "massive" trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on imported Japanese goods, a significant reduction from the previously threatened 25% rate. Trump claimed the agreement would create hundreds of thousands of jobs and involve Japan investing $550 billion in the U.S., with America receiving 90% of the profits. Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the 15% auto tariff reduction, calling it beneficial for both sides. This deal is part of Trump's broader strategy to secure a "blitz" of trade agreements before higher tariffs kick in, aiming to revive U.S. manufacturing and correct perceived unfair trade practices and imbalances.

This soft inflation figure clears the path for the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to potentially ease its monetary policy later in July, aiming to support economic growth amidst an uncertain global trade environment.

          <p>A top German court has upheld the domestic intelligence agency's classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a "suspected right-wing extremist" group, allowing continued monitoring including the use of undercover informants. This final ruling reinforces a previous court decision based on sufficient evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the party, particularly concerning the degradation of legal status for German citizens with migration backgrounds. Concurrently, the German government has approved the delivery of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Turkey, and a new draft law will permit federal police to carry and use Tasers, aiming for a more graduated use of force, as Franco-German ties seek to deepen.</p>

          <p>The UK government has revealed plans to cut foreign aid spending by 40%, reducing it from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, in a move to increase defense spending. A Foreign Office report indicates Africa will face the biggest reductions, with support for children's education and women's health significantly decreasing, raising increased risks of disease and death. Aid organizations like Bond warn that women and children in the world's most marginalized communities will pay the highest price for these "political choices." While multilateral aid bodies and humanitarian efforts in hotspots like Gaza and Ukraine will be protected, bilateral support for some countries is set to decrease.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a dismal 10-7 loss to the Minnesota Twins, primarily due to shockingly sloppy pitching from their bullpen. In the sixth and seventh innings, the Twins scored six runs with only two hits, capitalizing on a parade of walks and a glaring defensive error, turning a tied game into a significant defeat. Manager Dave Roberts described the game as "not pretty," highlighting the team's struggles with command and defense from their relief corps, which is currently missing key players due to injury. This defeat marks the Dodgers' 11th loss in their last 14 games and their fourth since the All-Star break, signaling a new nadir in what is becoming one of their worst single-month performances in years.</p>

Locals, like 77-year-old Jimmy Robertson, lament the loss of essential local businesses such as butchers and doctors' surgeries, replaced by souvenir stores that make the area less livable for residents. The article highlights a decline in local school enrollment and increased anti-social behavior, linking them to the pressures of tourism and the surge in holiday lets. While tourism significantly boosts the city's economy, supporting thousands of jobs, residents feel displaced, prompting calls for better management and the introduction of a tourist tax to fund infrastructure improvements.</p>

However, she attributes their success to the enduring appeal of rubber ducks to tourists, gift seekers, and collectors, particularly millennials, noting the "iconic" nature of the product.

Experts note that while both sides have mutual interests in countering some of President Trump's trade measures and unilateralism, the U.S.'s actions could inadvertently worsen EU-China relations. Brussels may feel pressured by Washington to sharpen its stance on China, making it difficult for the EU to navigate its economic relationship with Beijing while managing coercion from its American allies.</p>

However, 3D digital scans of the bite marks closely matched an extinct five-meter-long caiman species, Purussaurus neivensis, which likely ambushed its prey from the water's edge. This rare evidence, published in Biology Letters, provides unique insight into an ancient ecosystem, revealing that terror birds were more vulnerable to predators than previously believed, with the lack of healing indicating the bird likely died during the attack.</p>
