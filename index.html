          <p>A leisure centre in Larne, Northern Ireland, was attacked during a third night of violence, following unrest that initially began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena. Masked young people threw objects at vehicles, causing fire and smoke damage to the front reception, leading to the safe relocation of families who were temporarily sheltered there. Communities Minister Gordon Lyons condemned the violence, while local Alliance Party MLA Danny Donnelly described the scene as "absolute disorder," noting that a yoga class was disrupted. Meanwhile, in Ballymena, police used dogs and water cannons to disperse crowds throwing smoke bombs and other projectiles, and extra police officers were deployed to the affected areas to address what Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson called "racist thuggery." The article concludes by mentioning the arrest of a man in connection to the violence and the impact of social media in galvanizing criminal behavior.</p>

          <p>U.S. officials have reportedly been informed that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, prompting the U.S. to anticipate potential Iranian retaliation against American sites in neighboring Iraq, leading to the State Department advising some Americans to leave the region. Despite the tensions, President Trump's Middle East envoy is still planning to meet with Iran for a sixth round of talks on the country's nuclear program in the coming days. Trump reiterated that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop a nuclear weapon, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been skeptical of any deal with Iran and has conducted covert operations to hinder Iran's nuclear program. Last month, Trump publicly stated that he had urged Netanyahu not to strike Iran while his administration pursues negotiations with the regime.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded details of a dying star's explosion, describing it as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp with a pure yellow color. The observation was documented in a formal report to Emperor Yongle, interpreting the event as a heavenly endorsement of his reign. The report noted the star remained stationary and calm over 10 days of measurement and observation, confirming the phenomenon was a nova. This rediscovered memorial settles a long-standing debate among modern astronomers about the true nature of the 1408 event, with the unprecedented details helping narrow down the starâ€™s possible position.</p>

          <p>Protests in Los Angeles, sparked by increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids, reflect deep-seated tensions over immigration policies. The protests, while not massive, represent a microcosm of Los Angeles' diverse and liberal coalition, with many feeling their right to belong is under attack. Stephen Miller, a key Trump aide, is seen as a driving force behind the aggressive immigration policies, with Los Angeles becoming a focal point for asserting these policies. The article notes that Miller's vision clashes with Los Angeles' history of largely overlooking legal status for workers, and that his actions are leading to a backlash, including the deployment of federal troops.</p>

The decline follows a public disagreement between Musk and Trump over the president's spending bill, though Musk later expressed regret for some of his social media posts.

          <p>Hong Kong aims to secure a prominent position in the stablecoin market with the passage of comprehensive stablecoin laws, seeking a "first-mover" advantage over the US and Singapore. The new regulations, effective August 1, reflect the government's determination to unlock value in the sector while addressing past setbacks. Combined with the cityâ€™s vast offshore yuan holdings and Chinaâ€™s restricted use of cryptocurrencies, the law has fueled hopes that Hong Kong could rival US dollar-backed tokens like Tetherâ€™s USDT and Circleâ€™s USDC. The legislative push underscores an intensifying East-West contest over financial influence in the digital era. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say rewrites the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The two 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in a Mongolian museum, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery helps to understand how tyrannosaurs evolved into powerful predators that terrorized North America and Asia. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of features key to tyrannosaurs' tyranny, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw.</p>
