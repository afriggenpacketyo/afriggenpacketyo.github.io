          <p>President Trump announced plans to address crime in Washington, D.C., by federalizing the city's police department, deploying the National Guard, and clearing homeless encampments. However, his authority is constrained by the 1973 Home Rule Act, which limits such a federal takeover to a maximum of 30 days without congressional approval. D.C.'s attorney general has called the move unlawful, citing data that shows violent crime has significantly decreased. While the police union welcomed the move, disagreements over staffing and tactics have already emerged, casting doubt on the long-term feasibility of Trump's ambitious overhaul.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows a deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face increased U.S. sanctions, though previous talks have failed to produce a peace agreement. The choice of Alaska, once Russian territory, holds historical significance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend but will be briefed afterward, despite his concerns that any deal made without Ukraine's involvement would be meaningless.</p>

          <p>A former U.S. Postal Service carrier from Torrance, California, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud after stealing mail to fund a lavish lifestyle. Mary Ann Magdamit, 31, admitted to stealing checks and credit cards from her mail route, which she then used for luxury purchases like a Rolex watch and vacations to Aruba and Turks and Caicos. A search of her apartment uncovered over 130 stolen cards, stolen checks, and an unserialized 'ghost gun.' Magdamit, who flaunted her purchases on Instagram, now faces a potential sentence of up to 30 years in federal prison.</p>

          <p>A new Siena Institute poll indicates Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani holds a significant 19-point lead over former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. The poll shows Mamdani with 44% of voter support, while Cuomo and incumbent Eric Adams, both running as independents, trail significantly. Mamdani's strength is concentrated among younger voters, though he underperforms with Black and Jewish voters compared to Cuomo. Meanwhile, in a hypothetical 2026 gubernatorial race, incumbent Kathy Hochul's lead over Republican Elise Stefanik has narrowed, signaling potential challenges for centrist Democrats in New York.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations for not featuring his social media platform X and AI chatbot Grok in the App Store's 'Must Have' section. Musk questioned whether Apple was 'playing politics,' asserting that X is the world's top news app and Grok is a top-five app overall. He claimed Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company besides its partner, OpenAI, to achieve a top ranking. This threat adds to Apple's existing legal challenges, including an EU fine for anticompetitive behavior in its App Store.</p>

          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $50,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing stability against potential returns. CDs offer a fixed interest rate for a set term, providing guaranteed earnings, while high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that can fluctuate with market conditions. Current calculations show that for shorter terms, a high-yield savings account might earn slightly more, but for terms of six months or a year, a CD could yield a higher return. The decision depends on an individual's risk tolerance and expectations for future interest rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England is currently experiencing its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 33°C (92.1°F) in parts of the country. This prolonged period of dry, hot weather has led to what the national drought group describes as 'nationally significant' water shortfalls, impacting agriculture, wildlife, and increasing wildfire risk. The heat has also disrupted rail services due to soil shrinkage under tracks. While millions are now under hosepipe bans, water companies face criticism for significant leaks in their infrastructure, and experts warn these conditions are a clear signal of climate change's growing impact.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) indicated that inflation held steady in July, rising 2.7% annually, unchanged from the previous month. This stability was largely due to a monthly decline in grocery and gasoline prices, which helped offset increases in other areas. However, the core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose at its fastest annual pace since February, climbing 3.1%.

          <h2>An Analysis of the Safety and Risks of Reverse Mortgages for Seniors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, can be a useful tool but are not without risks. While most are federally insured HECMs, which offer consumer protections, homeowners are still responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failure to pay can lead to foreclosure. The loan balance grows over time, which can significantly deplete the equity available to heirs. Experts advise that these loans are safest for seniors who plan to remain in their homes long-term and caution against potential scams. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking a judge to jail former congressman Beto O’Rourke for allegedly violating a court order. The order temporarily blocked O'Rourke and his political group, Powered by People, from fundraising to support Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a quorum for a vote on a Republican-backed redistricting map. Paxton's filing claims O'Rourke openly defied the ruling by continuing to solicit donations online and at a rally. He is requesting that O'Rourke be fined and jailed until he agrees to comply with the court's order.</p>

The Conservative opposition criticized the government's plan as 'just a slogan,' while the government maintains it will turn the situation around with new measures, including a returns deal with France. The news was accompanied by a report of a woman dying on a French beach while attempting to board a boat to the UK.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. This move could significantly alter retirement savings options for millions of Americans and open a massive new market for the private equity industry. Proponents argue it could offer higher returns and portfolio diversification, but critics highlight the increased risks, higher fees, and lack of transparency associated with such assets.

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his pressure on the Federal Reserve, threatening to allow a 'major lawsuit' against Chairman Jerome Powell while demanding an immediate interest rate cut. In a social media post, Trump criticized Powell's performance as 'horrible' and 'grossly incompetent,' specifically citing the rising costs of renovations at the Fed's headquarters. Trump did not specify who would file the potential lawsuit. The threat is the latest in a series of public attacks by the president, who has consistently railed against the Fed for not cutting interest rates more aggressively.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly instructed companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 and certain AMD AI chips for any government or national security-related applications. This directive comes shortly after the U.S. government approved export licenses for these less-advanced chips under a new deal where the companies pay a 15% tax on their China revenues. The warning from Beijing underscores the escalating tech tensions, as China appears to be steering its domestic industry away from U.S. hardware, even when it is specifically designed to comply with American export controls.
