          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, the Grandview Institution, proposes that China and the US establish a security dialogue mechanism to mitigate conflict risks in the South China Sea. The report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, highlights confrontational dynamics in aerial and maritime interactions. Researchers Liu Xiaobo and Sophie Wushuang Yi advocate for institutionalized dialogue focusing on regional security architecture, maritime legal order, and crisis response protocols. Despite the risks, the report suggests that competition in the area remains manageable, albeit prolonged. </p>

          <p>India is seeking to tap into its rare earth reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the rare earth elements (REEs) market. Indian officials are exploring how Indian Rare Earths (IREL) can increase rare earth magnet production, following China's restrictions on exports. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal views this as a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative supply.

          <p>Canada's newly elected government is facing scrutiny over its proposed border bill, which critics argue aligns with US anti-immigrant policies and expands law enforcement powers. Bill C-2, or the Strong Borders Act, grants extensive authority to the immigration minister to cancel immigration documents and suspend intake in any immigration stream. The legislation also amends the Criminal Code, granting police greater access to citizens' data and electronic information without a warrant in "exigent circumstances." Opponents contend the bill infringes on privacy rights and due process, disproportionately affecting women, minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>After two decades of publicly warning about Iran's nuclear program, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu authorized an air assault aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Netanyahu evoked the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust to justify his decision, stating Israel had learned the lessons of history. The attack comes amid changing dynamics in the Middle East, including Israel's military actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. However, Netanyahu's move was potentially influenced by the recent U.S. announcement of direct nuclear talks with Iran, which blindsided him.</p>

          <p>In response to tariffs imposed by the United States, China is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help exporters target the home market. Domestic L/Cs function similarly to international ones, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. These L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, typically have a payment period of one year and can be used for both goods and services. This initiative aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by boosting domestic sales.</p>

          <p>German machinery manufacturers are calling for the EU to implement trade barriers to protect them from Chinese competition. The Mechanical Engineering Industry Association (VDMA) has published a paper highlighting concerns about unfair state subsidies for Chinese companies. The VDMA argues that Chinese firms often disregard European technical regulations and are heavily subsidized by their government, creating an uneven playing field. Bertram Kawlath, VDMAâ€™s president, insists that politicians must respond to this unfair competition.</p>

          <p>Japan hopes to secure special treatment in its tariff deal with the United States, according to Tokyo's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. This expectation follows U.S. President Donald Trump's indication of a potential rise in import levies on cars. Akazawa's visit to Washington marks his fourth in as many weeks, aiming to advance talks before a potential meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump. Japan is seeking concessions on auto tariffs and the removal of other sector-based tariffs.</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully relaunched its new 5,000-ton naval destroyer, less than a month after it capsized during the first attempted launch. Kim Jong Un oversaw the launch, with state media reporting the ship has been fully restored. Experts question the completeness of the repairs given the speed of the relaunch. Kim emphasized the country's commitment to developing a nuclear-armed navy and plans to build two more destroyers in the coming year.</p>

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 fell 1.2% to 37,721.63, while the Kospi in Seoul edged 0.7% lower to 2,900.14. Despite initial market reactions, analysts expect Asian markets to recover quickly due to limited exposure to the conflict and growing ties with unaffected Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

          <p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Israel would continue attacking Iran to eliminate its nuclear program. The article suggests that Iran was in a late-stage rush to assemble a nuclear weapon, prompting Israel's action. The author argues that Iran's diminished deterrent power, due to Israeli attacks on its proxies and territory, led to this decision. An Iran without a strong Axis of Resistance lacks bargaining power, making it necessary for Iran to achieve real nuclear statehood to recover its lost deference.</p>
