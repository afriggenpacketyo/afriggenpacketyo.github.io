          <p>Waymo and Toyota have announced a partnership to explore integrating Waymo's self-driving technology into personally-owned vehicles, aiming to accelerate the development of driver assistance and autonomous vehicle technologies. The collaboration may also lead to Toyota vehicles being incorporated into Waymo's ride-hailing fleet. This partnership is part of Waymo's broader strategy of collaborating with various automakers, including previous ventures with Jaguar Land Rover and Stellantis, to develop and deploy autonomous vehicle technology. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned the possibility of personal ownership of Waymo-equipped vehicles, aligning with GM's shift towards autonomous systems for personal use after abandoning its Cruise robotaxi business. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>Since President Trump's return to office, Elon Musk has been leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), aiming to cut government spending. While Musk promised trillions in savings, DOGE has so far achieved far less, with many of its claimed cost savings being questioned. The administration's efforts to slash the federal workforce have also faced criticism and legal challenges, with some laid-off workers being rehired due to court orders. Musk's influence has been sweeping, with DOGE personnel participating in the near-dismantling of federal agencies, though his business interests benefit from federal programs.

          <p>A Texas jury found Caysen Allison not guilty of murder but guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the 2022 stabbing death of Joe Ramirez Jr. at Belton High School.

Allison faces six months to two years in state prison and a possible fine at his sentencing hearing on June 16. The optimism score is 30.</p>

          <p>Two dozen states have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the administration is trying to "dismantle" the volunteer service organization.

          <p>A study comparing healing rates in humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and mice found that human wounds took more than twice as long to heal as wounds of other mammals. The slower healing may be a result of an evolutionary trade-off when humans shed fur for sweat glands to regulate body temperature. The presence of hair follicles, which house stem cells, aids faster healing in furry animals. The shift to sweat glands allowed for physical activity in hot environments and cooled the machinery of our big brains. The optimism score is 70.</p>
