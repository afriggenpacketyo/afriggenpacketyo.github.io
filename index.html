            <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reportedly shared sensitive details about a March attack on Houthis in Yemen in a second Signal group chat, this time including his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The shared information allegedly included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets. This follows a previous incident where Hegseth inadvertently shared similar information with a journalist. The Pentagon spokesperson dismissed the reports, but critics, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have expressed concerns about endangering lives and called for Hegseth's dismissal.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry concluded that "professional failures," including an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders," led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The IDF maintains that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. The report cited poor visibility and a perceived threat as contributing factors, leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander and reprimand for another officer. The incident has prompted calls for an independent investigation and raised concerns about accountability and international law.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for Xiamen Airlines in China landed back at Boeing's US production hub, a consequence of the escalating trade war and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. China imposed a 125% tariff on US goods. With a market value of around $55 million, the new 737 MAX has become too expensive for Chinese airlines to import. The decision regarding the aircraft's return remains unclear, but analysts suggest confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen in March in a second group chat using the messaging app Signal that included his wife, his brother and his personal lawyer. The details shared included the flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets involved in the pending attack on Houthi positions. The sharing of the details reportedly occurred around the same time in mid-March when key members of President Donald Trump's National Security Council, including Hegseth, inadvertently shared details about the March 15 missile strike in Yemen with the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic. Sean Parnell, chief spokesperson for the Pentagon, responded to reports of the second chat in a statement on X on Sunday night saying in part, "Another day, another old story—back from the dead. The Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to President Trump’s agenda."</p>

Following the announcement, the Chinese onshore yuan appreciated 0.20% to 7.2848 against the dollar, while the offshore yuan strengthened 0.22% to 7.2846 against the greenback.</p>

            <p>China warned countries against striking trade deals with the US at Beijing's expense, threatening countermeasures against those who "appease" Washington. This follows reports that the US plans to pressure nations to curb trade with China to avoid new tariffs. China insists "appeasement will not bring peace" and vowed to take "reciprocal countermeasures" against any nation acting against its interests. Several countries are reportedly negotiating with the US to avoid the tariffs, but must balance their reliance on trade with China.</p>

            <p>A survey published at the end of March found the supply of postdoctoral positions at Chinese universities “far exceeds” the number of young researchers looking for a job. According to the statistics, for every five postdoctoral early career research vacancies, there was on average just one jobseeker. Of all recruitment groups, the study found the largest gap between vacancies and demand was among postdocs. High-profile Chinese scientists including Wang Jiangtao, who worked at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for seven years, have chosen to return to home as the Trump administration slashes research funding.</p>

Home Plate's beef, previously sourced entirely from the U.S., is increasingly Australian. Beijing's 125% retaliatory tariffs, on top of the existing 22%, made it unaffordable. The pork ribs, too, are a-changing. They'll now come from Canada, he said.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 Americans are at risk of losing their rental assistance due to the Emergency Housing Vouchers program running out of funds.

Funding is expected to be depleted by the end of next year, potentially leading to a significant increase in evictions. Democratic Rep.

            <p>US Vice President JD Vance's visit to India begins with a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss a bilateral trade deal. The visit coincides with the escalating trade war between the US and China. Discussions are likely to focus on the progress of the bilateral agenda set out in February, including trade fairness and expanding the defense partnership. India hopes to secure a trade deal within a 90-day pause on US tariffs.</p>
