          <h2>Details of UK-US Tariff Agreement Revealed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 12:42:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US and the UK have reached a tariff deal on some goods, but a blanket 10% tariff on most UK goods entering the US remains. The agreement cuts tariffs on UK exports like cars, steel, and aluminum, but is not a full free-trade agreement as US President Trump lacks the authority to sign such an agreement without Congress approval. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars, while steel and aluminum tariffs are scrapped, benefitting firms like British Steel. Negotiations will continue on pharmaceuticals and digital services tax, with the UK and US agreeing to work on a digital trade deal. There are no changes to food standards as of yet, and the article does not mention whether the UK will drop its 10% tariff on US cars.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, political scientists argue that America has crossed into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. They propose a metric: the cost of opposing the government, noting that in democracies, citizens are not punished for peacefully opposing those in power. The article asserts the Trump administration has weaponized government agencies against critics, citing investigations into political opponents, targeting of law firms, and intimidation of donors. This has created a chilling effect, leading to self-censorship and a weakening of democratic defenses as civil society leaders retreat into silence and acquiescence.</p>

          <p>The federal government released over 60,000 pages of records related to Senator Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, ordered by President Trump with support from RFK Jr. The documents include details about the FBI's investigation, interviews with Sirhan Sirhan and eyewitnesses, but it's unclear if the files reveal new information. Previous releases included handwritten notes from Sirhan and references to conspiracy theories. RFK Jr. has publicly questioned Sirhan's guilt, while other Kennedy family members oppose his release. The article mentions that Sirhan has been incarcerated for decades, and multiple requests for parole have been unsuccessful.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has secured a trade agreement with the United States by cultivating a relationship with President Trump. The agreement, the first between the US and another country since Trump imposed tariffs, is a political victory for Starmer, who has avoided criticizing Trump and acted as a bridge between Europe and the US. The article notes Britain had other advantages in dealing with the United States. The deal could help buoy Britain's economy but also presents hurdles, including to efforts to reset trade relations with the European Union after Brexit.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced he will double his charitable giving to $200 billion over the next 20 years, motivated by global challenges and Andrew Carnegie's views on wealth. The Gates Foundation, founded with his ex-wife Melinda French Gates, has already given away over $100 billion and will close at the end of 2045 after Gates gives away virtually all of his wealth. Despite the increase, Gates notes that philanthropists cannot cover the multibillion-dollar foreign aid cuts by wealthy countries. He wrote that it is unclear whether the world's richest countries will continue to stand up for its poorest people.</p>

The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its status as a "bouncebackability asset" amid brightening prospects for U.S. trade deals. Antoni Trenchev of crypto exchange Nexo notes that Bitcoin is supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and demand from spot-ETF investors. The article suggests that Bitcoin's resilience will be tested further in an uncertain global environment, citing rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to cutting rates.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that a Michigan jury deadlocked in the murder trial of Christopher Schurr, a former police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya during a traffic stop in 2022. Schurr testified he feared for his life when Lyoya grabbed his stun gun. The judge declared a mistrial after four days of deliberation, and the prosecutor has not yet decided whether to retry the case. Lyoya's death sparked protests and racial tensions, and the trial centered on whether Schurr's use of deadly force was justified, while the defense argued that Schurr had reason to think that he faced a dire threat.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock slipped after the company reported mixed first-quarter results and issued soft guidance for the current period, with CFO Jeff Hoffmeister noting tariff uncertainty. Shopify expects gross profit and revenue to grow at a slower pace than analysts had anticipated. The company has some exposure to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, but the expiration of de minimis is not expected to have a "meaningful impact" in the near term. Hoffmeister said consumers who purchase from Shopify businesses skew higher income, with more than half of buyers in the U.S. having incomes above $100,000.</p>

Martin's association with a Jan. 6 defendant who has expressed antisemitic views also contributed to the opposition.

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates. The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term and comes as the president has used tariffs â€” and the threat of the levies â€” as leverage to bring other countries to the table to negotiate trade deals with his administration.</p>

          <p>A report from the Office for Students (OfS) reveals that over 40% of universities in England expect to be in a financial deficit by this summer. The main reason is a drop in international students due to visa changes, leading to course closures and job losses. Universities are closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but "significant reform and efficiencies" were needed to turn the tide. The OfS does not expect any large or medium institutions to fail in the next 12 months, but is working with a small number of institutions that were "under real pressure".</p>

Democrats have called the effort a waste of taxpayer dollars, while Greene claimed Democrats are catering to Mexican cartels by opposing the name change.

The author provides strategies for acquiring these virtues, including asking what others need that only you can provide, seeking improvements in your environment, questioning your own assumptions, and detaching from your emotions.</p>
