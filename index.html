          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations. The decision came after Petro, during a protest in New York City, called on American soldiers to disobey orders from President Trump regarding the conflict in Gaza. This action adds to the already strained relationship, which has seen disagreements over U.S. deportation flights and Colombia's cooperation on anti-narcotics efforts.</p>

          <p>The FBI has reportedly fired approximately 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during the 2020 protests that followed George Floyd's death. The dismissals are viewed by critics as part of a cultural purge under Director Kash Patel, while the FBI Agents Association has condemned the action as unlawful. The agents involved have maintained that their actions were a de-escalation tactic in a volatile situation, not a political statement.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Labour party conference, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has strongly criticized the rival Reform UK party, stating their policies would "tear this country apart." He specifically targeted Reform's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain for legal migrants, calling it one of the "most shocking things" the party has proposed.

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning about foreign attempts to illegally smuggle key strategic minerals, such as antimony, out of the country. The ministry stated that these efforts to bypass export controls pose a direct threat to national security by depleting China's scarce and vital resources. The announcement detailed two recently thwarted cases, including one involving a family-run criminal network that smuggled high-purity antimony ingots to an overseas buyer.</p>

          <h2>Dating Apps Turn to AI for Matchmaking, but Experts Question Its Ability to Predict Human Chemistry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major dating apps, including Bumble and those under Match Group, are increasingly incorporating AI to act as a "matchmaker," aiming to combat user burnout from endless swiping. These new systems use questionnaires and large language models to pair users based on deeper values rather than superficial profiles. However, this article expresses skepticism, noting that decades of research have failed to find a simple formula for romantic compatibility, and past experiments suggest that the perception of compatibility can be more powerful than actual data.</p>

          <p>Tech consulting giant Accenture is implementing a new strategy that involves "exiting" employees who are unable to be reskilled in artificial intelligence. CEO Julie Sweet stated that as AI becomes integral to their business, the company's primary focus is on upskilling its workforce, but it will remove staff on a "compression timeline" for whom retraining is not a viable path. This is part of a broader business optimization program intended to reinvest savings into AI talent and future growth.</p>

          <p>Despite leading the Labour Party back to power, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing significant internal criticism and poor polling numbers just over a year into his term. This analysis suggests a growing sentiment within the party that Starmer lacks strong communication skills, decisive leadership, and a clear governing vision. While there is no consensus on a potential successor, the persistent discontent and chatter about his leadership pose a serious challenge as he heads into the annual party conference.</p>

          <p>China is significantly growing its soft power in Africa through the expansion of its government-run Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese language and culture. While these institutes offer scholarships and career opportunities for African students, critics raise concerns about their role in promoting Beijing's political and economic agenda. Some academics warn that the institutes, often based at universities, can interfere with academic freedom and indoctrinate students with undemocratic principles while furthering China's access to African resources.</p>

While some remain committed to returning, widespread frustration with insurance companies, contamination concerns, and the prospect of living in a long-term construction zone is causing many to reconsider.

          <p>This opinion piece revisits the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, a town with many Holocaust survivors. The author recalls the pain the event caused but quotes the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right to march, arguing that the First Amendment was the true client. The lawyer, David Goldberger, reflects that while the case was personally painful, free speech must be protected even when it is offensive, or else officials gain the power to silence any speech they dislike.</p>
