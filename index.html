            <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Chinese imports to 125% has drawn strong criticism from China, which views the move as a selfish act against the international community. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stated that Beijing will take measures to safeguard its economy and uphold the common interests of the global community. The U.S. move comes despite Trump's decision to pause planned tariffs on other American trade partners for 90 days, which was met with a sigh of relief by global markets. The situation underscores the escalating trade tensions and the potential for further economic disruption.</p>

            <p>Ksenia Karelina, a dual U.S.-Russian national, has been released by Russia in a prisoner swap, as confirmed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Karelina, who was sentenced to 12 years for treason, was exchanged for Arthur Petrov, a German-Russian national held by the U.S. on charges of exporting sensitive microelectronics. The swap took place in Abu Dhabi and was reportedly negotiated by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and a senior Russian intelligence official, indicating deepening efforts to improve ties between the Trump administration and Moscow.

            <p>Global bond markets experienced a rollercoaster week, with U.S. Treasury yields recovering after a sell-off driven by investor concerns over fiscal outlooks. The U.K. bond market was particularly volatile, with yields on 30-year bonds spiking before tumbling following Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs. Analysts suggest the market sentiment shifted due to the tariff pause, with expectations that trade deals with the U.S. are still possible.

            <p>President Trump's increased tariffs on goods imported from China to the US could significantly raise the prices of popular gadgets like iPhones. Analysts estimate that the cost for a China-made iPhone 16 Pro Max with 256GB storage could surge from $1,199 to $1,999. While Apple has been trying to diversify its supply chains, shifting production from China to other countries like India, it will take time and money to relocate supply chains. The 90-day pause on tariffs offers some relief, but the long-term impact on consumer prices remains uncertain.</p>

The "Frankenjet" project cost $11.7 million, which was $2.8 million less than anticipated, and resulted in $63 million overall in savings for the Department of Defense.

            <p>Fintech stocks, including Affirm and Paypal, experienced volatility as markets reacted to President Trump's tariff pause. Affirm initially led a rally after the tariff news but later faced a pullback. Analysts suggest that while the tariff reprieve offers short-term relief, longer-term risks such as rising hardware costs and macro uncertainty persist. One analyst noted that macro weakness might serve as a tailwind for Affirm if traditional lenders tighten access to credit. The 90-day pause doesn't eliminate the threat of tariffs, and geopolitical risks continue to loom over the fintech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>OpenAI has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging that he has engaged in an "unlawful campaign of harassment" against the company. The lawsuit claims Musk has used various means to harm OpenAI, including press attacks and malicious campaigns on social media. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI but later broke ties, has consistently criticized the company's close alliance with Microsoft. OpenAI is seeking punitive damages and an injunction to prevent Musk from further interfering in its operations.</p>

            <p>Crude oil futures fell more than 4% as President Trump's steep tariffs on China overshadowed his 90-day pause on higher rates for most other countries. U.S. crude oil fell to $56.69 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was down to $62.84 per barrel. Trump's decision to increase tariffs on China, the world's second-largest economy and biggest crude importer, weighed on the market. Analysts believe the chaos is not over, citing the challenges of negotiating with numerous countries simultaneously.</p>

            <p>Major League Baseball owners are contemplating adding a salary cap and a salary floor as the league heads toward a new Collective Bargaining Agreement with players. The MLB Players Association has long been against a salary cap, resulting in a potential lockout in December 2026. The average MLB salary hasn't kept pace with the league's increase in revenue, suggesting reforming MLB's economics could be good for players. The large gaps in spending between teams are evidence of a "massive disparity problem."</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences unveiled genetically modified wolves with traits from long-extinct dire wolves, sparking debate about de-extinction ethics. These "dire wolves" are hybridized modern wolves, gestated in the womb of a domestic dog. The article questions the value of de-extinction and argues the responsibility of caring for the animals used in this research. This piece also argues that the commercial opportunities that could flow from controlling access to brand-new, charismatic animals could be a path toward familiar, profit-driven models of animal exploitation, such as exhibiting animals in zoos.</p>

            <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, but a certificate of deposit (CD) can help, offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. CD's can lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD and they're safe investments, generally coming with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. Short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms right now. A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs, buying some one year, some two years, some three years, etc. (not investment advice)</p>
