          <p>South Korea has reportedly indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and ex-first lady Kim Keon Hee, wife of ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, on Friday. Han faces serious charges including abetting the ringleader of an insurrection, perjury, and falsifying documents, related to Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration in late 2024 that ultimately led to his impeachment. Kim, the first former first lady to be indicted in the country's history, is accused of corruption, stock manipulation, receiving free opinion polls, and accepting luxury gifts from a religious movement for business favors. These legal actions stem from a comprehensive government probe approved by President Lee Jae Myung, targeting the former president's circle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. tariff exemption for package shipments valued under $800, known as the "de minimis" exemption, officially ended on Friday, a permanent change announced by the Trump administration. This policy shift, broadening an earlier cancellation for China and Hong Kong, is set to raise costs and disrupt supply chain models for a range of businesses. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro stated the change would save American lives by restricting narcotics flow and add up to $10 billion in tariff revenues. Critics previously noted the exemption, which had been in place since 1938 and was raised in 2015 to foster e-commerce, had seen a nearly tenfold increase in packages by 2024, facilitating direct-to-consumer models for companies like Shein and Temu.</p>

          <p>The Gulf Coast region, especially New Orleans, is commemorating the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which made its devastating second U.S. landfall on August 29, 2005. This historic Category 3 hurricane caused nearly 1,400 deaths and remains the costliest storm in U.S. history, with damages estimated at $200 billion in today's dollars. The article reflects on the profound and lasting impact, particularly highlighting the complete inundation of the predominantly Black Lower 9th Ward due to multiple levee breaches, which killed many and destroyed thousands of homes. It explores the enduring legacy of this catastrophic event through a series of powerful and evocative photographs.</p>

          <p>UK firms are warning that the termination of the U.S. "de minimis" exemption for parcels valued under $800 is creating significant uncertainty and potential price hikes for their businesses. This new U.S. tax policy, effective Friday, means goods previously exempt will now face tariffs, with UK goods typically incurring a 10% charge. Small businesses, like hand-dyed wool company Nellie and Eve, have already halted U.S. shipments due to unpredictable costs, fearing excessive charges or returns. The Federation of Small Businesses highlights that this change will push up costs and erect new barriers for UK small firms competing globally, forcing some to cease U.S. exports entirely.</p>

          <p>Elderly survivors, known as "comfort women," in China are still awaiting a response from provincial high courts regarding landmark lawsuits filed against the Japanese government. Eight survivors from Hunan province, now averaging 96 years old, demand a formal apology and 2 million yuan (US$276,000) in compensation each for their suffering during World War II. Despite the historical importance, the provincial high courts in Shanxi and Hunan have neither responded nor provided a timeline for when they might take up the lawsuits, nor have they thrown out the cases. Lawyers emphasize that for these plaintiffs, the ongoing fight is not just for restitution but for crucial recognition of their immense suffering before it is too late.</p>

          <p>Florida executed Curtis Windom, 59, on Thursday by lethal injection, marking the state's 11th execution this year, extending its record. Windom was convicted for the 1992 triple murder of his girlfriend, her mother, and a man he claimed owed him money. Despite his daughter and other family members of the victims campaigning against the execution, and filing multiple appeals citing incompetent legal representation and mental health struggles, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal. The execution has sparked further debate on the death penalty, with Floridians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty stating that forgiveness and healing do not come from lethal injection.</p>

          <p>Jim O’Neill, a biotech investor and former speechwriter, has been appointed acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a move expected to align the agency with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial vaccine policy goals. O'Neill, who lacks medical or infectious disease training, previously supported unproven COVID-19 treatments and promoted conspiratorial theories. His appointment follows the contentious firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez, who allegedly resisted "unscientific directives," and has drawn criticism from healthcare professionals and senators concerned about political interference in public health. This shift signals a significant ideological change for the nation's top public health agency.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Biloxi, Mississippi, is still struggling to secure full Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funding to complete critical rebuilding projects, including its pier and a crucial sewage and stormwater system. Mayor Andrew "FoFo" Gilich reports a persistent battle with FEMA, which has denied requests for increased funding, citing a lack of documentation for cost reasonableness. The city needs $111 million for upgrades but FEMA has only offered a fraction of the required amount, leading to project delays. This ongoing issue highlights broader concerns about FEMA's processes and the Trump administration's proposed overhauls, with some former officials warning of undoing post-Katrina reforms.</p>

          <p>California fire investigators are probing whether a prestigious Napa Valley winery, Hundred Acre, played a role in igniting the nearly 7,000-acre Pickett fire, which continues to threaten hundreds of buildings and dozens of wineries. A spokesperson for the Calistoga-based winery confirmed discussions with investigators, who are reportedly examining the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the major blaze. The fire began on August 21 at an address part of the Hundred Acre property. While no structures or vineyards belonging to Hundred Acre have been destroyed, the ongoing investigation highlights the potential liabilities and environmental risks in the region.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its "customer of size" policy, effective January 27, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by travelers who "encroach upon neighboring seats." Under the new policy, refunds will only be issued if the flight has at least one open seat and specific fare class conditions are met. This shift is drawing strong criticism from plus-size advocates, who deem it "heartbreaking" and a reversal of Southwest's inclusive stance. They argue the change will create financial burdens and increase anxiety for plus-size travelers, potentially limiting their ability to fly comfortably and with dignity.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new video footage has found that Israel struck Gaza's Nasser Hospital at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday, not twice as initially reported, killing at least 20 people including five journalists. The analysis identified two staircases hit almost simultaneously in the first wave, and what was thought to be a single later attack was in fact two separate strikes. This updated finding comes as Israel's narrative of the attack has evolved, with Prime Minister Netanyahu expressing regret for a "tragic mishap" and the IDF claiming a Hamas camera was identified. International legal experts suggest the actions may violate international law.</p>

The protesters, including current and former Microsoft, Google, and Oracle workers, demanded that Microsoft sever ties with Israel, following reports that a unit of the Israeli military uses Microsoft's Azure cloud platform for surveillance in Gaza and the West Bank. Microsoft stated the terminations were due to "serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct," including creating safety concerns.

The attack, one of the largest since the 2022 invasion, hit residential buildings and the EU Delegation, drawing condemnation from international leaders.

Investigators found evidence of arson and surveillance video leading to the arrest of the alleged arsonist and a woman. Salazar faces a mandatory minimum of five years and up to 20 years in prison if convicted, with authorities also noting his alleged history of arson and intimidation.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has revealed an international network of spammers, primarily based in Pakistan, profiting from AI-generated images of Holocaust victims on Facebook, a phenomenon termed "AI slop." These creators exploit Meta's content monetization program by posting fake images and fabricated stories, such as prisoners playing violins or babies left on train tracks, to garner engagement. Organizations like the Auschwitz Memorial criticize Meta for allowing the atrocity to be turned into an "emotional game," causing distress to survivors and undermining historical awareness. The spammers often impersonate other entities and target higher-value Western audiences for greater earnings.</p>
