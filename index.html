          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe addressed Alexander Isak's £125m transfer to Liverpool, acknowledging a shift in their relationship after Isak went on "strike" to force the move. Howe emphasized his initial positive relationship with Isak and the mutual benefits both parties experienced during his time at Newcastle. Howe expressed his disappointment at Isak's change in attitude once Liverpool expressed interest, and reiterated the club's desire to retain its key players. The manager also noted Newcastle's recruitment of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa to bolster their attacking options amid striker shortages.</p>

          <p>Following recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace, German politicians are urging increased investment in air defenses for the Bundeswehr. SPD spokesperson Siemtje Möller emphasized the urgent need to expand air defense capabilities, particularly anti-drone systems like the Skyranger. CDU state premier Boris Rhein echoed this sentiment, calling for a German defense guarantee and investment in combat drones. The article also mentions the Bundesliga's return after the international break, with Bayer Leverkusen seeking a fresh start under new coach Kasper Hjulmand after a disappointing season start.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review several cases involving policies enacted by the Trump administration, potentially shaping the limits of presidential power. The court will address the legality of tariffs imposed on U.S. trading partners, testing whether Trump had the authority to enact them under federal emergency powers. Other disputes involve the termination of temporary legal protections for Venezuelan migrants and the use of the Alien Enemies Act for deportations. The court will also consider challenges to Trump's firings of members of independent agencies, potentially impacting the balance of power within the executive branch.</p>

          <p>Despite being a densely populated urban environment, New York City offers surprising refuge for monarch butterflies, a species facing population declines nationwide. The city's parks, gardens, and even small patches of green space provide essential milkweed plants for monarch caterpillars and pesticide-free wildflowers for adult butterflies. Efforts by city gardeners, naturalists, and even "guerilla gardeners" to plant native species are contributing to the conservation of monarchs in the urban landscape. These efforts demonstrate that even small-scale habitat restoration can have a significant impact on wildlife conservation in urban areas.</p>

          <p>A growing number of NFL and UFC athletes are exploring ibogaine, a psychedelic substance, to treat traumatic brain injury, despite its Schedule 1 drug status in the US. An observational study on veterans indicated ibogaine's potential in reducing anxiety, depression, and cognitive challenges associated with TBI. While athletes like Robert Gallery and Tait Fletcher credit ibogaine with improving their mental health, experts emphasize the need for further research and medical supervision due to potential heart problems. Several states are pushing for clinical research into ibogaine, inspired by the positive results seen in veterans.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board released its final report on the 2023 helicopter crash that killed three people in Riverside County, attributing the incident to a lack of communication and an unauthorized descent by one helicopter. The report found that the Skycrane pilot failed to comply with safety procedures and made an aggressive descent, leading to the collision with the Bell helicopter. The report also highlighted that neither helicopter received clear clearance from the group supervisor to enter the fire traffic area. Cal Fire is set to implement new safety measures, including improved pilot training and updated communication protocols.</p>

          <p>Musician Phil Coulter has urged the UK to withdraw from Eurovision 2026 if Israel is allowed to participate, echoing RTÉ's stance due to the conflict in Gaza. Coulter believes musicians have a conscience and sees a double standard in allowing Israel's participation while Russia was excluded in 2022. Dana, an Eurovision winner for Ireland, emphasized Eurovision's purpose as a safe space for unity, not politics. Several other countries are also considering withdrawal depending on the EBU's decision, as RTÉ expresses concern over journalist killings and hostage situations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Health care costs in the United States are soaring, with employer-sponsored health insurance premiums expected to increase significantly. Many employers plan to pass these costs onto their employees through higher paycheck deductions and out-of-pocket expenses. The rising costs are attributed to factors such as new expensive treatments, increased demand for care, and consolidation within the health care industry. This situation highlights the role of employers in determining health care costs for most Americans and the limited bargaining power of workers in negotiating these costs.</p>

          <p>A publicly funded repair shop in Los Angeles, one of the few remaining in the country, provides free musical instrument repairs to students in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The shop, which maintains approximately 120,000 instruments, gained recognition after being featured in the documentary "The Last Repair Shop." Legendary musician Herb Alpert, a former LAUSD student, donated $1 million to the facility, recognizing its importance in providing equitable access to quality instruments for students from low-income backgrounds. The shop plays a crucial role in supporting music education and helping students succeed.</p>

          <p>CBS's new corporate owner, Skydance Media, is taking steps to address concerns from conservative critics, including President Trump, by making adjustments to its news division. The network appointed a conservative ombudsman for CBS News, promised to run full, unedited interviews on a public affairs show, and is considering hiring a news executive known for questioning mainstream media bias. These moves follow a $16 million settlement paid by CBS's previous owner to resolve a lawsuit brought by Trump and regulatory pressure from a Trump appointee. Discussions are underway to acquire The Free Press and give Bari Weiss a news leadership role.</p>

          <p>Germany is undertaking the cleanup of illegally dumped trash in Czechia, consisting of mixed waste and debris from wind turbine blades. The trash was dumped by a German company that misrepresented the waste as recyclable plastic. The CEO of the company and a Czech truck driver have been detained, and the cleanup process has commenced, with the cost being borne by the state of Bavaria. Environmental damage is being assessed, and Czech politicians are calling for a pan-European approach to address cross-border waste dumping.</p>

          <p>U.K. economic growth flatlined in July, according to data published Friday, adding to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' headache ahead of the Autumn Budget. The figure was in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters, and follows a 0.4% expansion in June. In July, weakness was concentrated in production output, which contracted by 0.9%, while services and construction output both inched higher, the U.K.'s Office for National Statistics noted. Economists now expect a slowdown to take hold of the U.K. in the latter half of 2025.</p>

          <p>At a news conference for the Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight, UFC chief Dana White clashed with a reporter over his new role in boxing and questions about the Muhammad Ali Act. White is spearheading a push to amend the act, which does not apply to MMA, allowing the UFC to make their own world titles. Critics argue White's UFC model in boxing would restrict fighters with exclusive contracts, create a monopoly and leaves boxers earning a far smaller share of event revenue. As the reporter pressed White, Alvarez chanted "fight, fight, fight".</p>
