          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) anticipates that disruptions to its online services due to a cyber-attack will persist until July, resulting in an estimated Â£300 million reduction in profits for the year. The cyber-attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments, with online ordering remaining unavailable for nearly a month. M&S chief executive Stuart Machin characterized the incident as a "highly sophisticated and targeted cyber-attack" and said that the company will emerge stronger from the setback. The ransomware attack is believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, a loose collective of online actors, using illicit tools from the cyber-crime service DragonForce.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited House Republicans to advocate for a wide-ranging bill encompassing his domestic agenda, urging party members to unite and overcome their reservations. Despite Trump's entreaties, many Republicans remained unconvinced, leading to Speaker Mike Johnson engaging in negotiations with various factions within the conference. While progress was reported, significant differences persisted, particularly regarding Medicaid reforms and state and local tax deductions (SALT). The bill, which includes extensions of the 2017 tax cuts, increased military spending, and cuts to Medicaid and clean energy subsidies, faces opposition from both conservatives seeking deeper spending cuts and moderates concerned about the impact on their constituents.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo reveals that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner advocated for tax increases to Chancellor Reeves, suggesting measures to raise Â£3bn to Â£4bn annually, though these proposals were not implemented. The memo included proposals such as increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While the Labour Party has already increased taxes on the wealthy through changes to the non-dom tax status, the Conservatives have seized on the memo to accuse Labour of planning further tax increases in the Autumn Budget. Environment Secretary Steve Reed maintained that the cabinet is united behind the government's plan for change.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has been bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed a unique immunity that may hold the key to creating a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that millions of people are bitten by venomous snakes annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Researchers studying Friede's blood aim to synthesize a treatment effective against multiple types of venomous snake bites. Current antivenoms are produced by injecting animals with small amounts of specific venoms to generate antibodies, but a universal antivenom could provide a more accessible and effective solution for snakebite victims worldwide.</p>

          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, has sparked varied reactions, particularly from Maga Catholics who view him with skepticism due to his perceived progressive leanings. Pope Leo's choice of name signals a confrontation with Trumpian nationalism, reminiscent of Leo XIII's challenge to laissez-faire economics and early communist movements. The new pope's agenda includes addressing wars, climate change, inequality, and migration, issues that clash with the Maga worldview's nationalistic and insular approach. While Maga Catholics share concerns about the neglect of working-class interests, their right-wing populism diverges from the Catholic commitment to universality and compassion for the stranger.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo metropolitan government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer in an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning and stay cool amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, allocating 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) for the initiative, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the measure aims to protect residents' lives and daily living in the face of declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving approximately 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months.</p>

          <p>Leanne Lucas, a survivor of the Southport stabbings, is advocating for the use of blunt-tipped kitchen knives as a safer alternative to traditional pointed-tip blades, inspired by her discomfort around knives since the attack. Lucas, who was critically injured in the attack that killed three children, launched the "Let's Be Blunt" campaign to promote a cultural shift towards safer kitchen tools. She notes that cooking has become a trigger for hyper-vigilance and believes blunt-tip knives can significantly reduce the risk of serious injury. While knife crime is on the rise, Lucas hopes to raise awareness and encourage public support for preventing future incidents, drawing parallels to successful public behavior shifts like the ban on indoor smoking.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing criticism for stating that he had never bought rice because his supporters gifted it to him, a remark that resonated poorly with the public facing soaring rice prices. The comment exacerbated public frustration over the government's handling of the rice shortage, which has driven up prices despite the release of emergency stockpiles. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi, a popular former environment minister, as Eto's replacement to mitigate the political fallout. The resignation underscores the political sensitivity of food prices and the importance of addressing consumer concerns in Japan.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for the passage of a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from dueling factions within the party. The House Rules Committee met late into the night to advance the bill, with conservatives demanding deeper spending cuts and moderates opposing changes to Medicaid and the state and local tax deduction (SALT). Trump urged Republicans to support the bill, warning against holdouts, but divisions remain over key provisions. The legislation aims to extend tax cuts, increase military spending, and cut funding for various programs, but its passage is uncertain due to internal disagreements.</p>

          <p>Scientists warn that a 1,000-foot "mega tsunami" could devastate parts of America's West Coast if a major earthquake occurs along the Cascadia subduction zone. A study estimates a 15 percent chance of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake hitting the region within the next 50 years, potentially causing coastal land to sink and triggering massive waves. Cities like Seattle and Portland are at risk, and the scientists emphasize that this event would occur rapidly, leaving little time for adaptation. The research highlights the need for preparedness and mitigation efforts to address this potential natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Manchester United and Tottenham are set to compete in the Europa League final, with both clubs aiming to salvage their seasons with a victory. Experts debate which team has had a worse season, citing Manchester United's self-inflicted wounds and managerial changes versus Tottenham's underperformance and failure to compete for Champions League qualification. While injuries have impacted Tottenham, Manchester United's high spending and poor results have been particularly disappointing. The outcome of the final will significantly influence perceptions of each team's season and the future of their respective managers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that the US export controls on AI chips to China have failed, as Chinese companies are turning to locally-developed technology. Huang noted that these restrictions have spurred China to invest heavily in developing its own semiconductor supply chain, reducing Nvidia's market share from nearly 95 percent to 50 percent. He praised President Trump's understanding that US companies are not the only providers of such technology, while China has condemned the US measures as discriminatory. The situation underscores the complex dynamics of technology competition and the unintended consequences of export controls.</p>

The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations. Thames Water has faced heavy criticism for its performance, including sewage discharges and leaks, and is seeking to reduce its Â£20bn debt pile.</p>

The expert attributes the infestation to readily available food, water, and shelter, urging the public and businesses to avoid leaving food behind and ensure bins are properly managed. The council has removed some planters used by the rats as pathways, but a controlled riddance program may be necessary to address the significant infestation.</p>

While some retailers claim to restrict sales to those over 18, teenagers report easy access. Health professionals express concern about the pouches' high nicotine content and potential oral health impacts, while anti-smoking advocates fear they could lead to cigarette smoking.
