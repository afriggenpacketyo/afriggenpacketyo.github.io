          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is essential for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan, particularly amid geopolitical tensions and de-dollarization discussions. Businesses in Qatar are interested in leveraging Hong Kong's yuan capabilities for joint ventures and investments with China. The trend reflects a broader move by countries and businesses to explore alternatives to the U.S. dollar in international trade, driven by the U.S.'s trade war. This push aligns with China's long-term strategy to internationalize its currency, aiming to reduce risks and establish financial independence amid increasing Sino-American decoupling.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, offering specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. The NHS aims to provide appropriate care in a calm environment, reducing long A&E waits. While some are skeptical of the scheme, citing the difficulty of separating physical and mental health issues, others emphasize the need for proper funding and testing of the model before national rollout.</p>

          <p>The use of facial recognition technology by a private organization, Project N.O.L.A., in the search for escaped inmates in New Orleans has ignited controversy. While authorities claim the technology aided in recapturing one fugitive, critics, including the ACLU and some members of Congress, raise concerns about constitutional and privacy issues. The New Orleans Police Department had paused automated alerts from Project N.O.L.A. due to legal and policy concerns, but used the technology during the manhunt. The debate centers on the balance between public safety and the potential for surveillance and bias inherent in facial recognition systems.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The incident occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, which disrupted contact with the helicopter as it approached the landing site. The Army stated that there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic, but the FAA air traffic controllers aborted the landings as a precaution due to conflicting positional data. The NTSB expressed disappointment that the Army released investigative information through the media before briefing the agency.</p>

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with alternatives as domestic rice prices rise. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price than Japanese-grown rice, reflecting consumer interest in more affordable options. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision is driven by record-high rice prices in Japanese supermarkets, partly due to a poor harvest in 2023, with the average price reaching 4,268 yen per 5 kg, roughly double last year's level.</p>

The ban aims to reduce environmental impact and discourage youth vaping, but some former smokers worry about the accessibility and taste of rechargeable alternatives. Retailers have seen a surge in sales as customers stock up, while others fear a return to smoking cigarettes. The government hopes to reduce environmental impact and cut the number of children and young people vaping, but some believe the ban may be counter-productive.</p>

A symbolic development was Trump's approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel. Akazawa emphasized the importance of economic security issues in the tariff talks and expressed hope for an agreement between leaders next month.

The departures follow criticism of the firm's agreement with Mr. Trump, which was seen as controversial within the legal community. Other law firms chose to sue the administration over similar orders, with some judges striking down Mr. Trump's actions as unconstitutional.</p>

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a Louisiana inmate, was captured after escaping from Tangipahoa Parish Jail for the second time. Johnson, who was awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, and another inmate helped him over the perimeter fence. This incident prompted administrative leave for at least four individuals pending a full review. Johnson had previously escaped from the same jail in May 2024, highlighting security issues and manpower shortages at the facility. His capture comes as authorities continue to search for five inmates who escaped from a jail in New Orleans.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating a plane crash in a San Diego residential neighborhood that resulted in at least four deaths and several injuries. The Cessna 550 private jet crashed near Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport, striking power lines and damaging multiple homes. The NTSB is examining a technical glitch at the airport that knocked out a weather update system and runway lights, though it's unclear if these issues contributed to the crash. Among the victims were employees of Sound Talent Group, including its co-founder. The crash prompted evacuations and a response from the San Diego Humane Society to rescue animals.</p>

The canal is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China, with an estimated investment of 320 billion yuan (US$44.4 billion). Once completed, the canal would connect Jiangxi province, a growing manufacturing hub for electric vehicles with abundant rare earth and copper reserves, to seaports in Zhejiang.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has dramatically curtailed press access inside the Pentagon, citing the need to limit leaks of classified and unclassified information. The new restrictions confine credentialed reporters to a limited area and require escorts for movement within the building. These measures have been criticized as an attack on the freedom of the press, especially after Hegseth ejected several news organizations from their workspaces. The move follows an investigation into multiple leaks, including those related to military plans and Hegseth's use of Signal group chats. The Pentagon Press Association has condemned the restrictions, questioning their effectiveness and transparency.</p>

Kim Jong Un blamed military officials and shipyard operators for the incident, calling it a "serious accident and criminal act."

While artificial intelligence is being explored to improve forecasts, meteorologists say it cannot replace the data collected by weather balloons.

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which is causing problems with his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel, 76, was advised by his doctor to refrain from performing as he undergoes physical therapy. Fans who purchased tickets will be automatically refunded. NPH is a brain condition that occurs when fluid builds up inside or around the brain, disrupting certain brain-related functions. The condition is relatively uncommon and more likely to occur in older people.</p>
