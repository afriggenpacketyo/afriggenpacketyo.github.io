          <p>Former President Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and several European leaders for a high-stakes summit aimed at ending the war with Russia. Trump has publicly asserted that Zelenskyy could end the conflict "almost immediately" by agreeing to cede Crimea permanently and abandon Ukraine's ambitions to join NATO. This meeting follows discussions between Trump and Putin, with European officials attending to support Ukraine's position and safeguard continental security interests amidst the ongoing diplomatic pressure. The summit occurs as both nations continue to exchange long-range drone and missile attacks, resulting in further civilian casualties.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has received a nationwide ban from all UK football stadiums after being arrested for racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. The incident occurred during the opening Premier League match against Liverpool at Anfield, causing a brief halt in play after Semenyo reported the abuse to the referee. Merseyside Police have conditionally bailed the man, with terms including the stadium ban and a restriction on approaching any football venue. Semenyo later posted on social media, expressing gratitude for the solidarity shown by players, fans, and officials in handling the situation professionally.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, reflecting the growing influence of internet and social media culture on the English language. Among the new entries are viral terms such as "skibidi," a nonsensical word from a YouTube series, and "tradwife," a portmanteau for "traditional wife." Other additions capture modern work-life trends, including "mouse jiggler," a device to feign computer activity, and "broligarchy," describing a small group of powerful male tech leaders. Lexical experts at the dictionary note that they only include words they believe demonstrate lasting power and significance in everyday communication.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:05:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system is a strategically flawed and exorbitantly expensive endeavor. The article draws parallels to France's failed Maginot Line, suggesting the system is based on outdated defense concepts and would be easily bypassed by modern threats like hypersonic missiles and drone swarms. With an estimated cost of $175 billion, which the Congressional Budget Office suggests could exceed $500 billion, the author contends the funds are unconscionable amid growing deficits. The piece concludes that such a system offers a false sense of security and would divert critical resources from more effective defense priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researcher Claims to Find Oldest Written Reference to Moses on Ancient Egyptian Inscriptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:00:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American-Israeli researcher, Michael S. Bar-Ron, has proposed a new analysis of 3,800-year-old inscriptions from an ancient Egyptian mining site that may contain the earliest known written reference to Moses. The Proto-Sinaitic etchings, found at Serabit el-Khadim in the Sinai desert, date to between 1800 and 1600 B.C., centuries before the Bible was written. Bar-Ron suggests two phrases translate to "This is from Moses" and "Declaration of Moses," potentially linking the biblical figure to Semitic laborers who resisted the worship of the pagan goddess Ba`alat. If verified through peer review, this discovery would provide the first physical evidence of Moses outside of religious texts.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously considered the last country without a national soccer team, made its historic international debut in a match held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese diaspora community of around 15,000 people, who turned out to enthusiastically support the new team. Despite a 4-0 loss to the US Virgin Islands, the event was celebrated as a major milestone, fostering a sense of pride and representation for the community. The team, which had only five training sessions together, later scored its first-ever goals in a subsequent match, marking a significant moment for the island nation.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick, leading to a potential breakthrough in a cold case from 1967. Authorities recovered the severely deteriorated vehicle and found human remains inside. Using the car's VIN, investigators identified it as belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing nearly 60 years ago. While the remains await formal identification, officials believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family. The fisherman, Brody Loch, described the discovery as "100% luck," expressing hope that it will finally bring closure to the family.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr is scheduled for a closed-door deposition before a House committee to answer questions about his personal involvement in the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death. Barr's direct intervention, including a personal review of jail surveillance footage, was considered highly unusual by Justice Department veterans. His public statements about the video are now being scrutinized after a CBS News analysis of the recently released footage revealed inconsistencies, including whether it conclusively proves no one entered Epstein's cell block. The deposition is part of a renewed congressional inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the controversial death in federal custody.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is navigating the challenge of balancing his socialist ideals with the need to appeal to a broader electorate. The article traces Mamdani's political journey through his deep ties to the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an organization he credits for his success. However, as he gains mainstream traction, courting figures like Elizabeth Warren and meeting with Wall Street leaders, he has moderated some past positions, such as his call to defund the police. The piece explores the internal complexities of the DSA and questions what kind of socialism Mamdani would bring to the city if elected.</p>

          <p>This analytical essay argues that the United States has become a "lawyerly society," overly focused on litigation and regulation, while China has thrived as an "engineering state" prioritizing construction, manufacturing, and technological development. This divergence has left the U.S. economically vulnerable, exemplified by its dependence on China for critical goods like rare-earth magnets. The author contrasts China's rapid infrastructure growth with America's struggles to complete major projects, attributing the U.S. decline to a culture that values procedure over results. While not advocating for the U.S. to adopt China's authoritarian model, the piece calls for a renewed American focus on building and industrial capacity.</p>

          <p>A recent, widely shared column arguing against the use of polling and data in Democratic campaign strategy is critiqued as a dangerous and flawed polemic. The author of this article contends that dismissing empirical data in favor of historical or philosophical readings of politics enables wishful thinking and insulates progressive intuition from any factual challenge. While acknowledging that data isn't everything, the analysis asserts that methods like polling remain the most reliable tools for understanding public opinion and testing political theories. The anti-data argument is framed as an elaborate rationalization for ignoring inconvenient truths, ultimately hindering the Democratic Party's ability to craft winning electoral strategies.</p>

Factors contributing to the rise include climate change, which expands tick habitats and seasons, and increased human development into wildlife areas.

          <p>The first group of critically ill and injured Palestinian children, estimated to be between 30 and 50 individuals, will be brought from Gaza to the United Kingdom for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This marks the first official government operation to evacuate children during the conflict, coordinated by several UK departments. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization facilitating their travel. This action follows a letter from 96 cross-party MPs urging the government to evacuate children at imminent risk of death due to the decimated healthcare system in the region.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate an initial group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment within the next few weeks. This will be the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the conflict, involving the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children, selected based on medical need, will travel with family members through a third country to receive care from the NHS. The move follows pressure from a cross-party group of MPs who urged the government to act without delay to save children at risk due to the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Fintech startup Yieldstreet, which markets itself as giving retail investors access to deals once reserved for the wealthy, is facing scrutiny after numerous real estate projects resulted in massive losses for its customers. An analysis of investor documents shows that customers invested over $370 million in 30 real estate projects that have since recognized $78 million in defaults, with many more expected to face deep or total losses. The company's struggles are attributed to the impact of rising interest rates on projects initiated between 2021 and 2022. Frustrated investors accuse the company of downplaying risks and a lack of transparency about the systemic nature of the failures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre is facing a crucial political test in a by-election for a rural Alberta riding. After losing his own seat in the last general election, Poilievre needs a decisive victory in this conservative stronghold to re-enter the House of Commons and solidify his leadership ahead of a mandatory party review. The race is unusual, featuring a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform. His performance will be closely scrutinized as a measure of his ability to lead the party against Prime Minister Mark Carney's new Liberal government.</p>

          <p>President Trump's emergency declaration for Washington D.C. enters its second week, with hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents on the streets and no clear end date for the operation. Critics, including former police officials and legal experts, argue the crackdown is based on false claims of a crime crisis and liken the situation to a "banana republic police state." The administration defends the action as "bold leadership," claiming over 300 arrests have been made. Tensions are rising between the White House and local D.C. officials, who are resisting what they call a "hostile takeover" of the city's police force.</p>

          <p>Many economists are expressing skepticism about the Trump administration's claim that its widespread tariffs will spark a major U.S. manufacturing revival. Experts argue that the president's erratic and inconsistent trade policies create too much uncertainty for the long-term investment required to build new factories. They contrast this with the previous administration's more targeted industrial policies for specific sectors like semiconductors and electric vehicles. Critics also note that the tariffs raise production costs for domestic manufacturers, potentially reducing their global competitiveness and leading to a net loss of jobs in the sector.

His comments align with growing concerns from other financial experts that investment in AI is moving too quickly and creating pockets of unsustainable valuations. Despite this view, Altman also affirmed his belief that AI is one of the most significant technological developments in a very long time. (not investment advice)</p>

This is part of the EU's "Vision Zero" program, which aims to eliminate road fatalities by 2050.
