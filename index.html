          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1990, passed away at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85. Souter, initially appointed as a Republican, became a key member of the court's liberal wing, often siding with liberal justices on issues such as abortion and church-state relations. He retired in 2009, allowing President Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, to fill his seat. Souter was known for his preference for a quiet life in his home state over the Washington social scene.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that the U.S. might be willing to lower tariffs on China, stating that an "80% Tariff on China seems right!" ahead of trade negotiations. This conciliatory tone comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators in Switzerland. The two nations have been engaged in a tense trade stand-off, with the U.S. imposing tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from China. Analysts anticipate that tariffs may settle around 34% as both sides are open to de-escalation and further negotiation.</p>

          <p>Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers were found guilty of cutting down the Sycamore Gap tree, a landmark next to Hadrian's Wall in northern England. The tree, which stood for around 200 years, was felled in September 2023, causing widespread outrage.

          <p>A rapid analysis by climate scientists has found that the severe storms in the central Mississippi valley in early April, which caused significant death and destruction, were made more likely and intense by burning fossil fuels. The record rainfall was approximately 9% more intense and 40% more likely due to human-caused climate change. Warm ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, exacerbated by climate change, fed the storm's moisture. The study also highlighted the importance of the National Weather Service's forecasting and early warnings in mitigating the disaster's impact.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, has launched a "rapid-response website" to counter what he describes as "right-wing misinformation" about the state and President Trump. The launch comes as a new poll indicates that over half of California voters believe Newsom is more focused on his presidential ambitions than on addressing issues in California. Newsom's campaign touts California's economic strength and progress in areas like clean energy, while the website aims to defend the state against Republican criticisms.</p>
