            <p>Nadine Menendez, the wife of former New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez, was convicted on all 15 counts related to a bribery scheme involving her husband. The charges include accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors benefiting the Egyptian government and personal enrichment. Menendez faces sentencing on June 12, while her husband, already convicted and sentenced to 11 years, resigned from his Senate seat after his own conviction. The case highlights the consequences of placing personal interests above public service, as stated by Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky.</p>

            <p>AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI are offering free or discounted access to their premium chatbots for college students, reminiscent of the "Millennial lifestyle subsidy" of the 2010s.

While this approach incurs significant costs for AI companies, it could lead to long-term user acquisition and future revenue streams.

            <p>A federal court in Denver heard arguments regarding the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants. Immigrants' rights groups argue that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is insufficient and violates due process rights. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network highlighted that many detainees lack legal counsel and face language barriers. The case raises concerns about the erosion of civil liberties and the potential for abuse of power under the rarely-used wartime law, which was last invoked during World War II.</p>

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has also cautioned companies against using terms like “autonomous driving” in promoting existing systems, as most available systems require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel.
