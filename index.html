          <p>President Trump stated that Apple will face a tariff of 25% or more for iPhones manufactured outside the United States, specifically mentioning China and India. This announcement led to a drop in Apple's stock price in premarket trading. Analysts estimate that producing iPhones in the U.S. could significantly increase the cost, potentially raising the price to $3,500 per device. Trump's stance reflects his broader policy of encouraging domestic manufacturing through tariffs, but the feasibility of moving iPhone production to the U.S. remains questionable due to cost implications and existing supply chains.

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security revoked the university's ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit argues that the administration's actions are a violation of the law and retaliatory for Harvard's refusal to surrender academic independence. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned the move as unlawful and unwarranted, stating it endangers the futures of thousands of students and scholars. The university is seeking a court order to halt the revocation, which impacts over 6,800 international students, comprising more than 27% of Harvard's student body.</p>

          <p>Recent claims of detecting potential signs of life on exoplanet K2-18b are being challenged by three independent analyses. Astronomers initially suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a molecule linked to life on Earth, in K2-18b's atmosphere. However, the new studies find no compelling evidence for this molecule, attributing the initial findings to faint noise in the data. While the debate continues, scientists emphasize the difficulties in observing distant planets and the importance of using sophisticated tools like the James Webb Space Telescope to analyze exoplanet atmospheres. The ongoing research aims to clarify the composition of K2-18b's atmosphere with more extensive data.</p>

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee stated that President Trump's tariff threats have introduced uncertainty, making it more challenging for the Federal Reserve to adjust interest rates. Goolsbee indicated that the Fed will likely remain cautious while assessing the impact of trade policies on inflation and employment. He expressed concern that tariffs could lead to stagflation, which would be a difficult situation for the central bank to manage. Despite the current uncertainty, Goolsbee remains optimistic about long-term economic growth, but acknowledges that the Fed's actions will depend on how trade policies affect the economy.

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans could significantly impact the electric vehicle (EV) market by repealing subsidies and incentives for battery manufacturing, EV purchases, and charging stations. The bill aims to use the saved funds for tax cuts, primarily benefiting high-income households and businesses. Analysts predict that the rollback of subsidies would make electric vehicles more expensive, potentially slowing their adoption in the United States and widening the gap with China and Europe. Environmentalists also warn that the legislation could lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions and dirtier urban air.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, of siding with Hamas and being on the "wrong side of humanity." This accusation followed the deadly shooting of Israeli embassy staffers in Washington and criticism from the three countries regarding Israel's military actions in Gaza. Netanyahu blamed a UN official's claim about baby deaths in Gaza for inciting the attack in Washington. UK officials defended their support for Israel's right to self-defense within international law while also emphasizing the need for aid to reach suffering people in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, a New York Times article examines the limited progress in nationwide police reform. Despite states and cities enacting new policies, data suggests minimal impact on accountability or police killings, which have risen since 2019. The Trump administration has dropped efforts to oversee police departments, and lawmakers have not fully embraced proposed changes. The article also highlights that racial disparities in police killings persist, and addressing the root causes requires more than just tweaking department guidelines and training.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board critiques the Republican domestic policy bill, arguing that it would cut Medicaid and deny health care to millions of Americans. The bill proposes adding work requirements to Medicaid, which would strip benefits from working-age adults without children who cannot prove they work at least 80 hours a month. This change is projected to cause 7.7 million Americans to lose health insurance by 2034. The editorial board argues that such work requirements do not effectively increase workforce participation and primarily serve to deprive eligible individuals of necessary health care.</p>

Researchers measured 134 clownfish monthly over six months and found a small but significant reduction in their length. The study suggests that being smaller may help clownfish cope with heat stress, as those that shrank had a higher chance of survival. This adaptation adds complexity to understanding the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems, highlighting the rapid and flexible responses of some species to environmental changes.</p>
