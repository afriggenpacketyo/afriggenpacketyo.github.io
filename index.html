          <p>A sudden lightning strike at an outdoor archery range in Jackson Township, New Jersey, resulted in the death of a 61-year-old man and injuries to 14 others, including children. The incident occurred during a children's competition when, according to a witness, the "earth exploded" without any prior sign of a storm. This event is one of several recent lightning-related incidents in the Tri-State Area, prompting a message of prayer from Governor Phil Murphy. The tragic accident highlights the unpredictable danger of lightning even in seemingly clear weather.</p>

          <p>An apparent Israeli military strike hit the Holy Family Church compound in Gaza City, resulting in the deaths of two people and injuring several others, including the parish priest. The church was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, both Christian and Muslim, at the time of the incident. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the attack on innocent civilians, and Pope Leo XIV renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire. The Israel Defense Forces stated it is reviewing the circumstances of the event and regrets any harm caused to civilians or religious sites.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate passed a rescissions package to claw back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The bill, passed by a narrow 51-48 vote, is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to reduce government spending. An amendment to protect funding for the PEPFAR HIV/Aids program was successful, but measures to save aid and public broadcasting funds were rejected. The legislation now returns to the House for a final vote before a Friday deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has been conducting a series of large-scale military exercises, seemingly in direct response to Taiwan's annual Han Kuang war games. The Eastern Theatre Command released details of naval aviation nighttime flight training and simulated dogfights, timed to coincide with Taiwan's largest-ever drills. These maneuvers are interpreted as a significant escalation of pressure from Beijing, demonstrating coordinated, multi-force operations. The drills aim to test and showcase the PLA's combat readiness and tactical capabilities in the region.</p>

          <p>Following renewed and lethal Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea, some foreign policy experts are urging the Trump administration to provide support to Yemen's legitimate government and the Southern Transitional Council. The call to action suggests that a U.S.-backed ground force could counter the Iran-sponsored group and secure vital shipping lanes, as a previous halt in U.S. military action appears to have been violated by the Houthis. The State Department has condemned the recent attacks, which have caused deaths and environmental risks, while reaffirming support for Israel's right to self-defense against Houthi aggression.</p>

Scientists recommend a multi-pronged approach to breaking the habit, including creating physical distance from the device, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. For severe cases, professional help through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can address the root causes of the addiction and retrain behaviors for long-term health benefits.</p>

          <p>The average cost for six weeks of summer holiday club childcare in the UK has risen to £1,076 per child, placing a significant financial burden on working parents. According to the children's charity Coram, prices have increased by up to 13% in some regions due to high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run options. Many families struggle with the upfront costs, as government benefits are paid in arrears, and find limited availability, especially for older children and those with special needs. This situation highlights the year-round challenge of affordable childcare for working families.</p>

          <p>At the request of former President Trump, Texas Republicans are planning to redraw the state's congressional map in a bid to gain up to five additional seats for their party. This mid-decade redistricting is a high-risk strategy that involves spreading Republican voters thinner, potentially making some GOP-held districts more competitive. Critics and watchdog groups argue the move is an undemocratic effort to blunt the growing political influence of the state's non-white population. The plan is likely to face significant legal challenges, with opponents claiming it would be impossible to achieve without discriminating against minority voters.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent dissenting opinions from the U.S. Supreme Court's three liberal justices—Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ketanji Brown Jackson. It argues that their writings are not just routine disagreements but a clear message that the conservative majority is no longer operating within the traditional bounds of law and precedent. The dissents increasingly use pointed language to accuse the majority of power grabs, complicity in wrongdoing, and disregarding facts to achieve ideological ends. This shift suggests the liberal wing believes the court's legitimacy is at risk, moving from collegial disagreement to urgent warnings about its direction.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government is facing a severe crisis, now operating as a de facto minority after two parties left his coalition, leaving him with only 50 of 120 parliament seats.

With popular support for his coalition already low and pressure mounting from both the public and the U.S., Netanyahu is in a precarious position, likely headed toward new elections in early 2026.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, even as the company experienced a decline in sales volume in North America. The food and beverage giant's organic revenue grew 2.1%, though overall volume for its food products fell. To counter softer domestic demand, the company is focusing on cost-cutting measures, improving in-store execution, and investing in popular product categories like protein-fortified snacks. Despite the mixed performance, PepsiCo reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, signaling confidence in its strategic adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

These specific bombs have been identified in multiple Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that resulted in the deaths of children and other civilians. The report details 24 cases where the GBU-39 was deployed in attacks on sites where displaced families were sheltering, often without warning. The findings have led the UN rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories to call for corporate accountability for "profiting from genocide."</p>

This continued decline, which is well below the population replacement level of 2.1, puts future pressure on the country's economic sustainability, pension systems, and healthcare services.

Analysts suggest this cooling labor market increases the likelihood of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England in August.

          <p>The Trump administration's overhaul of the federal student loan system is raising concerns among consumer advocates that many borrowers will face unaffordable monthly payments. The popular SAVE repayment plan is now defunct, and a new bill will eventually limit new borrowers to just two repayment options, one of which has significantly higher scheduled payments. Advocates warn that eliminating more generous income-driven plans will leave many individuals with no manageable options, increasing their risk of default. The changes mark a significant departure from the previous administration's approach to managing student debt.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Kenneth Roth explores the paradoxical idea that Donald Trump may be uniquely positioned to influence the Israeli government's actions in Gaza. It argues that Trump is less susceptible to traditional political pressures and is primarily driven by self-interest and a desire for accolades, like a Nobel Peace Prize. The author suggests that appealing to Trump's ego and framing a resolution to the conflict as a personal victory could persuade him to use his leverage over Netanyahu. This approach could potentially achieve a ceasefire and a path toward a two-state solution, something other presidents have failed to do.</p>

Through high-speed videography and CT scans, scientists found the fruit ripens under high internal pressure and orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle. When disturbed, it shoots its seeds at nearly 30 miles per hour, launching them up to 40 feet away. The seeds are also coated in an incredibly strong, slimy adhesive, which could inspire new material science applications, from soft robotics to advanced glues.</p>
