            <h2>UK Newspaper Front Pages Highlight Misogyny Surge in Schools and Extended Pub Hours</h2>

            <p>Saturday's UK newspapers feature a range of stories, including a report in The Guardian about a surge in misogyny and racism in schools attributed to students emulating figures like Donald Trump and Andrew Tate. The Times covers the UN's endorsement of the government's plan to send rejected asylum seekers to "return hubs" in the Balkans. The Daily Mail focuses on the union membership of Keir Starmer's ministers and an interview with Kemi Badenoch about her cousin's suicide. The Daily Star celebrates extended pub hours for VE Day, while The Telegraph reports on Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance on maintaining trade ties with China. Reeves believes it would be foolish for the UK to disengage with the world's second-largest economy.</p>

            <p>China is instructing its museums to promote ethnic unity and counter what it deems "wrong historical views," according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums are discouraged from portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities. Instead, museums should emphasize the "China story" using archaeological findings, portraying the country as "diverse but unified." This initiative aims to cultivate a sense of community and overall development of the Chinese nation by ensuring every cultural relic and historical narrative fits within this framework. The Sanxingdui Museum has already implemented a course titled "Viewing Chinese Civilisation from Sanxingdui."</p>

            <p>US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen, controlled by the Houthi movement, have reportedly killed at least 74 people and wounded 171, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military stated the strikes aimed to degrade the Houthis' economic power and restrict their access to fuel and revenue, while the Houthi-led government condemned the attack as a "war crime," claiming the terminal was a civilian facility. Thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to protest the strikes, and Iran's foreign ministry also condemned the attacks. The US military claims the objective was to degrade the Houthis, who continue to exploit and bring great pain upon their fellow countrymen.</p>

            <p>After Harvard University publicly rejected a series of authoritarian demands from Trump administration officials, one official allegedly attempted to retract the letter, claiming it was sent by mistake. The original letter demanded Harvard discontinue diversity efforts, limit student protests, install right-wing faculty, and spy on international students. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned the demands as an infringement on the university's independence and constitutional rights. The Trump administration has since frozen Harvard's public funding and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status, escalating the conflict.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump posted an image on Truth Social that appeared to be a digitally altered photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's hand, claiming he has an MS-13 tattoo. Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father, was deported to El Salvador, despite court orders demanding the Trump administration facilitate his return to the United States. The administration claims he is a gang member, although officials initially admitted his deportation was an administrative error. Social media users have expressed doubt about the authenticity of the image, suggesting it was Photoshopped, while images of Abrego Garcia's hand on his wife's TikTok account do not show "MS-13" spelled out.</p>

A U.S. District Judge denied the request, stating it was beyond his authority, while requests to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit are pending.

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom issued clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home and became a minister in prison. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation, following similar actions to help immigrants. Newsom also offered a posthumous pardon to Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient who faced drug charges after returning home with PTSD.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a prison in El Salvador. The order does not rule on the merits of the inquiry but gives the petitioners a deadline to reply to the government. Boasberg had found probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when it defied his order to return the deportation flights to the U.S.</p>

            <p>US bond markets have experienced unusual volatility, with bond yields rising sharply and bond prices falling, signaling a loss of investor confidence in the US economy. The uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on the US economy has led investors to demand higher returns for buying government bonds. Higher bond yields can lead to increased borrowing costs for households and businesses, potentially slowing economic growth. The bond market reaction has drawn comparisons to Liz Truss's mini-Budget in the UK, raising concerns about a potential risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

Many details shared in the files were already known, with limited redactions for privacy. Additional files related to the assassination were discovered and are being processed for release. Robert F.

            <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists reveals that major rice-producing countries in South and Southeast Asia are suffering from severe cadmium contamination in their soil. The research, published in Science, indicates that up to 1.4 billion people worldwide are affected by toxic heavy metal pollution. The affected regions are crucial to global food security but face increased risks of kidney damage, bone disorders, and respiratory diseases. Cadmium, a carcinogen, is most prevalent in the world's major rice-producing regions, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Thailand.</p>

            <p>A Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" as a biological woman has sparked contrasting reactions, with some calling it a victory for common sense and others describing it as devastating. The ruling provides clarity on the Equality Act, stating that the term "woman" refers to a biological woman, excluding biological males, even with gender recognition certificates. This impacts women-only spaces, such as changing rooms and refuges. The ruling has raised concerns about the rights and inclusion of transgender people, leading to uncertainty and debate.</p>

The Trump administration maintains that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13, despite orders from the Supreme Court to facilitate his return.
