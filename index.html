          <p>Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, RedTube, and YouPorn, has temporarily blocked access to its sites in France to protest new regulations requiring age verification for users. The French government is implementing a standard that requires porn sites to verify users are 18 or older using credit cards or government-issued IDs. Aylo argues that age verification should be done on devices rather than websites, citing privacy concerns and ineffectiveness. France's digital regulator reports that approximately 2.3 million minors in the country access porn websites monthly, representing 12% of total users. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been temporarily spared from President Donald Trump's executive order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%.

However, the UK could face the increased tariff if the ECD is not implemented or if the US determines the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the agreement. Uncertainty remains regarding the timing and final tariff rates, potentially impacting UK steel exports to the US. </p>

          <h2>Oreo Maker Sues Aldi Over 'Copycat' Packaging in the US</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mondelēz International, the maker of Oreo cookies, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi in the US, accusing the supermarket chain of copying the packaging of its snacks. Mondelēz alleges that Aldi's packaging is similar enough to deceive consumers and capitalize on the company's brand recognition. The lawsuit includes side-by-side comparisons of Mondelēz's products and Aldi's versions. Aldi UK has emphasized that it is a separate business and not involved in the lawsuit. </p>

          <p>Benito Flores, a 70-year-old retired welder, built a tree house to resist eviction from a state-owned home he had illegally occupied. Flores, along with others, seized vacant homes owned by Caltrans five years ago to protest the homelessness crisis in Los Angeles. He fortified the front door of the duplex and retreated to the tree house in the backyard. The state allowed Flores and others to remain legally and pay rents far below market rates for two years. </p>
