          <p>Oil prices fell after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no casualties, easing fears of escalating Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil prices decreased by 2.85% to $66.57 per barrel, and Brent crude fell by 2.77% to $69.50. Investors' optimism that the conflict would de-escalate grew after President Trump acknowledged early notice of the strike, preventing loss of life, and called for peace, suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy may be in play, according to analysts. The market's reaction indicates a belief that tensions will subside following the initial U.S. response. Optimism is further fueled by Trump's call for peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's control over rare earth exports is increasing global reliance on its supply chains, while China has become reliant on rare earth supplies from Myanmar. Myanmar accounted for 57% of China's rare earth imports last year, including heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium, vital for high-tech manufacturing. These elements are extracted through environmentally damaging methods in Myanmar, replacing closed operations in China due to stricter regulations. However, Myanmar's unstable political situation, particularly in Kachin State, poses supply chain risks, with armed groups seizing mining sites, leading to supply disruptions and price spikes.</p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is impacting much of the eastern United States, bringing record-high temperatures and prompting extreme heat alerts for over 150 million Americans. The National Weather Service warns of dangerous conditions due to light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. The heat wave is caused by a stationary heat dome trapping heat and humidity, with heat indexes already exceeding 100¬∞F in several cities. Experts emphasize the danger of early-season heat waves as bodies are not yet acclimated, advising people to stay indoors, hydrate, and avoid strenuous activities.</p>

The welfare reform bill, called the Universal Credit and Personal Independence Payment Bill, includes proposals to make it harder for disabled people with less severe conditions to claim personal independence payment.

Justice Sotomayor dissented, criticizing the decision as a gross abuse of the Court's discretion, while a Homeland Security official praised the ruling as a victory for American safety and security.

          <p>Following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, Republican lawmakers lauded President Trump's negotiating skills and leadership. Democrats, however, appeared to withhold their congratulations, with some raising concerns about the legality and constitutionality of the U.S. military involvement. Republicans emphasized Trump's ability to achieve peace through strength, while Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned the president's unilateral decision to engage in military action without congressional approval. The ceasefire announcement followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment sites.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries they are not from, including conflict-ridden areas like South Sudan. This decision pauses a ruling by a Boston-based federal judge who stated that immigrants deserve a meaningful opportunity to claim they would face torture, persecution, or death if removed to certain countries. The court ruling coincided with Donald Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which he dubbed the "12 DAY WAR."</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in New York are concluding their case in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who is accused of using his influence to facilitate sex trafficking and conceal his crimes. While Combs admitted to domestic violence, he pleaded not guilty to the charges, which rely on laws aimed at mob bosses. The prosecution called over 30 witnesses, including ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura and rapper Kid Cudi, to testify about Combs's alleged abuse and coercion. Legal experts suggest the testimony presents a compelling case, but a conviction on all counts remains uncertain due to potential vulnerabilities in the prosecution's arguments.</p>
