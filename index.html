            <p>At WrestleMania, John Cena secured his place in wrestling history by winning the WWE Championship for a record-breaking 17th time, surpassing Ric Flair. The victory over Cody Rhodes was aided by a surprise appearance from rapper Travis Scott. This WrestleMania marked the first to be broadcast live on Netflix, reaching millions of subscribers, as part of a 10-year deal. WWE also announced its acquisition of Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide, expanding its reach into Mexico, though the fans are more excited about the in-ring action.</p>

            <p>China has cautioned other nations against yielding to U.S. pressure in trade negotiations amid President Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs.

            <p>El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the US and imprisoned in El Salvador in exchange for the release of an equal number of political prisoners. Bukele appealed directly to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, mentioning nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including US citizens, as part of the proposed swap. Maduro has condemned the US deportation of Venezuelans to El Salvador, describing it as "kidnapping" and a "massive abuse" of human rights.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.

The messages were sent the same day Hegseth shared similar operational details in a separate Signal chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, sparking widespread concern over how senior officials handle sensitive military information.</p>

JPMorgan expects President Donald Trump's tariff blitz to yield "some deals" between the US and its trade partners, but says tax rates will still multiply in size.

The show expands on side characters and subplots, but the plot detours feel awkwardly inserted. The season explores fractured bonds and the cyclical nature of violence, but the show presents examples of undiluted pain, becoming a punishing watch. While subsequent episodes include moments of ingenuity, the show's limited imagination becomes more glaring, focusing on the characters' anguish and misery.</p>

The author suggests that China is digging in for a long fight and could use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact. However, the real key is for China to resolve its own economic weaknesses. The US has moved in the opposite direction – imposing increasingly strict export controls, particularly on advanced technology.</p>
