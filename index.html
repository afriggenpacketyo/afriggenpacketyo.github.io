          <p>Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes is reportedly considering a lucrative offer to join Saudi Pro-League club Al-Hilal, with his representatives already in discussions with the club. While Fernandes remains committed to his responsibilities as captain, he has not guaranteed his future with Manchester United, leading to speculation about his departure. Manchester United is said to be relaxed about the situation, knowing that selling Fernandes could provide funds to reshape the squad. Fernandes has been a key player for Manchester United, but former skipper Roy Keane has criticized his lack of discipline.</p>

          <p>Mark Twain's assertion that travel eradicates prejudice is challenged by current global events, despite record levels of international tourism. The rise of nationalism, conflicts, and protectionism suggests that travel has not fostered international cooperation as hoped. Many tourists remain detached from local realities, and international trade has not prevented bigotry. While tourism promotion is a strategy for some governments, evidence suggests that travel alone is insufficient to combat prejudice.</p>

          <p>Alpine communities in Switzerland's Lötschental valley are preparing for potential evacuation following a massive landslide triggered by the collapse of the Birch Glacier. The collapse sent millions of cubic meters of ice, rock, and mud into the valley, blocking the River Lonza and causing water levels to rise. Authorities are concerned that the blocked river could dislodge the mass and impact communities downstream.

While the UK has a deal to reduce car tariffs and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, it has not yet been implemented.

Saltmarshes capture carbon in the soils, making them as important for climate mitigation as trees. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, with many drained for agriculture.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun debating legislation that would allow married couples to keep different surnames for the first time in 28 years. Despite growing public support, passage of the bills submitted by opposition parties is unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains reluctant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is required to enable couples to keep different family names, with most women currently abandoning their maiden names.</p>
