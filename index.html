          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 mark, a level not seen since March, as investors seek refuge from stock market volatility and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency has shown resilience, decoupling from risk assets and outperforming gold in April. Analysts suggest that breaking the $93,000 resistance level would require a significant catalyst, such as Federal Reserve easing or tariff deals. While trading volumes remain light, long-term holders and strategic buying are supporting bitcoin's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's persistent criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has sparked concerns about his intentions to influence monetary policy. Economists suggest that even firing Powell might not guarantee the rate cuts Trump desires, as the FOMC could still vote against his wishes. Dismantling the Fed's independence could trigger a market backlash, with a falling dollar and rising long-term rates.

          <p>Steven Levitsky, a Harvard professor who studies democratic decline, offers a bleak outlook on American democracy under President Trump. Levitsky argues that the Trump administration has already inflicted severe damage, asserting that the U.S. is no longer functioning as a democratic regime. His analysis focuses on the erosion of democratic norms and institutions, raising concerns about the future of American governance. The professor's assessment underscores the challenges facing American democracy in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Tesla is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings report, with investors closely monitoring the company's performance amidst market concerns. The company is expected to report a slight revenue decline compared to the same quarter a year earlier. Investors are particularly focused on future prospects due to tariff-related concerns and CEO Elon Musk's ties to the Trump administration, which have negatively impacted the stock price. Tesla's recent delivery decline and Musk's political engagements have added to the uncertainty surrounding the company.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs. Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Chobani are committing significant investments to build and expand U.S. factories. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary motivation, the White House touts these moves as supporting job creation on home soil. Economists remain skeptical that tariffs alone are sufficient to spur strategic shifts in manufacturing locations.</p>

          <p>Chevron CEO Mike Wirth states that the company is not seeing indications of an imminent U.S. recession, despite concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on oil demand. While growth may be slowing, Chevron is not altering its capital spending plans in response to dropping oil prices. Wirth anticipates that U.S. onshore oil production could pull back if prices hit $60 per barrel. Chevron expects a limited direct impact from tariffs, but is monitoring the broader macroeconomic effects on growth and global trade.</p>
