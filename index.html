            <p>South Carolina executed Mikal Mahdi by firing squad for the murder of an off-duty police officer, marking the second time the state has used this method in recent weeks. Mahdi chose the firing squad over lethal injection or the electric chair. This is the fifth execution in South Carolina in less than eight months as the state resumes executions after a 13-year pause. The execution has sparked renewed debate about capital punishment and the methods used.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must attempt to release a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The justices declined to block a lower court's order to "facilitate" Garcia's return, but also noted the judge may have exceeded her authority. Garcia, alleged to be a gang member, was deported to El Salvador's notorious Cecot prison under an arrangement between the two countries. A judge has demanded daily updates on the efforts to bring Garcia back.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering taking control of a major British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, which is at risk of imminent closure. MPs have been called back from their Easter break to pass emergency legislation to keep the Chinese-owned site operating. The plant, which employs 2,700 people, is the last in the UK capable of producing virgin steel. The company says the plant continues to lose money despite significant investment, citing market conditions and transition costs.</p>

He stresses that democracy can't be taken for granted and that it's not like adulthood, a stage you reach that you don't leave.</p>

The decision sides with the Trump administration’s claim that a short memo written by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, which stated Khalil’s “beliefs and associations” were counter to foreign policy interests, is sufficient evidence to remove a lawful permanent resident from the United States.</p>
