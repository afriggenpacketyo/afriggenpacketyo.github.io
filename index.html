          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:50:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is exploring a knowledge test for individuals to qualify as accredited investors, allowing access to private market assets like venture capital and hedge funds. This initiative aims to enhance investor protection, as current accreditation relies on wealth thresholds set in the 1980s, which many experts deem insufficient given the complexity and higher risks of these investments. Designing an effective test is challenging, with concerns about assessing true financial sophistication and understanding the unique illiquidity and valuation issues of private markets. The move comes amid a broader push to make private assets more accessible, but also highlights the need for robust safeguards against potential financial losses for less knowledgeable investors.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke lost his libel case against The Guardian, which had published multiple stories in 2021 alleging he used his industry power for sexual assault and harassment. The judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on grounds of truth and public interest, finding the articles' meanings "substantially true." The court also deemed Clarke an unreliable witness and rejected his conspiracy claim, stating over 20 witnesses provided credible evidence against him. This verdict is a significant victory for investigative journalism and the women who came forward with their experiences.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, announced an immediate halt to issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers, citing concerns for American lives and the livelihoods of domestic truckers. The State Department confirmed this pause is for a comprehensive review of screening and vetting protocols, including English proficiency, following recent deadly accidents linked to foreign drivers' language abilities. This move occurs despite a significant shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. and is supported by the American Trucking Association, which calls for stricter entry-level training standards. The administration is also reviewing over 55 million existing U.S. visas for potential violations.</p>

Wu Zeke, deputy director of the parade office, confirmed that a large proportion of the domestically made systems in active service will be appearing for the first time. The development of a robust nuclear triad ensures a retaliatory "second-strike" capability, even if parts of the force are destroyed in a first strike. This event, expected to be Beijing's largest military parade, signifies China's advancing military capabilities and strategic defense posture.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a U.N.-backed authority, has officially declared famine in Gaza City, warning it will likely spread to other southern cities without a ceasefire and increased aid. This marks the first official declaration of famine in the Middle East, with over half a million people facing catastrophic starvation conditions. Israel immediately rejected the assessment, reiterating claims of no famine and accusing the IPC of bias, despite aid organizations reporting systematic obstruction of humanitarian supplies. The IPC's criteria for famine include extreme food lack in 20% of households, 30% acute malnutrition in young children, and high daily mortality rates due to starvation.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency due to Hurricane Erin, which is expected to bring coastal flooding, rip currents, and gale-force winds to the Atlantic coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Although weakening, the first Atlantic hurricane of the season still poses a significant threat, with storm surges up to a meter possible in states like Rhode Island and Virginia, as well as Canadian provinces. The National Hurricane Center emphasized the storm's large size, with hurricane-force winds extending far from its center, prompting beach and road closures. This event highlights concerns about an above-average hurricane season, intensified by warmer sea temperatures linked to climate change.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised its previous directive concerning stray dogs in Delhi, now allowing non-aggressive, non-rabid strays to be released after vaccination and sterilization, instead of being confined to shelters. The court mandated dedicated areas for feeding stray dogs and banned feeding them in public spaces, while requiring rabid or aggressive dogs to be sheltered. This modification follows widespread protests from animal welfare groups who advocated for humane solutions over mass confinement, citing concerns about overcrowding and culling. The ruling is a balanced approach to managing India's large stray dog population and high rabies-related deaths.</p>

In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed the city was "SAFE AGAIN" with no murders this week, but warned of federal intervention if the mayor did not comply. This follows previous orders directing the mayor to use the Metropolitan Police for federal purposes and mobilizing the D.C. National Guard to address crime.

          <p>Canada is being forced to fundamentally reevaluate its defense strategy, traditionally reliant on the U.S., due to concerns over potential American aggression under a second Trump administration and weakening international institutions. Experts suggest Canada is ill-prepared for self-defense, facing a "snack" scenario against a powerful neighbor. The article proposes adopting a "whole society defense" model, similar to Finland's, which mobilizes all national institutions to make conquest too costly for an aggressor. This shift requires Canada to overcome its historical peace-loving nature and significantly boost military spending and readiness, fostering national unification to confront looming global chaos and internal divisions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unilaterally terminated union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, following a federal appeals court ruling that overruled an injunction. Labor leaders, including the AFGE president, view this as a "test bed" for broader attacks on union rights across the U.S., warning it threatens the country's democracy and worker protections. The Department of Veterans Affairs and EPA contracts have been cancelled, with officials citing national security or efficiency, though critics argue it will degrade patient care and workplace safety.

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to roll back government incentives for electric vehicles (EVs) and his public disdain for them, the global shift towards cheaper EVs is unlikely to be halted. While U.S. EV sales have slowed and incentives are set to expire, other countries, like China, are rapidly adopting electric and hybrid cars, backed by subsidies. Ford's recent $5 billion investment in a new EV platform for a $30,000 pickup truck signals a commitment to making affordable electric options available by 2027. This move, driven by market demand and global environmental regulations, suggests that once EVs become more cost-effective than gasoline cars, their widespread adoption will accelerate, regardless of domestic political headwinds.

However, experts caution that a continued decline could lead to significant labor shortages and negative economic effects, especially given America's falling birth rate.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is increasingly employing aggressive, meme-driven social media tactics, mirroring former President Trump's playbook, to counter his political opposition. These viral images, ranging from Photoshopped abs to "MAGA Tears" mugs, aim to bypass rational thought and project a larger-than-life image, while offering plausible deniability as parody. This strategy, seen as fighting fire with fire, positions Newsom as a combative figure willing to engage on Trump's preferred digital battlegrounds. While his governing record and "left coast liberal" image might be hurdles, his perceived toughness and media savvy could resonate with voters in a political landscape increasingly valuing combat skills over traditional accomplishments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economic experts are strongly criticizing President Trump's reliance on tariffs as a primary tax base, arguing they are inefficient, arbitrary, and unstable. The article highlights a fundamental conflict: tariffs cannot simultaneously protect domestic producers and reliably generate significant revenue, as high protectionist tariffs reduce imports and thus revenue. Furthermore, tariffs disproportionately tax capital inputs, making investment more expensive and hindering productivity and wages, unlike broad-based consumption taxes. Economists contend that tariffs lack predictability, invite political favoritism through carve-outs, and raise only a fraction of government spending, ultimately undermining American prosperity rather than enhancing it.

          <p>A recent case of the plague in South Lake Tahoe, believed to be contracted from an infected flea, has led experts to explain the disease's continued presence and current dangers. While the plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, primarily affects rodents and is rarely contracted by humans today, it remains a serious illness. Historically devastating, it is now treatable with antibiotics, though it hasn't been eradicated due to its persistence in mammalian populations spread by vectors like fleas. Public health officials emphasize that with timely treatment, there is little to fear, but awareness is crucial, especially in rural and wilderness areas where infected rodents may reside.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang confirmed discussions with the U.S. government regarding the potential export of a new, more advanced AI chip, the B30A, to China. This comes amidst U.S. concerns about advanced American chips being used for Chinese military applications and previous restrictions on Nvidia's H20 chip. While Nvidia hopes to sell more advanced technology, Chinese authorities have recently raised security concerns about the H20 and reportedly urged local companies against using Nvidia chips, impacting the company's production. Huang argues that allowing sales helps ensure China's AI is built on American technology, preventing domestic tech giants from filling the void. (not investment advice)</p>
