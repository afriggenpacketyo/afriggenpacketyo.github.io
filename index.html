          <p>OpenAI's Sam Altman is stepping down as chairman of the board of nuclear startup Oklo to provide the company with more flexibility to explore potential partnerships with OpenAI or other hyperscalers, especially given the increasing demand for power from data center companies. Oklo, which Altman took public in May 2024, is developing advanced nuclear reactors and aims to launch its first reactor at Idaho National Laboratory before the end of the decade. The company has already signed an agreement to provide up to 12 gigawatts of power for data center company Switch, but has yet to secure a deal with a major hyperscaler. Oklo's shares fell 12% following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration are planning to phase out eight artificial food dyes and colorings from America’s food supply by the end of next year. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary cited studies linking petroleum-based synthetic dyes to health conditions such as ADHD, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and gastrointestinal issues. The FDA also plans to authorize four additional natural color additives using natural ingredients in the coming weeks and accelerate the review of other natural ingredient colors. This decision follows former President Joe Biden's administration's earlier move to ban Red No. 3, and Kennedy is now seeking to remove the six other petroleum-based dyes approved by the FDA.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, with automotive revenue plunging 20% year-over-year, due in part to factory updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices. Net income plummeted 71% to $409 million, while total revenue slid 9% to $19.34 billion. The company cited increasing uncertainty in the automotive and energy markets due to evolving trade policy and changing political sentiment, with CEO Elon Musk spending time in the Trump administration. Despite challenges, Tesla reassured investors that it remains on track for a pilot launch of its driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York extended a block on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, criticizing President Trump's use of the act to deport alleged migrant gang members without due process. Judge Hellerstein compared the practice to a medieval inquisition, particularly the deportation of migrants based on tattoo markings. A judge in Colorado also issued a temporary order prohibiting the administration from using the law to deport noncitizens currently within that state, requiring at least three weeks' notice before deportation. These rulings highlight concerns about due process and potential inhumane conditions in El Salvador, where some migrants are being sent.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 16:46:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously floated during his presidential campaign. However, economists are skeptical, arguing that it is not a realistic proposal. Alex Durante, senior economist at the Tax Foundation, stated that tariffs are unlikely to generate enough revenue to offset income tax revenue. Tariff negotiations are ongoing, with a 10% universal tariff rate on goods imported into the United States from most countries and tariffs on imports from China as high as 145%.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court appears inclined to side with parents seeking the ability to opt their elementary school-age children out of instruction involving storybooks on gender identity and sexual orientation. The case involves a dispute between families and the Montgomery County Board of Education over whether schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to religious freedom. Several justices expressed skepticism about the school board's decision to eliminate opt-outs, with Justice Kavanaugh questioning why the county was "dying on this hill." The court's decision is expected by early July.</p>

The test includes deadlifts, push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and a sprint-drag-carry exercise.

          <p>A jury concluded that The New York Times did not libel former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for an error in a 2017 editorial, which Palin claimed damaged her reputation. The lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control that incorrectly linked Palin's political action committee to an atmosphere of violence before a 2011 mass shooting. The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after publication, and former editorial page editor James Bennet apologized to Palin. The jury found that the error was not published with "actual malice," a necessary condition for a public figure to win a libel case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's plan to resume collecting defaulted college loan payments from millions of borrowers risks contributing to an economic slowdown, according to experts. Roughly 5 million borrowers will have their loans sent for collections beginning on May 5, potentially leading to wage garnishments and reduced consumer spending. While the impact of the student loan collections may be smaller than other economic factors, it could compound existing challenges such as tariffs and investor jitters. The policy may reduce income for some borrowers, but it clarifies the path forward for loan payments after years of uncertainty surrounding loan forgiveness efforts.</p>

          <p>Gunmen opened fire on a group of domestic tourists visiting Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries. The attack took place in Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow, and has been condemned by world leaders. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but there has been a long-running insurgency in the region since 1989. Security forces have been deployed to the scene, and a joint search operation is underway. Video footage suggests the gunmen singled out non-Muslims.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is rising to its highest level since before the pandemic, signaling potential economic challenges. Personal bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first three months of the year, driven by heavy consumer debts, years of inflation, and higher interest rates. Experts warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including tariffs, could exacerbate the situation. LegalShield expects bankruptcies to surge this summer, reflecting the increasing financial stress on American households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer does not believe trans women are women, according to his official spokesman, following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining "woman" by biological sex under equalities law. This stance marks a shift from Starmer's previous statements, where he had said that trans women are women. The government has affirmed that single-sex spaces are protected in law and that a person born male but identifies as a woman does not have the right to use spaces designated for women only. The Prime Minister's official spokesman insisted the Labour government had been consistent that single-sex spaces "are protected in law".</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a major overhaul of the US State Department, involving cuts to offices such as the Office of Global Criminal Justice and changes to the focus of staff looking at migration and refugees. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the restructure was designed to eliminate offices that are "misaligned with America's core national interests." The plan would eliminate around 130 domestic offices and scrap 700 jobs. Critics have condemned the cuts, while the administration says the US government is beholden to radically liberal civil servants who stifle their conservative agenda.</p>
