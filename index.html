          <p>Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, emphasized the urgent need for direct communication between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to address ongoing trade war issues. Speaking at an event in Beijing, McFaul highlighted the lack of dialogue between the leaders nearly four months into Trump's second term, calling the situation "horrible." He suggested that high-level engagement is crucial for improving the US-China bilateral relationship, referencing past instances where Trump's one-on-one meetings proved significant. McFaul also recommended increased government-to-government dialogue, including visits from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to China, to foster better understanding and resolution of trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new "NVLink Fusion" program, which is designed to allow customers and partners to integrate non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's technology. This program expands the accessibility of NVLink, Nvidia's high-speed data transfer technology, to third-party processors, enabling the creation of semi-custom AI infrastructures. According to Huang, NVLink Fusion will allow for AI infrastructures to combine Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), giving customers the benefit of the NVLink infrastructure and ecosystem. AI chipmaking partners for NVLink Fusion include MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys and Cadence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to speak with Russian President Putin to push for an end to the conflict in Ukraine, following unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul. Trump aims to address the ongoing "bloodbath" resulting in thousands of casualties weekly, as well as discuss trade matters with Putin. The call follows Trump's disappointment that Putin did not attend the Istanbul talks despite Zelenskyy's invitation. Meanwhile, long-range strikes continue on both sides, with Ukraine reporting numerous downed drones and Russia claiming to have intercepted Ukrainian drones overnight. Contacts between US, Russian, and Ukrainian officials have persisted after the Istanbul meeting, with Secretary of State Rubio speaking with Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>

          <p>Reports claim the Republican party's childcare policy is based on undoing women's rights and status, pushing them out of the workforce and into domestic roles. While some funding for Head Start was restored after initial cuts, other proposed changes include repealing a tax credit for daycare. Conservatives are promoting a traditional family structure where women prioritize caregiving, a view criticized for reinforcing sexist stereotypes. The right's agenda aims to force women out of education, paid work, and into pregnancy, unemployment, and dependence on men.</p>

          <p>US advocacy groups are launching a campaign to protect Medicaid and Obamacare from proposed Republican cuts that could leave millions without health insurance. The House bill's proposed $880 billion cut to Medicaid, primarily through work requirements, faces opposition from health advocacy groups and some Republicans. Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. defended the proposal, arguing that able-bodied adults who refuse to work pose a threat to the health system. The House proposal is paired with the desire to allow premium tax credits available through the Affordable Care Act to expire.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that older adults can enhance their cognitive performance with as little as five minutes of daily exercise. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of South Australia and AdventHealth Research Institute, found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is linked to better information processing, focus, multitasking, and short-term memory. Even moderate activities like walking can improve brain functions. Researchers emphasize that transitioning from minimal physical activity to just five minutes a day yields the most significant gains in cognitive function, although the benefits do not extend to long-term memory or visual-spatial functions.</p>

          <p>Karen Musalo, a law professor, argues that the Trump administration's plans to send migrants from the U.S. to Libya and Rwanda undermine international refugee protection norms. She draws a parallel to the St. Louis tragedy during the Holocaust, where the U.S. turned away Jewish refugees. Musalo asserts that sending migrants to Libya, known for its abuse of migrants, and Rwanda, whose agreements to take migrants have been deemed unlawful by courts, violates the principle of nonrefoulement. She calls for a vocal stand to uphold the refugee framework developed after World War II, ensuring that those fleeing persecution are not returned to danger.</p>

          <p>President Trump threatened to cut federal funding for K-12 education in Maine after Governor Mills opposed an executive order regarding transgender athletes, leading to a legal battle. Maine schools rely heavily on federal dollars to support students from low-income families, English language learners, and students with disabilities. Jonathan Moody, a rural school district superintendent, emphasizes that federal funds are crucial for educating the most needy students and supporting academic intervention systems. The potential loss of funding has created anxiety among educators and staff, who fear cuts to staffing and programming for students.</p>

The support of voters who backed far-right candidates eliminated in the first round will be crucial in the second round.
