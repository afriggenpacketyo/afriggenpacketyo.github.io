          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro following his comments at a New York protest. During the demonstration, Petro urged American soldiers to disobey orders from President Donald Trump, which the U.S. deemed "reckless and incendiary." Petro, who was in the city for the U.N. General Assembly, has had a contentious relationship with the Trump administration over various diplomatic issues. He responded by stating he has international immunity and European citizenship, which allows visa-free travel to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in at least 57 Palestinian deaths, according to health officials, as airstrikes and gunfire continue across the region. The attacks occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the UN, rejecting growing international calls for a ceasefire and vowing to "finish the job" against Hamas. The humanitarian situation is worsening, with hospitals on the brink of collapse and aid deliveries to northern Gaza halted. The conflict has claimed over 65,000 lives in Gaza, with ongoing U.S. diplomatic efforts to broker a deal.</p>

A local official suggested that a generator being operated without sufficient ventilation may have released the toxic gases. Nearby properties were temporarily evacuated as a precaution while police and the Health and Safety Executive investigate the circumstances of the incident.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he is deploying troops to Portland, Oregon, to counter what he describes as attacks on federal facilities by "Antifa, and other domestic terrorists." In a social media post, Trump stated he was authorizing the use of "Full Force, if necessary," ignoring pleas from local and state officials who dispute the severity of the protests. Portland's mayor and Oregon's governor both stated they had not requested federal intervention and were not informed of the mission's purpose. The move marks an escalation in the administration's use of federal forces in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Denmark's defense ministry reported multiple drone sightings over several military facilities, including the country's largest air base in Karup, prompting a temporary closure of airspace. This follows a series of similar incidents that disrupted civilian airports in Denmark, Norway, and Lithuania, heightening security concerns across Northern Europe. While no one has been blamed, the events have led to increased vigilance, with NATO officials condemning airspace violations and vowing a resolute response. In response, Sweden has offered to lend Denmark military anti-drone capabilities for an upcoming European Union summit.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) has drawn significant backlash after posting a tribute on social media honoring Assata Shakur, a Black militant who died recently in Cuba. Shakur, also known as Joanne Chesimard, was convicted in 1977 for the murder of a New Jersey State Trooper and was on the FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorists list after escaping from prison in 1979 and fleeing to Cuba. Critics, including school choice advocates, condemned the union's post as unhinged and disrespectful. The CTU has a history of taking controversial political stances on issues beyond education.</p>

          <p>After nearly 34 years, Austin police have identified a suspect in the unsolved 1991 murders of four teenage girls at a local yogurt shop. Through advanced DNA testing, investigators linked Robert Eugene Brashers to the crime, which involved the victims being bound, shot, and set on fire. Brashers, who had a violent criminal history, died by suicide in 1999 during a police standoff. The case had previously resulted in the wrongful convictions of two men who were later exonerated. Police have informed the victims' families of the breakthrough, though the investigation remains open.</p>

          <p>A group of women in Minneapolis discovered their social media photos were used to create AI-generated deepfake pornography on a "nudify" website, sparking a fight against the technology. The ease of access to these tools, which require no technical skill, has led to their rapid growth, raising alarms among victims, lawmakers, and cybersecurity experts. Because the creation of such content without distribution is often not illegal, victims have limited legal recourse. This has prompted legislative efforts, such as a proposed bill in Minnesota, to hold AI companies accountable for enabling the creation of nonconsensual explicit material.</p>

May, who resigned from his position earlier this year and is representing himself, faces five to 20 years in prison for each of the five counts. He had been a prominent member of the state's conservative Freedom Caucus.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated Austrian-American journalist known for his insightful television interviews and documentaries, has died at 103. A Viennese Jew, Troller fled the Nazis in his youth, later returning to Europe as a U.S. soldier where he helped interrogate SS officers at the liberated Dachau concentration camp. He settled in Paris and became a prominent correspondent for German television, gaining fame for his unconventional and sensitive interviews with cultural icons like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen.

          <p>A spokesperson for Prince Harry has claimed that recent media reports about his reunion with King Charles are "categorically false" and suggested they are fueled by sources intent on sabotaging their reconciliation. The statement addresses a story that described their first face-to-face meeting in months as formal and disappointing for the Duke. The spokesperson clarified that while a photograph was exchanged as a gift, it was not of the Duke and Duchess's family as reported. This comes as Prince Harry has publicly expressed a desire to reconcile with his family after years of strained relations.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani, former attorney for President Trump, has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit, filed in 2021, accused Giuliani of knowingly spreading false claims that the company's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement, including any financial details, were not disclosed in the court filing, which states that all claims have been dismissed with prejudice. This follows Dominion's massive $787 million settlement with Fox News in 2023 over similar election-related falsehoods.</p>

          <p>President Trump has drawn criticism for advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol, baselessly linking its active ingredient, acetaminophen, to autism. During a press event, Trump suggested women should "tough it out" if feeling unwell during pregnancy, a comment that has been labeled misogynistic and a reflection of how women's pain is often dismissed. Medical experts have refuted the causal link between acetaminophen and autism and warned that untreated fevers during pregnancy can pose risks to the fetus. The statements are seen as another instance of the administration advancing medically unsupported guidance.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a warning about foreign attempts to illegally acquire the country's strategic mineral resources. The agency revealed it had uncovered two recent cases involving the smuggling of antimony, a rare metal crucial for various industrial applications. According to the ministry, some foreign nations are trying to bypass China's export controls to build their own reserves, posing a threat to national security. One of the uncovered smuggling operations involved a family-run criminal network that used shell companies and third-country transit to move the materials.</p>

          <p>Major dating apps, including those from Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd and Match Group, are increasingly incorporating AI to act as a sophisticated matchmaker for users. The goal is to combat swipe fatigue and dissatisfaction by moving beyond superficial profiles and focusing on deeper compatibility based on values, goals, and personality traits. These AI systems will survey users and present curated matches, aiming to replicate the work of a traditional matchmaker. However, critics question whether AI can truly predict human chemistry, a complex element that has historically eluded even the most detailed algorithms.</p>

CEO Julie Sweet stated that as AI becomes integral to all company operations, employees are expected to retrain, and those for whom it is not a "viable path" will be let go on a compressed timeline. The move is part of an $865 million business optimization program that includes severance costs but is expected to save over $1 billion.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is confronting growing doubts about his leadership within the Labour party as he heads to its annual conference. Despite leading the party to a significant election victory, months of poor polling numbers and criticism over his communication style and decision-making have fueled speculation about his suitability for the role. While some allies point to his successes on the world stage, others describe a lack of vision and political instinct. The pressure is on for Starmer to use the conference to articulate a clear direction for his government and reassert his authority.</p>
