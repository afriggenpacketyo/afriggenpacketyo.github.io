          <p>Former Conservative health minister Maria Caulfield has defected to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, becoming the 15th former Tory MP to do so. Caulfield, who lost her Lewes seat in the last general election, stated the Conservative Party no longer aligns with her beliefs and that right-minded conservatives see their future with Reform. The move follows the defection of sitting MP Danny Kruger and has been dismissed by Tory leader Kemi Badenoch as a focus on "Westminster bubble issues" rather than substantive policy. Critics argue Reform is welcoming individuals responsible for past political problems.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have launched a major offensive in Gaza City, which Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz described as "burning." The Palestinian Foreign Ministry has called for urgent international intervention to protect civilians, accusing Israel of turning the city into a "mass graveyard." A UN commission report released concurrently concluded that Israel's actions amount to genocide, a finding the Israeli Foreign Ministry rejected as based on "Hamas falsehoods." The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 64,964 people have been killed in the conflict since it began.</p>

Despite the illness, the Queen still intends to participate in the upcoming state visit of President Trump. King Charles and other senior royals attended the service at Westminster Cathedral, which was the first Catholic funeral for a Royal Family member in modern times. The Duchess, who passed away at 92, was remembered for her kindness, dedication to charity, and love of music, which was featured prominently in the service.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the 'Hillsborough Law,' a landmark bill compelling public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The legislation includes a legal "duty of candour," with criminal sanctions for breaches, and aims to prevent cover-ups like those seen after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which killed 97 football fans. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer praised the decades-long fight by victims' families, stating the law will serve thousands by changing the balance of power and ensuring the state cannot hide from the people it serves.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and four of its journalists. The suit, filed in a Florida federal court, alleges that several articles and a book published in the lead-up to the 2024 election are part of a long-standing pattern of malicious defamation. The legal filing claims the statements were published with knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. In a social media post, Trump accused the newspaper of being a "virtual 'mouthpiece' for the Radical Left Democrat Party."</p>

          <p>Thousands of families are desperately trying to flee Gaza City as the Israeli military commences a large-scale ground operation, described by residents as "hell." Civilians are being directed to a single coastal road, which is severely congested, while airstrikes continue overhead, creating a perilous journey. The cost of transportation and temporary shelter has skyrocketed, forcing many to sell possessions or leave everything behind. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed the launch of a "powerful operation" in what he calls Hamas's last major stronghold, intensifying the humanitarian crisis for displaced residents.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered what are believed to be the world's oldest mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, in Southeast Asia. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that hunter-gatherer communities in the region practiced smoke-drying their dead over fires. This process, identified through heat exposure marks on ancient bones, predates the previously known oldest mummies from the Chinchorro people of South America by thousands of years. The practice likely allowed relatives to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, a tradition still seen in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk's murder, progressive organizations express fear of politically motivated investigations reminiscent of the McCarthy era's "red scare." President Trump and his allies have called for probes into left-leaning groups, with White House official Stephen Miller vowing to "destroy these networks" in Kirk's name. A letter from House Freedom Caucus members requests a select committee to investigate the "radical left's assault on America," linking the shooting to other unrelated crimes. Targeted groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Open Society Foundations deny any wrongdoing and warn that such rhetoric aims to silence dissent.</p>

One reader proposes a radical ultimatum from non-nuclear nations to compel disarmament, while another shares personal memories of Cold War-era nuclear tests and their haunting legacy. The letters highlight the profound and lasting psychological impact of living with the possibility of nuclear annihilation, a danger that one contributor warns society neglects at its own peril.

          <p>This article reflects on a 2022 off-the-record interview with Charlie Kirk, revealing his long-term vision and priorities before his assassination. Kirk emphasized that his primary goal was not short-term political wins but rather a multi-decade cultural and educational transformation focused on instilling Judeo-Christian values in America's youth. He saw his work with Turning Point USA in schools and churches as more fundamental than electoral politics, aiming to change how a generation thinks about philosophy, faith, and government. Kirk expressed particular pride in his efforts to establish a network of conservative Christian schools to create an "educational monolith."</p>

Dabhoiwala explains that speech is a form of action with real-world consequences, a fact that absolutist interpretations often ignore.

The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in this week's policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had attempted to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denied, but the case has raised significant questions about the Federal Reserve's independence from political interference. The law permits a president to remove a governor only "for cause," a term legally untested until this case. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of UK pensioners receiving winter fuel payments plummeted from approximately 11 million to just 1.3 million last year, according to new government figures. This sharp decline was the result of a controversial Treasury decision to means-test the payment, restricting it to low-income individuals on specific benefits. Following widespread public and political backlash, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a U-turn in June. The policy has now been revised, making pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less eligible, which will restore the payment for over three-quarters of pensioners this winter.

This is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific pigment in his work.

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the government's "triple lock" policy, the pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. This increase would raise the new state pension by over £500 a year, but it also brings pensioners closer to paying income tax, as the personal tax allowance remains frozen. Experts predict that individuals relying solely on the new state pension will become taxpayers by April 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bulgarian police have arrested Igor Grechushkin, the Russian owner of the ship that transported the explosive material responsible for the deadly 2020 Beirut port blast. The explosion killed over 200 people and devastated the Lebanese capital. Grechushkin, who was on an Interpol wanted list at Lebanon's request, was detained for potential extradition to face charges for his role in the disaster. Lebanon's domestic investigation into the blast has been repeatedly stalled by what critics describe as political interference, frustrating families of the victims who are still seeking accountability.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has informed suppliers that production at its factories will remain shut down until at least September 24 due to a major cyber attack that occurred over two weeks ago. The hack paralyzed the company's IT networks and has cost an estimated £50 million per week in lost output. While JLR has dismissed longer-term disruption as speculation, industry sources warn the impact could extend into November. The prolonged stoppage is causing significant concern among JLR's supply chain partners, with fears that smaller businesses could face bankruptcy without financial support.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has apologized to its fans after discovering that over 100 season tickets were being used by tour organisers for unauthorized resale, an issue that went undetected for years. The club terminated the tickets after a school from Dundee was able to purchase seats for a high-demand Champions League match against Barcelona. The club explained that while it ended third-party agreements four years ago, this particular arrangement from a decade ago persisted without a formal contract.

The banned chip remains available in China through grey market channels at less than half the price.

          <p>Ojai artist Alice Matzkin, 85, has experienced a remarkable creative resurgence after losing most of her life's work in the 2017 Thomas fire. The fire destroyed about 100 of her paintings, leading to a long period where she stopped creating art altogether. Two years ago, however, she felt a sudden inspiration to return to her studio and began producing a new series of vibrant, abstract paintings. This new body of work marks a significant shift from her previous focus on portraits and represents a powerful story of resilience and the enduring nature of creativity in the face of devastating loss.</p>

Despite their genre differences, both films center on saving a cherished family home from external threats, whether supernatural or economic. The analysis points to shared themes such as generational conflict, the struggles of their respective female protagonists, and a tendency to idealize their main characters. Both finales also conclude on a similar note of haunted but happy nostalgia, bringing back characters from past installments to provide a sense of closure for fans.</p>

The author laments how both conservatives and progressives have retreated into their respective camps, using the tragedy to fuel further division and animosity rather than uniting against political violence. The piece criticizes the rush to assign blame and the canonization or demonization of Kirk, suggesting that the silent majority of Americans are exhausted by the partisan warfare.

          <p>Today's date, 9/16/25, is being celebrated by mathematicians as a rare and special occasion that occurs only once a century. The date is unique because each number is a perfect square (3², 4², and 5²). Furthermore, the base numbers (3, 4, and 5) form a Pythagorean triple, meaning they satisfy the famous theorem a² + b² = c² (9 + 16 = 25). Mathematicians describe the date as revealing a "hidden mathematical poetry" and a beautiful coincidence that connects a simple calendar date to one of the most fundamental theorems in mathematics.</p>
