          <p>Miki Sudo has won the women's competition at the 2025 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, a traditional Fourth of July event in Coney Island, New York. She consumed 33 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes to claim her 11th victory, though this was well below her personal record. Sudo commented that while the crowd was supportive, the buns seemed more filling than usual, but a win is a win. The competition, which features cash prizes and the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt, continues to be a major holiday spectacle.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at a petrol station in Rome's Prenestino neighborhood has injured at least 29 people, including nine police officers. The blast occurred after a tanker truck reportedly struck a pipe, causing a gas leak and an initial, smaller explosion that emergency services were already attending. A subsequent, much larger fireball caused extensive damage to nearby buildings and vehicles, with the mayor describing the impact as terrible. Authorities had evacuated a nearby sports center just before the main blast, which likely prevented a more severe tragedy.</p>

          <p>A 90-day suspension of extensive U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, creating significant economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. If new bilateral trade agreements are not finalized, a baseline 10% duty on all imports could be supplemented by much higher country-specific rates. The Trump administration has announced new deals with China, the U.K., and Vietnam but has indicated it does not plan to extend the deadline for other nations. Economists warn this could lead to renewed inflation and market instability, while an extension would prolong uncertainty for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The sentence of a 15-year-old boy who was convicted of manslaughter for the killing of 80-year-old Bhim Kohli in Leicestershire is being reviewed for being potentially too lenient. Mr. Kohli was racially abused and physically attacked in a park, suffering fatal injuries. The boy was sentenced to seven years in custody, a decision that Mr. Kohli's family criticized as not matching the crime's severity. The Attorney General's Office has referred the case under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme, which could lead to a harsher penalty for the convicted teenager.</p>

          <p>A 23-year-old man, Tyler Webb, has been sentenced in a landmark case under the UK's Online Safety Act for encouraging a vulnerable woman to kill herself for his sexual gratification. Webb connected with the victim on a social media forum and later used the Telegram app to instruct her on self-harm, asking for images of her injuries. He was the first person charged under this specific section of the new law. The judge issued a hybrid order of nine years and four months, requiring Webb to be detained in a mental health facility before serving any remaining time in prison.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. This move is widely seen as a direct effort to curb the practice of Chinese manufacturers rerouting exports through Vietnam to evade higher U.S. tariffs. Economists and policy experts note that enforcing this distinction will be challenging for Vietnam, as it requires defining what constitutes a 'made in Vietnam' product versus a transshipment. The deal signals a broader U.S. strategy to pressure China within its global trade negotiations.</p>

While the Taliban hailed the decision as historic, former Afghan officials and critics condemned it, highlighting the regime's severe restrictions on women's rights.

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has advanced to the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a decisive 6-4 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old won nine consecutive games to dominate the match with powerful serving and shots. Kartal, who was ranked outside the top 800 just three years ago, has had an impressive run, defeating the 20th seed in the first round. Her success could see her become the top-ranked British player by the end of the tournament, marking a remarkable rise in her career.</p>

          <p>Researchers have uncovered evidence of a 125,000-year-old 'fat factory' operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of thousands of bone fragments and tools suggests these ancient humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them to extract nutrient-rich marrow and fat. This large-scale operation indicates sophisticated planning, including organizing hunts, storing carcasses, and processing them in a designated area. The finding challenges outdated stereotypes of Neanderthals as unintelligent, showing they had a deep understanding of nutrition and the skills to process resources for survival.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been indicted on murder charges in the 1983 disappearance of his then-girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, in Selma, Oregon. The breakthrough in the 42-year-old cold case came after advancements in DNA technology confirmed a human skull found in 1997 belonged to Peroni. She was 27 when she was last seen with Sanfratello at a party, walking into a wooded area after an argument. The case remained cold for decades due to insufficient evidence, but the new DNA match allowed a grand jury to issue the indictment, leading to Sanfratello's arrest in California.</p>

          <p>In response to recent U.S. and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear facilities, Iran has officially suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iranian officials stated the suspension will continue as long as the security of its nuclear sites is not guaranteed, raising questions about the future of IAEA inspections and Iran's status within the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The attacks on facilities that were under IAEA safeguards have fueled debate within Iran about the value of the treaty for its national security. The move further complicates international efforts to monitor and control Tehran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>Amid his feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk has renewed his threat to create a new political party, a venture legal experts say is extraordinarily difficult. Launching a national third party would require navigating a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the existing two-party system. The process would likely take years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars in organizational and legal fees to overcome challenges from the Democratic and Republican parties. While Musk has the financial resources, the logistical and legal barriers to establishing a viable national party by 2026 are immense.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Human Rights Office has criticized Germany's proposal to resume deportations to Afghanistan, a policy that was halted when the Taliban retook power in 2021. A UN spokesperson stated that it is 'not appropriate to return people to Afghanistan' due to ongoing and documented human rights violations in the country. The German Interior Minister had expressed openness to making direct agreements with the Taliban to facilitate the deportations. The UN refugee agency reiterated its non-return advisory for Afghanistan, urging all countries to refrain from forcibly returning individuals as conditions on the ground are not yet ready.</p>

          <p>A new peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, aimed at ending the conflict in eastern DRC, has been met with skepticism from regional observers. While the deal commits to ceasing hostilities and neutralizing armed groups, its success hinges on implementation and inclusivity. The powerful M23 rebel group has already rejected the deal's binding nature, criticizing it as limited. Analysts warn that for the deal to succeed, it must address the economic drivers of the conflict, ensure justice for atrocities, and gain the buy-in of local communities and armed factions who were not part of the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it is consulting with other Palestinian factions before providing a formal response to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release proposal. President Trump stated he expects to know within 24 hours if Hamas will accept the plan, which Israel has reportedly agreed to. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire, a staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and increased humanitarian aid. A key sticking point remains Hamas's demand for a guaranteed end to the war, a condition Israel has so far resisted.</p>

          <p>A massive explosion and subsequent fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics warehouse in Esparto, California, has left seven people unaccounted for. The incident on Tuesday evening caused several structures to catch fire and sparked grass fires that burned approximately 80 acres. Two people were injured, and a one-mile evacuation zone remains in effect. Records show a county sheriff's lieutenant is listed as an owner of the property, and the business was found to be operating without local licenses for fireworks storage. Federal authorities, including the ATF, have been called to assist in the investigation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House and Senate have passed President Trump's signature legislative package, which extends many of the 2017 tax cuts and allocates new spending for border security and defense. The 887-page bill introduces significant changes to social programs, including new work requirements for Medicaid and SNAP, which the CBO estimates could cause millions to lose coverage. The legislation also increases the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. The bill is funded in part by these cuts to health and nutrition programs.
