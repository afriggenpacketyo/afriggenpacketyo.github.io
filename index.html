            <p>Prison officers in the UK are requesting electric stun guns to protect themselves while guarding dangerous inmates, following an incident where Hashem Abedi attacked officers at HMP Frankland. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) is advocating for the tactical use of tasers by specially trained staff, as current measures like batons and incapacitant spray are insufficient. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has launched a full, independent review of the incident and suspended kitchen access for prisoners at the separation center where the attack occurred.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after sources revealed he shared details of a U.S. strike on Yemen via Signal, a messaging app not approved for classified information. The messages, which included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets, were sent to a private group chat including his wife, brother, and personal attorney. This revelation follows a previous incident where Hegseth inadvertently included The Atlantic editor-in-chief in a similar Signal chat.

            <p>Season 2 of HBO's "The Last of Us" adaptation diverges from the game by indulging in the brutality of Joel's death, requiring Abby to explain her motives, and packing in more deaths during the assault on Jackson. While Season 1 focused on building bonds in impossible circumstances, Season 2 explores how those bonds can fracture. The show has become a punishing watch, focusing on undiluted pain rather than a careful observation of animosity, and the show posits that all of the characters have gotten lost in the darkness.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines landed back at Boeing's U.S. production hub due to tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, was one of several waiting at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. Trump's recent increase of tariffs on Chinese imports to 145% and China's retaliatory 125% tariff on U.S. goods have made the delivery economically unviable. A new 737 MAX has a market value of around $55m, according to IBA, an aviation consultancy.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that President Trump's tariffs on China may inadvertently make the country faster, leaner, and stronger. China recognizes that the U.S.'s strategic goal is the systematic strangling of China's economic rise, rather than merely trade rebalancing. To counter this, China is focusing on resolving its own economic weaknesses, such as the fragmentation of its domestic market. While fiscal stimulus could provide near-term relief, the key is to strengthen internal economic structures.</p>

The rollout of the scheme has not been the panacea many had hoped for, with parents facing increasing difficulties in securing nursery places.

            <p>With mortgage rates expected to decrease, potential first-time home buyers are exploring various strategies to enter the housing market. Options include utilizing Lifetime ISAs, low-deposit mortgages, shared ownership schemes, and "income boost" mortgages. Experts recommend starting to save early and exploring different mortgage products to find the best fit. Shared ownership allows buyers to purchase a portion of a property and pay rent on the remainder, with the option to increase ownership over time.</p>

            <p>Studies show men go to the doctor less than women and are less likely to be registered at a dental practice or use a pharmacy. Men often delay seeking help until symptoms interfere with daily function, and the NHS suggests that concerns about how they are perceived come into play. Men may feel pressure to "tough it out" or that talking about health concerns might make others see them as weak, leading to negative health outcomes. Efforts are being made to create support groups and services that cater to men's specific needs.</p>

            <p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has proposed a prisoner exchange with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported from the US in exchange for "political prisoners." Bukele directed the offer to Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, noting that many of the Venezuelans have committed serious crimes while the political prisoners have committed no crime. Tarek William Saab, Venezuela’s General Attorney, responded to Bukele’s offer by asking for the names and medical status of all of the Venezuelans in Cecot and accused El Salvador’s government of breaching the human rights of its nationals held in the maximum security facility.</p>

Poor civil engineering practices, flawed road design, and inadequate signage exacerbate the problem. Despite efforts to improve road safety, a crisis rooted in infrastructure, human behavior, enforcement gaps, and systemic neglect persists.</p>
