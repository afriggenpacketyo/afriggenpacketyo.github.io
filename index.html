          <p>The U.S. government is introducing a new, non-waivable $250 "visa integrity fee" for all nonimmigrant visa applicants, in addition to existing charges. This fee, part of the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is intended to be reimbursed if visitors comply with their visa terms, though implementation details remain unclear. Critics, including the U.S. Travel Association, express concern over the fee's impact on tourism, especially with reduced funding for the nation's destination marketing organization. The government states the measure aims to restore integrity to the immigration system.</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late Pat Tillman, was arrested on suspicion of intentionally crashing a vehicle into a San Jose post office and setting it on fire. The building was a total loss, and authorities found the phrase "Viva La Me" spray-painted on the exterior, though the motive remains unclear. Pat Tillman famously left his NFL career to join the U.S. Army and was killed by friendly fire in Afghanistan in 2004. The incident has raised more questions than answers for investigators and the community.</p>

          <p>The declining Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust-belt region, is investing 1.2 billion yuan to construct a new airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This move is a strategic gamble to revive its struggling economy, which has been hit by industrial decline and a shrinking population, by improving connectivity and boosting trade with Russia. The Luobei Airport is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. Experts view this as a common strategy for smaller Chinese cities seeking economic breakthroughs through infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a formidable leader across China's entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has diversified from telecommunications into AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. U.S. sanctions inadvertently bolstered Huawei's status as a national champion, accelerating its development of a comprehensive AI hardware and software stack.

          <p>Fierce price wars are sweeping across multiple Chinese industries, from electric vehicles to food delivery, driven by increased consumer price sensitivity following the pandemic. While shoppers can find extreme discounts, this "race to the bottom" is squeezing corporate profits and contributing to deflationary pressures. The Chinese government and state media have expressed concerns that this cutthroat competition could compromise product quality and safety, harm wages, and negatively impact the broader economy. The ripple effects are also felt internationally, as foreign markets grapple with the influx of low-cost Chinese goods.</p>

The result reflects voter frustration over rising prices, political scandals, and the threat of U.S. tariffs, undermining the government's influence.

Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder linked to insulin resistance, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, weight gain, and hair loss after using these medications. While the drugs are not yet approved for PCOS, experts believe their ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly addresses the condition's root causes.

          <p>The founder of Chinese quantum computing firm SpinQ, Xiang Jingen, has predicted that the technology will cross the threshold into practical, widespread usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the Shenzhen-based company currently produces small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful superconducting systems for industrial use. Xiang compared the current state of quantum technology to the early days of semiconductors in the 1950s, indicating that while there is significant progress to be made, a major transition is on the horizon. SpinQ has already sold its products to over 50 countries.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows Declining Support for Trump's Deportation Program Amid Economic Concerns</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now believing it is not focused on dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. This shift has contributed to a slide in the president's overall approval rating, as most Americans, outside of his core base, want the administration to focus more on lowering prices. The poll also found widespread disapproval of the recently passed "One Big Beautiful Bill," which most believe will primarily help the wealthy, further defining a split between the president's base and the rest of the country.</p>

          <p>In one of the deadliest days for aid-seekers during the conflict, at least 85 Palestinians were killed at various locations across Gaza while trying to access humanitarian supplies, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The largest number of casualties occurred in northern Gaza, where witnesses claim Israeli forces fired on a massive crowd gathered near an aid convoy. The Israel Defense Forces stated they fired warning shots to disperse a crowd that posed a threat, but disputed the casualty figures. The incident highlights the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and escalating violence surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent struggles continued with a 6-5 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, completing a six-game season sweep by Milwaukee and marking the Dodgers' tenth loss in twelve games. The frustrating defeat was compounded by a significant injury to first baseman Freddie Freeman, who sustained a left wrist contusion after being hit by a pitch. Although X-rays were negative, the potential loss of a key player adds to the team's woes, which include defensive errors and a struggling bullpen. The team is now grappling with its worst 12-game skid since 2018.</p>

          <p>Insiders and analysts suggest the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project was destined for problems, citing the inherent challenges of building major infrastructure on a "small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island." The project, now tens of billions over budget and years behind schedule, was also hampered by an initial ambition to build the world's fastest line, which dramatically drove up costs. A complex planning and approval process, requiring thousands of permissions and costly compromises to appease local opposition, further contributed to the massive delays and budget overruns for the now-shortened line.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident on June 18, 1984, involved violent confrontations between thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners based on what she called "discredited evidence." Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for years, expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has cemented his position as the most dominant force in men's golf, drawing frequent comparisons to Tiger Woods in his prime. This win marks his fourth major title, and his machine-like consistency and ability to close out tournaments have become his trademark. Peers and commentators note his "Tiger-like" dominance, even as Scheffler himself remains humble about the comparison. His success is attributed to a combination of his unflappable mental game and a significant improvement in his putting after adopting a new technique.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to shut down the Environmental Protection Agency's primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD). This office provides the scientific analysis for regulations on a wide range of environmental hazards. The closure is part of a broader plan to cut the EPA's staff by 23%, which the agency claims will save money and allow it to better focus on its core mission. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers and environmental groups, have condemned the move as a "travesty" that will cripple the agency's ability to use science to protect public health.</p>
