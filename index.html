          <p>Aalborg Airport in northern Denmark suspended operations on Wednesday following the observation of unauthorized drones in its airspace. The closure impacted at least four flights from major carriers, including SAS, Norwegian, and KLM. Airport officials confirmed the drone sightings but have not yet released details on the number of drones or their origin. This incident highlights the growing security challenges that aviation authorities face from the unauthorized use of unmanned aerial vehicles near critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Attorney in Virginia, appointed by Donald Trump, is reportedly planning to ask a grand jury to indict former FBI Director James Comey on charges of lying to Congress. This move comes despite Department of Justice prosecutors recommending against it, having found insufficient evidence to establish probable cause after a months-long investigation. Sources indicate the decision is being pushed forward before the statute of limitations expires, following direct calls from Trump to prosecute his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Guardians' designated hitter David Fry is expected to be out for six to eight weeks after suffering multiple facial and nasal fractures. The injury occurred when he was struck in the face by a fastball from Detroit Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal during a game. The team announced that while Fry's injuries require close monitoring, he is expected to make a full recovery without surgery and is resting comfortably after being discharged from the hospital. Skubal expressed his concern for Fry, emphasizing that the player's health is more important than the game.</p>

          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears, establishing a new league record valuation for the team at $8.9 billion. The stake, previously held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna, was sold to the team's existing owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation represents a significant increase from the team's $6.4 billion valuation just a year ago. The deal underscores the soaring financial value of NFL franchises, even as the team explores options for a new stadium. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The family of a victim from the fatal January collision between an American Airlines plane and an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., has filed a lawsuit against the FAA, the U.S. Army, and the airlines involved. The lawsuit, the first of an expected 60, alleges that the parties failed to act on warning signs from over 30 documented near misses in the area. The collision, which killed 67 people, was the deadliest U.S. plane crash since 2001. The family's legal action seeks accountability and aims to prevent similar tragedies in the future.</p>

The move comes after JLR was forced to halt production due to a major cyber attack, leaving its factories idle and threatening the viability of smaller suppliers who depend on its business. Among the ideas being considered are government-backed loans or a plan for the government to purchase and stockpile component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms until JLR resumes operations.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial for a one-time gene therapy treatment, AMT-130, has shown promising results in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75% over three years in a small group of patients. Researchers from University College London reported that the experimental therapy uses a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions to the brain, which helps turn off the toxic protein that damages brain cells. While these early findings are highly encouraging and represent a potential breakthrough, the treatment is still years away from potential FDA approval and requires further, larger studies to confirm its safety and efficacy.</p>

          <p>Doctors and public health officials are pushing back against President Trump's recent suggestion that pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking acetaminophen for pain or fever. Experts warn this advice could be harmful, as untreated high fevers during pregnancy are linked to developmental issues in babies. They reiterate that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, remains the safest over-the-counter pain and fever reducer for pregnant women when used as needed. There is concern that the president's comments could lead patients to use riskier alternatives or avoid necessary treatment altogether.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas nearly doubled on Wednesday following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal emerged during renegotiations of a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine in Nevada. An administration official stated that if loan repayment terms are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. The move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The legal team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has filed a motion claiming President Trump's public comments have violated their client's right to a fair trial. The filing cites a Fox News interview where Trump called Mangione a "pure assassin" and inferred his guilt, as well as White House statements linking him to "left-wing extremist groups." In response, the presiding judge has warned Department of Justice officials against making comments that could interfere with the trial. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

          <p>This editorial from The Guardian acknowledges the encouraging boom in global investment in renewable energy, which is now double the amount being spent on fossil fuels. However, it warns that this progress is insufficient without a simultaneous and rapid reduction in fossil fuel production, as current plans would far exceed the 1.5C warming limit. The piece calls on governments to submit ambitious new climate pledges and resist the influence of anti-climate populism. It concludes that while progress is being made, abandoning the goal of phasing out fossil fuels would mean abandoning hope for a stable climate.</p>

          <p>Slovakian Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar has pushed back against pressure to cut the country's purchases of Russian energy, arguing that it lacks sustainable and affordable alternatives. Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Blanar called for "empathy," stating that breaking long-term contracts could cost Slovakia billions and that diversification takes time. He also pointed to a perceived hypocrisy, noting that some Western European nations have increased their purchases of liquefied natural gas from Russia. Slovakia, along with Hungary, has maintained ties with Moscow and argues for a diplomatic, rather than military, solution to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>As U.S. household debt reaches record levels, this article outlines several common pitfalls that can sabotage debt repayment efforts. Key mistakes to avoid include only making minimum payments, which can prolong debt for years, and taking on new debt while trying to pay off existing balances. Other detrimental behaviors are draining emergency savings to pay down balances, which leaves one vulnerable to unexpected expenses, and failing to change the spending habits that led to the debt in the first place. The article stresses that avoiding these errors is as crucial as adopting effective payoff strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the fall respiratory illness season begins, parents are facing varied guidance on vaccinations for children. Medical groups like the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) are consistent in recommending the annual flu shot for everyone 6 months and older. However, recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine now differ, with the AAP strongly recommending it for children under two, while a CDC advisory panel has shifted to a model of "individual-based decision-making." This divergence, along with some states issuing their own separate guidance, is causing confusion for parents navigating how to best protect their children.</p>

Instead of using investor funds for the specific brands as promised, they allegedly used money from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones and diverted at least $16 million for their personal use, as none of the portfolio companies were actually profitable.</p>

The film stars Teyana Taylor as a charismatic revolutionary leader and Leonardo DiCaprio as her less-than-heroic follower, with the review highlighting their strong performances. The critic notes that Anderson has reoriented the story around race and modern political tensions, creating a film with a sensibility that is distinctly his own. The movie is described as an energetic and pointed thriller that explores the perpetual nature of political and social struggle.</p>

          <p>For individuals managing multiple debts, this article details several structured repayment strategies to regain financial control. It explains the "debt snowball" method, which focuses on paying off the smallest balances first for psychological momentum, and the "debt avalanche" method, which targets the highest-interest debts to save the most money over time. Other effective tools discussed include using a balance transfer credit card with a 0% introductory APR or consolidating multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate.

          <p>Ukraine has significantly ramped up its domestic production of long-range drones and is now using them to systematically target Russia's economic infrastructure, particularly its oil and gas industry. This strategy aims to "starve the Russian war machine" by reducing the state income used to fund the invasion, a tactic seen as more effective than relying on troop casualties to deter Moscow. The campaign has already reportedly damaged over a fifth of Russia's refining capacity, causing domestic fuel shortages and reducing export revenue. This independent effort acts as a form of self-imposed sanctions amid shifting international support.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UN Climate Summit, nations are submitting their new 2035 climate targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), though many major emitters are lagging. Only a fraction of countries met the initial deadline, with the EU issuing a statement of intent rather than a final target and the U.S. having withdrawn from the Paris Agreement under President Trump. China, the world's largest emitter, has pledged a 7-10% cut from its peak emissions, a target criticized as underwhelming but still significant. The article highlights the ongoing gap between current commitments and the actions needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
