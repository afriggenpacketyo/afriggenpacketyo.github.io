          <p>Former President Donald Trump has commenced his second state visit to the United Kingdom, where he was formally greeted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The visit, marked by traditional royal pomp and pageantry, occurs as Trump faces renewed scrutiny over his past association with Jeffrey Epstein. The trip is intended to further diplomatic and trade relations between the US and the UK, though it has also drawn plans for protests. This visit is considered unusual as second-term US presidents are not typically offered a full state visit.</p>

          <p>Costco has recalled its private-label Kirkland Signature Prosecco Valdobbiadene, citing a risk that unopened bottles could spontaneously shatter. The recall affects products sold in 12 states between April and August. The company has advised customers not to open the bottles and to dispose of them safely after wrapping them in paper towels or placing them in a plastic bag. Customers can receive a full refund by presenting the recall letter at their local Costco store, and no injuries have been reported so far.</p>

          <p>Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, has stated that two independent laboratories confirmed her husband was poisoned shortly before his death in an Arctic penal colony. In a video statement, she claimed the labs have not published their findings due to "political considerations" and urged them to release the results. Navalnaya has consistently blamed Vladimir Putin for her husband's death, a charge the Kremlin denies. Russian authorities officially attributed his death to natural causes, which his family and supporters dispute.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has labeled China an "adversary" following reports that Beijing ordered tech companies to cease purchasing a specific Nvidia AI chip designed for the Chinese market. Johnson stated that China's actions, including intellectual property theft, are the cause of strained relations, not US policies. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed disappointment with the ban but acknowledged the larger geopolitical issues at play between the two nations. This move represents the latest escalation in the ongoing "chip war" over control of high-end AI technology.</p>

          <p>Environmental experts are raising alarms about a potential ecological disaster in Southeast Asia's Mekong River, caused by a boom in rare-earth mining in Myanmar. Watchdogs report that Myanmar has become the world's primary source for heavy rare-earth elements, with mining operations leading to toxic contamination, including high levels of arsenic, in Mekong tributaries. This pollution threatens the water supply and agricultural systems for millions of people in downstream countries like Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The lack of regulation in the conflict-ridden mining regions complicates any potential mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>The campus of the American University of Beirut (AUB) is a sanctuary for more than 1,000 cats, a tradition that began about 30 years ago when the university started taking in animals abandoned during wartime. The sprawling, green campus provides a suitable environment for the felines, which include both purebreds and street cats. The university manages the population by spaying, neutering, and vaccinating them, as well as facilitating adoptions. For many students, the presence of the cats offers a source of comfort and stress relief in a region often marked by tension.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Palestinians are fleeing Gaza City as Israeli troops continue a major ground offensive aimed at occupying the area. The operation has included large-scale bombardment, with Gaza's health ministry reporting that a children's hospital was targeted, forcing patients to evacuate. Israel announced it was opening a second route for civilians to move south, though aid agencies warn the designated "humanitarian area" is severely overcrowded and insufficient. The offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation, with humanitarian groups describing the situation as an unconscionable and deepening catastrophe for civilians.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant decrease in mortgage rates to their lowest level since last October has triggered a massive 58% weekly jump in mortgage refinance applications. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, refinance activity was also 70% higher than the same week a year ago. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.39%, prompting many homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek lower monthly payments. This surge indicates that consumers are actively looking for savings opportunities amid an uncertain economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is actively monitoring its shipbuilding capacity to prevent the kind of overproduction that could destabilize the global market, according to the China Association of the National Shipbuilding Industry (CANSI). An official stated that authorities have implemented a system of checks and balances to avoid boom-and-bust cycles and ensure sustainable growth. Chinese shipyards currently dominate the global market with a 70% share and are operating at 75% capacity. In the first half of the year, the industry saw a 20.8% year-on-year increase in revenue, demonstrating its current strength.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the starkly contrasting perspectives on the future risks of artificial intelligence, framing the debate as a clash between two worldviews. One camp, the "doomers," argues that a superintelligent AI would almost certainly lead to human extinction and that development must be halted immediately. The opposing "normalist" camp views AI as just another powerful technology that society can adapt to and control through regulation and careful deployment. The article suggests a third, more plausible "accumulative" risk model, where the gradual erosion of societal systems by less catastrophic AI harms could lead to a cascading collapse.</p>
