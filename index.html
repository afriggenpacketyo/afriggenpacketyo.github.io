          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car fire. The first fire occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, while the second took place at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, causing damage to the entrance. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to the properties' previous connections with Starmer, who still owns the Kentish Town home but resides at Downing Street. Residents in the area expressed concern and worry about future unwelcome visitations, highlighting the unusual nature of the incidents in their typically quiet neighborhood.</p>

          <p>At least 21 people have died in India and 10 are hospitalized after consuming tainted liquor, prompting multiple arrests, according to authorities. The incident occurred in the Amritsar district of Punjab, where villagers drank liquor laced with methanol, a common adulterant in cheap alcohol that can cause blindness, liver damage, and death. Punjab's chief minister has vowed to punish those responsible, and an investigation is underway to uncover the entire operation. Such incidents are frequent in India, where bootleggers sell vast quantities of cheap, unregulated alcohol to the poor.</p>

          <p>A federal court is hearing arguments in a case challenging President Donald Trump's tariffs, marking the first time his economic agenda has come under legal scrutiny. Five domestic businesses are suing, claiming that Trump exceeded his authority by imposing steep tariffs on over 180 countries and territories. The plaintiffs argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to issue such sweeping duties. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that IEEPA authorizes the president to regulate imports through tariffs under specific circumstances.</p>

          <p>The New World Screwworm (NWS) fly, eradicated from the U.S. since 1966, poses a renewed threat after an outbreak in Mexico, leading to a suspension of cattle, horse, and bison imports along the southern border. Female flies lay eggs in wounds or orifices of warm-blooded animals, and the larvae burrow into the flesh, causing severe damage and potential death. While rare, humans can also be affected, particularly those with open wounds or compromised immune systems. The USDA warns of potential devastating impacts on pets, livestock, wildlife, and humans if an outbreak occurs in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A group of small businesses is challenging President Trump's tariffs in the Court of International Trade, arguing that the president exceeded his authority. The businesses claim that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize Trump to unilaterally impose tariffs. The Department of Justice argues that Congress permits the president to impose tariffs and that Trump's invocation of a national emergency broadens his power. At least six separate lawsuits have targeted Trump's tariffs, making this hearing a high-profile event for the court.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified a man found dead in Oregon over 40 years ago as 30-year-old Larry Eugene Parks, a Vietnam veteran, linking his death to California's “Scorecard Killer,” Randy Kraft. Kraft was convicted of murdering 16 young men in Orange County in 1989, but is believed to have killed more than 60 people across multiple states. Parks' body was found near where another victim linked to Kraft was discovered, and investigative genetic genealogy helped identify him. The Oregon State Police Cold Case Unit is working to bring the case to a close.</p>

          <p>Thomas B. Edsall's guest essay in The New York Times discusses how Donald Trump's repeated attacks on his adversaries mask his own alleged violations of the law and Constitution. Experts argue that Trump's brazen corruption and self-enrichment have become normalized, with his supporters hailing his defiance of norms as a sign he is destroying a rigged system. The article explores how Trump's shamelessness, transparent deals, and lack of contrition are seen as strength and reinforce loyalty among his base, despite his actions being criticized as morally corrupt by others.</p>

          <p>Following the 2024 election, a debate has reignited among economists and policymakers about the effectiveness of “post-neoliberal” economic policies embraced by the Biden administration. Critics argue that Biden’s economic agenda, which centered on government intervention and investment, caused inflation and failed to win back working-class voters. Defenders maintain that the policies were successful in attracting investment and creating jobs, but that the benefits were slow to materialize. The outcome of this debate will shape the economic agenda that Democrats adopt to regain working-class support.</p>
