          <p>Despite key disagreements, Iran and the United States are set to resume high-level discussions regarding Tehran's nuclear program, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and US President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff leading the talks in Oman. The US demands Iran halt uranium enrichment, while Iran insists on its right to enrich for civilian purposes, creating a stalemate. Trump has expressed a preference for a diplomatic solution but has also threatened military action if diplomacy fails, adding pressure to the negotiations. The article highlights the red lines for both nations, with the US demanding the dismantling of Iranian enrichment facilities and Iran asserting its non-negotiable right to enrich uranium. Optimism is tempered by these entrenched positions.</p>

          <p>Former workers and public health officials warn that mass terminations and budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Trump administration are creating a "real danger" of missed disease outbreaks. The HHS workforce is being reduced from 82,000 to 62,000 through firings and buyouts, and grant cuts have impacted state public health agencies, leading to staff layoffs. An epidemiologist from the South Carolina Department of Public Health notes that disease surveillance is critical for identifying and responding to outbreaks early, and cuts to public health staff compromise this system. The article also highlights the dismantling of the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) program and the impact on child support services.</p>

          <p>While overall electric vehicle (EV) exports from China to the UK have decreased, exports of plug-in hybrid vehicles have experienced a significant surge, increasing nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. The UK remains a key export destination for Chinese EVs, subject only to a standard 10% import tariff, unlike the higher tariffs imposed by the European Union. This trend reflects a growing embrace of Chinese car brands among Britons, driven by affordability and a desire for change from traditional European marques. The article highlights the increasing popularity of hybrid vehicles as a viable alternative in the UK market.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net profit, attributed to lower oil prices and production, with net income falling to $26 billion. The company's free cash flow also decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, signaling ongoing strain on its balance sheet amidst global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024 and repeated that figure for the first quarter of 2025, impacting revenue for the Saudi government as it faces widening deficits. The article notes that OPEC+ production cuts and downgrading of oil price outlooks by banks and energy agencies further contribute to the bearish oil market outlook.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed optimism about upcoming peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting a "big week" ahead and emphasizing the potential to end the "bloodbath." This follows Putin's announcement of a unilateral three-day ceasefire, which Ukraine stated was repeatedly violated, and Zelenskyy's counter-offer of a 30-day ceasefire. Putin has proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday, without preconditions, and Zelenskyy has responded positively, calling it "a positive sign."

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, addresses the anxieties and pressures faced by mothers, arguing that being a "perfect mother" is not only unattainable but also harmful. She emphasizes that flaws are an essential part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own imperfections and understand the give-and-take nature of relationships. The article critiques the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems and encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack, recognizing that their efforts are already good enough. The article offers a quiz to help mothers acknowledge their imperfections and embrace self-compassion.</p>

          <p>The article discusses high-yield stocks for dividend investors, cautioning against reaching too far for yield, using AGNC Investment as an example of a mortgage REIT with a high but potentially unsustainable dividend. Realty Income, a REIT with a 5.6% yield and 30 years of annual dividend increases, is presented as a more stable option. Toronto-Dominion Bank, with a 4.7% yield and a long history of dividend payments, is also highlighted as a potentially worthwhile investment.

Texts between Ryan and Sarah, unearthed after her death, show Ryan providing and administering drugs to Sarah, creating an addiction.

          <p>Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has dismissed the recently announced UK-US trade deal as "isn't worth the paper it's written on," pointing to President Trump's history of reversing trade agreements. Stiglitz argues that the deal plays into Trump's strategy of dividing and conquering weaker countries and suggests the UK should have focused on its relationship with the EU. The article highlights concerns about the reliability of agreements with the Trump administration and the potential benefits of closer ties with the EU. Key terms of the deal include reduced tariffs on British car and steel exports and the removal of a UK tariff on ethanol.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, has vowed to continue her legal battle after being released from immigration detention, where she was held for over six weeks for her political speech. Ozturk, who co-authored an op-ed criticizing Tufts' response to the war in Gaza, claims her arrest was unlawful and designed to punish her for exercising her First Amendment rights. A federal judge ordered her release, citing a lack of evidence to justify her detention, and several Democrat politicians have expressed support. The article highlights concerns about the Trump administration's stance on pro-Palestinian activism and its impact on international students.</p>

          <p>Faced with the threat of new sanctions, President Vladimir V. Putin called for direct talks between Ukraine and Russia to be held in Turkey. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, on their first joint visit to Ukraine, said on Saturday that Russia would face “new and massive” sanctions on its banking and energy sectors if President Vladimir V. Putin refused to agree to a full, unconditional 30-day cease-fire. There was no immediate response from Ukraine early Sunday, but about an hour after Mr. Putin’s news conference, authorities reported an attack by Russian exploding drones that set off air alerts in several cities, including Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital.</p>
