          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly advised President Donald Trump to decline the offer of a $400 million jet from Qatar's royal family, citing concerns regarding national security and Qatar's history of divided allegiances. Pence emphasized the potential risks associated with intelligence gathering and ensuring the president's safety during international travel. He suggested that if Qatar wishes to make a gesture of goodwill, they should instead invest the money in infrastructure improvements at a U.S. military base. Trump previously attributed any acceptance of the aircraft to delays from Boeing, the U.S. manufacturer.</p>

          <p>Several Democratic governors are proposing to roll back health insurance coverage for immigrants without legal status, citing budget shortfalls. These efforts to limit access to healthcare programs are emerging as a common theme across states, especially as Congress considers reducing state Medicaid funds for states offering such coverage. California Governor Gavin Newsom wants to freeze new enrollments and charge a monthly premium, while Minnesota is considering making adult immigrants without legal status ineligible for Medicaid. These proposals face pushback from lawmakers and advocates who argue for alternative budget cuts to protect underserved communities.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that President Biden's mental fitness should be questioned, particularly regarding his last-minute pardons, including one for his son Hunter. The author suggests that if Biden's cognitive decline was as rapid as Democrats claim, the pardons might be invalid. The piece criticizes the lack of accountability within the Biden administration and raises concerns about the potential consequences of actions taken during his presidency, calling for scrutiny of his decisions. The piece ends by stating that there is every reason to believe that Bidenâ€™s condition, which was hidden from us, makes his pardons, all of them, null and void.</p>

          <h2>Kyodo News Survey Reveals Record Low Support for Ishiba Cabinet in Japan</h2>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey indicates that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has reached a record low approval rating of 27.4 percent, driven by growing dissatisfaction over rising prices and the government's response. The survey also reveals that a majority of Japanese citizens feel "uneasy" about U.S. President Donald Trump's second term, primarily due to concerns about tariffs and unpredictable actions. Taiwan's last nuclear reactor was shut down capping four decades of operation in line with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy, though whether that goal can be achieved remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the US's credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing rising levels of government debt and a widening budget deficit. This move could add pressure on US government debt, potentially leading to higher interest rates. Investors are hopeful that the downgrade will not have a lasting market impact, although it will focus attention on US debt levels. The White House criticized Moodyâ€™s move, claiming that the economist for Moodyâ€™s is an Obama advisor and Clinton donor who has been a Never Trumper since 2016.</p>
