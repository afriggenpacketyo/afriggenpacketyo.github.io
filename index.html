        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK jobs market is cooling, with a 5.8% drop in vacancies between May and July across most industries, according to the Office for National Statistics. This suggests some firms are not recruiting new workers or replacing those who left, although the slowdown is less sharp than economists predicted. Despite this, average wage growth held at 5%, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.7%. The fall in job openings is expected to contribute to slowing wage growth, a key economic indicator the Bank of England considers for interest rate decisions. One economist forecasts a further interest rate cut this year. (not investment advice)</p>

Harvey died after being stabbed in the heart with a hunting knife at All Saints Catholic High School in Sheffield. His mother, Caroline, expressed that Harvey's name was "tarnished" during the trial while the defendant remained unnamed. The family, who have established a youth club in Harvey's memory, are also reiterating their call for knife arches in schools and increased education on the devastating impact of knife crime.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has cautioned the world against trusting Russia, revealing intelligence suggests Moscow is preparing new offensives rather than a ceasefire, despite upcoming peace talks. This warning comes as Ukraine is notably excluded from the forthcoming discussions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, sparking fears of forced territorial concessions. Zelenskyy firmly stated that no agreement on Ukraine's future can be struck in its absence, a sentiment echoed by European leaders who are also pressing for Kyiv's direct involvement in the high-stakes diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>China has accused the United States of fabricating lies as a "pretext for seeking control" of the Panama Canal, escalating a diplomatic spat. China's Ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, asserted that Beijing respects the canal's neutrality and supports Panama's sovereignty, while condemning "unwarranted accusations" from the U.S. Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea had expressed concerns over China's "outsized influence" on the canal's critical infrastructure and port operations, labeling it a potential threat to global trade and security. This dispute follows former President Trump's unsubstantiated claims about China's secret control of the waterway.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, face a lawsuit from a Hawaii real estate investor and broker, alleging they were unjustly removed from a $240 million luxury housing development. The plaintiffs claim Ohtani and Balelo exploited their celebrity status, demanding concessions from developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr. and broker Tomoko Matsumoto, before compelling their partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, to terminate them. This legal action accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference and unjust enrichment, asserting they undermined the plaintiffs' foundational role in the project for personal financial gain, despite being brought in solely for Ohtani's promotional value.</p>

          <p>The United States Coast Guard has suspended its search for a missing fisherman after his 40-foot fishing vessel, Das Bug, capsized in challenging conditions off the Oregon coast. The incident occurred in 7-foot swells and heavy winds, sending all four crew members into the water. While three individuals were successfully rescued by a Coast Guard Motor Lifeboat crew and treated for hypothermia, the extensive eight-hour search, covering 54 square miles, failed to locate the fourth fisherman. This difficult decision was made as crews were unable to find him, with the Coast Guard extending their thoughts to the family.</p>

The EU's stance comes amid concerns that Trump might push for territorial concessions from Ukraine.

President Trump signed an executive order to prolong the truce until November 10, a move reciprocated by Beijing. This extension provides a window for further negotiations aimed at addressing "trade imbalances" and "unfair trade practices," alongside efforts to enhance US market access in China and tackle national security concerns.

This unprecedented damage, spanning 1,500km, includes areas previously considered resilient to climate change, such as Ningaloo Reef, a World Heritage-listed site. The extensive heat stress caused corals to expel the algae vital for their survival, a process often fatal. Scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science emphasize that climate change is making bleaching events more frequent and intense, giving reefs insufficient time to recover and highlighting the urgent need for global emission reductions.</p>

The majority of their earnings are confiscated by the North Korean state as "loyalty fees," with workers receiving little to no pay until their return home.

          <p>Spain is navigating a precarious foreign policy path by openly challenging the Trump administration on defense and pursuing closer ties with China. Madrid recently opted for European military aircraft over US-made F-35s and resisted committing to NATO's new 5% defense spending target, drawing criticism from President Trump. Analysts suggest Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's minority leftist government may be using foreign policy to divert attention from domestic scandals. While Spain's EU membership provides some protection from direct US tariffs, this assertive stance reflects a broader European desire for strategic rebalancing, though it carries inherent risks for Spain's international relations.</p>

          <p>A trial has commenced regarding California Governor Gavin Newsom's lawsuit against the Trump administration over the controversial deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles protests. The suit alleges a violation of the 19th-century Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, a key figure in the deployment, testified that he never heard the term "rebellion" used to describe the situation, despite the administration's use of it to justify the action. The case scrutinizes the extent of presidential authority to deploy military forces, particularly when federal officials claimed their mission was to protect facilities and personnel, even in the absence of active threats.</p>

          <p>Colombian Senator and presidential hopeful Miguel Uribe Turbay has died two months after being shot three times at a political rally in June, a tragic event that has deeply alarmed the nation. Uribe, 39, was a prominent lawyer and strong critic of Colombia's current leftist government, and his assassination recalls the dark chapters of drug-fueled political violence from the 1990s. While a teenage suspect was arrested and other individuals detained, the masterminds and motive behind the attack remain unknown. His passing has sparked widespread mourning and renewed calls for justice, underscoring the ongoing challenges to political stability in Colombia.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a significant 7-4 loss to the Angels, with pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivering one of his worst major league starts, yielding six runs in less than five innings. This defeat has shrunk the Dodgers' National League West lead to a mere one game over the San Diego Padres. The team's offense struggled against Angels right-hander José Soriano, managing only two hits through six innings. This loss, coupled with recent poor performances, marks another backward step in their campaign, dropping their record to 12-19 since the Fourth of July and raising urgency for improved play.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian firm, Wild Hornets, has unveiled its Sting interceptor drone, recorded flying at speeds up to 195 miles per hour, comparable to a bullet train. This $2,500 first-person-view drone is specifically designed to combat the Iranian-designed Shahed loitering munitions that Russia increasingly employs to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. The Sting's exceptional speed is critical for effectively pursuing and neutralizing these slower, exploding drones. While a small contribution against the vast volume of Russian drone attacks, the Sting offers a cost-effective solution to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities, with pilots reportedly using it to destroy approximately 100 Shahed drones.</p>

Halem, who served about 13 years before transitioning to a reserve role, was arrested by the LAPD’s Robbery-Homicide Division and faces a potential life sentence.
