          <p>Chainalysis data reveals that while 58 crypto wallets made millions on President Donald Trump's $TRUMP meme coin, approximately 764,000 wallets have lost money on the investment. Most wallets that lost money held smaller amounts of the token, while a few wallets amassed significant gains. Interest in the coin surged after the project promised top holders a seat at a dinner with the president. The event includes a reception for the 25 wallets with the largest coin balance, along with a White House tour. (not investment advice)</p>

UK consumers are expected to benefit from lower tariffs on goods coming from India, while UK firms will gain from expanded exports to India.

About 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere, with the bulk coming from Colombia and Ecuador. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers, while others are trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs.</p>

While most healthy people won't experience adverse effects, those with compromised immune systems, the elderly, or those with asthma are at higher risk.

          <p>A bipartisan group of California legislators has released a letter urging the state's congressional delegation to protect the Head Start program from proposed Trump administration cuts. The letter expresses alarm over cuts to the federal early childhood program, which provides childcare, education, and medical care to low-income children. Legislators emphasized the importance of Head Start for working families and the potential economic impact of reducing access to early education. Two of the members speaking at the conference had attended Head Start programs themselves.</p>

          <p>Humanitarian organizations rescuing refugees in the Mediterranean feel abandoned by the European Union, despite over a decade of efforts. They report that the EU has outsourced responsibility for sea rescues to civilian organizations, while agreements with countries like Libya and Tunisia have been criticized for human rights violations. The organizations call for a collective European sea rescue program and an end to cooperation agreements with countries where migrants face abuse. Experts advocate for a European deal with African countries that prioritizes human dignity and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz became Germany's 10th postwar chancellor after an unprecedented initial failure to secure the necessary parliamentary votes. Despite his party's victory in February elections, Merz fell short on the first ballot, raising concerns about his authority and the stability of the new government. After a second vote, Merz secured the chancellorship and now faces challenges including tariff threats, economic malaise, and countering Russian aggression. Political observers suggest the initial setback could hinder his ability to project strength on the world stage and pass critical legislation.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a 12% drop despite the company's ongoing revenue growth acceleration, prompting CEO Alex Karp to defend the company. Analysts attributed the decline to concerns about international revenue and the company's failure to surpass a high growth benchmark. Despite the stock decline, Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year. Karp expressed optimism about the company's future during the earnings call, citing 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the United States does not need to "sign deals" with trade partners, contradicting earlier claims from White House officials about the administration's focus on trade agreements. Trump expressed frustration with questions about when deals would be signed. After weeks of saying that countries were asking for bilateral trade talks with the United States, the president and his team have yet to announce any formal agreements or frameworks.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Defends Abortion Pill Access in Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 16:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration asked a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging access to the abortion pill mifepristone, surprising observers who expected a rollback of abortion rights. Experts suggest this move preserves the administration's ability to strategically attack abortion access in the future. The lawsuit seeks to reverse FDA regulatory changes that expanded access to mifepristone, but the Trump administration argues that the case should not proceed in Texas. The administration is not revealing plans for mifepristone but could attempt to restrict access through the FDA.</p>
