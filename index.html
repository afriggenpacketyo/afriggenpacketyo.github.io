          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, suspending planned tariff hikes that were set to take effect. This extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the additional time will be used for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances, unfair practices, and national security concerns. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two nations have already seen a significant decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Carolina Attorney General's Office has formally pushed back against Alex Murdaugh's appeal for a new trial in his double-murder conviction. In a detailed brief, prosecutors argue that the jury's guilty verdict was based on overwhelming evidence, not on alleged jury tampering by the court clerk, Becky Hill. Murdaugh’s defense claims Hill’s conduct improperly influenced jurors to secure a conviction. The state Supreme Court is expected to hear oral arguments this fall, with a final decision anticipated next spring.</p>

          <p>China's Wing Loong-2 (WL-2) unmanned aerial vehicle is identified as a key asset in both the People's Liberation Army's arsenal and the global export market. The drone, comparable to the U.S. MQ-9 Reaper, has seen combat use by various countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Domestically designated as the GJ-2, it serves as a cornerstone of China's uncrewed reconnaissance and strike capabilities, frequently used in exercises around Taiwan. Its success is attributed to its proven combat record and cost-effective, modular design for foreign buyers.</p>

          <p>Residents and business owners in Huntington Park, California, report that ramped-up immigration enforcement has turned the once-bustling community into a "ghost town." The city, which is over 95% Latino, is experiencing a significant economic downturn as fearful residents stay home. Some local businesses have resorted to locking their doors during operating hours to create a sense of safety for customers. A city council member expressed concern that the fear is harming the local economy and that the community is being unfairly targeted.</p>

It warns that this move could establish a precedent for the president to deploy armed forces in American cities under spurious emergency declarations.

          <h2>Trump's Justification for D.C. Takeover Relies on False Crime Narratives, Analysis Shows</h2>

          <p>An analysis by The Guardian asserts that President Trump's federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police force is based on false and misleading narratives about crime and homelessness. The article fact-checks the president's claims, pointing to official data that shows violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low after a spike in 2023. This report draws parallels to Trump's previous deployment of federal forces in Los Angeles, which was also justified with exaggerated claims of chaos. Experts cited in the article argue that D.C.'s success in reducing crime has come from community-based interventions, not punitive crackdowns.</p>

          <p>Whistleblowers at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned the Charity Commission that the organization is at risk of collapse. The complaint alleges misuse of public funds and a "toxic internal culture," and comes after the UK's Technology Secretary threatened to withdraw funding unless the institute pivots its focus to defense research. Staff members claim this government pressure has triggered a "crisis in governance," putting the institute's future in jeopardy. The institute stated it is undergoing changes to deliver on its national role.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old case of a missing cyclist, Tony Parsons, was solved after his killer's new girlfriend led police to his shallow grave.

When McKellar showed her the remote burial site, she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted police. Parsons' family expressed immense gratitude for her quick thinking, which was crucial in recovering the body and bringing the case to a close.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests President Trump's approach to ending the war in Ukraine prioritizes direct negotiation with Vladimir Putin, effectively sidelining Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump has framed the upcoming bilateral summit in Alaska as a "feel out" meeting to explore a deal potentially involving "land swapping." During a press conference, Trump tellingly misspoke, saying he was "going to Russia on Friday," a gaffe that the article argues reveals how central Putin is to his foreign policy narrative, leaving Ukraine's interests in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his stance on Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, calling him a "success" after a meeting at the White House, just days after demanding his immediate resignation. Last week, Trump had called Tan "highly CONFLICTED," echoing concerns from Senator Tom Cotton about the CEO's past ties to China. Following the meeting, which included cabinet members, Trump announced that Tan and his team would be bringing him suggestions in the coming week. The sudden shift in tone reflects the administration's complex and often volatile relationship with the semiconductor industry.</p>

          <p>A 51-story residential skyscraper has received approval from the Los Angeles City Council for a location in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The project, planned by a New York developer, is set to include 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not provided a timeline for construction, reflecting a challenging financial climate for new development. High interest rates, tariffs, and rising labor costs are creating uncertainty for developers despite high demand for housing in the city. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The gunman who attacked the CDC headquarters in Atlanta fired over 180 shots at the campus, breaking approximately 150 windows and causing extensive damage. According to internal agency information, bullets penetrated even "blast-resistant" windows, and repairs could take weeks or months. The attack was carried out by a man who reportedly blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for his mental health issues; he killed a police officer before later dying himself. The incident has raised concerns about the long-term impact of anti-science rhetoric on the safety of public health officials.</p>
