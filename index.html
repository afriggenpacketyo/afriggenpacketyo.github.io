          <p>A broad daylight shooting in south Minneapolis resulted in one death and six injuries, three of which are critical, after a suspect fired approximately 30 rounds from a high-velocity rifle at a busy intersection. Police Chief Brian O'Hara condemned the "sickening and unacceptable" violence, noting that at least one victim was targeted in the attack. The shooter fled the scene, and while investigators are actively pursuing strong leads, no arrests have been made yet. This incident has caused significant fear and concern within the local community, with residents recounting taking shelter, underscoring the ongoing challenges for public safety despite police efforts to enhance presence and vigilance.</p>

          <p>Bain Capital, the controlling shareholder of luxury parka maker Canada Goose, is evaluating take-private bids valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International, along with others, have submitted offers as Bain seeks to offload its stake after a 12-year investment cycle. The move comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum, facing declining sales in key markets like China and the EMEA region, and questions regarding its brand positioning amid cautious consumer spending. Going private could offer buyers greater autonomy to implement a turnaround strategy without public scrutiny, despite the company's shares gaining over 21% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the firing of Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, citing "gross negligence" and "potentially criminal" false statements on mortgage documents. Cook and her attorney, Abbe Lowell, immediately declared the action illegal and vowed to file a lawsuit, asserting that a president can only remove a Fed governor "for cause" under federal law. Cook's term runs until 2038, and the Federal Reserve stated it would abide by any court decision, emphasizing the importance of governors' long, fixed terms for independent monetary policy. The allegations against Cook, first raised by Bill Pulte, are part of broader attacks by Trump against the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over interest rate policies.</p>

          <p>Civil rights groups, including the NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, have filed a lawsuit against Texas, seeking to overturn new congressional maps. They allege the maps, designed to favor Republicans in the 2026 midterms, dilute the electoral influence of Black voters, violating the Voting Rights Act. NAACP President Derrick Johnson stated that white voters control over 73% of congressional seats despite being only 40% of the state's population, calling the mid-decade redistricting racially motivated and unconstitutional. The lawsuit follows intense partisan debate in the Texas House, where Democrats accused Republicans of gerrymandering, while Republicans insisted the maps were legally drawn based on changing voter demographics.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Wednesday as investors processed China's industrial profits data and anticipated new U.S. tariffs on India. China reported a 1.5% slip in industrial profits in July, a recovery from steeper declines, while additional U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian exports, raising overall duties to 50%, were set to take effect. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw marginal gains, led by Nikon Corporation's surge on acquisition rumors, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 showed slight declines and gains, respectively. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 posted increases, with some economists noting "irrational exuberance" in the latter, though not yet a bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is launching a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to counter negative perceptions, even as National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen performing cleanup duties in public parks. While some Guard members patrol with police, about 110 are assigned to litter removal, creating unusual optics. Destination DC, the city's marketing arm, aims to build on record 2024 visitor numbers and mitigate an anticipated drop in international tourism for 2025. The campaign, profiling locals, seeks to separate "rhetoric from reality" ahead of America's 250th anniversary in 2026, which is expected to bring significant cultural renovations and millions more visitors.</p>

          <p>India's $434 billion merchandise export sector, particularly its $86.51 billion in goods shipped to the U.S., faces substantial challenges as President Trump's additional 25% tariffs take effect, raising total duties to 50%.

Key export sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics are highly exposed, with some already facing high existing tariffs. While some electronic and pharmaceutical goods are currently exempt, Trump has threatened future duties on pharma, creating widespread uncertainty and potentially eroding India's export competitiveness against regional rivals.

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a reduced decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest contraction in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels, which have enhanced corporate profitability. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell by 1.7%. State-backed companies experienced a 7.5% drop in profits during this period, while businesses with foreign investments saw a 1.8% increase.

          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. The teen received a suspended 18-month sentence after confessing to aiding an acquaintance who planned to use knives or explosives outside the stadium. Prosecutors stated the defendant supported the Islamic State group's ideology and sent bomb-building instructions, as well as organizing contact with an IS member. Austrian authorities arrested two suspects in August 2024, just before the concerts, which were expected to draw up to 65,000 fans inside and 30,000 onlookers outside.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department under President Trump is investigating whether former senior FBI officials mishandled classified documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation, found in "burn bags" at the bureau's headquarters. This probe follows years of Trump's criticism of the "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation, which he called a "hoax." Fox News initially reported the discovery of thousands of Russia-related documents by FBI Director Kash Patel. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard further fueled the controversy by declassifying documents and accusing Obama-era officials of "treasonous conspiracy," referring the matter for potential criminal investigation. No criminal charges have been filed, and former President Obama's spokesperson dismissed the allegations as "bizarre."</p>

          <p>The small town of Mason, Tennessee, is divided over plans to reopen a shuttered private prison as a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center. Supporters, including Mayor Eddie Noeman, argue the CoreCivic-owned facility will bring over 200 jobs and significant revenue to the financially struggling town. However, Alderwoman Virginia Rivers and other residents oppose it, citing concerns about mistreatment of detainees and the ethics of a for-profit prison, stating, "All money is not good money." President Trump's reversal of a Biden-era policy against renewing private prison contracts enabled the reopening. Critics also point to CoreCivic's history of staffing deficiencies and higher inmate fatality rates compared to government-run prisons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled another $175 million in funding for California’s high-speed rail project, further jeopardizing the state's ambitious but delayed plans. This latest withdrawal, for grade separation and a Madera station, follows a previous cancellation of $4 billion in federal grants earlier this summer. California has sued to challenge these funding cuts, calling the decision illegal and politically motivated. The 16-year project, aiming to link Los Angeles and San Francisco, has faced numerous delays and cost escalations, with current projections placing service along a portion of the line by 2033 at a cost of up to $128 billion. State lawmakers suggest a $1 billion annual investment is now needed to continue the project.</p>

Although visually dramatic, these storms are common in dry regions and typically last 10-30 minutes.
