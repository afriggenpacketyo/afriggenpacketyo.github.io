          <p>Linda Yaccarino is stepping down as the CEO of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, after joining the company in June 2023. In a farewell note, she expressed gratitude to Elon Musk for the opportunity to lead the company's transformation and protect free speech. Her tenure focused on reviving advertising revenue after many major brands paused spending following Musk's acquisition. Despite a significant drop in the company's market value, Yaccarino's leadership saw the return of key advertisers like Amazon and Apple, though her departure comes amid a new chapter for the company involving Musk's xAI venture.</p>

          <p>Reports suggest that former President Donald Trump is considering naming a "shadow chair" for the Federal Reserve, a move intended to pressure the current chair, Jerome Powell, into cutting interest rates. This has raised concerns among economists and market analysts about the future independence of the central bank. A new chair appointed under such circumstances could face a significant credibility problem, as they might be perceived as being in place solely to enact the president's political agenda rather than making data-driven decisions. Such a scenario could introduce substantial uncertainty and potential volatility into financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sitting around a campfire may provide therapeutic benefits for mental health, according to psychologists and researchers. Studies have shown that the experience can lead to significant reductions in blood pressure and foster improved social interactions. Experts note that the natural setting encourages people to disconnect from technology and daily stressors, creating a disarming and non-judgmental environment for engagement. This atmosphere can help individuals, especially those who are anxious or hesitant, to connect with others and share personal experiences, leveraging the restorative effects of being in nature to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>

          <p>The European Union has indicated that a preliminary trade agreement with the United States could be reached within days, even as President Donald Trump threatens a new wave of tariffs. Trump announced plans to impose a 50% tariff on imported copper and has issued letters threatening duties on numerous countries, including EU trading partners. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic expressed optimism about finalizing a framework agreement soon, taking advantage of a deadline extension to August 1. However, some officials caution that negotiations remain complex, and the new measures could push U.S. tariffs to their highest levels since the 1930s.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colorado State University researchers are predicting an above-average Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, with an updated forecast estimating 16 named storms, eight of which will become hurricanes. Three of these are expected to become major hurricanes, reaching Category 3 or higher. The forecast anticipates hurricane activity to be about 125% higher than the 1991-2020 average, driven primarily by warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures. While this is slightly less intense than the 2024 prediction, the absence of a strong El Niño pattern, which typically suppresses storm formation, contributes to the heightened risk for coastal regions.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flash floods in Central Texas has climbed to at least 119, with search and recovery operations continuing for more than 170 people who remain missing. The disaster, which occurred over the holiday weekend, was centered in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes. A girls' summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely impacted, with at least 27 campers and counselors confirmed dead and several still missing.

In a letter, a detective chief superintendent expressed sorrow that the main suspect cannot be prosecuted.

          <p>Following a recent conflict with Israel, attention has turned to the question of who will succeed Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The selection process, which has only occurred once before in 1989, is now seen as more urgent. Potential successors range from Khamenei's son to past reformist presidents, but the choice remains secret to prevent political attacks on the nominee. Analysts are divided on whether the next leader will be a cleric or if the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps might favor a different path, potentially leading to a de-escalation of tensions with the West after a period of significant setbacks.</p>

Trump is expected to open a new course at the Trump International Scotland property. While no private meeting with King Charles is anticipated during this trip, a full state visit to the UK is planned for later in the year. The potential visit requires a significant policing operation, recalling his last presidential trip in 2018, which was met with major protests and a large security presence.</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced plans to offer a generic version of semaglutide in Canada, as the patent for Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy is set to expire there in January. This marks the company's first expansion into Canada and positions it to compete in the growing market for GLP-1 medications. The move follows Novo Nordisk's decision to let its Canadian patent lapse after failing to pay maintenance fees. Hims & Hers joins other drugmakers, like Sandoz, that are preparing to launch cheaper, generic versions of the highly sought-after treatment.</p>

          <p>Carlo Ancelotti, the current manager of the Brazil national football team, has been handed a one-year suspended prison sentence by a Spanish court for tax evasion. The case relates to his failure to pay approximately €1 million in taxes on his salary during his first tenure as manager of Real Madrid between 2013 and 2015. Under Spanish law, Ancelotti will not serve jail time as the sentence is under two years and he has no prior convictions. He is required to pay a fine of over €386,000, having already paid back the full tax debt in 2021.</p>

Market analyst Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto Nvidia stock for the long term rather than engaging in short-term trading. In other business news, coffee giant Starbucks has reportedly received interest from nearly 30 firms about acquiring a stake in its Chinese operations, a move that could value the division at up to $10 billion.

The audio, detailed in a forthcoming book, highlights Trump's candid and aggressive rhetoric behind closed doors on the campaign trail. A White House spokeswoman responded by stating that Russia did not invade Ukraine while Trump was in office, attributing this to his leadership and a policy of "peace through strength."</p>

The Neptune missile system is a crucial weapon for Ukraine, famously used to sink Russia's Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, in 2022.

While some college professors report that even top students struggle with complex texts, hard data proving a decline in college-level reading comprehension is scarce. However, national test scores for younger students show a clear drop in reading proficiency over the past decade, a trend that predates the pandemic. Experts point to various potential factors, including increased screen time and changes in teaching methods, but there is no consensus on the primary cause or the most effective solution for this complex issue.</p>
