          <p>Hurricane Imelda strengthened to a Category 1 storm early Tuesday, located north of Great Abaco Island and west-southwest of Bermuda. The storm, the ninth named one of the 2025 Atlantic season, is projected to move away from the Bahamas and towards Bermuda, with further strengthening anticipated. While swells from Imelda and Hurricane Humberto are impacting the U.S. East Coast, potentially causing life-threatening rip currents, Imelda itself is not expected to make U.S. landfall. Coastal North Carolina may experience isolated flash flooding from associated rainfall.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are recommending at least an 11-year prison sentence for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, despite his acquittal on more serious sex trafficking charges. Following his conviction on two counts of transportation for prostitution, prosecutors argue Combs remains unrepentant and inflicted "decades of unchecked violence" and psychological damage on victims like Cassie Ventura. They cite hotel security footage depicting physical abuse and emphasize the need for a sentence reflecting the harm caused. Defense attorneys, however, criticize the recommendation as "draconian," advocating for time served.</p>

          <p>The Federal Unionists Network and 35 unions have called on Democratic congressional leaders to resist Republican budget demands, even if it means a government shutdown. These federal workers express willingness to forgo paychecks to protect critical public services and ensure appropriated funds are spent. The article suggests this stance offers Democrats a chance to reclaim their identity and connect with their base on issues of economic justice and public welfare. It highlights the workers' solidarity in prioritizing public good over immediate personal financial impact.</p>

          <p>China's new K visa program, designed to attract young foreign STEM graduates with streamlined entry and employment opportunities, is drawing significant criticism domestically. The initiative faces backlash fueled by competition for jobs, a struggling local job market, and immigration anxieties within China. Public policy analysts suggest that greater transparency, clearer messaging, and strict oversight are essential to address the growing unease among the Chinese populace regarding the scheme's implementation. Details on eligibility criteria remain scarce, contributing to public uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Gregory's Coffee, a U.S. chain, is confronting soaring coffee prices, which have jumped nearly 21% in the past year, reaching a record average of $8.87 per pound.

Despite not yet raising prices, the company anticipates doing so soon to protect its business amidst rising costs across the supply chain.

          <p>Borrowers have seen mortgage rates decline recently, with the average 30-year fixed rate reaching a three-year low of 6.13% after the Federal Reserve's first 2025 interest rate cut. While a further Fed rate cut is anticipated in October, experts suggest it may not significantly impact mortgage rates, as markets often price in such decisions in advance. Mortgage rates are more directly influenced by Treasury yields, which may already reflect an expected 0.25% cut. Homeowners with high rates from recent years are advised to explore refinancing options, especially adjustable-rate mortgages, though with caution regarding associated risks.

The ICO's investigation probed Imgur's compliance with UK data protection laws and children's code, noting the platform did not require age declarations for account setup. Imgur's decision, described by regulators as a "commercial decision," means UK users can no longer view or upload content, nor will embedded Imgur content display on third-party sites.

          <p>Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins supported the recent interest rate cut but expressed caution regarding future reductions, citing persistent inflation threats. Speaking in New York, Collins noted a "highly uncertain environment" with risks of both higher inflation and a weakening labor market. While acknowledging a "modestly restrictive policy stance" is appropriate, she indicated that further easing this year would depend on incoming data. The looming government shutdown poses an additional challenge, as it could halt key economic data releases, including the crucial nonfarm payrolls report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that over 400 individuals, primarily low-income women, have been charged with pregnancy-related crimes in 16 U.S. states since Roe v. Wade was overturned two years ago. Most prosecutions, concentrated in Alabama and Oklahoma, involved allegations of substance use during pregnancy under child abuse or neglect laws, with 16 cases escalating to homicide charges. Pregnancy Justice, the reproductive justice group behind the research, argues these cases cement "fetal personhood" doctrine, potentially at the expense of women's rights. The tally is likely an undercount, as many laws intended for children are being applied to fetuses.</p>
