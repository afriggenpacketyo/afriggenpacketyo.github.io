          <p>India's market regulator, SEBI, has temporarily barred U.S. firm Jane Street Group from accessing India's securities market and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. SEBI accuses the firm of widespread market manipulation, specifically influencing the Nifty 50 index by aggressively buying banking sector stocks and futures early in the day, then placing large bets on the index's decline. The regulator stated Jane Street's rapid reversal of trades lacked plausible economic rationale, serving only to profit from larger options positions. Jane Street disputes these findings and affirms its commitment to regulatory compliance, while SEBI emphasizes protecting retail investors and market integrity against such "egregious behavior."

          <p>A residential fire in Pacoima, Los Angeles, caused by active fireworks inside a detached garage, left a 33-year-old woman in critical but stable condition and damaged three homes and a car. Over 100 firefighters responded, containing the blaze in just under an hour, while a 68-year-old woman suffered smoke inhalation. Witnesses described feeling an "explosion" as fireworks detonated, causing multiple fires. The Los Angeles Fire Department's HazMat and arson investigators, along with the LAPD Bomb Squad, are currently conducting an ongoing investigation into the dangerous incident.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are battling extensive wildfires near Athens and on the island of Crete, where over 5,000 tourists, hotel workers, and residents have been evacuated from the Ierapetra area. The blazes have damaged homes and businesses, with some farm animals perishing. Simultaneously, wildfires in western Turkey have claimed at least two lives and forced thousands to flee, disrupting daily life and causing road closures. These escalating incidents underscore the intensifying conditions driven by climate change, even as Turkey recently adopted a landmark climate law targeting net-zero emissions by 2053.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will levy anti-dumping tariffs on European cognac, predominantly from France, for the next five years, effective this Saturday. The Ministry of Commerce stated that its investigation found dumping margins ranging from 27.7% to 34.9%, posing a "material threat of injury" to China's domestic brandy industry. This decision, announced just before a Chinese Foreign Minister's visit to Paris, comes ahead of the original July 5 deadline for the anti-dumping investigation. No retroactive duties will be imposed on imports from October 11 up to Friday, but the move signals ongoing trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's public invitation for a major banknote redesign has received over 2,000 responses, sparking creative ideas for the next series of £5, £10, £20, and £50 notes. Suggestions range from national treasures like British Bulldogs and famous landmarks such as the Angel of the North, to classic British TV characters and vintage trains, celebrating UK heritage and popular culture. While some advocate for retaining historical figures, others question the necessity of a significant overhaul given the declining use of cash, even proposing mobile phone imagery to reflect modern payment methods. The Bank is considering various themes, indicating a potential shift from traditional historical figures.</p>

          <p>Kyiv experienced its most intense Russian aerial attack since the war began, with a record 550 drones and 11 missiles striking almost every district, injuring at least 23 people and damaging railway infrastructure and buildings. This massive bombardment occurred hours after a phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, where Trump expressed disappointment that Putin was unwilling to end the war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha condemned the attacks, linking them to Putin's disregard for peace efforts and calling for immediate, tougher sanctions. The strikes highlight escalating hostilities amidst stalled ceasefire talks and a recent pause in US weapon shipments, impeding Ukraine's defense capabilities.</p>

The article highlights potential federal funding cuts for cities experiencing anti-ICE protests and visa denials affecting international athletes from countries on Trump's travel ban lists.

Despite an initial stock dip, analysts believe Pop Mart International, the company behind popular Labubu dolls, will largely be insulated from intensifying scrutiny. They argue the company primarily targets Gen Z and millennial adults with adequate purchasing power, not young children. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapidly growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, are expected to cushion any domestic regulatory impact, with foreign revenue projected to surpass half its total sales this year.</p>

          <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, UK, has persisted for six months, leading to "apocalyptic" piles of rubbish and a pervasive stench across the city, causing significant concern for residents. The dispute, involving members of the Unite union, began in January over plans to downgrade some roles as part of the city council's attempts to sort out its equal pay liabilities. Kerbside green waste and recycling collections have been suspended, resulting in the city's recycling rate plummeting to the lowest of any unitary authority in the country. Despite the council's commitment to resolving the dispute, no end to the industrial action is yet in sight.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer revealed he has built a "good personal relationship" with U.S. President Donald Trump, based on shared family values, noting Trump's condolence call after his brother's death. Starmer claims this rapport, despite their differing political backgrounds, helped secure a vital U.S. tariff deal for UK industries, alleviating "anxiety writ large" among factory workers. He also highlighted "over a glass of wine" discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron that paved the way for a new EU agreement, which he asserts will lead to lower food prices in British supermarkets. Starmer emphasizes the national interest in forging such close international ties.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has passed Congress, marking a critical legislative victory intended to finance key campaign promises, including extensive tax cuts and massive cash injections into immigration controls and military spending. The bill also ramps up fossil fuel incentives while winding down clean energy initiatives, and introduces changes to health and social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. Nonpartisan analysts project it will add $3.4 trillion to the national debt. Despite being a political win for Trump, the bill is largely unpopular with the public, particularly due to its significant cuts to the social safety net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Ben McLemore has been found guilty by an Oregon jury of sexual assault, unlawful sexual penetration, and sexual abuse. The charges stemmed from an October 2021 party where prosecutors argued the 21-year-old woman was incapacitated after heavy drinking and unable to give consent, presenting evidence including photos of her passed out. McLemore's defense claimed consensual sex, while the victim testified she froze in terror during the assault. The woman pursued the criminal case without seeking monetary compensation, emphasizing that "you can't do that to somebody." Sentencing is scheduled for Wednesday, highlighting the pursuit of justice regardless of celebrity status.</p>

This move follows Russia's removal of the Taliban from its list of terrorist organizations and a history of engagement, despite widespread international condemnation of the Taliban's human rights violations, particularly against women and girls, which the UN calls "gender apartheid."</p>

While details are scarce, the plan, if realized, would require unprecedented event infrastructure, as the proposed audience size exceeds most NBA arena capacities.
