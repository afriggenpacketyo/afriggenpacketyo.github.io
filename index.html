          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced its third equipment outage in under two weeks, leading to significant flight delays and cancellations. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that a backup air traffic control system experienced a momentary failure, resulting in a 45-minute ground stop. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to reduce the number of flights in the coming weeks as a temporary fix and said a new direct line from Newark to the Philly TRACON is under construction. Passengers expressed frustration, citing repeated delays and disruptions to their travel plans, while officials assured the public that flights are safe despite the issues.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. Both countries will suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days and continue negotiations, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that neither side desires a decoupling of their economies, and China will suspend countermeasures adopted in retaliation for escalating tariffs. This agreement aims to break an impasse that had disrupted trade, with economists warning of potential global economic slowdown, inflation, and product shortages.</p>

          <p>Nina Mohanty, a millennial entrepreneur, has raised $2 million to create Bloom Money, a fintech app designed to support U.K.-based immigrant communities in collaborative money-saving methods known as "money circles." The app addresses the gap in mainstream banking services that often overlook how immigrant communities manage their finances, focusing on pooling resources and building wealth rather than just remittances. Bloom Money aims to digitize and regulate this informal system, offering a secure and transparent platform while also fighting for a more diverse formal financial system. The app allows users to create and participate in savings circles, ensuring that funds are used for the benefit of the entire group.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Senator Josh Hawley argues against proposed Republican cuts to Medicaid, emphasizing the program's importance for working-class families and its popularity among Republican voters. Hawley highlights that Medicaid serves over 70 million Americans, including many in his state of Missouri, where voters mandated its expansion. He contends that cutting Medicaid would harm vulnerable families, close rural hospitals, and contradict President Trump's promises to protect social insurance programs. Hawley advocates for policies that support working families, such as capping prescription drug costs and providing tax cuts, rather than eliminating their healthcare.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the debate surrounding food additives in the United States, highlighting concerns about the safety and regulation of the estimated 10,000 additives allowed in American food. It contrasts the U.S. system, which allows companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without prior FDA approval through the GRAS pathway, with Europe's more cautious approach. The article points out that many chemicals in food are not tested for long-term health effects or interactions with other chemicals, and regulators don't routinely re-examine chemicals already on the market, which raises questions about the safety of ultraprocessed foods.</p>

          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has cautioned Democrats against dismissing female candidates in the 2028 election following Kamala Harris's loss to Donald Trump. Klobuchar highlighted the successes of women in leadership roles globally and in U.S. state elections, refuting claims that Harris's defeat indicates a broader issue with female candidates. Her remarks contrasted with Joe Biden's comments attributing Harris's loss to sexism, and Klobuchar suggested that a more competitive primary could have benefited the party. While acknowledging current challenges, she emphasized the need to focus on helping Americans rather than dwelling on the past.</p>

          <p>President Trump is facing scrutiny for allegedly attempting to use the IRS for political purposes, drawing comparisons to Richard Nixon's efforts to weaponize the tax agency. Trump's actions, such as threatening to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status and sharing taxpayer data with immigration officials, have raised concerns about political interference. Despite laws enacted after Watergate to prevent such meddling, the Trump administration's actions are testing these protections. Critics argue that these moves risk politicizing the IRS and undermining its independence, while supporters defend them as necessary measures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food scientists have discovered that white rice and pasta contain a hidden superfood called resistant starch, which can be unlocked by cooking and chilling these carbohydrates. Resistant starch improves gut health, lowers inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, and helps manage blood sugar levels. This process transforms digestible starch into resistant starch, which our enzymes cannot break down, resulting in less sugar being released into the blood. The same trick works with other foods containing digestible starch, including potatoes and whole grains, making them even healthier.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are working on an overhaul of federal student loan repayment plans, aiming to simplify the system with two primary options: a standard plan with fixed monthly payments and a Repayment Assistance Plan tied to income. The standard plan would offer repayment windows of 10 to 25 years based on debt size, while the Repayment Assistance Plan would base payments on adjusted gross income, with a minimum of $10 per month. This plan would also waive remaining interest after payments and reduce principal balances, but would eliminate President Biden's SAVE Plan and restrict borrowers from changing plans later. Experts have differing views on the impact of these proposed changes.</p>

Research suggests that microplastics, which can leach from cutting boards and containers, may have negative health effects, though more research is needed. To reduce exposure, experts recommend replacing plastic tools with wooden, glass, or metal alternatives, and avoiding heating food in plastic containers. Restaurants are also exploring sustainable practices by ditching plastic and opting for more permanent and safer alternatives, which also promotes a more careful and focused approach among staff.</p>

          <p>Following a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan, India has reopened its airports. A DW correspondent reported a sense of relief among locals near the Line of Control, noting it was the first peaceful morning in days, but cautioned that the situation remains fragile. The correspondent emphasized that both sides will need to put in a lot of effort to iron out the details of the ceasefire, as previous agreements have been broken repeatedly.

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has been engaged in a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced that it will lay down its arms and disband. This decision follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the organization to dissolve itself, as he believes there is no alternative to democracy. The PKK, considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU, UK, and US, has been fighting for greater Kurdish rights and autonomy. The move is seen as an important step toward a "terror-free Turkey," but the process will be monitored by state institutions.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or P.K.K., announced that it would lay down its arms and disband, a decision that could reshape Turkish politics and influence Kurdish militias in neighboring countries. The announcement came a few months after its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, urged the group to disarm and disband, saying that the groupâ€™s armed struggle had outlived its initial purpose and that further progress in the struggle for Kurdish rights could be achieved through politics. The move could end a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives and is seen as a boon for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.</p>
