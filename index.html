          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen reported that a US airstrike struck a migrant center in the Sadaa governorate, resulting in the deaths of at least 68 people and injuries to 47 others. The rebels' Civil Defense organization released graphic footage purportedly showing bodies and wounded individuals at the site. The US military has not yet commented on the incident. This follows recent US military actions targeting Houthi facilities in response to their attacks on ships near the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, actions taken in retaliation for Israel's offensive in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Tess Segal, a Jewish student at the University of Florida, was arrested during a protest advocating for divestment from weapons manufacturers and a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. Despite the state dismissing the charges, the university banned her from campus and proposed a suspension, later extended to three years by the dean. Segal was prevented from taking her final exam and participating in a summer program. The university cited disruption to normal functions and interference with law enforcement duties as justification for the extended suspension, though it would not officially comment due to privacy laws.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that increased infrastructure spending in Germany will not fully counteract the negative effects of U.S. tariffs on the euro zone's economic growth. The IMF recently lowered its growth forecasts for the euro area for the next two years, citing President Trump's volatile tariff policies. Alfred Kammer, director of the IMF's European department, stated that trade tensions and tariffs are weighing heavily on the outlook, despite Germany's efforts to stimulate its economy through increased defense spending and infrastructure investments.</p>

          <p>Following their Premier League victory, Liverpool is considering strengthening its defense with potential signings in the full-back and center-back positions. Trent Alexander-Arnold is rumored to be joining Real Madrid, and Andrew Robertson is 31, leading to speculation about replacements. Former Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy suggests that the club's defensive priorities lie at left-back, but the emergence of Conor Bradley could provide a replacement for Alexander-Arnold if he departs.

          <p>A new study suggests that the Han dynasty's conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in 112 BC contributed to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress, a critically endangered tree species. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen analysis, and historical records to connect the military campaign with changes in the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples from ancient battlegrounds revealed a decline in swamp cypress pollen and a spike in charcoal deposits around 100 BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Panyu, the Nanyue capital, which was set ablaze.</p>

The tariffs are seen as a Luddite trap, shielding domestic automakers from competition while simultaneously cutting them off from advancements in electrification, digitization, and automation.

          <p>The absence of China's top general, He Weidong, from a recent Politburo study session has fueled speculation regarding his whereabouts. He, the second-ranked vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), has not been seen in public since March 11. Beijing has not provided an official explanation for his absence, though analysts do not anticipate any impact to China’s political stability. His absence from key events where top CMC leaders are typically present has heightened the scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policies in England are set to affect over four million pupils, aiming to reduce the cost for families by limiting the number of compulsory branded items. The government estimates that seven in ten secondary schools and 35% of primary schools will need to reduce the number of branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students. While the government anticipates savings for parents, uniform retailers warn that the changes could lead to increased costs due to the need to replace lower-quality generic garments more frequently.</p>
