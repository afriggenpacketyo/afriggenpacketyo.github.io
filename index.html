          <p>President Trump appointed Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia after withdrawing Ed Martin's nomination due to lack of Senate support. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and past experience as a district attorney. Pirro's appointment fills a crucial role overseeing criminal prosecutions and civil cases in D.C. and marks a significant shift as she steps down from her position at Fox News to take on this new legal challenge. The article notes that Trump plans to appoint Martin to the Department of Justice as the new Director of the Weaponization Working Group, Associate Deputy Attorney General, and Pardon Attorney.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are pushing for a reevaluation of World War II history, suggesting that the start date should be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. They argue that the current Western-centric view diminishes China's significant role in fighting against fascism. This proposal comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. The article states that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, further highlighting China's involvement in the war.</p>

The suit, brought by activist groups, claims the school favors Black applicants with lower scores while requiring near-perfect scores from white and Asian applicants. The lawsuit alleges that admissions officials openly discussed race and used it as a factor in decision-making. The suit comes amid scrutiny of UCLA and other UC campuses for potential "illegal DEI" practices in admissions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed including a tax increase on wealthy Americans in an upcoming fiscal package, potentially reversing a key element of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
