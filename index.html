          <p>Bernie Sanders has criticized President Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles in response to immigration protests, describing it as a move towards authoritarianism. Sanders highlighted that the deployment occurred without the request of California's governor or Los Angeles' mayor, asserting that Trump believes he has unchecked power. Sanders also pointed to Trump's attacks on the media, law firms, universities, and judges, arguing that the president is usurping congressional powers and undermining the Constitution. Sanders urged Republicans in Congress to stand up for the Constitution and the rule of law, emphasizing the need to resist what he sees as Trump's consolidation of power.</p>

          <p>Helen Hunt has discussed her decision to reject Hollywood's beauty standards after years of feeling "misery and shame" about her physical appearance. Hunt, now 61, shared that she internalized the pressure to look a certain way early in her career but eventually decided to prioritize her mental well-being. She mentioned being influenced by "The Only Diet There Is," a book promoting intuitive eating and self-acceptance. Hunt joins other '90s stars like Christina Applegate, who have spoken about the struggles with body image and eating disorders stemming from the pressures of fame. Hunt's experience demonstrates the importance of self-acceptance in an industry often driven by unrealistic beauty standards.</p>

          <p>President Trump has invoked a rarely used law to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to quell immigration protests in California, bypassing the authority of Governor Gavin Newsom.

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia early Sunday, with the epicenter located 17 kilometers northeast of Paratebueno. The U.S. Geological Service reported the quake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometers, and the Colombian Geological Service recorded additional tremors ranging from 4 to 4.6 in magnitude shortly after. The National Unit for Disaster Risk Management is assessing the situation in several municipalities. While images on social media showed people in Bogota evacuating workplaces, initial reports indicate no casualties or significant damage. Colombia's location in the Pacific Ring of Fire makes it prone to frequent seismic activity.</p>

          <p>A US marshal in Arizona was briefly detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents after being mistakenly identified as a subject they were seeking. The deputy marshal was released once his identity was confirmed by other law enforcement officers. This incident occurred amidst pressure from the White House for ICE agents to increase arrests, with reports indicating a target of 3,000 arrests per day. The Trump administration appears to be shifting towards a more generalized detention of undocumented immigrants, rather than focusing on those with criminal histories, which has raised concerns among advocates.</p>

Blow points to examples such as the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural and the removal of Harriet Tubman's image from a National Park Service page.

Half of Americans think Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program. While more people believe the program makes the U.S. safer, a larger share thinks it will weaken the economy.
