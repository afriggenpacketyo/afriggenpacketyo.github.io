          <p>South African Police Minister Senzo Mchunu stated that crime statistics disprove allegations of a 'white genocide,' noting that between January and March, five of six farm murder victims were black. This is the first time South Africa's crime statistics have been broken down by race, which Mchunu did in response to these claims. Trump had previously amplified claims of genocide, which led to attempts to reset relations after Trump granted asylum to Afrikaners. Mchunu also rejected Trump's allegations about government land expropriation, emphasizing that crime impacts all societal sections. The BBC found that Trump's evidence contained numerous falsehoods.</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax and policy bill would repeal subsidies critical to electric vehicle (EV) growth, potentially slowing sales and production in the United States. The measure would eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, EV purchases, and charging stations, while imposing a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts suggest that if the bill passes, EV prices would rise, and some automakers might delay factory plans, leaving the U.S. behind China and Europe in EV adoption. While analysts still expect EV sales to grow due to improving battery technology, the bill could significantly handicap the United States' ability to compete in the EV market. </p>

Tech giants like Amazon and Oracle have invested heavily, with Oracle developing a $1.4 billion Nashville campus for its global headquarters. The city's 10-year strategy has created over 600,000 jobs since 1990, significantly increasing per-capita income. Commercial and residential real estate have boomed, though affordable housing remains a challenge.

          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee indicated that President Trump's recent tariff threats have complicated monetary policy, likely delaying interest rate changes. Goolsbee stated that while he anticipates rates being lower in the future, the Fed will likely hold off on adjustments to evaluate the impact of the evolving trade policy on inflation and employment. He emphasized the need for clarity on trade before acting, noting that tariffs causing stagflation would be the central bank's worst-case scenario. Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, stressed the importance of not precommitting to a course of action given the current uncertainty. </p>

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell in early trading following Trump's posts on Truth Social. Trump proposed a 25% tariff on Apple if it didn't move iPhone production to the U.S. and a 50% tariff on the EU, citing stalled trade negotiations. European markets also reacted negatively, with major indices in Germany, Paris, and London all declining.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant job cuts and restructuring major federal agencies as part of its DOGE initiative. Judge Susan Illston issued a preliminary injunction, pausing further reductions in force and reorganization, asserting that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates. The Trump administration appealed the decision, arguing that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating and funding federal agencies. The judge emphasized that large-scale executive branch reorganization requires partnership with Congress.</p>

          <p>A House Republican tax bill, the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' is projected to disproportionately benefit wealthy Americans through tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners, while negatively impacting low-income households due to reductions in social safety net programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bottom tenth of households would see a 2% income decrease in 2027 and a 4% decrease in 2033, while the top 10% would experience an income boost. The bill preserves a lower top tax rate of 37% and maintains tax breaks for capital gains, further benefiting high earners. Economists note that the legislation compounds the regressive nature of recent tariff policies.</p>

          <p>Faced with President Trump's demand for NATO allies to spend 5% of their national income on defense, European countries are exploring creative accounting methods. Some NATO nations have backed a plan to target 3.5% of GDP for traditional military spending, plus 1.5% for non-traditional 'defense-related' spending by 2032. This could include infrastructure improvements like rail lines and cybersecurity enhancements. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized the need for enablers related to defense spending, reflecting efforts to appease Trump and address shortcomings in logistical preparedness highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The new approach acknowledges that the current 2% GDP pledge is insufficient.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have carried out a significant prisoner exchange, with each side expected to swap around 1,000 soldiers at the Ukraine-Belarus border. The initial exchange involved 270 Russian soldiers and 120 Russian civilians for the same number of Ukrainian counterparts, facilitated by recent peace talks in Istanbul. Despite failing to agree on a ceasefire, the prisoner swap represents a rare accord between Moscow and Kyiv during the conflict. Russia conducted a large-scale aerial attack on Ukraine, while Ukraine's air force reported downing numerous Russian drones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on Apple unless the company shifts iPhone manufacturing to the United States, disapproving of its move to India. Analysts suggest a U.S.-bound relocation is unlikely due to the time, expense, and higher labor costs. While final assembly in the U.S. is theoretically possible, it would take years and raise prices for consumers. Trump previously exempted phones, computers, and chips from tariffs on China-made goods, providing cost savings for Apple, which produces about 90% of its smartphones in China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, returning almost all titles to the shelves after a new review using Pentagon-standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified a broad range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The new review, using the Pentagon's search terms, identified only about 20 books for potential removal, pending further review by a Department of Defense panel. The move aligns with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A 440-foot container ship ran aground in Norway, narrowly missing a cabin while its owner slept. Reports suggest the helmsman was also likely asleep during the incident.

          <p>Homeowners insurance costs are rising significantly in states within Tornado Alley, primarily due to the increasing frequency and severity of hailstorms, not tornadoes. Insurance companies are raising rates in response to growing costs from extreme weather disasters. While tornadoes pose a greater threat to life, hail causes more insured damage across larger areas, accounting for a significant portion of homeowner insurance claims annually. Climate change's impact on tornadoes and hailstorms is still being researched, but some studies suggest storms could produce larger hailstones as the Earth heats up. Insurers are scaling back coverage on roofs and increasing rates to match the rising risk.</p>

Trump's proposal for a 50% tariff on EU goods and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. led investors to seek safety in bonds. The moves followed a volatile week for bonds, driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and the U.S. deficit.

          <p>Skeletal remains discovered on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as Captain Henry Goodsell of the schooner Oriental, which sank in 1844. The identification was made possible through investigative efforts by college students at Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center.

The New Jersey State Police confirmed the identification after collecting a family reference sample from one of Goodsell's great-grandchildren.

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may be attractive this summer due to declining interest rates, offering flexibility compared to home equity loans. Experts advise using HELOCs to capitalize on falling rates and consolidate credit card debt, potentially saving on interest. HELOCs can also fund home repairs and renovations, increasing property value. However, avoid using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as they carry the risk of foreclosure.
