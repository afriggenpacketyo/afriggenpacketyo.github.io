          <p>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned, alleging that the Trump administration interfered with their authority to award scholarships. The board claimed the administration denied Fulbright awards to a significant number of individuals selected for the 2025-2026 academic year and subjected an additional 1,200 foreign recipients to an unauthorized review process. The board stated that these actions contradict the Fulbright mission and values, including free speech and academic freedom. The resignations highlight concerns about the politicization of academic scholarships and the administration's adherence to established guidelines. The board's actions underscore their commitment to protecting the integrity and independence of the Fulbright program. The optimism score reflects the negative impact of political interference on academic exchange programs.</p>

These announcements came after high-level trade talks in London, underscoring the ongoing complexities and negotiations between the two economic superpowers.

          <p>The UK and the EU have reached a post-Brexit agreement regarding Gibraltar's status, aiming to avoid checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border. Passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system used for Eurostar passengers at St Pancras station. Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized that the agreement protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Chief Minister Fabian Picardo welcomed the deal as one that safeguards future generations of British Gibraltarians. The agreement seeks to resolve the territory's status and border issues that have been ongoing since Brexit, ensuring continued ease of movement for the thousands who cross the border daily. The agreement represents a significant step forward in EU-UK relations after Brexit.</p>

          <p>Disney and Universal have jointly filed a lawsuit against AI image company Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement for the unlicensed use of characters from Star Wars, The Simpsons, and other films. The lawsuit claims Midjourney used and distributed AI-generated characters from the movie studios and disregarded requests to cease such activity. Disney and Universal are seeking a jury trial, asserting that Midjourney's actions threaten the core incentives of U.S. copyright law, and they describe the company as a "copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism." This lawsuit marks the first AI copyright legal battle from Hollywood giants, highlighting concerns over protecting content from illegal copying in the age of AI.</p>

          <p>Protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) continue in Los Angeles and spread to other cities, escalating tensions between President Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an overnight curfew for a square mile in downtown LA, the site of clashes between police and protesters. Trump deployed 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines to LA against the wishes of Newsom and Bass. Newsom is suing the Trump administration, arguing that they unlawfully "trampled over" Californiaâ€™s sovereignty by federalizing the California National Guard.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Trump's actions were intended to prevent a repeat of the 2020 riots, when Democratic governors struggled to balance law and order with sympathy for protesters.

          <p>President Trump intends to phase out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after the current hurricane season, shifting disaster response responsibilities to the states. Trump believes states should lead their own disaster response, despite the current system where they rely on FEMA for funding and expertise. Critics warn that dismantling FEMA could lead to an uneven landscape of disaster safety, especially for poorer states lacking resources. Experts suggest that a dramatic shake-up of FEMA is needed, but it should be done safely with a major infusion of cash to the states to bolster any FEMA-replacing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>As Malawi prepares for elections in September, young candidates are pushing for greater political inclusion, facing challenges such as entrenched party structures and financial barriers. Despite youth comprising over half of Malawi's population, they often encounter empty rhetoric and limited opportunities within political parties. Experts emphasize the need for parties to create fair competition and avoid handpicking candidates, while also urging young entrants to come prepared with solid strategies. Structural exclusion, cultural resistance, and a lack of investment in leadership training further impede youth participation in politics, highlighting the need for comprehensive reforms and intentional mentorship.</p>
