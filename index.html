        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering momentum in July as key indicators, including retail sales and industrial output, fell short of forecasts. The slowdown is attributed to persistent weak domestic demand, a complex external environment, and Beijing's ongoing efforts to curb excess industrial capacity. This performance raises concerns among economists about the nation's ability to meet its annual 5% growth target without additional policy support. The data points to significant challenges in rebalancing the economy towards consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

A construction worker first uncovered a suspicious device in January while installing new equipment, leading to a wider search by an explosive ordnance disposal team. The bombs, which were not live but contained a small charge, were found deliberately stacked in rows. The park was declared safe and reopened to the public following the successful removal operation.</p>

          <p>This article examines the increasing prevalence of loneliness and social isolation among young men, referencing research that indicates a sharp decline in close friendships since 1990. It argues that restrictive societal norms about masculinity and a lack of emotional 'scripts' contribute significantly to this disconnection. The author calls for men to actively build genuine, supportive communities and move beyond the limitations of online interactions to foster deeper, more meaningful relationships and combat this growing social issue.</p>

          <p>The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology have released updated guidelines for managing high blood pressure, which is a primary risk factor for heart disease. The new recommendations advocate for more aggressive treatment, suggesting medication for individuals with systolic pressure between 130-139 mm Hg if lifestyle changes alone are insufficient. In a significant shift, the guidelines now also recommend complete abstinence from alcohol, citing growing evidence of its negative effects on blood pressure.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer allow the party to appoint peers to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that his party's significant vote share in the last general election and its success in local government create a "democratic disparity" in the upper chamber. He highlighted that other parties with fewer votes and MPs currently have representation in the Lords, asserting that Reform UK's political presence warrants similar appointments.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new, high-speed uncrewed aerial vehicle with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, designed for naval deployment. The jet-powered drone can be launched from the decks of conventional warships like destroyers and frigates, even in rough seas, before transitioning to long-range cruise flight. This technological advancement could significantly expand the operational reach and surveillance capabilities of the Chinese navy by effectively turning a wide range of vessels into mini aircraft carriers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed concerns that Latin American countries are turning to China for economic partnerships as a response to U.S. trade policies. When questioned about Brazil increasing its coordination with Beijing following U.S. tariffs, Trump asserted that the American economy is outperforming all other nations, including China. His remarks suggest a lack of concern about shifting geopolitical and economic alliances in the Western Hemisphere, emphasizing his confidence in the strength of the U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>As the new school year starts in Los Angeles, a climate of fear has settled over many immigrant communities due to a recent increase in federal immigration enforcement actions.

          <p>According to a new analysis by ConsumerAffairs, Oregon ranks as the fourth-worst state in the U.S. for relocation in 2025. The state's low ranking is attributed to poor scores across several key categories, including affordability, public safety, economic strength, and access to healthcare and education. The report also notes that Oregon faces significant environmental challenges, such as high risks of drought and wildfires, which further detract from its appeal as a destination for new residents.</p>
