        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's widespread "reciprocal tariffs" are illegal, stating he overstepped his presidential authority which resides with Congress. The decision, which the administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, affects levies on most countries, including those previously imposed on Mexico, Canada, and China. While this ruling creates uncertainty for Trump's trade agenda, sector-specific tariffs on steel and aluminum, as well as those from his first term, remain unaffected for now. The court's decision temporarily keeps the tariffs in place until October 14 to allow for the appeal process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Medical and psychological experts are offering precautionary guidelines for children's screen time, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development stages. Recommendations range from "screen-free until age three" to a maximum of two hours for teenagers, with a focus on supervised, quality content over passive consumption. Researchers express concern that excessive screen time can replace crucial activities for motor, social, and language skill development, potentially leading to poorer outcomes. Parents are advised to engage with their children about their digital activities and establish clear rules, including for themselves, to foster healthy media habits.</p>

          <p>Former Bridgewater Associates chief investment strategist Rebecca Patterson has warned that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as firing Governor Lisa Cook, could jeopardize the central bank's independence. Patterson argues that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, potentially leading to negative long-term economic consequences like weaker markets, higher inflation, and a depreciating currency. While markets might initially react positively to lower interest rates, she believes sustained inflation would ultimately harm consumption and corporate earnings. This could have significant impacts on the U.S. economy and global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Footballer Jack Grealish is experiencing a career revival since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, delivering consecutive man-of-the-match performances. His creative prowess, including multiple assists in recent games, has made him a central figure for his new club after being sidelined for much of last season. This resurgence has raised questions about his exclusion from the latest England squad under manager Thomas Tuchel, who faces stiff competition for spots. With the World Cup approaching, Grealish's revitalized form is putting pressure on the national team's selection process and giving him a chance to prove his value.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly demanded the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy's long-standing anti-vaccine stance and promotion of disproven conspiracy theories, which he argues is undermining the nation's health infrastructure. The call for resignation follows the firing of the CDC director and the subsequent resignations of four other top officials in protest of Kennedy's policies. Sanders warned that these actions threaten to reverse decades of progress against preventable diseases and represent a "war on science."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving forward with eliminating over 500 positions at the Voice of America and its parent agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media. The announcement by acting CEO Kari Lake came a day after a federal judge blocked her from removing VOA's director, Michael Abramowitz, and ordered her to testify about the agency's compliance with previous court orders. These layoffs are part of a broader, contentious effort to reshape the federally funded news organization, which provides reporting in countries with restricted press freedom. Critics and employees argue the move undermines the agency's mission and is being pursued without proper legal review.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a temporary injunction. The ruling concerned The Bell Hotel in Epping but was seen as a key test case for similar challenges nationwide. Amid ongoing protests and counter-demonstrations, councils like Epping Forest are considering appealing to the Supreme Court, arguing the hotels pose public safety risks and violate planning laws. The government maintains that using hotels is a temporary measure as it works to find more sustainable solutions for asylum accommodation.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has instructed all staff to return to on-site work by September 15, five weeks after a deadly shooting occurred at its Atlanta headquarters. In an internal email, the agency's COO stated that safety is the top priority and that significant progress has been made on repairs to the damaged building. The mandate comes during a period of turmoil for the CDC, which has faced leadership changes, staff cuts, and controversy under the current administration. The August 8 attack, which resulted in the deaths of a police officer and the gunman, had left the agency's workforce shaken.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, offers a more polished and emotionally grounded take on the Troma original. Starring Peter Dinklage as the janitor-turned-mutant-hero, the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody of its predecessor but with higher production values and a well-known cast including Kevin Bacon and Elijah Wood. The story centers on Winston Goose, a janitor who, after being transformed by toxic waste, seeks revenge on a villainous pharmaceutical company. The review suggests that while it's diverting and fun, its slickness may feel at odds with the intentionally cheap aesthetic of the original.</p>

Union leaders state they are focused on organizing workplaces and educating members on their rights while protesting government actions. Experts warn that federal hostility towards organized labor, particularly in public sectors, could lead to significant challenges for the movement's future, including layoffs and reduced bargaining power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Originating from the 1999 film "The Matrix," the term "red pill" has evolved from an internet meme into a metaphor for a global, anti-feminist ideology. Initially adopted by "pick-up artists" and men's rights activists, the "manosphere" now encompasses a range of digital communities promoting misogynistic beliefs and conspiracy theories. This ideology has seeped into mainstream political discourse and has been amplified by social media algorithms and influencers like Andrew Tate. Researchers note its global appeal and cultural adaptability, as it often translates personal frustrations into a broader, seemingly coherent worldview that can bridge to extremist milieus.</p>

          <p>Swimmers along the U.S. coastline face potential health risks this Labor Day weekend due to high levels of fecal contamination at many popular beaches. Advisories have been issued from Maine to California, warning that elevated bacteria levels can cause illnesses like rashes and gastrointestinal issues. A report from Environment America found that nearly two-thirds of U.S. beaches tested in 2024 had at least one day of unsafe water quality. The problem is largely attributed to outdated sewer systems and increased stormwater runoff, which overwhelm infrastructure and carry waste into recreational waters.</p>

          <p>The Pickett fire in California's Napa Valley has caused an estimated $65 million in agricultural losses, primarily affecting wine grape growers. Wineries like Robert Craig Winery lost entire crops from specific vineyards due to direct fire damage and preventative back-burns set by firefighters. While vineyards can act as fire breaks, the heat and smoke from nearby blazes can ruin grapes, a phenomenon known as "smoke taint." This event evokes painful memories of the devastating 2020 Glass fire, highlighting the growing and recurring threat that wildfires pose to the region's vital wine industry.</p>

          <p>After a landmark study identified agricultural pollution as a major contributor to Iowa's severe water quality problems, funding for publicizing the report's findings has been quietly eliminated. The $1 million study, commissioned by Polk County, linked pollutants from the state's powerful farm industry to environmental risks and high cancer rates. However, over $400,000 remaining in the budget, partly earmarked for public awareness campaigns, was recently "zeroed out" without explanation. Critics suggest this is an attempt by agricultural interests and allied officials to suppress the report's controversial findings and impede necessary reforms.</p>
