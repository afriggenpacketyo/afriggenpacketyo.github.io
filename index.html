          <p>An opinion article discusses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the current arrangements are set to expire. The author recounts initial lack of concern in the 1970s due to Beijing's disavowal of unequal treaties, but notes the importance of addressing the issue, especially concerning property mortgages and land leases. The piece urges calm and forward-thinking rather than alarmism, emphasizing the need for law students to prepare for potential shifts towards mainland law. The article underscores the necessity for Hong Kong to proactively address its future legal framework to maintain stability and investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a pivotal presidential election that is set to determine the country's direction on key issues like abortion rights, LGBTQ protections, and its relationship with the European Union. The front-runners are pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, with polls indicating a likely runoff between the two. The election occurs amidst ongoing political friction between the Polish prime minister and the conservative outgoing president, Andrzej Duda, potentially easing gridlock if Trzaskowski wins. A far-right candidate, S≈Çawomir Mentzen, could also play a significant role in the second round.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the prevailing themes at the Cannes Film Festival, noting a trend toward films depicting characters facing legal, moral, and psychological storms with often tragic outcomes. Films like Ari Aster‚Äôs ‚ÄúEddington‚Äù and Dominik Moll‚Äôs ‚ÄúDossier 137‚Äù explore societal anxieties and the limitations of heroism. Sergei Loznitsa‚Äôs ‚ÄúTwo Prosecutors‚Äù and Oliver Laxe‚Äôs ‚ÄúSir√¢t‚Äù offer cynical views of power and community, respectively. Harris Dickinson's directorial debut, ‚ÄúUrchin,‚Äù provides a more nuanced, though still Sisyphean, portrayal of social struggle, indicating that the festival favors narratives that reflect a sense of unease and disillusionment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that the German military does not have "systemic" extremism, with only a small percentage of soldiers displaying right-wing extremist views. However, the study also found problematic chauvinist and xenophobic attitudes among some soldiers. Despite these findings, some researchers remain skeptical, pointing to past incidents involving far-right networks within the military and suggesting that the voluntary nature of the survey may underestimate the true extent of the problem. The article balances the study's findings with concerns about the normalization of right-wing attitudes in broader German society.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts judge has restricted references to a separate, mishandled murder investigation in Karen Read's retrial for the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe. The case has highlighted concerns over police procedures, including evidence handling and witness interviews, prompting calls for improved training. An expert noted that the mistakes made by police in the Read case and a previous unrelated case could cost cases and cause lawsuits. Despite the judge's ruling, there is still room for reasonable doubt in the jurors' minds, according to a legal analyst.</p>

          <p>Casey Michel argues that while Trump's corruption is unprecedented, he is not the first politician to exploit his position for personal gain. The article highlights how the Trump family has profited through foreign deals, meme coins, and crypto fund-raisers, but also notes that previous administrations, including that of Joe Biden, have faced similar issues with family members leveraging their connections. The author calls for stricter legislation to prevent foreign lobbying and financial arrangements by family members of high-ranking officials, emphasizing that foreign regimes view them as vectors of influence. The article concludes by urging future administrations to enforce existing counter-kleptocracy measures and prosecute any illegal use of office for personal enrichment.</p>

          <p>In 1993, the murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis left investigators with a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints at the crime scene. The decades-long investigation involved comparing the prints to multiple suspects and eventually led to DNA testing, revealing an unknown profile. This profile was then used in investigative genetic genealogy, which identified Jerry Westrom as a potential match. Although Westrom denied any involvement, his DNA and footprints were linked to the scene, leading to his conviction in 2022. The article details the meticulous forensic work and the challenges faced in solving the cold case.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance large infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves Chinese companies receiving long-term operating rights in exchange for funding and constructing projects, such as highways and railways. This approach addresses African governments' debt concerns and sustains infrastructure development. For example, Kenya is seeking Chinese funding to extend its Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) using a PPP model, where Chinese financiers contribute a significant portion of the investment and gain exclusive construction and operating rights for an extended period.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a presidential runoff election after the previous election in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities. The initial vote saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round. The annulment was based on findings of campaign financing and organization violations, including the use of social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messages as part of an alleged Russian hybrid attack. Georgescu has been barred from standing in the rerun, which is expected to be tightly contested.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and introduce a monthly fee for beneficiaries with "unsatisfactory immigration status" due to budget deficits. These changes aim to address a $12 billion deficit, attributed to Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. The plan would suspend access to comprehensive Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19 starting January 1, though it would not affect children or those already enrolled. Adults with "unsatisfactory" immigration status would be charged $100 monthly starting January 1, 2027.</p>

          <p>The 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis led to a decades-long investigation that hinged on a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints found at the crime scene. Investigators meticulously documented the scene, finding evidence of a violent struggle and collecting DNA samples. Despite initial leads, the case went cold until 2015, when advancements in DNA technology linked the crime to Jerry Westrom. Westrom was eventually convicted in 2022, with the bloody footprints playing a key role in the prosecution's case, highlighting the enduring impact of forensic evidence in solving cold cases.</p>

          <p>A first date between Leslie Reeves and Chris Smith turned tragic when both were shot in Smith's Illinois home. Reeves died, but Smith survived, though he has no memory of the event. The investigation led to Reeves' ex-boyfriend, Bobby Tarr, who was eventually convicted of murder and attempted murder. The case involved conflicting testimonies, a lack of physical evidence directly linking Tarr to the crime scene, and a complex web of lies. Smith, now a motivational speaker, is still recovering from his injuries, while Reeves' friends remember her as an advocate for women's rights.</p>

          <p>Germany and other European countries are significantly increasing their military spending in response to growing security threats, with Germany aiming to have the "strongest conventional army in Europe." This shift marks a historic turnaround in German security policy, which has traditionally relied on international cooperation and diplomacy. France, Poland, and the UK also have ambitious plans to modernize and expand their armed forces, focusing on advanced technology and increased troop numbers. Despite these efforts, the global ranking of military strength is unlikely to change significantly in the near term, with the United States, Russia, and China continuing to lead.</p>

          <p>China has announced anti-dumping duties on imports of POM copolymers, an engineering plastic, from the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Taiwan. The duties, ranging up to 74.9%, follow an investigation launched in May 2024 after the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods. The highest rates are levied on U.S. imports, while shipments from Europe will face 34.5% duties. This move comes amid hopes of easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, who recently agreed to a 90-day tariff truce.</p>

The government rejected proposals from the House of Lords to require AI companies to disclose their training materials, prompting Sir Elton to warn that young artists will be robbed of their income and legacy. He threatened legal action if the plans are not changed, and called on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to address the issue.</p>
