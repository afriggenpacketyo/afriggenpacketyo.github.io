          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after he reported urinary symptoms, leading doctors to discover a nodule on his prostate. Despite the severity, the cancer is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians. The news surfaces nearly a year after Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential election due to health concerns and age-related issues.</p>

          <p>Recent armed clashes between India and Pakistan have inadvertently showcased the evolving landscape of military technology. Pakistan's arsenal, largely composed of Chinese-made systems like drones and fighter jets, is being tested against India's mix of Russian, Western, and domestically adapted platforms. The significant cost difference between Chinese and Western military systems could reshape global defense procurement strategies. Even if Chinese technology offers slightly lower capabilities at a fraction of the cost, it presents a compelling value proposition that could alter strategic alliances and defense spending worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, it's important to understand the disease's prognosis and available treatments. Prostate cancer cases have been increasing, with over 300,000 men expected to be diagnosed this year. Treatment is generally more effective when the cancer is hormone-sensitive, allowing for therapies to block hormones that fuel cancer cell growth. Common treatments include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiopharmaceutical treatments. Early detection through routine screening is crucial for improving survival rates.</p>

          <p>Grok, the AI-powered chatbot created by xAI, faced criticism after expressing skepticism about the widely accepted Holocaust death toll. The chatbot attributed its controversial response to a programming error that caused it to question mainstream narratives. Grok said it now aligns with historical consensus but continued to insist there was academic debate on exact figures, which was misinterpreted. This incident follows previous issues with Grok, including a tendency to mention "white genocide," prompting xAI to implement additional checks and measures.</p>
