          <p>Robert Benton, the Oscar-winning filmmaker renowned for his contributions to 'Bonnie and Clyde,' 'Kramer vs. Kramer,' and 'Places in the Heart,' has died at the age of 92 from natural causes.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over 30 years. The brothers claimed self-defense, citing years of alleged abuse. The judge's decision followed testimony from family members who believe the brothers have reformed. The case will now go before the California Board of Parole Hearings and then to the governor's office. The resentencing decision is seen as a significant step toward their possible release, though prosecutors maintain they haven't fully taken responsibility for their actions.</p>

          <p>China has completed key technology checks for its experimental satellite, Chutian-001, designed for very low Earth orbit (VLEO), marking progress toward a 300-satellite constellation for remote sensing and communications. The bullet-shaped satellite is designed to reduce atmospheric drag, a major challenge for spacecraft operating below 300km. VLEO satellites offer advantages like lower signal latency and stronger transmission, but require frequent thruster firings to counteract drag. This project is part of China's effort to expand its commercial space sector, with the Chutian constellation slated for deployment in three phases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is reportedly seeking to hire lawyers to investigate employee misconduct, including unauthorized communications with the media. This effort is seen as a continuation of previous administration's crackdown on employees speaking to the press, sparking concerns about intimidation and the suppression of dissent. The job posting indicates that the lawyers will also defend against grievances filed by employees affected by agency-wide downsizing.

          <p>Rapper Tory Lanez was hospitalized after being stabbed at the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi, where he is serving a 10-year sentence for shooting Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez was allegedly attacked by another inmate and is in fair condition. Details about the attack remain scarce as officials investigate the incident. Lanez's legal troubles continue behind bars, with Stallion alleging he has harassed her from prison through surrogates, resulting in an extension of the restraining order against him.</p>

          <p>Three GPs share their perspectives on assisted dying as the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill is debated in Parliament. Dr. Abdul Farooq opposes assisted dying due to religious beliefs and concerns about end-of-life care resources. Dr. Susi Caesar supports assisted dying, driven by her father's experience and belief in patient choice. Dr. Gurpreet Khaira is conflicted, balancing her personal experience as a cancer survivor with concerns about vulnerable patients being coerced. Their diverse views highlight the complexities of the issue within the medical community.</p>

          <p>Traditional British television faces increasing pressure from US streaming giants, leading to discussions about potential mergers and collaborations to ensure survival. The shift to digital-only video on demand by 2035 raises concerns about the ability of British broadcasters to compete financially with better-funded US rivals. Some propose a single gateway for public service content, potentially under BBC iPlayer, while others argue for maintaining distinctiveness. The debate centers on how to preserve British-originated and British-focused TV in a changing media landscape.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book promises explosive new details on former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s mental and physical decline while in the White House. The book, “Original Sin,” by Jake Tapper of CNN and Alex Thompson of Axios, chronicles how Mr. Biden’s advisers stomped out discussion of his age-related limitations, including internal concerns of aides, external worries of Democratic allies and scrutiny by journalists.

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," details how former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s aides suppressed concerns about his age and cognitive decline during his time in the White House. The book reveals that Biden forgot names of longtime aides and allies, and that cabinet gatherings were largely scripted for him. Despite these accounts, few Biden allies would speak openly about his decline, even after pressure forced him to drop out of the presidential race. The book highlights the Democratic Party's unwillingness to publicly reckon with its choice to back Biden.</p>
