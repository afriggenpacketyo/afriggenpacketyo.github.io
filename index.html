          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 08:41:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Doctors and humanitarian aid workers in Gaza are reporting a severe and worsening hunger crisis, with malnutrition spreading rapidly, especially among children and pregnant women. Aid organizations like Mercy Corps and Médecins Sans Frontières describe a dystopian situation where families struggle to find any food, and stabilization centers are overwhelmed. The crisis is compounded by the limited entry of aid, with workers themselves facing starvation. While Israel denies limiting aid and blames Hamas for shortages, aid groups warn of imminent mass starvation and a catastrophic, irreversible toll on the population.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal face significant uncertainty after both the U.S. and Israeli delegations withdrew from talks in Doha, Qatar. A U.S. envoy stated that Hamas's response to the latest proposal showed a "lack of desire to reach a ceasefire," prompting a reevaluation of options. In response, Hamas expressed surprise at the negative characterization of its position, affirming its commitment to reaching a permanent ceasefire agreement. The diplomatic impasse occurs amid a deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, with the UN warning of man-made mass starvation and aid agencies reporting a surge in malnutrition cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a challenging housing market characterized by high interest rates, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance face affordability concerns. As of late July 2025, average national rates for a 30-year mortgage are approximately 6.79%, while a 15-year mortgage averages around 6.01%, with refinance rates slightly higher. Experts suggest that borrowers with strong credit profiles in the mid-to-high 700s are best positioned to secure favorable rates. To improve chances of a good rate, individuals should focus on strengthening their credit, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders to find the most suitable terms.

          <p>For individuals seeking to protect their savings from inflation, high-yield savings accounts currently offer rates that significantly outperform traditional accounts. While the national average savings rate sits at a low 0.38% APY, top high-yield accounts from online banks are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30% as of July 2025. Financial experts recommend these accounts, often found at online-only banks with lower overhead costs, as a secure and effective way to grow an emergency fund. These institutions typically feature streamlined online setup, minimal fees, and low initial deposit requirements, making them accessible for a wide range of savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary has stated he has no "preconceived plans" to alter policies regarding the abortion pill mifepristone, which is used to terminate pregnancies within the first 10 weeks. In a recent interview, Makary confirmed that the agency is conducting an ongoing safety review of the drug, a standard requirement, and remains open-minded to all data and opinions. He emphasized that while there are no current plans for policy changes, the FDA will not hesitate to act if new data indicates a significant safety concern. This position comes after Republican senators, including Josh Hawley, urged the FDA to restore previous safeguards on the medication.</p>

The company's CFO acknowledged that while product sales remain strong, margins are being squeezed by these external pressures and the lower profitability of electric vehicles.

While senior doctors will cover emergency care, the NHS aims to maintain as many non-urgent services as possible, a strategy the British Medical Association (BMA) warns could stretch staff too thinly. The government has maintained that pay is not open to negotiation, while the BMA argues that doctors' pay has effectively decreased by a fifth since 2008 when accounting for inflation.

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, a move that enables her to serve in the role in an acting capacity. The decision followed a leadership dispute after a federal court declined to keep Habba in the post and instead appointed her deputy. Attorney General Pam Bondi criticized the court's move, and by withdrawing the formal nomination, the administration sidesteps a federal law that would have restricted Habba's ability to serve as an acting officer.

The article points to the administration's aggressive deportation campaigns, pressure on state election officials, and actions against the press as evidence of this strategy. It concludes that while Trump's support may show cracks, he is doubling down on his policies and is unlikely to relinquish power without a significant fight from a mobilized opposition.</p>

          <p>South Park co-creator Trey Parker issued a mock-serious apology to President Donald Trump after the show's season premiere featured several jokes at his expense, including a depiction of him with Satan. The episode prompted a White House spokesperson to call the long-running animated series a "fourth-rate" show that is no longer relevant. Speaking at Comic-Con, Parker's brief, facetious apology came as the show continues its tradition of topical satire. The controversial episode also satirized the recent merger of parent company Paramount Global, its legal disputes with Trump, and the use of lawsuits to silence media critics, receiving praise from many reviewers for its sharp commentary.</p>

The lawsuit serves to rally his base against media narratives and acts as a warning to other news organizations.

The teenager from Lancashire, UK, went missing on June 17 after a night out, prompting a massive search. An inquest heard that Slater, who had taken drugs and alcohol, was attempting a 14-hour walk back to his accommodation when he fell in a remote and dangerous area of a national park. The coroner stated that he suffered non-survivable skull fractures and brain trauma, dying instantly.

The 22-year-old City academy graduate impressed last season, helping Burnley secure promotion to the Premier League. Manchester City activated a buy-back and matching rights clause in his original transfer contract after Newcastle submitted a £27 million bid for the player. Trafford is expected to sign a five-year contract and will join a goalkeeping roster that includes Ederson and Stefan Ortega.

Kennedy argues these additives, found in many ultra-processed foods, are linked to health issues like hyperactivity in children. While public health advocates generally support the move, food manufacturers face complex challenges in switching to less stable, plant-based natural dyes. The transition also raises concerns about supply shortages and whether American consumers, accustomed to vibrant, neon-colored products, will accept the potentially duller hues of naturally colored foods.</p>
