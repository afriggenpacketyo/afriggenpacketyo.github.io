          <p>Ozeki Onosato secured the Emperor's Cup with a 14-1 record at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, despite a final-day loss to yokozuna Hoshoryu, preventing an undefeated run. The 24-year-old had already clinched consecutive championships and promotion to yokozuna prior to the final bout. Hoshoryu's victory improved his head-to-head record against Onosato, while komusubi Wakatakakage's strong performance sets the stage for a potential ozeki promotion bid. Onosato's promotion to yokozuna will be formally recommended, making him the fastest to reach the sport's highest rank under the modern calendar and the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster. The article reflects on Onosato's impressive achievements and future prospects in sumo wrestling.</p>

          <p>Dermatologist Dr. Michelle Hure discusses the growing trend of younger individuals seeking "baby Botox" and other cosmetic procedures, expressing concern about the long-term costs and unrealistic expectations. Hure attributes this trend to increased online presence during the pandemic, leading to heightened self-scrutiny and dissatisfaction with perceived flaws. She emphasizes the importance of medical professionals pushing back against unnecessary procedures, even if it means sacrificing potential profits. Hure also warns about the psychological risks associated with cosmetic procedures, such as dependence and perception drift, and the dangers of medical procedures being treated as mere retail services. The article explores the ethical and psychological implications of cosmetic dermatology.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap if elected. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement puts pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who has already announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the Reform proposals, stating that the country cannot afford to remove the two-child benefit cap and accusing both Starmer and Farage of making undeliverable promises.

          <p>A tax bill passed by House Republicans could undermine the U.S. clean energy sector by terminating key tax credits that have fueled its growth. The legislation would eliminate investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, potentially causing a significant decline in clean energy deployment. The bill also restricts projects from claiming tax credits if they receive "material assistance" from prohibited foreign entities, primarily targeting projects sourcing materials from China. Industry leaders warn that the bill could lead to job losses and increased electricity costs, while some Republican senators have expressed concerns about its impact on job creation.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles is intensifying immigration enforcement in jails through "Operation Guardian Angel," targeting individuals with criminal records who have been deported and illegally re-entered the country. This initiative aims to counteract California's sanctuary policies, which limit local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration agents. State officials assert that they already collaborate with federal authorities regarding immigrants who have committed crimes. Experts suggest that the practice of prosecuting individuals for illegal entry could increase immigration arrests in the region. The article examines the legal and political tensions between federal and state authorities on immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's amended Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) is under fire from rights groups, who claim it's being used to suppress critical voices, particularly journalists. The law criminalizes the spread of false information online that could incite fear, with potential imprisonment and fines. Journalists Farhan Mallick and Waheed Murad were detained under PECA for allegedly disseminating "online disinformation." Critics argue the law stifles press freedom and is used to control the state narrative, while the government insists it's necessary to limit disinformation.

          <p>Venezuela is holding an election for governor and legislators in Essequibo, a region internationally recognized as part of neighboring Guyana. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is using the vote to stir nationalistic sentiment and build support for his government amid internal dissatisfaction. The move has been criticized as an attempt to legitimize his rule and assert control over the oil-rich territory. This action has further strained relations with Guyana, and international observers are skeptical of the legitimacy and impact of the election.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, the Black Lives Matter movement has given way to a backlash, with the politics of "white grievance" championed by President Trump. The Justice Department has abandoned oversight agreements for police forces accused of racial bias, and the U.S. refugee resettlement program is effectively shut down. Despite the initial surge of support for racial justice, the movement now faces headwinds, with public opinion shifting and efforts to dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion gaining traction.
