          <p>European nations, spearheaded by France and the UK, are navigating intricate challenges in establishing security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, as a pivotal meeting in Paris underscores the absence of a ceasefire and the uncertain extent of American commitment. U.S. President Trump's shifting stance on a ceasefire and his past withdrawals from international agreements create significant dilemmas for European leaders, who are wary of deploying troops without clear U.S. backing. The discussion highlights the difficult choices facing the "coalition of the willing," with experts suggesting that increasing direct military aid to Kyiv might be the most viable, albeit risky, option amidst geopolitical complexities. The future of Ukraine's security framework remains highly precarious.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner faces escalating scrutiny over an alleged £40,000 underpayment in stamp duty on her East Sussex flat, a situation she attributes to complex family arrangements and initial legal advice. While she has now contacted HMRC to rectify the tax shortfall and referred herself for an independent investigation, opposition figures are demanding her resignation. The inquiry will assess whether her reliance on advice was appropriate, with potential penalties varying based on whether her actions are deemed careless or deliberate. This incident highlights the challenges public figures face regarding personal finances and transparency, impacting her political standing significantly.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is facing criticism for its "incoherent" attacks on Beijing, particularly after failing to recall Kuomintang lawmakers. A deputy minister's accusation that Beijing wasted billions on a military parade, while neglecting domestic issues and threatening Taiwan, is highlighted in this article. The author argues that this critique inadvertently reveals the DPP's own political vulnerabilities and strategic miscalculations, questioning the logic of complaining about a military show rather than actual military buildup. The piece suggests the DPP's aggressive rhetoric stems from its perceived weakening political position.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, after no ticket successfully matched all numbers in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This colossal sum represents the third-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history, boasting an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. The current streak of 41 drawings without a winner ties a game record, underscoring the formidable odds of 1 in 292.2 million. This ongoing excitement around such a massive prize continues to captivate the nation, with the jackpot potentially growing even larger.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly declared he is "giving serious thought" to revoking actress Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship, a threat he has issued before but cannot legally enforce due to the 14th Amendment.

Trump's remarks on Truth Social follow O'Donnell's critical statements and a previous apology for spreading misinformation about a school shooting.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally experienced an uptick on Thursday, influenced by a tech-led rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic concerns persisted. Major indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 recorded gains, driven by strong tech performance and favorable domestic economic data, respectively. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines. Global bond markets remained a focal point, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields exceeding 5% after a federal court decision on Trump-era tariffs introduced uncertainty regarding future government revenues.

          <p>Shares of Nidec Corp, a prominent Japanese electronics manufacturer, experienced a dramatic decline of over 22% on Thursday, marking its most significant one-day drop.

This latest issue follows a prior delay in financial reporting due to concerns over inaccurate country-of-origin declarations that might have resulted in unpaid import tariffs.

          <p>Experts have concluded that the renowned Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in September 2023, was between 100 and 120 years old. This age estimation comes from Historic England's dendrochronological investigation, the first of its kind for the tree, involving the meticulous counting of growth rings from a well-preserved cross-section of its trunk. Despite some challenges in precisely counting all rings, the analysis provides significant insight into its history. Two individuals received over four-year jail sentences for the act that caused widespread public anger. Further advanced imaging techniques are slated to provide an even more accurate age count.</p>
