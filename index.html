        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies within the next decade to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort focused on predicting and preventing illnesses, which includes a Â£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that this gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows an earlier announcement of a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies, marking a significant step towards personalized and preventative healthcare. The NHS hopes that such measures will allow for earlier interventions and improved health outcomes for the population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar estimates that Israel's attacks on Iran have slowed down the Islamic Republic's development of a nuclear bomb by at least two to three years. Saar highlighted the elimination of key individuals leading the weaponization of the nuclear program as a crucial achievement. The conflict between Israel and Iran escalated a week prior with Israeli airstrikes targeting nuclear and military sites, along with top generals and nuclear scientists. Iran has consistently denied accusations of trying to build a nuclear weapon, asserting that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, though this claim has been questioned by experts and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Despite the ongoing tensions, Israel remains committed to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has rerouted the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group from the Indo-Pacific to the Middle East, marking the fourth such maneuver by the US Navy in less than a year. This redeployment has raised concerns in Taiwan, highlighting the increasing demands on American military resources due to fluctuating and prolonged conflicts. The USS Nimitz halted operations in the South China Sea to support the USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group amidst escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran. This move underscores the need for the United States to balance immediate operational requirements in the Middle East with long-term strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region, as tensions continue to rise.</p>

Khalil, a green card holder, had been detained for months as the Trump administration sought to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a threat to the community or a flight risk, and criticized his detention as "highly unusual." Upon his release, Khalil expressed gratitude and criticized the Trump administration's actions, while officials stated their intention to appeal the decision and continue efforts to remove him from the United States.</p>

Garcia, a photographer and doctoral student, had been picking up a delivery when he witnessed the raid and began filming, leading to his arrest.

          <p>All charges against Barry Morphew were dismissed without prejudice in the case of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who disappeared in May 2020. Prosecutors cited the need for further investigation and the belief that they are close to discovering Suzanne's body as reasons for the dismissal. The defense argued that the charges were false from the beginning and pointed out the lack of physical evidence connecting Barry to the alleged crime. Barry Morphew had previously been charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in connection with Suzanne's disappearance. As the search for Suzanne's body continues, Barry Morphew is now a free man.</p>

Trump stated that his administration is working closely with Harvard and that a settlement could be announced soon, emphasizing its potential benefits for the country.

          <p>The Rhode Island state House, controlled by Democrats, passed a bill to ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now awaits the signature of Democratic Governor Dan McKee, who supports such a ban. If enacted, Rhode Island would join 10 other states with similar prohibitions on high-powered firearms. The bill applies only to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, aligning it with Washington state's approach. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and may face challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

The skirmish, which resulted in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula.

          <p>President Trump suggested he may attempt to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for maintaining steady interest rates. Trump has repeatedly lashed out against Powell, whom he appointed, for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. While it remains legally unclear whether Trump can fire Powell before his term ends in May 2026, he has previously stated he has "no intention" of doing so. Federal law allows for the firing of Federal Reserve's Board of Governors only "for cause." Powell has stated he will not resign if asked to step down, and the two met at the White House last month.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Lime e-bikes have been dumped in rivers and canals across England, raising concerns about pollution and flooding. The Canal and River Trust reports spending thousands of pounds to retrieve the bikes, with Nottingham being a particular hotspot. The Environment Agency notes that e-bikes pose a pollution risk due to substances in their batteries. Lime says it is working with authorities to address the problem. The Canal and River Trust has asked Lime to cover the retrieval costs, but an agreement has not yet been reached.</p>
