          <p>China is developing a new long-range early warning and control aircraft, the KJ-3000, based on social media footage of a prototype. The aircraft's design is derived from the Y-20B transport plane and features a distinctive rotating radar dome on its fuselage, which houses advanced surveillance equipment. This development signals Beijing's commitment to this type of military technology, even as other global powers like the United States have shifted away from using such planes in modern warfare strategies.</p>

This 12-month program targets individuals from countries with high rates of visa overstays or inadequate security screening. The bonds, set at $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000, are intended to ensure visitors comply with the terms of their visas and do not become a financial liability to the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's threats of steeper tariffs, India has defended its increased importation of Russian oil, stating it was a necessary step after traditional supplies were diverted to Europe. India's foreign ministry pointed out that the U.S. and EU also engage in significant trade with Russia and argued that its oil purchases, encouraged by the U.S. at the time, helped stabilize global energy prices. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions in international trade and diplomacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's government has unveiled a new plan to strengthen its domestic cattle industry in response to falling prices and strong competition from imports. The policy aims to boost beef production and promote consumption by implementing a quality-grading system for locally produced meat.

          <p>More than 40 protesters were arrested in New York City during a demonstration organized by the Jewish-American group IfNotNow. Hundreds gathered to demand an end to the war in Gaza, greater humanitarian aid access, and U.S. pressure on Israel to stop what they termed a policy of "ethnic cleansing by way of forced mass starvation." The protest began at Columbus Circle and moved to the Trump International hotel, where demonstrators were arrested for blocking the street.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court ruling, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's recent asylum ban. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals partially granted an order that limits the ban, stating it cannot be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. This directive instructs Customs and Border Protection officials to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law, marking a significant legal challenge to the administration's policy.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has issued a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. Lab tests confirmed the presence of diphacinone, a blue-dyed anticoagulant rodenticide, which the pigs likely ingested directly or through eating other poisoned animals. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use methods that protect non-target wildlife and are advising hunters to avoid consuming any game that shows signs of discoloration.</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings Lead to More Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in Younger Adults</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among adults aged 45-49. This trend is directly linked to a 62% rise in screening rates for this age group between 2019 and 2023, following updated recommendations that lowered the suggested screening age from 50 to 45. While the findings are seen as promising news for early detection, experts caution that overall screening rates for this demographic remain suboptimal.</p>

          <p>In interviews, several of the Texas Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican redistricting bill have stated they are prepared to face any consequences for their actions. The lawmakers argue that breaking quorum is a necessary constitutional tool to fight against an egregious gerrymandering plan that they believe harms Texas voters. They are staying out of state to run out the clock on the special legislative session, despite threats of civil arrest from the governor.</p>

          <p>Firefighters on Maui successfully battled a brush fire that ignited on Monday near Ka'anapali, just a few miles north of the area devastated by the Lahaina wildfires two years ago. The blaze prompted the temporary closure of the Honoapiʻilani Highway due to heavy smoke and firefighting operations. The Maui County Fire Department reported that the fire was being slowly contained and asked the public to avoid the area while crews worked to secure the scene.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's recent rebound is largely due to the impressive earnings success of major technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He argues that despite concerns over weak labor data, the financial strength and diverse revenue streams of these tech giants provide a resilient foundation for the market. Their strong performance in areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence is seen as a key driver of current market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The majority of these savings came from a single lawsuit that blocked a Trump administration attempt to freeze trillions in federal funding to states, including California.</p>

The guidance emphasizes the importance of long-term behavioral changes, healthy eating, and physical activity for sustained success.</p>
