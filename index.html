          <p>Israeli troops reportedly opened fire on crowds of Palestinians near food distribution hubs in southern Gaza, resulting in at least 32 deaths. The incident occurred near sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an organization supported by the U.S. and Israel as an alternative to U.N. aid distribution. Witnesses described indiscriminate firing from tanks and drones, while the Israeli military stated they fired warning shots after suspects approached their position. This event highlights the extreme dangers civilians face while seeking essential supplies amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis and conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>The family of Cornelius Taylor, a 46-year-old man experiencing homelessness, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Atlanta after he was killed when a bulldozer crushed his tent. The incident occurred during a city-led clearing of a homeless encampment in January, conducted in preparation for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The lawsuit alleges that city employees acted negligently by failing to check if tents were occupied before razing the site. Taylor's death has intensified criticism of the city's methods for handling encampments amid a severe affordable housing crisis.</p>

          <p>At least 30 people were injured, with several in critical condition, after a driver intentionally rammed a car into a crowd outside a music venue in East Hollywood. The incident occurred early Saturday morning after the individual was reportedly removed from a nearby business. Following the crash, bystanders pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, during which he was shot by an unknown assailant who remains at large.

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred while she was suspended over the audience performing her hit song "Roar." Videos show the singer was momentarily startled but quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption. After the song, Perry calmly remarked, "Not today, Satan," addressing the near-mishap with humor as the prop safely returned her to the stage.</p>

Mendoza-Gonzalez had been previously arrested on lesser charges of concealing and abusing a corpse but was released from custody by a county judge, sparking criticism of local laws.

The effort involves a Russified school curriculum, patriotic songs, and military-style youth groups like the "Youth Army," which provides military skills training to children as young as eight. Teachers are being imported from Russia, and Ukrainian children are taken on state-sponsored tours of Russia to foster loyalty.

          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week summer school holiday and redistribute the break time throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help mitigate learning loss, ease childcare burdens and costs for working parents, and address "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, contend that the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and that a shorter summer could concentrate travel demand, potentially driving up holiday prices further. The discussion reflects varied perspectives on student well-being, educational equity, and family economics.</p>

This decline suggests a significant shift in linguistic and cultural priorities in the West.

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency team before being promoted to his advisory role. His departure is part of a recent staffing shakeup in Hegseth's office that followed a scandal involving the sharing of sensitive military plans on a messaging app. In a statement, the Pentagon thanked Fulcher for his service, while Fulcher stated his planned six-month term of service had been completed.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after 17-year-old Aamir Siddiqi was murdered in a mistaken-identity killing, his sister has made a public appeal to the fugitive suspected of ordering the attack. Aamir was stabbed to death at his Cardiff home in 2010 by two contract killers who went to the wrong address. While the hitmen were convicted, the suspected mastermind, Mohammed Ali Ege, escaped custody in India in 2011 and remains one of Europe's most wanted men. In a new podcast, Aamir's sister, Nishat Siddiqi, urged Ege to hand himself in, telling him he is "not truly free" while living a life on the run.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a thrilling third-round performance at The Open, shooting a 66 to keep himself in contention for the title amidst incredible support from the home crowd. His round was a rollercoaster of momentum, featuring early birdies, a bizarre incident where his swing unearthed a buried golf ball, and a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole that generated one of the loudest roars of his career. Despite the strong showing that put him at eight under par, he remains six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler but has given himself an outside chance for the final day.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between the minority Druze community and armed Bedouin groups have persisted in southern Syria's Suweida province, despite a ceasefire announced by the country's interim president. The violence, which has reportedly killed over 900 people in the past week, prompted Israeli military intervention in support of the Druze. A US-brokered deal was meant to halt the fighting and Israeli strikes, but reports of gunfire and looting continued in Suweida city after the announcement. The ongoing conflict underscores the deep-seated tensions and instability plaguing the region even as the government attempts to assert control.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on closer security cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic shift, marked by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized that while Europe must increase its own defense capabilities, the nuclear deterrence of France and the UK could supplement, but not replace, the US security guarantee. This alliance signifies a pragmatic European response to a changing geopolitical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a move to FC Barcelona after falling out of favor at his current club. Rashford has not played for United since being dropped by manager Ruben Amorim in December and was told to train separately. For Barcelona, the move is seen as an opportunity to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets, with the initial deal likely being a loan with an option to buy, which suits their current financial constraints. The potential transfer has sparked debate about whether Rashford can rediscover his top form at the Spanish club.</p>

The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to solve endless complex calculations instantly, which could revolutionize fields like medicine, materials science, and logistics. While major milestones have been achieved, a practical quantum computer that can solve a useful real-world problem has yet to be built due to issues with qubit stability, but the potential remains immense.

          <p>Germany is marking the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The assassination attempt, known as "Operation Valkyrie," failed when a bomb planted in a briefcase only minorly injured Hitler, leading to the swift collapse of the coup. Stauffenberg and hundreds of co-conspirators were subsequently executed. Over the decades, the perception of the plotters has evolved from traitors to heroes in Germany, symbolizing the German resistance to Nazism, though historians note their complex motivations and late opposition to the regime.</p>
