          <p>A federal judge appointed by former President Obama has dismissed a lawsuit filed by a Pennsylvania high school runner. The student sued her school district and the state's interscholastic athletic association after competing against and losing to a transgender athlete. The judge ruled that the complaint lacked factual allegations of purposeful sex-based discrimination, stating that the plaintiff failed to show she was treated differently than other students. The plaintiff's attorney has announced their intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated E.J. Antoni, an economist from the conservative Heritage Foundation, to head the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The nomination has sparked alarm among economists, who view Antoni as a partisan figure unqualified for the traditionally nonpartisan role. Concerns were amplified after Antoni suggested the agency could suspend its monthly jobs reports in favor of less frequent quarterly data. This follows the recent firing of the previous BLS commissioner after an unfavorable jobs report was released. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions for immigrant detainees at a facility in Manhattan. The ruling requires ICE to reduce the number of detainees and provide basic necessities such as sleeping mats, hygiene products, and access to legal counsel. The order followed a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates who described the conditions as "inhumane," with a government lawyer conceding to the lack of services. The facility must now be cleaned three times daily and provide adequate space per detainee.</p>

He is already facing counts of grand theft, perjury, and conflict of interest for allegedly voting on projects that financially benefited his wife's consulting firm. The initial charges claim his wife received over $150,000 from developers involved in these projects. The new charges reportedly involve similar conduct related to votes on contracts for the city's transportation and housing authorities, which his attorney has dismissed as an attempt to bolster a weak case.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of workers and activists gathered in MacArthur Park to protest the Trump administration's recent immigration raids in Los Angeles. Organizers from groups like the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) are demanding an end to the raids, the release of detained immigrants, and a halt to the expansion of private detention centers. The protest included a call to boycott major companies that organizers claim are not adequately protecting their immigrant employees. The park has become a symbolic site after federal agents staged a large-scale operation there in July.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss the war in Ukraine. The choice of Alaska, once a Russian territory, adds historical resonance to the summit, which the White House has framed as a "listening exercise." The meeting follows Trump's unsuccessful push for a ceasefire and aims to find a path to end the conflict, though Ukraine's President Zelenskyy will not be in attendance. Both sides have entrenched positions, with Russia seeking territorial concessions and Ukraine adamant about not ceding land.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, which mandates more thorough background checks for police officer candidates statewide. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous jobs. The new law requires law enforcement agencies to review an applicant's complete prior employment records before making a job offer. The goal is to prevent officers with histories of serious disciplinary issues from being hired by other departments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has revealed that one of the victims in last week's shooting at Fort Stewart, Georgia, was the "intimate partner" of the accused, Sgt. Quornelius Radford. Consequently, a specification of domestic violence has been included in the charges against him. Radford is also charged with multiple counts of attempted premeditated murder and aggravated assault for injuring five soldiers and firing at a sixth. During his first court appearance, a hearing officer ordered him to remain in pretrial confinement ahead of proceedings to determine if he will face a court-martial.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce admitted in a recent interview that his on-field performance has not met his own high standards over the past two seasons. He suggested that his focus may have "slipped a little bit" due to his increasing off-field ventures, which include hosting television shows and his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift. Kelce, who fell short of 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in seven years, clarified that he does not regret the opportunities but is motivated to return to his peak form.</p>

          <p>This article explains the legal framework governing President Trump's deployment of the National Guard and his temporary takeover of the D.C. Metropolitan Police. The president's authority over the D.C. Guard is unique, and their activation under Title 32 allows them to support law enforcement without being restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1973 Home Rule Act permits the president to assume control of the city's police force during a declared emergency for up to 30 days. The deployment is part of a stated effort to address crime in the nation's capital.</p>
