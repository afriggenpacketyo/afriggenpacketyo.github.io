          <p>A former NHS vascular surgeon, Neil Hopper, has been sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for insurance fraud and possession of extreme pornography. Hopper, who had performed hundreds of amputations, orchestrated the removal of his own legs in 2019 by using ice and dry ice, then falsely claimed the injuries were due to sepsis to defraud insurers of over £466,000. The court also revealed his "sexual interest in amputation" and his possession of videos depicting body mutilation, which were deemed to have an exceptionally high level of harm. Hopper expressed regret for the dishonesty, though not the operations, and has been suspended from the medical register, while the hospital confirmed no patient harm.</p>

          <p>Witnesses described a harrowing scene as Lisbon's Gloria funicular careened out of control, crashing into a building and killing at least 16 people, injuring about 20 more. Helen Chow, observing from the base of the hill, recounted a sound like a bomb followed by an unsettling silence and black smoke, with frantic people crying and rushing to help. Passengers in the lower carriage also experienced a terrifying uncontrolled descent and hard stop, with one shouting "we are all going to die here" as the upper carriage sped towards them. The 140-year-old funicular, typically a tourist attraction, became the site of a major tragedy that left the community deeply shaken and prompted immediate rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Thieves executed a sophisticated nighttime heist at the Adrien Dubouche National Museum in Limoges, France, stealing three porcelain works valued at approximately $11 million. The stolen items, comprising two 14th and 15th-century Chinese porcelain dishes and an 18th-century Chinese vase, are all officially designated as "national treasures." The alarm was triggered around 3:15 a.m. after a window was smashed, but the suspects had already escaped before police arrived. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into aggravated theft, and the city's mayor speculated that high-level criminals likely carried out the theft on behalf of specific collectors, highlighting the vulnerability of even major museums.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed the UK government is actively considering a new digital ID scheme as a crucial tool to combat illegal immigration and reduce incentives for unauthorized entry. He believes the public's perception of digital identification has evolved significantly over the past two decades, differing from the privacy concerns that led to the scrapping of a previous physical ID card scheme in 2011. While details are still being explored, the initiative aims to provide a more consistent approach for right-to-work and right-to-rent checks, potentially reducing the use of fake documents and enhancing enforcement efficiency. This move could reignite debates over civil liberties but is seen by Starmer as an important part of modernizing immigration controls.</p>

He claims the nonprofit received $20 million from Neville Roy Singham, who has CCP ties, and that its activities may violate U.S. law. Smith warns of potential subpoenas, IRS revocation of tax-exempt status, and criminal referrals if the group fails to comply, emphasizing the need for transparency and accountability.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines is discontinuing service in a dozen U.S. cities this fall as it grapples with severe financial challenges, including its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing within a year. The budget carrier, which aims to cut hundreds of millions in costs, will exit markets like Oakland, Portland, and Salt Lake City, and has canceled plans for Macon, Georgia. Rival airlines, including United and Frontier, are swiftly moving to capture Spirit's market share, with United even preparing for the possibility of Spirit's complete shutdown. Spirit, however, maintains it will continue offering low fares, accusing competitors of "wishful thinking" to eliminate a low-cost rival. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a heated hearing, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced intense questioning from senators regarding his views on vaccines and the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Mark Warner challenged Kennedy's assertion that he didn't know the number of American COVID-19 deaths, while Senator Maria Cantwell accused him of being a "charlatan" and "perpetrating hoaxes" regarding vaccines. Republican Senator Bill Cassidy raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest among Kennedy's newly appointed members to the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, many of whom hold vaccine-skeptic views or have served as expert witnesses against vaccine makers. Kennedy dismissed these as biases, not conflicts of interest, amidst the scrutiny.</p>

Nationalists champion MAGA tariffs, a stance often opposed by business-minded conservatives. Trump's political success has been his ability to unify these disparate factions, a challenge his eventual successor will likely struggle to replicate. The article highlights the complex dynamics within the party, where loyalty to the president masks ideological differences that could resurface in a post-Trump era.</p>

          <p>Salesforce's stock experienced a 7% drop, deepening its year-to-date decline to 28%, after the company issued a disappointing revenue forecast in its latest quarterly earnings report. Despite exceeding analyst estimates for second-quarter revenue and earnings per share, the guidance for the fiscal third quarter fell short of expectations. Wall Street remains concerned that the AI boom, which has lifted many tech peers, might erode the software sector, a sentiment CEO Marc Benioff dismissed as "nonsense." Salesforce continues to highlight strong adoption of its AI-powered Agentforce and Data Cloud products, yet investors remain cautious about its future growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is poised for its most significant test yet regarding presidential authority, specifically on President Trump's power to unilaterally impose tariffs. This article highlights a recent Court of Appeals decision that invalidated most of Trump's tariff claims, which he has appealed to the Supreme Court. The case centers on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and whether it grants the president broad authority to declare economic emergencies and impose tariffs without explicit statutory authorization. The Court's decision will be crucial for both the future of tariff imposition and the broader constitutional system of checks and balances, signaling its willingness to scrutinize or defer to presidential emergency declarations.</p>

          <p>Giorgio Armani, the legendary Italian fashion designer and a pioneer of international fashion for nearly half a century, has died at 91 in Milan. Known for his minimalist aesthetic, perfectionism, and invention of the color "greige," Armani revolutionized fashion by deconstructing suits and introducing an androgynous style for women in the 1970s. Despite his immense wealth, he led a reclusive life, remaining the creative head and sole manager of his empire, which expanded beyond fashion to include hotels, perfumes, and even cars. Armani, who dressed Hollywood stars and the Italian Olympic team, continued working until his final days, leaving a legacy of natural sophistication and a carefully planned succession.</p>

The discrepancy in her documents causes daily problems, including job searching. The AG argued that national law, as interpreted by Bulgarian courts, infringes on the right to an identity card for freedom of movement and residency, proposing that legal recognition of gender identity should not be contingent on gender reassignment surgery.</p>

Experts suggest Kim might also be seeking leverage for potential future talks with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has expressed interest in resuming diplomacy. The joint appearance of Kim, Xi, and Putin has sparked speculation about a collective pushback against U.S. pressure, though China remains cautious about a formal three-way alliance.</p>

For two-and-a-half years, their congregations worshipped together, shared ministries, and transcended racial and economic barriers, embodying "the love of Jesus." This historic collaboration, which earned their leaders keys to the city, became a testament to resilience and unity in the face of tragedy.</p>
