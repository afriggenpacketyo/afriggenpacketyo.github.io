          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's former President Yoon Suk Yeol, has reportedly been indicted on charges of corruption and bribery. Accusations include funding a stock manipulation scheme, receiving free opinion polls before the 2022 presidential election, and accepting luxury gifts from the Unification Church in exchange for business favors. Her indictment follows her husband's removal from office and arrest for declaring martial law, and comes after current President Lee Jae Myung approved investigations that Yoon had previously vetoed. This development marks a significant legal challenge for the former first family.</p>

Gauff experienced a public emotional struggle, including seven double faults in the first set, before a medical timeout for Vekić allowed her to reset. Inspired by Simone Biles in the crowd, Gauff adjusted her game, hitting only one double fault in the second set and demonstrating resilience. This challenging match is seen by Gauff as a crucial test shaping her into a tougher competitor for her career.</p>

          <p>The US has ended its long-standing de minimis tariff exemption, which allowed items valued at $800 or less to enter the country duty-free, effective Friday. This 1938 policy saw a massive increase in packages, from 140 million in 2014 to 1.36 billion by 2024, leading to concerns about US retailers, unsafe goods, and drug smuggling. All imports are now subject to duties, with postal services offering flat-rate options for a six-month transition period before full value-based collection begins in February 2026. This policy shift has prompted dozens of foreign postal companies to suspend parcel deliveries to the US due to insufficient preparation time.</p>

          <p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, whom President Trump is attempting to fire. The new referral alleges misrepresentations in Cook's government ethics filings regarding her Cambridge, Massachusetts condominium and two other homes. This follows an earlier referral concerning alleged false claims on mortgage applications, which led to a DOJ criminal investigation. Cook has sued Trump to block her removal, as Pulte continues to act as an aggressive advocate for the president's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>Investigators have revealed that Robin Westman, the attacker who killed two children and injured 18 others at a Minneapolis church, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children" and appeared to hate "all of us." The victims were identified as Fletcher Merkel, 8, and Harper Moyski, 10, whose families expressed profound grief and called for action against gun violence. Westman, who died by suicide, had previously attended the church's school and left a note with anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, and anti-Trump sentiments, leading the FBI to classify the attack as domestic terrorism. Officials are urging media to stop naming the shooter to prevent copycat incidents.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia have asked a federal judge to bar top Trump administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Attorney General Pam Bondi, from making "baseless public attacks" against their client. Abrego Garcia was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year and is now facing criminal prosecution for allegedly transporting undocumented immigrants, which he denies, and potential deportation to Uganda. His attorneys argue that officials' statements, labeling him an "MS-13 gang member" and "child predator," violate his right to a fair trial and could taint any jury pool. This legal battle highlights tensions between the administration's tough stance on immigration and an individual's right to due process.</p>

          <p>Four senior officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resigned, expressing deep concerns over political interference in the agency's scientific work, particularly regarding vaccine policy. Dr. Debra Houry, Chief Science and Medical Officer, and Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, stepped down hours after CDC Director Susan Monarez's ouster. They criticized alterations to evidence reviews and a lack of transparency, warning that re-litigating established vaccine science could undermine public trust and leave the nation vulnerable. These resignations, made without backup jobs, are intended as a "bat signal" to alarm the public about the agency's direction and the "weaponization" of public health.</p>

Key events include the withdrawal of a CDC director nominee over vaccine safety concerns, the firing of the vaccine advisory panel, and the controversial restriction of COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its "customer of size" policy, which previously guaranteed a refund for an extra seat purchased by travelers who "encroach upon neighboring seats." Effective January 27, refunds will only be issued if at least one open seat is available on the flight and both tickets are in the same fare class, sparking "heartbreaking" concerns among plus-size advocates. For a decade, the policy provided dignity and accessibility, easing anxiety about fitting into standard airplane seats, which often range from 15.5 to 19 inches wide. Critics argue this reversal, coupled with the upcoming switch to assigned seating, will create financial burdens and increased travel anxiety for plus-size passengers, potentially reducing their ability to fly.</p>

          <p>A BBC Verify analysis of new video footage has revealed that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday, not twice as initially reported. The attack, which killed at least 20 people including five journalists, involved two near-simultaneous strikes on staircases, followed by two more projectiles hitting the same eastern stairwell within milliseconds, targeting first responders and journalists. Israel's narrative has evolved, with Prime Minister Netanyahu expressing regret and the IDF later claiming a Hamas camera was present, though no evidence was provided. International legal experts suggest the strikes may violate international law, as hospitals retain protected status even with the presence of adversary equipment.</p>

Microsoft cited "serious violations of established company policies and our code of conduct," including safety concerns.

Prosecutors allege Salazar terminated the lease for his Blackstone Avenue location, renewed its insurance policy with a significant increase, and then paid the president of the Screamin’ Demons Motorcycle Club to commit arson. The fire, which occurred in April 2024, resulted in a nearly $1 million insurance payout. Investigators also claim Salazar has a history of alleged arson, including offering an employee money to lie and orchestrating the burning of his former brother-in-law's house.

Her lawyers argue her firing is illegal, stating only President Trump can remove a Senate-confirmed appointee, and that she was targeted for resisting "unscientific, reckless directives." Jim O'Neill, Kennedy's deputy, is named as acting director. Monarez's stance, supported by multiple senior CDC officials who resigned over concerns about vaccine policy and scientific independence, highlights deep institutional conflict and fears for the integrity of public health.</p>

The goal is to identify genes that contribute to their longevity and ability to withstand climatic extremes, using this knowledge to select the best oak trees for future planting.

Councils are submitting plans for new unitary authorities, with the government aiming for single councils covering 500,000 or more residents, though this is now a "guiding principle, not a target."
