          <p>The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by ABC has drawn responses from fellow late-night hosts, including Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Jimmy Fallon. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and came amid pressure from the FCC. Colbert condemned the move as "blatant censorship," while Stewart used satire to mock the idea of government-approved content, and Fallon offered personal support for Kimmel. The collective reaction highlights growing concerns among broadcasters about free speech and media suppression under external pressure.</p>

          <p>During Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, McLaren driver Lando Norris crashed into a wall, causing significant damage to his car and disrupting his session. The incident was costly for Norris, who missed crucial high-fuel race simulation runs, leaving him behind on data collection. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton led a Ferrari one-two, finishing just ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc, who has a strong record at the Baku circuit. Despite Ferrari's strong showing, Leclerc noted that McLaren's true pace was likely hidden and expects them to be highly competitive in qualifying.</p>

          <p>Jamie Hepburn, a minister in the Scottish government, has resigned from his position after being accused of physically assaulting Conservative MSP Douglas Ross. The allegation stems from an incident where Ross claimed Hepburn grabbed him and swore aggressively following a dispute in the Holyrood chamber. In his resignation letter, Hepburn stated that his actions did not align with his personal code of practice, irrespective of whether they breached the Ministerial Code. First Minister John Swinney accepted the resignation with regret, acknowledging it as a single lapse in Hepburn's usual courteous conduct.</p>

Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the one enacted, stated his conversation with the president was brief and congratulatory. This comes amid heightened concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence, as Trump has been openly critical of the central bank and its chair, Jerome Powell. Miran affirmed his decision was made independently and dismissed concerns about a potential conflict of interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney who negotiated Jeffrey Epstein's controversial 2008 plea deal, appeared for a closed-door deposition before the House Oversight Committee. Acosta, who later served as Labor Secretary under President Trump, resigned from that post amid renewed scrutiny of the agreement, which has been widely criticized as too lenient. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that lawmakers have serious questions for Acosta regarding why Epstein was not more aggressively prosecuted despite warnings about his crimes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. retailers are increasingly using a "tariff arbitrage" strategy, known as the B2B2C model, to reduce the financial impact of trade war tariffs on consumers. This method involves routing online orders through a middleman company that purchases the goods at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value, rather than the final retail price. Companies like ESW and Global-e facilitate this process, which can cut tariff costs significantly, helping retailers avoid price increases. While some see this as an innovative adaptation, others warn it may attract regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State health officials in Louisiana have confirmed a fifth death this year from Vibrio vulnificus, a rare flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters. The bacteria can cause life-threatening infections through exposure of open wounds to contaminated water or consumption of raw seafood. Louisiana has seen a significant increase in cases this year, with 26 documented infections, compared to an average of seven annually over the past decade. Experts suggest that warming ocean temperatures may be contributing to the rise in cases, allowing the bacteria to thrive in new areas beyond the Gulf Coast.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's rapid expansion of its online marketplace was facilitated by loosened vetting processes for third-party sellers, leading to an influx of counterfeit and fraudulent products. As Walmart sought to compete with Amazon, it made it easier for sellers to join its platform, sometimes with stolen business identities, resulting in shoppers receiving fake goods. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve seller applications quickly, sacrificing safety for growth. In response to the findings, Walmart has recently tightened its vetting procedures for sellers in certain categories.</p>

The relationship came to light after a colleague raised concerns, leading to an investigation that found Breen's contact details in the inmate's cell. The judge cited Breen's pregnancy and childcare duties as exceptional reasons for suspending the sentence.</p>

          <p>A large fire caused the partial collapse of a commercial building in downtown Barberton, Ohio, late on September 18. Fire crews arrived to find heavy smoke and fire coming from the roof, and the front of the building collapsed onto the street shortly after their arrival. The fire was extinguished within about 25 minutes, and searches of the affected building and two adjacent structures found no victims. The cause of the fire is now under investigation by the South Summit Fire Investigation Unit and the State Fire Marshal. Several neighboring fire departments provided assistance.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have responded to excerpts from Vice President Kamala Harris's forthcoming book, "107 Days." Shapiro stated that Harris will "have to answer" for not publicly raising concerns about Joe Biden's fitness to campaign for re-election. In her memoir, Harris writes that she feared confronting Biden would be seen as self-serving. Buttigieg expressed surprise at Harris's suggestion that he was too risky as a running mate because he is a gay man, stating that voters are more concerned with policy than identity categories.</p>

          <p>The 190th Oktoberfest in Munich has begun, with an estimated six to seven million visitors expected over the next two and a half weeks. This year's festival is marked by record beer prices, with a one-liter stein, or Mass, costing over €15 in most tents. Despite the rising costs, organizers anticipate that around seven million liters of beer will be consumed. The festival is also continuing its push for sustainability, with a goal to become entirely climate-neutral by 2028 through the use of green electricity, water recycling, and an increase in regional and organic food products.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new round of sanctions against Russia that would target Chinese entities involved in purchasing Russian oil. This marks the 19th sanctions package since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine and aims to further curtail Russia's energy revenues, which have already fallen by 90% in Europe. The measures, which must be approved by all 27 EU member states, are also expected to include a ban on EU purchases of Russian liquefied natural gas. The move signals a tougher stance on third-country entities that are seen as helping Moscow circumvent existing economic restrictions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose on Friday, with the 10-year note yield reaching its highest point in two weeks despite the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates earlier in the week. The yield on the 10-year note climbed to 4.145%, a counterintuitive move as short-term rates fell. Investors in longer-term debt are weighing not only future rate expectations but also the outlook for economic growth, inflation, and government finances. Recent economic data, including a positive weekly jobless claims report, has calmed some fears of a slowing economy, contributing to the upward pressure on long-term yields.

          <p>A political analysis argues that the Trump administration's actions leading to Jimmy Kimmel's suspension represent a significant coercion of media organizations. The article refutes conservative claims that the situation is equivalent to the Biden administration's pressure on social media over COVID misinformation. It asserts that the FCC's explicit threats to revoke broadcast licenses over content critical of the administration is a more direct assault on the First Amendment. The piece concludes that while some on the left may have been inconsistent on free speech, it does not justify the current administration's use of regulatory power to silence critics.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement that he will designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is likely to face significant legal hurdles, according to experts. Because antifa is a decentralized movement with no formal structure or leadership, it does not fit the criteria for such a designation. Furthermore, legal scholars point out that the president lacks the authority to designate domestic groups as terrorist organizations, a power that is reserved for foreign entities. Critics argue the move is a political gesture aimed at prosecuting an ideology, which would raise serious First Amendment concerns about free speech and association.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's authorization of U.S. Navy strikes on suspected drug boats from Venezuela represents a dangerous overreach of executive power. The article contends that these actions, which have resulted in at least 14 deaths, lack legal justification under both international and U.S. law, as they do not meet the criteria for self-defense against an imminent threat. The author, a former Naval War College professor, criticizes the administration for bypassing Congress and acting as a "rogue state on the high seas." The piece warns that these actions could normalize the idea of the military as the president's personal enforcement tool.</p>
