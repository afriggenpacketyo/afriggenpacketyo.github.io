          <p>State inspectors approved the emergency plan for Camp Mystic just two days before a devastating flash flood claimed the lives of dozens, including many children and a camp counselor. Despite receiving multiple flood warnings from the National Weather Service, the camp did not evacuate its hundreds of campers and staff from the flood-prone Guadalupe River area. The tragedy has raised significant questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparedness and the state's oversight, as details of the approved plan remain unclear. The event has left the community reeling as search efforts for the missing continue.</p>

          <p>The United States has announced new tariff proposals targeting Japan and South Korea, two key allies already grappling with economic headwinds. These tariffs focus on crucial exports like automobiles and steel, threatening to exacerbate existing slowdowns and potentially push Japan into a technical recession. Economists predict the measures could significantly lower GDP growth for both export-dependent nations, which count the U.S. as a primary market. The move is seen as a pressure tactic to force concessions in ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cato Institute is legally challenging the Trump administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs, arguing it represents an unconstitutional overreach of executive power. In an amicus brief, the libertarian think tank supports a lower court ruling that found the tariffs were not legally authorized for addressing issues like drug trafficking or trade imbalances. The case highlights the struggle of small businesses impacted by the unpredictable duties and questions the separation of powers, as critics argue Congress has delegated too much authority to the president.

          <p>John Fogerty, at 80 years old, delivered a powerful and energetic rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The setlist was heavily dominated by classics from his time with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a lengthy legal battle. Despite the passage of time, Fogerty's vocal performance remained remarkably consistent and strong, and he played guitar with vigor throughout the two-hour show. The concert was a testament to the enduring power and legacy of his music, which continues to resonate with audiences.</p>

          <p>Four days after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas, at least 161 people are still missing in Kerr County alone, with the statewide death toll rising to over 109. Governor Greg Abbott stated that search and rescue operations are ongoing, utilizing helicopters, drones, and more than 250 responders in the Kerrville area. The missing include campers and a counselor from the devastated Camp Mystic. Officials have faced questions about the adequacy of warnings, with the governor acknowledging that while a storm was expected, its sheer magnitude, which he described as a "30-foot high tsunami wall of water," was unforeseen.</p>

          <p>China's producer prices fell by 3.6% in June compared to the previous year, the most significant drop since July 2023, signaling deepening deflationary pressures within the economy. This decline was worse than anticipated and comes as Chinese companies engage in an intense price war to attract consumers amid tepid demand. While producer prices have been in decline for years, the consumer price index showed a slight 0.1% increase, a small sign of recovery. Policymakers have criticized the aggressive price-cutting, which has hurt business profitability without significantly boosting consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several Instagram users have reported extreme stress after their accounts were wrongly banned for allegedly violating the platform's rules on child sexual exploitation. The BBC highlighted cases where parent company Meta permanently disabled accounts, only to reinstate them with an apology after journalistic inquiry. The issue appears to stem from the platform's AI-powered moderation system, which has led to thousands of users claiming false bans and facing an ineffective appeals process. The incidents have caused significant distress, loss of income for businesses, and the deletion of years of personal memories for affected users.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move that follows an investigation into the national security impact of foreign copper. The decision caused U.S. copper prices to jump to a record high. The metal is a crucial component in military equipment, electric vehicles, and construction, with the U.S. importing about half of its supply from countries like Chile and Canada. This action is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to protect American industries, with similar measures looming for pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

After the posts were removed, the Grok account stated the comments were an "unacceptable error" and that its creator, xAI, is working to refine the model.

The crash also caused the Tesla to hit a pickup truck, injuring its six occupants. Jiminez has pleaded not guilty to murder and several other charges, including assault with a deadly weapon, and faces a potential life sentence if convicted.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods have intensified focus on the Trump administration's staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) and its parent agency, NOAA. Since February, the NWS has lost about 600 staff, raising concerns about the agency's ability to provide timely and effective warnings for severe weather events. While experts believe the NWS performed well in this instance, they warn that continued staff shortages could compromise future responses. The disaster highlights the critical role of federal weather agencies and the potential life-or-death consequences of underfunding and understaffing them in an era of increasing weather extremes.</p>

          <p>To combat a severe backlog of nearly 77,000 cases in England and Wales, a review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended introducing judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud. The proposed reforms aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by streamlining the justice process, which currently sees some victims and defendants waiting years for a trial. Other suggestions include increasing out-of-court resolutions and creating a new court division to handle less serious cases. While some legal professionals support the changes to speed up justice, others argue that removing juries undermines the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

While Collins's post did not name a specific drug, the ASA determined it clearly referenced and promoted a service providing such medications.

The piece argues this is not an isolated glitch but a systemic problem, reflecting both the inherent biases in large language models and Musk's ideological preference for minimal guardrails.

This massive carbon footprint is attributed to the high reliance on air travel between the widespread host cities and the significant increase in the number of matches.
