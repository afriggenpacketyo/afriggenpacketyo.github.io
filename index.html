          <p>A shipment of approximately 14,000 chicks from a Pennsylvania hatchery intended for various farms was mishandled by the United States Postal Service, resulting in 4,000 deaths and 10,000 survivors overwhelming a Delaware animal shelter. The chicks were found abandoned in a delivery truck without water, food, or temperature control after a routine shipment went awry. The Freedom Ranger Hatchery expressed frustration over the Postal Service's failure to deliver the chicks to their intended destinations, which included Spokane, Wash., and the lack of explanation for the error. The shelter has been providing 24/7 care and has put the surviving birds up for adoption while the Postal Service investigates the incident and its established processes for live animal shipments.</p>

Babbitt was part of a group attempting to breach the House of Representatives chamber during the certification of the 2020 election results. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed his disappointment with the settlement, emphasizing that the officer involved was cleared of wrongdoing and that the decision sends a chilling message to law enforcement officers. Babbitt's family had filed a wrongful death lawsuit, claiming negligence on the part of the officer, though reviews by the Capitol Police and the Justice Department found no evidence of police misconduct.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's injunction, allowing the termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants to proceed while legal challenges continue. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The TPS program, established in 1990, provides temporary immigration protections for migrants from countries facing wars or natural disasters. The Trump administration argued that continuing the program was "contrary to the national interest," while TPS beneficiaries argued that ending the protections would cause significant harm and force them to return to a dangerous country. The case underscores ongoing debates over immigration policy and executive power.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have climbed back above 7% following Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, reflecting concerns about the government's growing debt levels. The increase in mortgage rates adds to the challenges faced by aspiring homebuyers, who are already dealing with high home prices and a shortage of affordable properties. Analysts expect limited additional market impact from the downgrade, but elevated mortgage rates are likely to persist. (not investment advice)</p>
