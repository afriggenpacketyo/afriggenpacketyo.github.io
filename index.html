          <p>Denis Arndt, a Tony Award-nominated actor known for his roles in 'S.W.A.T.' and 'Basic Instinct,' died peacefully at 86.  His family described him as a "Renaissance man" with a generous spirit and passion for his art.  The obituary, published in Fox News,  shows a potential bias towards celebrating Arndt's Hollywood career, perhaps downplaying his military service and other life aspects.</p>
