          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial has begun in New York, with jury selection underway. Combs faces charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution, potentially leading to a life sentence if convicted. He also faces numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of drugging, assaulting, sexually assaulting, intimidating, and silencing people, all of which he denies, dismissing the claims as attempts for a quick payday. The trial is expected to last around eight weeks, with proceedings open to the public but not televised. The article details the charges, allegations, and Combs' defense against them.</p>

          <p>After weekend talks in Geneva, the United States and China have agreed to temporarily suspend most tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in their trade war. The agreement involves reducing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower its import duty on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that both sides have a shared interest in balanced trade and neither side desires a decoupling of the two economies. Global markets responded positively to the announcement, with stocks surging and the U.S. dollar strengthening. This article provides an overview of the tariff reductions and the context of the trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who stated that the armed struggle has outlived its purpose and that further progress can be achieved through politics. The decision could reshape Turkish politics and influence other Kurdish militias in the region, potentially leading to greater Kurdish rights and a terror-free Turkey. President Erdogan needs the support of pro Kurdish political parties if he is to be able to run again in Turkey's next presidential election, due in 2028.</p>

Edward White, author of "Dianaworld: An Obsession," notes that Kate was more mature when she married Prince William, and she learned from Diana's experiences to avoid rushing into royal life. Kate receives strong support from the palace and her family, which Diana lacked, and she maintains a focus on duty.

          <p>President Donald Trump has promised to use executive powers to significantly cut prescription drug prices in the U.S., aiming for reductions of 30% to 80% to align with prices in other countries.

This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks due to concerns about potential profit declines.

          <p>The United States and China have indicated progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with both sides describing the discussions as productive and constructive. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "substantial progress," and a joint statement is expected to provide further details. The talks are the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, causing financial market turmoil. While analysts anticipate tariff cuts, they expect them to remain above historical norms, potentially still disrupting international trade flows.</p>
