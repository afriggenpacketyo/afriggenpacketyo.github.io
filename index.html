          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has generated tsunami waves that have reached the United States. The National Tsunami Warning Center confirmed waves measuring up to 1.6 feet in California and 4.9 feet in Hawaii, prompting tsunami warnings and advisories across the Pacific, including for Alaska, Guam, and the U.S. West Coast. Authorities issued evacuation orders in some coastal areas and urged caution, though initial reports from Hawaii suggest a major, destructive tsunami is not expected to strike the islands. The event has caused significant disruptions, including flight cancellations and diversions for carriers like Hawaiian and Alaskan Airlines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from India, citing the country's high tariffs and trade barriers as justification. President Trump also criticized India for its significant purchases of military equipment and energy from Russia, particularly during the conflict in Ukraine. The move is part of a broader strategy to address what the administration views as unfair trade practices and a large U.S. trade deficit with India, which grew to $45.7 billion in 2024. This action aligns with the administration's recent threats of imposing tariffs on countries that do not secure trade deals with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks has agreed to acquire Israeli identity security provider CyberArk in a massive deal valued at approximately $25 billion. The acquisition, which offers a 26% premium to CyberArk shareholders, marks a significant move for Palo Alto Networks into the identity security market. CEO Nikesh Arora stated the timing is strategic, as the identity market is at an inflection point, especially with the rise of AI threats. Following the announcement, Palo Alto Networks' stock fell by 7%, while CyberArk's shares saw a slight dip, reflecting investor reaction to one of the largest cybersecurity deals of the year.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of shrinking same-store sales and missing earnings expectations, Starbucks is showing early signs of a successful turnaround, according to some Wall Street analysts. Executives highlighted that customer traffic improved sequentially each month during the quarter, with notable growth among non-rewards members for the first time in years. CEO Brian Niccol's "Back to Starbucks" strategy, which includes labor changes and new menu innovations, is giving some analysts greater confidence in the company's future performance. However, the company's stock fell slightly, indicating that not all investors are yet convinced by the pace of the recovery.</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans are moving forward with a controversial mid-decade push to redraw the state's congressional district maps, a move they claim could add up to five GOP-friendly seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. State lawmakers are expected to unveil the proposed maps soon, prompting a strong backlash from Democrats who accuse the GOP of attempting to "cheat to win." House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is scheduled to meet with Texas Democrats to strategize a response, which may include legal challenges. This effort is part of a broader national strategy by Republicans to solidify their House majority, while Democrats in states like California explore their own options.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after the match-fixing scandal that ended his career, this article revisits the life and legacy of former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje. Once a national hero, Cronje's fall from grace was dramatic, culminating in a lifetime ban for his dealings with bookmakers. The article explores the duality of his character: a charismatic leader who was also driven by an obsession with money, which led to his corruption. His story, which ended tragically in a 2002 plane crash that sparked conspiracy theories, remains a complex tale of temptation, betrayal, and a lost chance for redemption in the world of sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the resurgence of protectionism in U.S. politics, tracing how tariffs have become a central tool of modern Republican trade policy under President Trump. Featuring trade historian Douglas Irwin, the discussion refutes common myths about tariffs, arguing they historically harm domestic manufacturing by increasing the cost of inputs and provoking retaliation. The analysis contends that rather than fixing trade deficits or checking rivals like China, tariffs slow economic growth, increase government-led corruption, and disproportionately tax lower-income Americans who spend more on goods. The conversation also explores why these economically costly policies maintain political appeal despite their demonstrated negative effects. (not investment advice)</p>

Months after its recapture by the army, the city is a tragic shell of its former self, yet the few remaining residents consistently welcome visitors with offerings of tea and coffee. This ritual of kindness persists even among those who have lost everything—family, homes, and belongings—to the brutal civil war.

The period's data reflects economic activity following the administration's tariff announcements, which had previously caused imports to surge. While the report shows underlying strength, some metrics, like final sales to private domestic purchasers, indicate a potential slowdown, and the housing market continues to face headwinds from high mortgage rates.

          <h2>U.S.-China Trade Negotiations Conclude Without a Deal, Extending Stalemate</h2>

          <p>The latest round of trade negotiations between the United States and China, held in Stockholm, has ended without a conclusive agreement, continuing the ongoing economic standoff. While a 90-day truce has paused the most severe tariff escalations, key differences over strategic issues like China's dominance in rare earth materials and U.S. restrictions on AI chip exports remain unresolved. Analysts suggest both sides are buying time in hopes of a future shift or a high-level meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping later this year. The outcome leaves global markets in a state of uncertainty, as failure to secure a deal could lead to tariff re-impositions. (not investment advice)</p>

California cities dominate the list, occupying the top five most expensive markets due to a combination of high-paying job markets, desirable lifestyles, and limited housing supply. The analysis also places cities like San Francisco, Anaheim, San Diego, and Los Angeles in the top ten. This trend highlights the significant affordability challenges facing would-be buyers, as rising prices continue to outpace wage growth in these high-demand areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The population of England and Wales is estimated to have grown by over 700,000 in the year to June 2024, marking the second-largest annual increase in over 75 years. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this jump was almost entirely due to net international migration, which stood at 690,100, despite being lower than the previous year. Natural change contributed only a small fraction to the growth. The figures have reignited political debate over immigration policy, with both major parties acknowledging the pressures that such rapid population growth places on public services and housing.</p>

          <p>China has commenced construction of a massive dam on the Yarlung Tsangpo river, near its disputed border with India, raising significant environmental and geopolitical concerns for downstream nations. The hydropower project, larger than the Three Gorges Dam, gives Beijing potential control over water flows into India's northeast and Bangladesh. Indian officials and experts express alarm that China could weaponize water resources, impact agriculture by trapping nutrient-rich sediments, and pose a catastrophic risk in the earthquake-prone region. The unilateral move, made without a water-sharing treaty, is expected to become a major new source of tension between the two powers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has firmly stated that the August 1st deadline for implementing reciprocal tariffs on numerous countries will not be extended, creating a hard stop for ongoing trade negotiations. This announcement was made alongside a specific declaration of a 25% tariff on India, signaling the administration's resolve to move forward with its protectionist trade policies. In the lead-up to the deadline, the administration sent letters to over two dozen countries detailing new import tax rates, with some significantly higher than previously indicated. The stance adds pressure on nations to finalize trade agreements with the U.S. or face steep new duties on their exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump has implemented a new practice of personally meeting with candidates for promotion to four-star general, a departure from traditional military promotion protocols. A spokesperson defended the move, stating the president wants to ensure military leaders are "war fighters first — not bureaucrats." However, the practice has raised concerns among current and former officials about the potential politicization of the military's senior ranks. This development aligns with the president's previous statements about wanting to remove "woke generals" and ensure ideological alignment within the Defense Department's leadership.</p>
