            <p>Crude oil futures experienced a rise of over 1% on Tuesday, recovering from significant losses triggered by anxieties surrounding President Trump's proposed tariffs and the potential for a global trade war. U.S. crude oil increased by 75 cents to $61.45 per barrel, while Brent crude rose by 69 cents to $64.90 per barrel. China has voiced its opposition to Trump's tariffs, announcing retaliatory measures, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes China's escalation is a miscalculation due to the imbalance in export volumes between the two countries.

            <p>Brandon Williams, President Trump's nominee to oversee America's nuclear arsenal, faces a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing amidst both support and scrutiny. Supporters highlight his Navy experience and technical competence, while critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, question his lack of advanced degrees and raise concerns about potential Chinese ties through his software company. The NNSA is currently managing a $200 billion nuclear modernization project, and Williams's ability to lead this effort effectively is under debate, especially given GAO findings of cost overruns and delays.</p>

This reversal followed Kennedy Jr.'s admission that a CDC program monitoring lead exposure among children was almost entirely gutted, with plans to move the work to the new Administration for a Healthy America.</p>
