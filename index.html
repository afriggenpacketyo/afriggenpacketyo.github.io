          <p>Large-scale protests have marked President Donald Trump's second state visit to the United Kingdom, with thousands gathering in central London to voice their opposition. Organized by a coalition of over 50 groups, demonstrators marched with signs denouncing racism and Trump's politics, creating a significant security challenge for the more than 1,600 police officers deployed. Speakers at the rally, including former Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, criticized the visit and the politics Trump represents, reflecting widespread public discontent.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the ousted former director of the CDC, told a Senate committee that she was fired after refusing demands from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to rubber-stamp recommendations from a new vaccine advisory panel "regardless of the scientific evidence." She testified that Kennedy also ordered her to dismiss career vaccine experts without cause and that he frequently communicated with President Trump about changing US vaccine policy. Her testimony highlights a significant conflict between political appointees and career scientists over the integrity of public health agencies.</p>

          <p>Michael Rapino, the CEO of Live Nation, stated that despite public perception of high prices, concert tickets are still relatively underpriced compared to major sporting events. Speaking at a conference, he highlighted the immense demand for live events in a post-pandemic world, noting that touring has become the primary revenue source for artists. Rapino argued that the average concert ticket price of $72 is a bargain compared to professional sports, where premium seats can cost thousands, reflecting a fundamental shift in the economics of live entertainment.</p>

          <p>A man is in federal custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh field office in what authorities initially described as a "targeted attack." The suspect, identified as Donald Henson, reportedly has a history of mental health issues and had recently visited the office to make a complaint that was determined to lack a federal nexus. No injuries were reported in the incident, and investigators are examining a message written on the vehicle's window.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral medication, orforglipron, proved more effective at lowering blood sugar and promoting weight loss in Type 2 diabetes patients than Novo Nordisk's approved pill, Rybelsus. The late-stage study showed that the highest dose of Eli Lilly's drug reduced hemoglobin A1c by 2.2% and resulted in an average weight loss of 19.7 pounds. These results position orforglipron as a potentially strong contender in the lucrative and growing market for convenient, needle-free GLP-1 treatments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is set to make the path to citizenship more challenging by reinstating a longer and more difficult civics test from 2020. Under the new rules, applicants will need to correctly answer 12 out of 20 questions drawn from a pool of 128, a significant increase from the previous requirement of 6 out of 10 from a pool of 100. This change is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to tighten legal immigration processes, which pro-immigrant advocates argue creates unnecessary barriers for long-term residents.</p>

          <p>The practice of companies suspending their 401(k) matching contributions is raising concerns about employee retirement security, as exemplified by a recent decision at Sherwin-Williams. While legally permissible in most cases, such moves are often a sign of financial distress and can be seen by employees as a pay cut and a breach of trust. Experts note that while these suspensions can be temporary, they risk damaging workforce morale and may prompt valuable employees to seek jobs elsewhere with more stable benefits.</p>

          <h2>Fired Labor Statistics Chief Warns of 'Dangerous' Political Interference with Economic Data</h2>

          <p>Erika McEntarfer, the former head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) who was fired by President Trump, has spoken out against her removal, calling it a "dangerous" act of political interference. McEntarfer was dismissed after the agency revised job growth numbers downward, which Trump claimed without evidence was a "RIGGED" effort to make him look bad. She warned that undermining the independence of federal statistical agencies erodes market trust and could lead to severe economic consequences, drawing parallels to crises in other countries where data was manipulated.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament has approved significant justice reforms, most notably the elimination of the "not proven" verdict, a unique and long-standing feature of the country's legal system. This change, part of a broader bill, will leave juries with only "guilty" and "not guilty" options. To address concerns that this could increase wrongful convictions, the reforms will also raise the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds, and will establish a specialized court for sexual offenses.</p>

          <p>An American woman living in Taiwan has highlighted the stark differences in postpartum care between the two countries after spending $5,000 for a comprehensive experience that she says would be inaccessible in the U.S. After giving birth, she stayed at a postpartum care facility that provided 24/7 baby care, nutritionist-prepared meals, and wellness treatments, an established practice in Taiwan. She contrasted this supportive and affordable system with her "traumatic" first birth in the U.S., which cost double the amount for far less care.</p>

          <p>A state-mandated report has revealed that the Los Angeles Police Department deployed more than 1,000 less-lethal projectiles, including bean bags and rubber rounds, against protesters during a single day of demonstrations in June. The protests were against the Trump administration's immigration policies and the deployment of the National Guard. This heavy use of force has drawn scrutiny and concern from legal experts, who question whether it violated a 2021 California law restricting such munitions and represents an improper method of policing protests.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut this week, but the decision is complicated by both economic uncertainty and political pressure from the White House. While markets have priced in the cut, the Fed's forecast for the remainder of the year will be closely watched for signals of future policy direction. The meeting is also notable for the presence of a new Trump-appointed governor, who may dissent in favor of a more aggressive cut, highlighting growing divisions within the central bank.</p>

The exchange highlights the intense competition and strategic disagreements within the U.S. airline industry as budget carriers struggle with rising costs and larger airlines adopt similar no-frills ticketing strategies.</p>
