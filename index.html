          <p>During an Oval Office event marking the end of his role in the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk addressed a New York Times report alleging frequent ketamine use during the 2024 campaign, questioning the publication's credibility. Musk has publicly acknowledged having a prescription for ketamine, stating he uses it infrequently to manage a "depressive mindstate," though reports suggest more frequent use. Despite criticizing parts of Trump's agenda recently, Musk was praised by Trump and expects to remain an advisor to the president, and the administration says DOGE has saved about $170 billion so far. Musk brushed off concerns about the impact of his reported drug use on his companies, emphasizing "what matters is execution."</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey indicated that UK defence spending is expected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plans to increase it to 2.5% by 2027. The upcoming strategic defence review will prioritize military and security spending, including the deployment of "digital" experts to protect troops from drones and control unmanned weapons. New money for defence will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, and this cut in aid prompted International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds to resign in February. NATO is expected to call on allies to increase defence spending at an upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is warning consumers about scam websites offering rice at heavily discounted prices as rice prices soar due to a poor harvest. Complaints have spiked since March, with reports of rice not being delivered after payment, and in some cases, customers receiving unrelated items instead. The average price of rice at supermarkets has nearly doubled compared to last year, reaching a record high, and the government is attempting to curb prices by releasing rice stockpiles. Consumers are advised to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid websites with unrealistically low prices to avoid these scams.</p>

          <p>Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities closed the road and advised the public to avoid the area, while beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate their queen. The road where the truck overturned was closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, and hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored and returned to use. By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, despite continued convention traffic. Visitor numbers have decreased compared to the previous year, and hotel occupancy rates have also slipped, with average nightly rates on the Las Vegas Strip increasing. International visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, are also fewer in number, and heavy traffic due to construction and special events is deterring some tourists. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and city officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience.</p>

The lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and violating the First Amendment through viewpoint discrimination and illegal retaliation. The executive order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS," alleging that the two news organizations have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda with taxpayer dollars, and PBS vehemently denies the charge.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the US will double its current tariff rate on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%, starting on Wednesday. Speaking at a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Trump said the move would help boost the local steel industry and national supply, while decreasing reliance on China. He touted the increase to 50% as a way to ensure US Steel's survival, and one of the major concerns from steelworkers about the US-Japan trade deal was how Japan would honor workers' union contract which regulates pay and hiring. He also accused China of violating a truce they'd reached over tariffs earlier this month over talks in Geneva.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities and supporters are expressing anger and disappointment over the sport's 130-year history without a knighthood or damehood, suggesting potential snobbery and class prejudice within the honors system. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, and a cross-party group of MPs have voiced their support for recognizing rugby league stars, contrasting it with rugby union's frequent knighthoods. The lack of top honors is believed to be linked to the working-class backgrounds of rugby league players, who often didn't attend elite schools or mix in privileged social circles.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces 50% Steel Tariffs and Hails Deal with Japan</h2>

          <p>Donald Trump announced he was doubling foreign tariffs on steel imports to 50%, as he celebrated an agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel during a rally in Pennsylvania. Trump unveiled the tariff rate increase, declaring that the dramatic hike would “even further secure the steel industry in the United States”. The powerful United Steelworkers union remained wary, and Trump has thrown his full support behind the “partnership” between the Japanese and American steel giants, months after insisting he was “totally against” a $14.9bn bid by Nippon Steel for its US rival.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Japanese company Nippon Steel that he said would keep the iconic U.S. steelmaker in Pittsburgh and invest billions in facilities in several other states. Trump said Nippon would invest a total of $14 billion in U.S. Steel, and he emphasized that the U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, bringing in more jobs for Americans. He pledged that there will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever, and the deal would ensure U.S Steel would still be "controlled by the USA."

The author suggests that the redefinition of "harm," "abuse," "neglect," and "trauma" has led to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting. As a result, the author contends that their generation dreads parenthood because they've held their own parents to unreachable standards, standards that they themselves would struggle to meet.</p>

This decision means investors should not expect SEC protection and should buy at their own risk, and the SEC's shift to a more industry-friendly approach to crypto is controversial due to President Trump's family's involvement in crypto, leading to conflict of interest concerns. The $TRUMP token, largely controlled by the Trump Organization, has no underlying value, and Sen.
