Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's CSI 300 both recorded significant climbs, with the latter reaching its highest point since late 2024. In contrast, South Korea's Kospi experienced a decline, and Singapore reported a larger-than-expected contraction in non-oil domestic exports for July. The overall market sentiment was cautiously optimistic, partly influenced by hopes for potential U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which had previously fueled a strong week on Wall Street.

          <p>Ahead of a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that the responsibility to end the war lies with the Ukrainian leader. In a social media post, Trump suggested Zelenskyy could halt the conflict "almost immediately" by accepting that Ukraine would not join NATO and would not regain Crimea. This statement follows Trump's recent talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where Moscow reportedly offered to freeze front lines in exchange for Ukrainian withdrawal from key eastern regions, a proposal Zelenskyy has previously rejected as strategically untenable for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has regained strength and is now a powerful Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 130 mph. The hurricane is currently located north of the Caribbean and is moving northwest, prompting tropical storm warnings for the Turks and Caicos and the southeast Bahamas. While the storm is not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. East Coast, its large size poses a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents along the Southeast coast. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect Erin to remain a dangerous major hurricane through the middle of the week.</p>

          <p>China's efforts to expand its global soft power are encountering a complex international landscape, marked by both successes and challenges. While Chinese-made cultural products like the "Labubu" dolls and popular streaming shows are gaining overseas fans, enthusiasm for learning Mandarin in Western countries appears to be waning. Analysts suggest this shift is influenced by China's economic situation and evolving global image. Internally, Chinese experts are urging the nation to better control its own narrative to counteract Western perspectives and strengthen its discourse power on the world stage.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security protections similar to NATO's Article 5. This significant concession was reportedly made during the recent summit with President Trump and is being described as a potential "game-changing" development in negotiations to end the war. Such a guarantee would address one of Ukraine's primary security concerns and could offer a path forward, bypassing Russia's long-standing opposition to formal NATO membership for Kyiv. European leaders have welcomed the development but await further details on its practical implementation.</p>

          <p>Bolivia is on track to elect its first non-left-wing president in nearly twenty years, as preliminary results from Sunday's election show right-leaning candidates in the lead. Senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira and former president Jorge Quiroga are set to face each other in a run-off election after neither secured an outright majority. This political turn comes amid a severe economic crisis in the country, with voters expressing a desire for change after two decades of rule by the socialist MAS party. The outcome is expected to significantly alter Bolivia's foreign policy, potentially fostering closer ties with the U.S. and increasing foreign investment.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally, with the Shanghai Composite Index surging to a level not seen since August 2015. This increase in risk appetite is driven by investors moving funds from low-yield bonds and bank deposits into the stock market, creating a notable "wealth effect." The strong performance comes as a surprise to some, given recent official data indicating a general slowdown in China's economic growth momentum in July. Analysts believe the trend may continue, fueled by hopes for further stimulus measures from Beijing to support the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its federal intervention in Washington D.C., with three additional states—West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio—committing to deploy National Guard troops to the city. This move is part of President Trump's broader initiative to address what he terms as out-of-control crime in the nation's capital. However, crime prevention experts have expressed skepticism, arguing that such deployments do little to solve the systemic issues underlying violence and property crime. The policy has also prompted concern among Democratic mayors in other cities, who are preparing for potential similar actions.</p>

          <h2>Ban on Pigeon Feeding in Mumbai Sparks Conflict Between Activists and Authorities</h2>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has ignited a heated debate, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious groups. Authorities imposed the ban due to health risks associated with pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding birds is a pious act. While experts point to the ecological and health problems caused by pigeon overpopulation, activists argue for finding a middle ground, such as designated feeding times, to balance hygiene with cultural traditions.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts forecast that Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent. This trend highlights a strategic shift within these companies, as they increasingly focus on novel drug development, reducing their historical reliance on the sale of generic medications.

          <p>This article compiles opinions from medical professionals about cosmetic surgeries they consider overly dangerous or likely to have poor long-term outcomes. Procedures like Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), rib removal, and certain facial fillers are highlighted due to risks such as embolism, organ damage, and undesirable effects from aging. The consensus suggests that the potential complications of these surgeries often outweigh their aesthetic benefits, with some surgeons also warning against medical tourism for discounted procedures due to the difficulty of managing complications upon returning home.</p>

          <p>The Green Party in the UK is at a strategic crossroads as it holds a leadership election, with candidates debating the party's future direction. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bold "eco-populist" approach, aiming to connect with voter anger and challenge the elite more directly. In contrast, his opponents, current co-leader Adrian Ramsay and MP Ellie Chowns, argue for continuing the more moderate, locally-focused strategy that led to record success in the last general election. The outcome will determine whether the party embraces a more radical tone or sticks with its proven formula for electoral growth.</p>

          <p>A massive concert by the ultra-nationalist Croatian singer Thompson has exposed profound societal divisions over the country's history. The event, attended by hundreds of thousands, featured the controversial chant "Za dom, spremni" ("For homeland, ready!"), which originated with the World War Two-era Nazi-allied Ustasha movement. While supporters, including some government officials, defend the chant as a patriotic symbol from the 1990s war of independence, human rights groups and opposition parties condemn it as a neo-fascist salute. The debate reveals conflicting interpretations of Croatia's past and raises concerns about rising nationalism.</p>

          <p>Japan is facing a severe demographic crisis, with its population shrinking for 15 consecutive years due to a historically low birth rate and falling marriage rates. The country is projected to lose half its population by the end of the century, posing immense challenges to its economy, healthcare, and social structure. In response, the government has launched initiatives like a city-sponsored dating app and shortened workweeks to encourage family formation. This trend is seen as a cautionary tale for other developed nations, including the U.S., which is also experiencing its own record-low fertility rate.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged after U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers discovered 14 live toucans hidden inside the dashboard of his vehicle at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry. The young, protected birds were found sedated and injured, with some suffering broken bones. This incident marks the fourth recent case of exotic bird smuggling in the San Diego area, a trend that authorities say is not only cruel to the animals but also poses a public health risk by bypassing mandatory quarantine and disease testing. The illegal wildlife trade threatens endangered species and ecological balance.</p>
