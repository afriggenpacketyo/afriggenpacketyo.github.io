          <p>Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook, through her attorney Abbe Lowell, announced plans to file a lawsuit challenging her recent removal by President Donald Trump. Trump's decision was reportedly based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which Cook's legal team vehemently denies, asserting a lack of factual or legal grounds for dismissal. Cook has publicly stated her refusal to resign, emphasizing her commitment to her role in supporting the American economy since 2022. This legal challenge emerges amidst a Justice Department criminal investigation into Cook regarding alleged false statements on home mortgage applications, raising significant questions about the extent of presidential authority over Federal Reserve appointments and the process for removing such high-ranking officials.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently at 6.58% for a 30-year fixed rate, are expected to see minimal change even if the Federal Reserve implements a rate cut in September. Experts suggest that while a 0.25% Fed rate cut is likely "baked into the market," mortgage rates primarily follow the bond market, not directly the federal funds rate. Fannie Mae projects rates around 6.5% by year-end, with a slight decrease to 6.1% in 2026, while other forecasts anticipate rates closer to 6% by the end of 2025. A significant drop below 6% could trigger a surge in homebuyer demand, potentially pushing home prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's impactful "Tips From Former Smokers" advertising campaign is slated to end in September, a decision stemming from funding cuts and a Trump administration reorganization of the CDC. For 13 years, these powerful ads shared real stories of smoking's devastating health consequences, directing individuals to free quitline services and prompting millions of successful quit attempts, which in turn saved billions in healthcare costs. Public health advocates and individuals like Leslie Allison-Seei, who credits the campaign with saving her life, express profound fears that discontinuing this vital program will lead to preventable deaths and increased healthcare spending, effectively dismantling decades of public health progress.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick revealed that the Pentagon is actively discussing the potential for the U.S. government to acquire equity stakes in leading defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin. This consideration follows the government's recent $9 billion acquisition of 10% of Intel stock, signaling a broader strategy by the Trump administration to exert greater control over key private industries. Lutnick suggested the current financing methods for defense capabilities are a "giveaway," hinting at a major overhaul of Pentagon appropriations. Critics, including some conservatives, warn that such moves could compromise free-market principles and introduce political considerations into corporate decision-making.</p>

The 28-year-old All-Star is now among an elite group, being the eighth player in MLB history to reach 50 homers before the end of August and the second Mariner, following Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. His impressive season, featuring 30 home runs as a left-handed hitter and 20 as a right-handed hitter, underscores his significant impact and versatility on the field.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tax Bill May Expand 0% Capital Gains Eligibility for 2025</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" for 2025, while maintaining existing capital gains rates, is expected to broaden eligibility for the 0% capital gains bracket due to new deductions. Investors holding assets for over a year typically face rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on their taxable income, with an additional 3.8% surcharge for higher earners. Financial planners highlight a temporary $6,000 tax break for older Americans, which doubles to $12,000 for married couples, as a significant factor. This provision can substantially reduce taxable income, presenting a "golden opportunity" for qualifying individuals to realize profits from asset sales without triggering a tax liability.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against all 15 federal judges of the Maryland district court, which challenged a standing order preventing the immediate deportation of migrants contesting their detentions. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, appointed by President Trump, ruled that the Justice Department's challenge was improper, violating legal precedent and constitutional tradition by suing a co-equal branch of government. Cullen criticized the administration's "concerted effort to smear and impugn individual judges," suggesting the proper recourse would be to appeal specific decisions or petition the judicial council, rather than a broad lawsuit. The Maryland court's order was implemented to manage a surge in emergency lawsuits and ensure due process for detainees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy experts generally recommend adjusting your air conditioning thermostat a few degrees higher than normal when leaving home for several hours, rather than completely turning it off. While turning off the AC can save energy and money for extended periods, it carries risks such as mold growth in humid environments and increased wear on the system when it strains to rapidly recool the house. Adjusting the thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit for eight hours daily can potentially yield up to 10% savings annually on heating and cooling costs. The most effective strategy depends on various factors, including local climate, home insulation quality, and the type of AC unit, with smart thermostats offering convenient optimization.</p>

Warmer falls, a trend observed since the early 1900s, can prolong dangerous summer-like heat, increase cooling costs, extend growing and allergy seasons, and potentially diminish the vibrancy of fall foliage.

          <p>A wildfire in central Oregon, which previously destroyed four homes, has begun to stabilize due to increased moisture, though firefighters still have extensive work ahead. Meanwhile, the Pickett fire in northern California's Napa county continues to burn, having charred approximately 10 square miles, but has so far spared the region's famous vineyards. Firefighting efforts are challenged by ongoing hot, dry weather and potential erratic winds from thunderstorms. While some Oregon evacuation orders have been lifted, a 60-year-old contract firefighter tragically died from a cardiac emergency while battling the Bivens Creek fire in Montana, highlighting the dangers faced by crews.</p>

          <p>Over 100 US human rights, faith-based, and civil rights organizations have urgently called upon Secretary of State Marco Rubio to secure the release of Mohammed Zaher Ibrahim, a 16-year-old dual American-Palestinian citizen held in an Israeli prison for six months. Ibrahim, arrested at age 15 over allegations of rock throwing, has reportedly suffered deteriorating health, including scabies and significant weight loss, in a prison notorious for abusing Palestinian children. The coalition asserts his imprisonment violates the Fourth Geneva Convention and criticizes the US government's "inadequate response" to his detention, intensifying pressure for immediate intervention to protect American children abroad.</p>

          <p>For individuals seeking to increase their calcium intake, experts highlight various non-dairy and less obvious food sources crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Beyond traditional dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese, calcium can be found in fortified non-dairy milks, fruit juices, and cereals. Registered dietitians also recommend tofu made with calcium, as well as canned fish with bones like salmon and sardines. Certain vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and bok choy also contribute to calcium levels. Consulting a doctor about supplements is advised if dietary intake remains insufficient, emphasizing natural food sources as the primary method for nutrient absorption.</p>

          <p>As many francophone African nations mark 65 years of independence in 2025, they reflect on their journey since 1960, revealing a mixed record of progress and persistent challenges. While some nations, particularly in the Sahel region, remain among the world's poorest and grapple with political instability, coups, and weak institutions, others like Senegal demonstrate peaceful democratic transitions. French political influence has waned, with troops largely withdrawn, yet close economic ties and the controversial CFA franc currency system endure. Despite these hurdles, most francophone African countries have seen declines in extreme poverty, increased life expectancy, and reduced infant mortality over the past six decades.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has "almost certainly" experienced its hottest summer on record in 2025, with provisional statistics from the Met Office indicating a mean temperature of 16.13C (61.03F), significantly exceeding the previous record set in 2018. This sustained warmth and dryness are consistent with broader climate change trends. The season was characterized by widespread and long-lasting heat, with temperatures meeting heatwave criteria on four separate occasions, including a peak of 35.8C in July. While sunshine was abundant, especially in England, rainfall patterns were highly variable, leading to hosepipe bans across large parts of the country, a situation intensified by the UK's driest spring in over 50 years.</p>

Parents, like Mary Rodee who lost her son to sextortion on Meta's Messenger, are increasingly critical of such partnerships. The report claims Meta's tactics aim to counter negative narratives and influence public debate, with the National PTA promoting Meta products without always disclosing sponsorship. Both Meta and the National PTA deny wrongdoing, with the PTA stating it seeks a "seat at the table" to advocate for children's safety.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer has voiced doubts about England's "killer instinct" necessary to secure victory in the upcoming Ashes series against Australia this winter. Langer, who boasts a strong Ashes record as both a player and coach, highlighted England's recent 2-2 draws against India and Australia, implying they failed to capitalize on opportunities to clinch those series. He firmly believes that England must adopt an aggressive approach, often dubbed "Bazball," to effectively challenge Australia's formidable bowling attack on their home grounds. Langer underscored that immense courage will be paramount for England to succeed against world-class bowlers such as Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins in the highly anticipated series.</p>

According to Realtor.com, delistings surged by 38% since early 2025 and 48% year-over-year, with 21 homes taken off the market for every 100 new listings in June. This "deadlock" in the housing market is attributed to high mortgage rates, steep prices, and sellers holding out for pre-pandemic price expectations. Many homeowners are content to wait, especially if they have favorable existing mortgage rates, rather than sell at a price they deem unfavorable.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's revived threat of a 200% tariff increase on China's supply of rare earth elements clearly underscores the critical importance of these minerals in global manufacturing and Beijing's significant leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. Analysts interpret Trump's comments as a potent warning should trade talks falter and shipments be halted again, highlighting a key pain point for the U.S. The United States maintains a heavy reliance on China for rare earths, which are indispensable for various advanced technologies and defense applications. This strategic dependency grants China considerable power in economic and geopolitical discussions, making any potential disruption to supply a major concern for U.S. industries and national security.</p>

While Trump has historically mastered attention manipulation, progressives are finding success by combining profane style with policy substance, as seen in Newsom's aggressive redistricting plan.
