          <p>The Trump administration is considering imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's continued purchases of Russian oil. Vice President J.D. Vance confirmed that President Trump is reviewing options but has not made a final decision, acknowledging the complexity of the U.S.-China economic relationship. This potential move is part of a broader strategy to exert pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine, using emergency powers that allow the U.S. to penalize countries indirectly supporting Russia's energy sector.

          <p>An in-depth report from the occupied West Bank details how ultra-nationalist Israeli settlers have intensified their campaign to displace Palestinians since the Hamas attacks of October 2023. The article highlights that this pressure, framed by Israel as security measures, is part of a broader agenda to expand settlements and undermine prospects for a Palestinian state. Human rights groups and a UN panel accuse Israeli forces of failing to protect Palestinians from settler violence, with some officials even encouraging the expansion.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, explains that the immense destruction of World War II is a frequently underestimated factor in shaping the nation's contemporary political and social landscape. The conflict shattered the country's infrastructure, forcing a near-total restart after the war. According to Mitter, this historical context helps explain China's current strategic interests, which he argues lie in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region to support its continued development.</p>

          <p>President Trump has demanded the immediate removal of homeless people from Washington, D.C., suggesting they be relocated to distant facilities while also threatening to jail criminals. In a series of social media posts, he floated the idea of placing the nation's capital under federal control to address what he described as "squalor, filth, and Crime." This comes as D.C. crime data shows a significant drop in violent crime over the past year and a half, contrary to the president's claims.</p>

          <p>A new NPR series explores the ongoing fragmentation of the post-World War II global order, a system long characterized by U.S. leadership, globalization, and multilateral cooperation. The article notes that this established framework is now under strain from the resurgence of authoritarian powers and shifting international alliances. As U.S. influence appears to wane, many countries are reconsidering their strategic positions, leading to an uncertain future for global dynamics and cooperation.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has intensified his standoff with Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. Abbott threatened to call indefinite special legislative sessions, stating the fight "could literally last years" and that the absent Democrats would be arrested upon their return. The conflict centers on a contentious gerrymandering proposal, instigated at Donald Trump's behest, which aims to secure additional Republican seats in the U.S. House ahead of midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot stated he does not believe Crystal Palace fans had malicious intent when a minute's silence before the Community Shield was disrupted. The silence was held to remember former player Diogo Jota and his brother, who died in a car crash. Slot suggested the noise likely came from a fan who was unaware of the memorial and was cheering for his team, with other fans then making noise in an attempt to quiet them down.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is reportedly in a state of turmoil over its processes for reviewing drugs, particularly for rare diseases. The article uses the case of Sarepta Therapeutics' gene therapy, which received accelerated approval despite limited data and has since been linked to patient deaths, to illustrate the agency's dilemma. This situation highlights the intense pressure the FDA faces to balance the demand for rapid access to new treatments with the critical need to ensure their safety and efficacy.
