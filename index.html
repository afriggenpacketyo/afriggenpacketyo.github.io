          <p>Nicusor Dan, a liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against right-wing nationalist George Simion. Dan secured 55% of the vote, emphasizing the need for unity and change in Romania, particularly regarding corruption and support for Ukraine. Simion, who had significant support in the diaspora, attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv, initially claiming victory before conceding. The election followed months of political turbulence, including the annulment of a previous vote due to claims of Russian interference, which Russia has denied.</p>

          <p>A series of powerful storms, including tornadoes, swept through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, resulting in at least 28 fatalities and widespread destruction. Kentucky and Missouri were particularly hard-hit, with significant damage to homes and infrastructure.

          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years has ended after NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen reached a tentative agreement.

The agreement addresses the engineers' demand for pay parity with other railroads, involving concessions on work rules.

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones at the age of 82. His cancer was categorized as having a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade cancer that could spread quickly. While routine screening for prostate cancer in men over 75 is controversial, Biden's office said his symptoms led to a prostate exam that resulted in the discovery of a small nodule. The goal of treatment is not to cure the disease but to control it, slow progression, and preserve quality of life. The primary treatment will be to block testosterone with a medication like Lupron.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker, the host of Match of the Day, is expected to leave the BBC, with an announcement anticipated on Monday. Speculation has arisen following a social media post about Zionism that included an antisemitic image, for which Lineker has apologized. The former England striker has faced criticism for his social media activity in the past, leading to a temporary suspension in 2023. Lineker had previously announced his departure from Match of the Day but was expected to continue with FA Cup and World Cup coverage. Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman, and Gabby Logan have been named as new presenters for Match of the Day.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified Guy Edward Bartkus, 25, as the primary suspect in the deadly car bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The FBI believes the suspect, who is presumed dead, had nihilistic beliefs and intentionally targeted the in vitro fertilization clinic. Investigators are examining writings and social media activity, suspecting he attempted to livestream the bombing. The explosion, which injured four others, is being treated as an act of terrorism. The Palm Springs Police Chief stated that the city will rise above the attack, while the fertility clinic affirmed its commitment to serving the community.</p>

          <p>Wildfires in Europe are becoming more severe, with climate change intensifying droughts and reducing summer rain, leading to predictions that wildfire risk will more than double by 2100. A report by the European Academies Science Advisory Council highlights that about 60,000 forest fires rage through the EU annually, causing significant economic losses. Increasing urbanization and land use changes, such as abandoned farmland and monocultures, contribute to the problem. Solutions include controlled burning, restoring ecosystems, and educating the public about fire risks and land management.</p>

          <p>According to a senior Asian economist, China's yuan has the potential to rival a weakening US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan already works well in cross-border purchase settlements. However, to compete with the dollar, China must deepen its financial markets, improve access to yuan-denominated assets for foreigners, and create new yuan-backed asset classes. Convertibility remains a concern among investors outside the mainland. (not investment advice)</p>
