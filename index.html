          <p>During a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a valuable partner, highlighting their commitment to invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel and safeguard American jobs. Trump stated that the two companies would establish a strong alliance, ensuring the continued operation of U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for at least a decade. He also announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the existing 25%, aiming to bolster the domestic steel industry and national security. Trump emphasized that this investment is the largest in Pennsylvania's history and will secure the jobs of U.S. Steel workers. </p>

          <p>An appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, maintaining a pause on Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-led cuts. The court's 2-1 ruling supported a California judge's order questioning the legality of the administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce. The ruling stated that the executive order exceeded the President's constitutional powers, despite the administration's claim that voters had given Trump a mandate to reshape the federal government. This decision means that the administration cannot proceed with its planned large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans for federal agencies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on foreign steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, celebrating an agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. Trump insisted that US Steel would remain an American company after the partnership with Nippon, despite conflicting information on US Steel's website referring to the transaction as an acquisition. The tariff increase aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States, with Trump promising that every US steel worker would soon receive a $5,000 bonus.

          <p>Elon Musk, during an Oval Office send-off marking the end of his formal role with the Trump administration, reacted sharply when questioned about a New York Times report alleging his frequent ketamine use. Musk dismissed the report, questioning the credibility of the Times. The exchange occurred as Musk concluded his role overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), where he aimed to cut federal spending. The Oval Office back-and-forth came as Musk wrapped up his stint as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, where he oversaw the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey stated that UK defense spending is expected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, although this projection is based on his personal opinion rather than a new official commitment. The government is set to release its strategic defence review, which will outline the military and security spending priorities for the coming years. The review assumes that spending will follow this trajectory, with potential for faster project delivery if the target is accelerated. The Ministry of Defence plans to invest over Â£1 billion in technology to expedite battlefield decision-making.</p>

          <p>Japan's consumer affairs center is cautioning consumers about fraudulent websites selling rice at heavily discounted prices, as rice prices surge due to a poor harvest. Complaints related to these websites have spiked since March, with some customers reporting that they never received their orders despite making payments. The center advises consumers to thoroughly vet business operators and avoid websites offering unrealistically low prices. The average price of rice at supermarkets has nearly doubled compared to last year, reaching a record high.</p>

          <p>Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The accident occurred early Friday morning, causing the hives to spill onto the road. Authorities are urging the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away, particularly those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers are assisting in the effort to re-hive the bees, with the goal of saving as many as possible. The road is expected to remain closed for up to 48 hours during the recovery operation.</p>

          <p>A new US-Israeli backed aid distribution scheme in Gaza, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has faced condemnation and chaos.

Videos show desperate civilians overrunning distribution centers, and GHF personnel using non-lethal deterrents to control crowds. Aid agencies have criticized the location of the GHF distribution sites and the presence of armed security, undermining faith in aid operations.</p>
