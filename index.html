          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 23:22:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed new legislation, including the "No Secret Police Act," which prohibits federal and local law enforcement, like ICE, from wearing face coverings while on duty and requires identification. This action aims to curb the reach of federal immigration enforcement, which Newsom criticized as "dystopian" and likened to "secret police" operations. Federal officials, including U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli and DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, argue the state lacks jurisdiction and that the law endangers officers, who are reportedly facing increased assaults. The legislation also protects children at schools and limits officer access to hospitals without judicial warrants, amidst escalating federal-state tensions over immigration policy and enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts head coach Shane Steichen lauded the Indiana Fever for their "grittiness, toughness, and resilience" following their dramatic WNBA playoff upset against the Atlanta Dream. The injury-depleted Fever, who lost several key players including star Caitlin Clark to season-ending injuries, secured a stunning 87-85 Game 3 victory to advance to the semifinals. Steichen highlighted the team's ability to overcome significant adversity and play together as a cohesive unit, calling it an exciting development for both the team and the city of Indianapolis. The Fever will now face the formidable Las Vegas Aces in the semifinals, marking a notable achievement after a decade without a playoff series win.</p>

The vehicle was impounded after being abandoned in Hollywood Hills for weeks, and police found human remains inside a bag. While detectives state there's no indication of a crime yet and no arrests have been made, the artist, David Anthony Burke, is cooperating with the investigation. Rivas was reported missing last year from Lake Elsinore, and neighbors noted she had a boyfriend named David with matching tattoos.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared his intention to award the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, to Ben Carson during an event at Mount Vernon. This marks the third such award announced by Trump this month, following previous announcements for other honorees. Carson, a former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, later served as Housing and Urban Development secretary during Trump's first administration and became his national faith chairman for the 2024 campaign. The Medal of Freedom recognizes individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security, national interests, world peace, or other significant public endeavors of the United States.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 22:12:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, hours after Erik Siebert abruptly resigned from the position. Siebert's departure followed pressure from the administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation, which James' lawyers deny as politically motivated.

          <p>Resurfaced emails reportedly show Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, calling convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a "supreme friend" in 2011, weeks after publicly distancing herself from him and condemning his actions. A spokesperson for the Duchess stated this email was sent under duress, in an effort to assuage Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation for associating him with paedophilia. The Duchess had previously called her involvement with Epstein a "gigantic error of judgment" and vowed to cut ties, stating her abhorrence for sexual assault of children. She maintains she stands by her public condemnation, asserting her primary thoughts are with his victims, and that she was taken in by his lies.</p>

The Boston venue's statement cited a "credible threat on Morrissey's life" and an "abundance of caution for the safety of both the artist and the band."

          <p>The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point, yet long-term rates, including those for mortgages, unexpectedly increased. While stock investors cheered the Fed's first rate cut of the year, sending markets to record highs, bond traders "sold the news," driving down bond prices and raising yields. This reaction suggests bond investors perceive the Fed as potentially "taking the eye off" inflation, which remains above the 2% target, especially as updated projections indicate slightly faster inflation next year. The rise in longer-term yields has implications for mortgage loans and credit card costs, signaling bond market skepticism about aggressive rate cuts if inflation persists.

          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was murdered in Kenya, allegedly by a British soldier, a Kenyan court has issued an arrest warrant for a UK national. Wanjiru's body was discovered in a septic tank near a hotel three months after she went missing in 2012, having been stabbed. Her friends recall her last night, involving interactions with British soldiers, locally known as "Johnnies," and her efforts to earn money. A 2019 inquest concluded she was murdered by British soldiers, and the case gained wider attention due to reports of British Army failures to discipline soldiers for transactional sex. This potential extradition would mark a significant precedent for a British soldier facing trial abroad for a civilian murder.</p>

The disruption affected airlines using the Muse software, leading to manual check-in operations and long queues, with some passengers missing flights. British Airways operated normally using a backup system, but most other airlines at Heathrow were affected. While the National Cyber Security Centre and European Commission are investigating, the incident highlights the aviation industry's vulnerability to digital system issues.

          <p>A right-wing anti-immigration demonstration in The Hague, Netherlands, devolved into violence and chaos as rioters clashed with police and vandalized a political party's office. Police used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse the rioters, who threw objects at officers, set a police car on fire, and attacked the D66 party office. Caretaker Prime Minister Dick Schoof and right-wing leader Geert Wilders condemned the "shameless violence" and attacks on police, with Wilders calling the perpetrators "idiots" and "scum." The unrest comes weeks before a general election on October 29, which was triggered by a dispute over migration policies, with some protesters displaying symbols of a pre-war Dutch Nazi party.</p>

Illinois and New York formally declined, citing detainers as voluntary requests and state laws limiting cooperation. DHS argues these policies obstruct immigration enforcement and release "criminal aliens" into communities, while states counter that compliance can lead to liability for erroneous detentions and undermines trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

While the Dodgers have managed without him, thanks to the capable emergence of journeyman catcher Ben Rortvedt, Smith's presence in the middle of the batting order is crucial for the team's top form heading into the postseason.

The play explores themes of toxic dating apps, self-worth derived from social media, and the complexities of female friendships. This fresh take on Austen's work aims to resonate with modern audiences by updating the timeless human condition of jealousy and love within a contemporary context.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of students in England, like 19-year-old Tianna Hunkins, are juggling extensive paid work alongside their studies because maintenance loans fail to cover their living costs. Research indicates that maximum annual loans cover only about half of freshers' expenses, leading students to work up to 30 hours a week or endure long commutes. Tianna, who wears her fast-food uniform to lectures, and Faith Webb, who commutes 1.5 hours each way, exemplify the sacrifices made, including missing academic opportunities or social events. Universities are adapting by offering extensions and recorded lectures, while advocating for the reintroduction of maintenance grants and increased loan thresholds.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is being increasingly explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating brain fog, improving short-term memory, and enhancing focus. While extensively researched for athletic performance, recent studies are now considering its impact on female biology and hormonal fluctuations, particularly during perimenopause. Experts like Professor Emeritus Trevor McMorris suggest creatine might mitigate brain fog, especially for individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies, by increasing the brain's energy production. However, dieticians caution about potential side effects like stomach upset, and emphasize that more research is needed, as it is not a "wonder drug."</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer decided to recognize a Palestinian state in September, coinciding with the UN General Assembly, unless Israel met specific conditions like a ceasefire and commitment to a two-state solution. This significant shift in British foreign policy, long a Labour manifesto promise, came amidst mounting pressure from Labour MPs and international allies like France, Australia, and Canada. While critics label it "political posturing" and a "reward for terrorism," government sources insist it will galvanize peace efforts. The decision puts the UK at odds with the US and reflects Labour's evolving stance on the Gaza conflict, aiming to appease voters.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and other prominent political figures are set to attend a memorial service for Charlie Kirk, the conservative activist killed two weeks prior, at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Organized by Turning Point USA, the event expects a massive turnout, prompting "TSA-level screening" and heightened security measures. The Secret Service reported an armed individual exhibiting suspicious behavior at the stadium, later identified as a private security advisor, highlighting the tense atmosphere surrounding the event. The memorial, featuring speakers like Kirk's widow Erika, Vice President JD Vance, and Donald Trump Jr., underscores the political significance and polarization following Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has implemented new restrictions for journalists, requiring them to agree not to disclose "unauthorized information" or risk losing their press credentials and access to the building. These changes, announced by Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, also limit journalists' movement within the facility. The move follows a series of recent leaks and aims to protect sensitive information and national security. While the department states it remains committed to transparency, it emphasizes that information must be approved for public release. Critics point to Hegseth's own past handling of sensitive information and the administration's angry reaction to a leaked intelligence report.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Oklahoma have introduced legislation requiring all public universities to construct a "Charlie Kirk Memorial Plaza," featuring a statue of the assassinated activist and signage calling him a "modern civil rights leader." Failure to comply would result in monthly fines. This proposal echoes efforts on the right to compare Kirk to figures like Martin Luther King Jr., a comparison rejected by King's son, Martin Luther King III, who cited Kirk's divisive rhetoric against Black women. The bill also mandates protection against vandalism and automatic expulsion for defacing the memorials, despite polling suggesting Kirk's views were broadly unpopular on college campuses.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals, including top CIA deputies and Democratic congressional staffers, without prior notification to the White House. This move caused significant consternation among Trump's advisers, who viewed it as a blunder and an unvetted action, deepening animosity between Gabbard and the CIA. Gabbard claims she was executing the President's agenda to remove officials involved in "politicization or weaponization of intelligence" related to Russia's 2016 influence operations. The incident highlights ongoing tensions within the intelligence community and the administration's skepticism towards it, despite Gabbard's previous ability to weather fraught moments.</p>

This development follows years of US efforts to divest TikTok's US operations from Chinese parent company ByteDance due to national security concerns, with President Trump previously delaying a ban. While Trump indicated approval after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing's Commerce Ministry offered a less clear statement, suggesting ongoing negotiation points.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stern warning to Afghanistan, stating that "bad things" would happen if the country does not return control of the Bagram air base to the United States. He declined to rule out sending in troops to retake the base, emphasizing ongoing discussions with Afghanistan. This follows Trump's previous assertions about regaining control of the strategic base, which was central to American forces during two decades of war. Current and former US officials caution that re-occupying Bagram would resemble a re-invasion, requiring substantial troops and advanced air defenses, and could face threats from militants and potentially Iran.</p>
