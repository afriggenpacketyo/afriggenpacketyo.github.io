          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as the 10th president of Ireland after winning against Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys, becoming the first independent president backed by left-wing parties. Connolly, a TD (member of the Irish parliament) since 2016, secured 63% of first preference votes, the largest amount in Irish presidential election history, and she pledged to be an inclusive president for all. Connolly emphasized her commitment to peace, neutrality, addressing climate change, and recognizing the work being done across the country, as well as expressing her desire to see a border poll on the island of Ireland during her seven-year presidency.

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to a prominent banking family, has been identified as the anonymous donor who contributed $130 million to help cover U.S. military personnel's salaries during the government shutdown. President Trump described the donor as a "great patriot" and a "friend of mine," but did not reveal his name, and Mellon's contribution, while substantial, only amounts to about $100 per service member. Some legal experts suggest the donation might violate the Antideficiency Act, which restricts federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress, and Mellon has been a long time donor for Trump, contributing $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle. The article discusses the controversy surrounding the donation and its potential legal implications.</p>

          <p>Addison Barger, who spent the night before the World Series sleeping on a squeaky pull-out couch in a teammate's hotel room, hit a pinch-hit grand slam in the sixth inning of Game 1, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Barger, who had just returned from seeing his wife after the birth of their third child, found himself without a permanent residence in Toronto, leading to his unconventional sleeping arrangements. His grand slam was the first in Blue Jays' World Series history, adding to a wild week for the player who had also celebrated his team's ALCS victory and the birth of his child. The article illustrates how an unconventional night led to a historic moment for the Blue Jays.</p>

          <p>Negotiators from China and the US have initiated a new round of trade talks in Malaysia, preceding a scheduled meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea. Trump expressed optimism about a "very good Meeting" with Xi, hoping for a deal to avoid further tariffs, and he also mentioned a potential meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which would be their first since 2019. Tensions exist between the two countries, with China recently announcing tighter export controls on rare earths, leading to Trump threatening additional taxes on Chinese imports.

          <p>According to a new poll, Donald Trump's support among Hispanic adults has significantly decreased since the beginning of his second term, marking a shift within a voting bloc that was crucial to his 2024 re-election victory. The poll indicates that only 25% of Hispanic adults now hold a favorable view of Trump, down from 44% before he began his second term, and a growing number believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction. The decline in popularity is attributed to the Trump administration's hardline immigration enforcement and rising financial strain within Hispanic households, with concerns about groceries, housing, healthcare, and wages being more pronounced than in the general US population. The article suggests a potential shift in Hispanic voters' sentiment towards Trump.</p>

          <p>An online bar chart claiming the UK has the highest number of sexual assaults in Europe is misleading, as it uses accurate numbers to distort facts due to differences in legal definitions and reporting practices. The UK's higher rate reflects its consent-based laws and reporting practices, where a case is counted when a police report is filed, rather than the actual prevalence of sexual assault. Criminologists recommend victim surveys, instead of relying on police report statistics, to gain a more accurate measure of sexual assault rates across countries.
