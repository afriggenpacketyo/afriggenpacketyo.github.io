          <h2>China's Exports Rise Despite Trade Tensions with the U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, increasing by 8.1% year-on-year, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries which offset a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently enacted tariffs. Imports, however, saw a minimal decrease of 0.2%, contrary to expectations of a larger drop. While exports to ASEAN countries grew substantially, exports to the U.S. fell by over 20%, reflecting the impact of ongoing trade disputes and tariffs. The surge in exports could be attributed to transshipments through third countries and contracts predating the tariffs, with expectations of gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump abruptly terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, sparking outrage from Democrats. Hayden's dismissal came after criticism from a conservative group accusing her of promoting "radical" content in children's books and literary material by Trump opponents. Democrats condemned the firing as unjust, highlighting Hayden's efforts to modernize the Library of Congress and increase accessibility. Trump's administration has been systematically removing officials perceived as disloyal, prompting concerns about political interference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump hinted at the possibility of reducing tariffs on goods from China as high-level trade talks are scheduled to occur in Switzerland. Trump noted that tariffs are at their peak, implying a likely decrease as discussions progress between U.S. and Chinese trade officials. China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunying expressed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S., and officials from both countries face growing economic pressure to de-escalate trade tensions. While analysts anticipate lengthy negotiations and systemic frictions, the upcoming meeting signals a potential transactional de-escalation.</p>

          <p>New soil testing conducted by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health revealed elevated levels of lead and other toxic metals at homesites previously cleared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers following recent wildfires. The health department's findings indicated that a significant number of properties in the Eaton burn scar still had lead levels exceeding California's residential standards, even after federal cleanup efforts. Public health officials are recommending that property owners consider potential soil contamination and conduct soil impact assessments before rebuilding. The county's testing initiative underscores concerns about the effectiveness of federal cleanup operations in removing hazardous contaminants.</p>

          <p>The US and UK announced a new trade deal, with both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump describing the agreement as "historic." The deal aims to save British car industry jobs and addresses some tariffs imposed by the White House. However, a flat 10% levy on most goods remains in place.

          <p>Nearly 60 felony cases in Hanceville, Alabama, are being dismissed due to corruption within the local police department. A grand jury found a "rampant culture of corruption" after four officers and the police chief were indicted on charges related to mishandling evidence. An audit revealed that nearly 40% of evidence bags and a third of firearms were undocumented. The town has decided to disband and rebuild the police department from scratch.</p>

Erick Escamilla was apprehended after being seen on Ring doorbell cameras stalking the halls and breaking into the victim's apartment.

The LAPD has launched internal investigations into the officers' responses to this killing and another slaying in Woodland Hills, where officers did not find the victims because they did not go inside.</p>

While the White House agreed to walk back some import taxes on strategic sectors, the 10% import tax on most UK goods remains intact.
