The 66-year-old artist is stepping back due to ongoing health battles with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a degenerative neurological condition he inherited and was diagnosed with in 2011. The event aims to be a grand finale, featuring numerous fellow country stars, and will raise funds for the CMT Research Foundation. Jackson has been transparent about his mobility and balance challenges, explaining his condition to fans to avoid misinterpretations of his stage performance.

          <p>AMD stock surged by an impressive 43% this week, fueled by a landmark agreement with OpenAI, which committed to purchasing billions in AI equipment from the chipmaker. This partnership also grants OpenAI a potential 10% ownership stake in AMD, contingent on specific stock performance and collaboration milestones. The deal has significantly bolstered investor confidence, positioning AMD as a formidable competitor to Nvidia in the rapidly expanding AI chip sector. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, hailed the agreement as mutually beneficial, asserting that their AI chips are fully capable of supporting large-scale deployments, even as Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed surprise at the development.

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the new leader of the Conservative Party, delivered a confident and policy-rich speech at the annual conference, aiming to re-energize her party and distinguish it from political rivals. A key announcement was the proposal to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases in England and Northern Ireland, a move she believes will foster homeownership and enhance social mobility. This, alongside pledges to scrap business rates and the carbon tax, forms part of a broader strategy to portray the Conservatives as prudent financial managers. Badenoch's address sought to consolidate her leadership and capture public attention amid low poll ratings, focusing on bold policy decisions and a commitment to fiscal responsibility.</p>

          <p>Roundhill Investments has resurrected its Meme Stock ETF, trading as MEME, offering investors a simplified entry into the often-volatile world of buzzy stocks. The original ETF, launched in late 2021, was discontinued two years later after failing to perform, coinciding with a Nasdaq Composite peak. This relaunch, featuring new holdings like Opendoor Technologies, which has seen a 430% surge this year, is viewed by some analysts as a sign of market froth. The article highlights historical patterns where such meme-focused funds appear when market exuberance is high, prompting caution about whether this signals an impending market slowdown rather than sustained growth.

          <p>The IRS has furloughed nearly half of its workforce, approximately 34,000 employees, as the government shutdown extends into its eighth day, impacting most agency operations. This decision leaves only 53.6% of IRS staff on duty, significantly hindering tax services and other functions. The furloughs come amidst continued legislative deadlock in the Senate, where dueling funding resolutions have repeatedly failed to pass. While furloughed workers have been promised back pay upon the shutdown's resolution, an internal draft memo had previously raised concerns about the administration's commitment to this. The ongoing situation underscores the severe operational and human impact of the federal funding impasse.</p>

Their shared passion for music provided an escape from the pervasive gang violence of the 1990s, fostering connections with a different crowd.

This case, one of several, highlights concerns about military medical practices and long-term health impacts on service members.</p>

          <p>Jamie Dimon's perspective, alongside other prominent Wall Street analysts, highlights a stock market currently propelled by the strength of AI and megacap companies, with the S&P 500 approaching record highs. Nvidia and Microsoft alone are responsible for half of this year's gains, contributing to a level of market concentration unprecedented in five decades. While firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan forecast continued upside, with targets ranging from 6,800 to a potential 9,000 in a bubble scenario, they stress the critical need for selective investing, favoring robust balance sheets over speculative ventures. Major risks identified include stubborn inflation and a potential reversal in AI sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve meeting minutes from September indicate a strong consensus among officials to lower interest rates, driven by concerns over a weakening labor market. While nearly all participants agreed on the necessity of cuts, they were split on whether two or three total reductions would be appropriate by the end of 2025, with a slight majority favoring two additional quarter-point cuts. Discussions also addressed President Trump's tariffs, with a general sentiment that they would not be a long-term inflationary factor. A significant challenge ahead is the ongoing government shutdown, which could leave policymakers without essential economic data for upcoming decisions, potentially influencing future rate adjustments.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asserted that President Trump's new H-1B visa policy, which mandates a $100,000 fee per visa, would have made his family's immigration to the U.S. impossible due to financial constraints. Huang, who arrived in the U.S. from Taiwan at age nine, underscored the profound impact such a policy would have had on his own opportunities. The tech sector, heavily reliant on foreign talent, has been taken aback by this significant price hike. While Huang's company, Nvidia, plans to cover these fees for its 1,400 visa holders, he advocates for policy refinements to ensure continued opportunities for diverse talent.</p>

Despite dipping below Category 1 hurricane status, Priscilla is still producing high surf conditions and gusty winds across Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect for a coastal stretch. As of Wednesday morning, the storm maintained maximum sustained winds of 70 mph and was tracking northwest. Forecasters predict further weakening over the next 48 hours, but caution that large swells will persist, posing life-threatening risks from surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>The Covid inquiry has heard compelling evidence that the NHS's decision to redeploy health visitors during the pandemic was "fundamentally flawed," directly resulting in harm to vulnerable children. Alison Morton, CEO of the Institute of Health Visiting, testified that many essential health visitors were redirected to other NHS roles, leaving remaining staff with overwhelming caseloads, sometimes exceeding 750 children. Research indicated that pandemic-era adaptations, particularly the shift to virtual visits, were factors in numerous child deaths and serious incidents, including the tragic cases of Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. The inquiry also noted a significant increase in children's waiting lists for various medical procedures.</p>

          <p>Latino voters are identified as a potentially decisive factor in New Jersey's increasingly close gubernatorial race between Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has President Trump's endorsement.

The article highlights that shifts in Latino turnout and voting preferences, largely influenced by economic dissatisfaction and inflation, could determine the election's outcome.

          <p>This article explores American voters' reactions to Donald Trump's "retribution" agenda, a central theme of his presidency that has led to relentless actions since his inauguration. The impact of this approach is evident in sectors like agriculture, which faces challenges from tariffs and Chinese retaliation, and in stringent immigration policies. The political climate is further complicated by internal divisions within the Democratic Party concerning leaders such as Chuck Schumer, and the surprisingly competitive nature of the New Jersey gubernatorial race. The broader narrative suggests a nation grappling with the far-reaching consequences of Trump's policies and their divisive effects on various segments of society.</p>

          <p>Following Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and anticipated further reductions, borrowers are experiencing some financial relief, yet savers are advised to proactively assess Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. Although the exceptionally high CD rates of previous years are no longer available, current short-term options, such as 4.30% for 6-month CDs, remain significantly more attractive than standard savings accounts. The article recommends locking in these rates promptly, as they are likely at their peak for the current cycle and are projected to decrease further.

Paxton, a Republican Senate candidate, characterized the accused as "abortion-loving radicals" and "fake doctors," reiterating his commitment to enforcing Texas's stringent anti-abortion laws.

Examples cited include CBS's muted response to Trump's actions against James Comey and the handling of the Charlie Kirk murder aftermath, contrasting with The Free Press's prior critiques of progressive dogmatism. The article ultimately implies that Weiss's appointment could be a politically motivated concession, potentially undermining CBS's journalistic integrity.</p>
