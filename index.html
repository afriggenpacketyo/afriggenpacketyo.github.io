          <p>The United Nations reported that about 90 truckloads of aid entered Gaza, marking the first major influx of food after a two-month Israeli blockade, although the Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that no civilians have yet received any aid. UN agencies and aid groups are struggling to distribute the aid due to complicated Israeli military procedures and the breakdown of law and order inside the territory. The limited number of deliveries is raising fears of looting and unrest as desperate residents await food and medical supplies, while starvation-related deaths are reportedly on the rise. This article highlights the complexities and challenges in delivering crucial humanitarian assistance to Gaza amidst ongoing conflict and logistical hurdles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, alleging the university fostered violence, antisemitism, and coordination with the Chinese Communist Party. Harvard called the revocation unlawful and stated its commitment to supporting its international students and scholars, comprising over 27% of its total enrollment. A federal judge issued an injunction against the administration, potentially blocking the action, while the DHS Secretary warned other universities about complying with federal immigration laws.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested on suspicion of endangering safety on the railway after a train collided with a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Herefordshire, resulting in two injuries. The incident occurred near Leominster, causing significant disruption to rail services between Hereford and Craven Arms. Passengers reported shaking, screaming, and flying debris during the crash, which involved 56 people on board. An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances leading to the collision, involving a farm track used by agricultural vehicles and a user-worked crossing where the landowner is responsible for opening and closing the gates.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. Almost all of the initially pulled books have been returned to the shelves, with only about 20 titles requiring further review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal followed a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for DEI-related content, leading the Navy to reinstate titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The Pentagon memo was issued to bring the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>During a tense meeting at the White House, Donald Trump confronted President Cyril Ramaphosa with a series of contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa. Trump played a video featuring Julius Malema chanting a song calling for violence against white farmers and presented articles alleging widespread brutality against South Africa's white minority. Fact-checking revealed that the video's rows of crosses were from a memorial, not burial sites, and claims of "white genocide" lacked evidence. Ramaphosa emphasized that the EFF is a minority party and that South African policy opposes such views.</p>

Key provisions include extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and overtime (through 2028), and allowing tax deductions on auto loan interest for US-assembled cars. The bill also imposes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, increases the State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, and allocates significant funding for border security and defense. Additionally, it creates $1,000 "Trump accounts" for child savings and raises the upper age requirement for food stamp eligibility.</p>

While most cases fall short of extreme violence, data from police departments and nonprofits suggest a significant wave of hate-fueled incidents.

          <p>The GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed the House, introduces nationwide work requirements for Medicaid, potentially causing millions to lose coverage. The bill requires able-bodied adults without children to report 80 hours of monthly work or community activity to maintain benefits, starting at the end of 2026. Critics argue that the requirements will disproportionately harm low-income individuals, leading to administrative challenges and coverage loss, as demonstrated by Arkansas's previous experience with similar policies. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 10.3 million people would lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 under the GOP bill.</p>

The coin, issued by Trump-affiliated entities, has raised ethical concerns over pay-to-play policymaking, as attendees include individuals with strategic policy incentives and a Chinese-born crypto billionaire charged with market manipulation.

Investors are selling off U.S. government bonds, leading to higher borrowing costs for the government. The European Central Bank warned that President Trump's tariffs are putting the global financial system at risk, while Moody's downgraded the creditworthiness of the United States, citing the mounting deficit.

          <p>American Airlines' chief financial officer (CFO) stated that some travelers are opting to avoid Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions. Travelers are choosing alternative airports such as LaGuardia, JFK, and Philadelphia, although the impact is considered modest. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered airlines to temporarily cut flights at Newark to alleviate congestion, which has been exacerbated by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has further contributed to the disruptions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The cryptocurrency's rise is attributed to growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation and ongoing interest from institutional buyers. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. The Senate is also advancing crypto legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a former bitcoin skeptic, has announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.

However, the report has faced criticism for misrepresenting scientific consensus and for its focus on corporate influence in federal policymaking.
