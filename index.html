          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, announced a significant reduction in the number of individuals listed as missing following devastating floods. The count dropped from nearly 100 to just three after extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies verified that most were safe. This development brings a measure of relief to a community that saw its missing persons list exceed 160 at its peak. However, the overall death toll from the statewide flooding event remains high at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>The 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin, was solved using modern technology after a complex investigation. Initially, her boyfriend was the prime suspect, but data from his Fitbit tracker provided an alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch. His location data from Google Dashboard conclusively placed him at the crime scene and other key locations, leading to his conviction and a life sentence for the brutal crime.</p>

          <p>Volunteers with the Southern California Guinea Pig Rescue discovered a distressing situation at a South Los Angeles residence, finding more than 400 guinea pigs living in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions. The animals lacked proper food and water, and many suffered from health issues like ringworm and open wounds. The rescue effort began after the tenant faced eviction, revealing a far larger number of animals than initially reported. The rescue groups are now urgently seeking public assistance for fostering, adoptions, and donations to cover medical care.</p>

          <p>Actress Jennifer Love Hewitt has responded to long-standing rumors of a feud with her former co-star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, stating they are unfounded. Hewitt revealed that she has not spoken to or seen Gellar since they worked on the 1997 film "I Know What You Did Last Summer" when she was 18. The speculation was recently fueled by Gellar's reactions to questions about the movie's new sequel and social media omissions. Gellar has since clarified her actions were related to non-disclosure agreements and event logistics, not animosity.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Southport, UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to introduce a new law targeting individuals who plan mass violence, even without a specific ideological motive. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws. This would empower authorities to apprehend individuals who research targets or otherwise prepare for an attack before they can act. The move is a direct response to cases where attackers were fixated on violence but did not fit the legal definition of a terrorist.</p>

          <p>A new generation of exclusive, members-only clubs like Soho House is emerging in India, catering to the country's growing class of "new money" entrepreneurs and creatives. These modern clubs offer a more relaxed alternative to traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which are often inaccessible due to long waiting lists and a focus on "old money" legacy. While still highly exclusive with expensive fees, their membership criteria are based more on personal accomplishment than family pedigree. This trend reflects the significant economic and social shifts occurring in modern India.</p>

Paul, 40, spent six successful years with the Clippers and would add valuable experience, playmaking, and depth to their backcourt. The team emphasized its desire to add more ball-handling and noted that any veteran joining would need to accept a reserve role. The potential signing would reunite Paul with former teammate James Harden and bolster the team's competitive chances.</p>
