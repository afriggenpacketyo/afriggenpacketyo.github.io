            <p>The White House released the results of President Trump's annual physical, stating that he "remains in excellent health." The report, conducted by Capt. Sean P. Barbabella at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, indicates robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function for the 78-year-old president. A colonoscopy in July 2024 revealed diverticulosis and a benign polyp, with a follow-up recommended in 2027. The report concludes that Trump is fully fit to execute the duties of Commander-in-Chief and Head of State.</p>

            <p>Devastating attacks on camps hosting hundreds of thousands of people in Sudan's Darfur region have resulted in the deaths of over 100 civilians, including children and medical personnel. The attacks, blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have targeted the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps, where residents are facing famine-like conditions. Residents describe dire situations with closed routes and ongoing shelling, exacerbating the already critical humanitarian crisis.</p>

            <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the recent tariff exemptions for electronics are only temporary, with those items soon subject to "semiconductor tariffs." The administration aims to encourage the reshoring of semiconductor, pharmaceutical, and flat-panel industries to the United States. Lutnick emphasized that these are national security concerns and not available for negotiation. The White House plans to implement a tariff model to incentivize companies to move their business to the U.S.</p>

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Meta has begun, focusing on whether the social media giant broke competition laws by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC argues Meta eliminated competition to maintain monopoly power, seeking to unwind the acquisitions. Meta counters that it is being punished for innovation and faces fierce competition from other platforms. The trial's outcome could significantly impact Meta's advertising business and the future of social media competition.</p>

            <p>The abuse and suffering in Ireland's Magdalene laundries and mother-and-baby homes remain a haunting scandal. Efforts to bring these stories to light have been met with obstruction, and the question of redress persists. Only two of eight religious organizations linked to the homes have offered to contribute to a survivor redress scheme. The Catholic church's expressions of remorse have been criticized as insufficient, with campaigners calling for the seizure of church assets. The scandal continues to be revisited culturally, but a true acknowledgment of the pain caused is needed.</p>

            <p>Financial therapists suggest that difficulties with budgeting and money management may stem from emotional attachment styles rather than a lack of self-control. Anxious attachment to money involves a fear of loss and compulsive checking, while avoidant attachment involves ignoring bills and financial planning. Secure attachment involves a balanced approach. Understanding one's attachment style can be key to changing financial behaviors. Setting boundaries and creating positive associations with money-related tasks can help improve financial well-being.

            <p>The former CEO of fintech startup nate, Albert Saniger, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding investors of millions by falsely claiming the company's e-commerce app was powered by AI.

The aftermath of the company's fallout in 2023 left investors with near-total losses. This case highlights the growing scrutiny of AI claims in the investment world.</p>
