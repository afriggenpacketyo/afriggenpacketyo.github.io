          <p>Bubba Wallace secured a historic victory at the Brickyard 400, becoming the first Black driver to win a NASCAR Cup Series race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's oval track. The win, his third career victory, snapped a 100-race winless streak for the 23XI Racing driver. Wallace overcame a late rain delay, two overtime restarts, and fuel concerns to hold off a charging Kyle Larson. He attributed his shifted mindset and recent success to his new perspective as a father, emphasizing family over racing.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a significant trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported into the US. The agreement, finalized between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, averts a threatened 30% tariff. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to increasing its investment in the US by $600 billion and purchasing $750 billion in American energy, aiming to rebalance the transatlantic trade relationship. Certain goods, including aircraft parts and some agricultural products, will be exempt from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Honeywell's recent stock performance suggests that despite a "beat and raise" on earnings, the market reacted negatively, causing a significant price drop. The article attributes the decline to factors like the complexity of its upcoming three-way split, a lack of significant data center exposure, and general market impatience. The author expresses conviction in the company's long-term value, citing its strong aerospace and automation businesses and the leadership of CEO Vimal Kapur.

          <p>While the absence of a major Marvel Studios panel from Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 was noted, many attendees found the experience just as enjoyable. For some, the less crowded schedule for the famous hall made it easier to attend other presentations, such as those for "Alien: Earth" and "Tron: Ares." Many fans emphasized that the convention's appeal extends far beyond major film announcements, citing interests in exclusive merchandise, artist alleys, and cosplay. The growing presence of anime and television programming suggests a shift in the pop culture landscape celebrated at the event.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville police dispersed a crowd of 600 to 700 juveniles from a planned "takeover" event on the city's Southbank. The gathering, promoted on social media, involved disruptive behavior including fighting and drug use. Authorities were aware of the planned event and had issued warnings, but still had to intervene when the crowd grew unruly. One juvenile was arrested after reaching for a backpack containing a gun. This incident highlights a growing trend of large, unsanctioned teen gatherings, prompting warnings from police departments about enforcing curfews and public safety regulations.</p>

          <p>Russell Vought, a key author of the conservative Project 2025 blueprint, suggested that President Trump's criticism of the Federal Reserve is driven by a desire for lower interest rates, not by the specific proposals in the document. When asked about the Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Fed, Vought claimed, "I don't even know what that chapter says." The Trump administration has recently intensified pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, citing an "ostentatious" office renovation as a potential reason for dismissal, though the core issue appears to be the Fed's reluctance to lower interest rates.

          <p>Michigan authorities are seeking to file terrorism charges against Bradford James Gille, the 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The attack, which authorities say was random, involved a folding knife and injured five men and six women. All victims are expected to survive. The suspect was confronted by multiple citizens in the parking lot, including one who was armed, before a deputy took him into custody. The terrorism charge is being pursued because the mass attack is believed to have been intended to instill fear in the community.</p>
