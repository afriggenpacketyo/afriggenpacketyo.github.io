          <h2>Mortgage Demand Surges Despite Economic Uncertainty as Interest Rates Dip Slightly</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 07:36:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite lingering economic uncertainty, weekly mortgage demand surged by 11% due to a slight drop in mortgage interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Applications for home purchases also rose 11% and were 13% higher than the same week last year, driven by demand for conventional loans. Refinance applications increased by 11% as well, with VA loans showing a significant rise. The article notes that the housing market has been slow, with potential buyers hesitant due to economic concerns, and Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting could influence mortgage rates further.

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, anticipating a reduction in the availability of compounded alternatives. First-quarter sales of Wegovy were lower than expected, leading to a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast. The FDA's decision to end a drug shortage ruling, which allowed compounding pharmacies to produce copies of Wegovy, is expected to boost Novo Nordisk's sales. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and partnering with telehealth providers to improve access to Wegovy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on alleged terrorist infrastructure sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, an operation dubbed "Operation Sindoor." Pakistan has condemned the strikes as unprovoked and claimed that its military shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone. The strikes have heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors, with both sides taking tit-for-tat measures. India has not named any group it suspects carried out the attack in Pahalgam, but Indian police have alleged two of the attackers were Pakistani nationals.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Unlock Gene Secret in Drought-Tolerant Rice</h2>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered genetic secrets in the roots of upland rice that are linked to drought resistance. The researchers identified a gene, HMGB1, that obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots, which are crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could transform widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties, enhancing food security.</p>

          <p>The IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors amid budget cuts from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, according to a watchdog report. The agency's workforce has decreased by more than 11,000 employees, with a significant impact on revenue agents who conduct audits. The report coincides with the President's fiscal year 2026 budget request, which proposes further IRS budget cuts to end the "weaponization of IRS enforcement." As of April 25, the IRS processed over 140 million returns during the 2025 filing season.</p>

          <p>Banks are keeping credit card interest rates high and maintaining new monthly fees, even after a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule they blamed for the increases was struck down in federal court. Synchrony and Bread Financial, major issuers of branded credit cards, stated they do not plan to reverse the rate hikes. Consumer advocates argue that the companies are profiting at the expense of consumers. The industry initially raised rates and added fees to offset anticipated revenue losses from the CFPB rule.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges faced by pro-tariff liberals who advocate for targeted trade restrictions, as opposed to the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump. These liberals fear that Trump's approach will discredit tariffs as a policy tool. They argue that tariffs can be effective when applied rationally to specific countries and sectors, in combination with other strategies to bolster American industry. The article highlights the need for Democrats to distinguish between Trump's policies and a more strategic approach to trade.</p>

          <p>A federal court will hear a lawsuit challenging the legality of President Trump's tariffs, with a decision expected to have significant economic implications. The plaintiffs, small businesses that import goods, argue that the tariffs are illegal under the "major questions doctrine." Former Republican officials have filed an amicus brief supporting the challenge. The courts could uphold the tariffs, strike them down, or rule that the president exceeded his authority. The case is likely to reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Container bookings from China to the United States experienced a sharp decline, dropping 27% year-on-year to their lowest level since February. This decline is attributed to the impact of increased US tariffs, causing significant disruption and sourcing shifts in the supply chain. Continuing uncertainty over future tariff levels has led many supply chain teams to rethink timing, inventory levels, and sourcing strategies. Before the tariffs, weekly container bookings from China to the US had remained above 100,000 TEU.</p>
