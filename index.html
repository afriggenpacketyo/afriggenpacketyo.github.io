        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New powers in England and Wales allow for jail sentences of up to two years for water company executives who obstruct investigations into sewage spills or fail to cooperate. This comes as a public spending watchdog report criticizes the government and regulators for mismanaging risk and investment in the water sector, leading to customer bill increases and an all-time low in consumer trust. Environment Secretary Steve Reed stated that previous regulation was weak, with no accountability for widespread law-breaking, emphasizing the need for tougher penalties to deter illegal sewage discharges and ensure water companies prioritize infrastructure investment over shareholder dividends and executive bonuses.</p>

          <p>Several young Democratic primary challengers are aiming to unseat longtime House members, citing a need for generational change and more effective leadership within the party. This movement arises amidst broader Democratic debates on how to respond to the Trump administration and connect with voters after recent losses. Challengers argue that incumbents are out of touch and inaccessible, while incumbents defend their experience and effectiveness. The effort is fueled by organizations like Leaders We Deserve, which plans to spend millions to support younger candidates, creating potential for infighting within the Democratic Party as the 2026 midterm elections approach.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has ordered Amazon Japan to pay 35 million yen in damages for failing to prevent sellers from listing counterfeit products. The lawsuit was filed by a medical equipment manufacturer and its distributor, who claimed their sales declined due to the availability of fake items. The court ruled that Amazon has an obligation to take effective measures against counterfeits, especially after being notified of their presence.

          <p>Luigi Mangione is scheduled to be arraigned in New York federal court on charges related to the murder of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

          <p>The Swiss president announced that Switzerland is among 15 countries selected for "privileged" negotiations with the United States regarding sweeping tariffs. This follows discussions in Washington, including a meeting with the U.S. Treasury Secretary, aimed at finding a resolution to the tariff issue. The U.S. had initially planned to impose tariffs of 31% on Swiss products, higher than those on EU goods, but has since paused these measures. The U.S. is Switzerland's most important export market, and the bilateral trade volume between the two countries reached nearly $186 billion in 2023, highlighting the significance of these negotiations.</p>

This comes as new tariffs between Washington and Beijing have intensified, leading major Wall Street banks to lower China's GDP forecasts for the year.

          <p>UK retail sales experienced their most significant rise in almost four years during the first quarter, with a 1.6% increase between January and March, boosted by warmer weather in March. Garden centers and clothing stores saw notable growth, while food sales volumes decreased, particularly in supermarkets. Despite the positive figures, analysts caution that sales may weaken in the coming months due to a decline in consumer confidence in April. The increase is attributed to cooling inflation and wage increases, but retailers are bracing for potential changes in consumer spending.</p>

Scientists and environmental groups have condemned the order, warning of potential disruption to marine ecosystems and damage to the fishing industry.

          <p>An NPR report examines the pronatalist movement, which promotes higher birth rates in the U.S., and its various factions, including the religious right, tech types, and anti-feminists. While some express concerns about economic challenges related to declining birth rates, others hold deeper ideological beliefs about the importance of nuclear families and traditional gender roles. The report highlights the influence of figures like Elon Musk and the Trump administration, as well as the presence of controversial figures who promote eugenics and racial hierarchies within the movement, with concerns raised about the movement's potential impact on diversity and inclusion.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Warn NOAA Cuts by Trump Undermine Hurricane Forecast Improvements</h2>

          <p>Scientists are expressing concern that cuts to NOAA by the Trump administration are undermining progress in hurricane forecasting. Hundreds of NOAA employees have been fired, and funding has been reduced for weather satellites and climate research. These cuts could slow or halt advancements in weather and climate models, including the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System (HAFS), which has significantly improved hurricane track and intensity predictions. The deputy director of the National Hurricane Center noted that these models have enabled scientists to forecast rapid intensification, saving lives by allowing more time for evacuations, emphasizing that lives are at risk from the cuts.</p>

The artworks were stored in wheelie bins in the basement and were "not handled with care", according to local newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. The lack of guidelines for registration, storage, conservation and security of the artworks were contributing factors. The 46 artworks altogether were worth around €22,000 (£18,800) and the Maashorst municipality said it was unlikely they will ever be found.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), raising questions about its impact on Pakistan. The treaty, which governs water sharing of six rivers in the Indus basin, has survived previous conflicts between the two countries. Experts say it's nearly impossible for India to hold back the water from the western rivers during high-flow periods due to a lack of storage infrastructure. However, if India begins controlling the flow with its existing and potential infrastructure, Pakistan could feel the impact during the dry season, when water availability is already at its lowest.</p>
