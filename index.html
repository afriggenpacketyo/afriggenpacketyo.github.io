          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. In a social media post, he urged Hamas to accept the proposal, which was mediated by Qatar and Egypt, stating that the terms would not improve for the group. The announcement comes amid ongoing conflict that began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, and ahead of a planned meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Israeli officials have expressed a desire for a ceasefire to secure the release of remaining hostages, Hamas has historically insisted on a permanent truce.</p>

          <p>A former FBI agent who was pardoned by President Trump while on trial for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot is now serving in the Department of Justice. The agent, Jared Wise, was accused of encouraging rioters to attack police, with videos showing him yelling "Kill 'em!" before entering the Capitol building. Sources confirm Wise is now an investigator and counselor within the DOJ's "Weaponization Working Group," a highly controversial appointment. This development has raised significant concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department, though the department has declined to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of "30% or 35%" on Japan if a new trade agreement is not reached before a July 9 deadline. This would be a significant increase from the current 10% levy most Japanese exports to the U.S. face. The threat comes as a 90-day pause on broader global tariffs is set to expire, with Trump expressing doubt that a deal with Tokyo can be achieved. The president also criticized Japan's trade policies, specifically its restrictions on U.S. rice imports, while Japanese officials have stated they will not make concessions that harm their nation's farmers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors, including nurses and healthcare advocates, gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to oppose President Trump's major spending bill. The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes over a trillion dollars in cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while making previous tax cuts permanent. Critics argue the bill is reckless and will harm vulnerable populations, including the 15 million Californians who rely on Medi-Cal for healthcare. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the Senate's version would increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion and cause millions to lose health insurance.</p>

In a joint statement, the group expressed concern about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions stemming from dependence on a single country.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration, under Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, had planned to end the program in September, revoking legal status and work permits. However, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan determined the administration lacks the authority to vacate the designation before its previously scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge noted that migrants had enrolled in schools and jobs in reliance on the existing deadline, while the White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant change to the company's contract chip manufacturing business to attract major clients like Apple and Nvidia. The potential shift would involve de-emphasizing the marketing of its "18A" chipmaking process to external customers, a technology his predecessor had heavily invested in. Instead, the company would focus more resources on its next-generation "14A" process, where it believes it can gain a competitive edge over rival TSMC. This strategic review reflects the new leadership's urgent efforts to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article proposes that investors seeking exposure to the energy sector without the volatility of oil prices should consider midstream companies. These firms, which own infrastructure like pipelines, tend to have reliable cash flows based on demand for energy transport rather than commodity prices. The article contrasts the dividend reliability of companies like Enterprise Products Partners and Enbridge with the past cuts from Kinder Morgan and Energy Transfer. It argues that the former's history of consistent dividend growth and strong financial foundations make them more trustworthy choices for income-focused investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The chaotic episode has been compared to the parliamentary struggles of previous, weaker governments and has led to internal anger.

The facility, built rapidly by the state, can house up to 3,000 people and is part of the administration's broader strategy to increase deportations.

          <p>Tesla's stock value fell by 7% as CEO Elon Musk publicly clashed with President Donald Trump over a massive spending bill. Musk criticized the legislation for increasing the national deficit and for provisions that would cut support for renewable energy and phase out electric vehicle tax credits, which could negatively impact Tesla's sales and energy division. In response, Trump suggested that Musk's government-reliant businesses, like SpaceX, could lose more than just EV mandates. The dispute adds volatility for Tesla, which has historically benefited from billions in federal contracts and environmental regulatory credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A massive 940-page legislative proposal, endorsed by President Trump, is causing significant controversy due to its ambitious scope and political implications. The bill aims to make 2017 tax cuts permanent, expand the child tax credit, and allocate substantial funding for defense and border security. However, it also proposes significant spending reductions for social welfare programs like Medicaid, which has drawn sharp criticism. The proposal has divided Republicans and faced condemnation from figures like Elon Musk over its projected $2.4 trillion addition to the national debt over the next decade, highlighting deep ideological rifts.</p>

The investigation aims to determine if existing laws are sufficient to deter anticompetitive practices in higher education and will inform potential legislative reforms, while the universities maintain they have been cooperating.</p>

State officials argue this action creates a climate of fear that could deter people from seeking essential medical care.

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's toughest law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, nicknamed "Amara's Law," was inspired by the powerful testimony of Amara Strande, a 20-year-old who was dying of a rare cancer she believed was linked to contaminated water in her community. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The chemical manufacturer 3M, which developed PFAS, has agreed to stop producing the chemicals and pay the state $850 million for cleanup efforts.</p>

Brennan stated that bankruptcy is the only way to handle the claims equitably while allowing the diocese to continue its ministry. However, attorneys for the abuse survivors have criticized the move as a delay tactic designed to shield the church from accountability and force victims into a lengthy, property-focused legal process. The lawsuits largely stem from a California law that temporarily reopened the statute of limitations for civil sexual assault claims.</p>

This decision is a direct result of the Trump administration's crackdown on transgender participation in sports, stemming from a 2021 executive order and investigations into potential Title IX violations.
