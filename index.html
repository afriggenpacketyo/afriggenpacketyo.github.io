          <p>A bipartisan bill proposes awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Ed Dwight, recognizing his trailblazing life as the first Black astronaut candidate and, at 91, the oldest person to travel to space. The article details his journey, from being selected by President Kennedy's administration in 1961 to resigning after facing prejudice following the president's assassination. Forced to reinvent himself, Dwight became a successful entrepreneur and a renowned sculptor, creating over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. His story is presented as one of profound resilience and a commitment to inspiring his community and making the world a better place for everyone.</p>

During the meeting, which was more cordial than their previous encounter, Trump stated the U.S. would provide Ukraine with "very good protection" but remained vague on specifics. He also indicated he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin following the talks and appeared to walk back his previous demand for an immediate ceasefire as a precondition for a deal, suggesting a peace agreement could be worked on while fighting continues.</p>

          <p>A 63-year-old American tourist was seriously injured by a shark while spearfishing near Big Grand Cay in the Bahamas. The victim received initial treatment at a local clinic before being airlifted to the United States for further medical care. This incident is one of several recent attacks on U.S. tourists in the region, prompting the State Department to issue a travel advisory urging increased caution due to shark-related risks. The article notes that while attacks are rare, the Bahamas has a higher rate relative to its population, ranking ninth globally for confirmed unprovoked attacks over the last four centuries.</p>

The study highlights that users of the OTC pill, Opill, were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas compared to those with prescriptions. The primary reasons for choosing the OTC option were convenience and not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford participated in practice for the first time since the beginning of training camp, having been sidelined with a back issue. The 37-year-old veteran was a full participant, taking part in both individual and team drills with the first-team offense. Despite his return to the field, head coach Sean McVay provided no definitive updates on his long-term status, stating the team will take his recovery one day at a time. The Rams are scheduled to open their season against the Houston Texans on September 7th, making Stafford's health a key concern.</p>

          <p>The trend of 'job-hopping' seen during the 'Great Resignation' has been replaced by 'job hugging,' as workers increasingly cling to their current roles amid economic uncertainty. The rate at which employees voluntarily quit their jobs has fallen to its lowest level since 2016, reflecting decreased confidence in the labor market. This shift is attributed to a cooling job market, higher interest rates, and slower hiring rates, which make finding new employment more challenging. While providing stability, experts warn that staying put could lead to stagnant wage growth and skill development for employees.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple and effective strategy to enhance investment returns through compound interest. Instead of receiving cash dividends, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, including fractional shares. The author argues that for long-term investors not reliant on dividend income, this passive approach ensures money is consistently put to work, citing an S&P 500 ETF as an example where reinvesting dividends significantly boosted total returns over a decade compared to just price appreciation.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire and hostage release proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a two-stage framework that would involve an initial 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages. The plan also includes negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, while his cabinet is expected to approve plans to occupy Gaza City.</p>

Democrats stated their return was strategic, allowing them to build a legal case against what they call a 'discriminatory map.' The political battle has national implications, as Democrats in states like California are now pursuing their own mid-decade redistricting to counteract potential Republican gains in Texas.</p>

The detectives explain their community-focused, non-authoritarian methods of de-escalation, contrasting them with the overly aggressive federal response.

This development comes after federal prosecutors announced they would not seek the death penalty against the 77-year-old kingpin.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage depends heavily on an individual's health, financial needs, and long-term goals. While homeowners can qualify at age 62, waiting until their late 60s or early 70s often allows them to access more of their home's equity. A reverse mortgage can provide crucial income for retirees on a fixed budget by eliminating mortgage payments and providing cash flow. However, experts caution that it reduces the home's equity, potentially leaving less for heirs, and the loan becomes due if the homeowner moves out permanently, making it ideal for those committed to aging in place.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Pakistan deported 211 Afghans who had already been approved for resettlement in Germany. These individuals, including human rights defenders and former local staff for German institutions, had fled to Pakistan after the Taliban takeover and were awaiting transfer. The German government is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to try and facilitate their return to Pakistan, while also arranging temporary accommodation for them in Afghanistan. This action is part of a broader deportation campaign by Pakistan, affecting thousands of Afghans who fear persecution under Taliban rule.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several European leaders, including France's President Macron, traveled to Washington for urgent talks with President Trump regarding the war in Ukraine. The visit was prompted by concerns that Trump's recent shift in strategy, made after meeting with Vladimir Putin, could undermine European security. European officials are worried that Trump has dropped his demand for a ceasefire as a precondition for peace talks and is backing away from further sanctions on Russia. Their goal is to persuade the White House that a lasting peace cannot be achieved by simply ceding territory and requires robust, long-term security guarantees for all of Europe.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal and has ordered them to return to work immediately. The ruling came after the union, CUPE, defied a previous government back-to-work order issued over the weekend. The strike, now in its third day, has caused widespread disruption during the peak summer travel season, affecting hundreds of thousands of passengers. The union and the airline remain far apart in negotiations over pay and working conditions, and it is unclear what consequences the union will face for its continued defiance.</p>

According to data from the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has committed approximately $130.6 billion, making it the largest single donor. However, when combined, European nations and EU institutions have contributed more, totaling around $165.7 billion. The report also addresses claims about the nature of the aid, clarifying that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mixture of grants and loans, though the U.S. has offered a higher proportion of grants.</p>

          <p>In response to political pressure to lower drug prices, Novo Nordisk will now offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic for $499 per month to U.S. patients paying in cash. This price is less than half of the drug's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy and partnerships with savings companies like GoodRx. The move aims to expand access for uninsured or underinsured patients and to compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions of the medication that gained popularity during previous supply shortages.</p>
