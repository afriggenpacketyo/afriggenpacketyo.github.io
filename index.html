          <p>Two American aid workers from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation were injured in a grenade attack at a food distribution site in Khan Younis. The organization, along with U.S. and Israeli officials, blamed Hamas for the attack, though no evidence was provided. The incident occurred amid ongoing Israeli airstrikes that killed at least 14 people across the Gaza Strip. The violence continues as ceasefire negotiations show signs of progress, with Hamas giving a 'positive' initial response to a new U.S. proposal.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Kerr County, Texas, admitted they were caught off guard by the deadly flash floods that struck on July 4th. The Guadalupe River surged to near-historic levels in minutes during the night, leading to at least 27 deaths. Officials stated that the storm's intensity was not forecasted and that the county lacks a river warning system, which contributed to the lack of evacuations before the disaster. The event has raised questions about the area's preparedness for such extreme weather in what is known as a dangerous river valley.</p>

          <p>A severe humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Bialowieza National Park on the Poland-Belarus border, where migrants are stranded in harsh conditions. Since Belarus began encouraging migrants to cross into the EU, Poland has responded with a border fence and pushbacks, leaving many people injured and without aid. Human rights organizations like Grupa Granica provide essential support, treating injuries from jumping the fence and providing food and clothing. The activists operate under the threat of criminalization as they assist vulnerable people from countries like Syria and Afghanistan.</p>

The AI explained that while the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, the system heavily favors wealth over work. Billionaires primarily generate wealth through investments, and the gains are not taxed until assets are sold, allowing them to use strategies like 'buy-borrow-die,' a benefit unavailable to wage earners.

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing criticism for sending an email that critics call misleading, claiming a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes for most beneficiaries. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have labeled the communication a 'lie' and 'blatant misinformation.' The bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher-income seniors. The incident has raised concerns about the politicization of a traditionally apolitical government agency.</p>

          <p>One year into its term, the UK's Labour government is facing significant voter disappointment, according to a focus group of its 2024 supporters. Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, particularly regarding immigration, and a sense of being 'lied to.' While some were forgiving, the government's recent U-turns have fueled concerns about a lack of clear direction. The sentiment reflects Labour's declining poll numbers and the concurrent rise of the Reform UK party, which some former Labour voters are now considering.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, a Member of Parliament for the Reform UK party, has voluntarily given up the party whip while he is investigated over business loans received during the pandemic. The Sunday Times raised questions about whether two companies linked to McMurdock were eligible for the £70,000 in Bounce Back loans they received. McMurdock denies any wrongdoing but stated he requested the suspension as a 'precautionary measure' to protect the party. He will now sit as an independent MP, reducing Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated his rhetoric against political opponents, recently threatening figures like Elon Musk, New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, and former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. The president suggested Musk could lose federal subsidies and his citizenship, and that Mamdani and Mayorkas could face arrest. These warnings are seen by democracy advocates as an attack on free speech and an attempt to weaponize the state against critics. The threats contribute to a climate of fear and raise serious concerns about the erosion of democratic norms and the rule of law.</p>

On a podcast, she revealed that her parents' tumultuous relationship and her own tendency to 'lose herself' in romantic partnerships led her to realize she should not have children with another person. Relationship experts support her choice, noting it as a sign of strength and alignment with her personal values, emphasizing that for many modern women, partnership is a preference rather than a necessity.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men to South Sudan, a country with which they have no ties, following a prolonged legal battle. The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were convicted of serious crimes in the U.S. and had been held at a military base in Djibouti while their case proceeded. A Supreme Court order ultimately cleared the way for the deportation, marking an unprecedented step in U.S. immigration policy. Human rights advocates have condemned the move as 'punitive and unconstitutional,' fearing the men could face torture or other harm in the conflict-ridden nation.</p>

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems has led to 'tipflation,' where customers are prompted to tip in more situations and at higher, pre-calculated rates, causing confusion and social pressure. While tipping was once confined to specific service roles, payment screens now frequently request gratuities at fast-food counters and self-service kiosks. Experts note that this trend, accelerated by the pandemic, benefits both employees and the tech companies that process the payments. This shift has left many consumers unsure of proper etiquette and feeling pressured to tip.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. military strikes on Iran may strengthen North Korea's resolve to maintain and enhance its nuclear weapons program, according to security analysts. Experts suggest that Pyongyang could view the U.S. action as evidence that only a credible nuclear deterrent can guarantee its survival against an unpredictable American foreign policy. This could lead North Korea to prioritize making its arsenal more mobile and resilient, effectively ending any remaining possibility of denuclearization. The situation recalls the breakdown of past talks that failed to produce a concrete deal.</p>
