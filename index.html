He has pledged to use his resources to support primary challengers against these incumbent Republicans in their next election races, marking a significant break with the party's current legislative push.</p>

          <p>Russia has executed its most extensive aerial attack on Ukraine to date, launching over 500 drones and missiles over a single weekend.

This escalation represents a significant strategic shift, bringing the conflict's intensity to parts of the country far from the established front lines.

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, both short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and money market accounts offer attractive returns for savers.

However, for a 9-month term, the money market account proves more lucrative. Savers must weigh the fixed, guaranteed rate of a CD against the variable rate of a money market account, especially with potential Fed rate cuts anticipated later in the year.

The legislation proposes to curtail subsidies for renewable energy and impose new taxes on projects using Chinese components, which could increase electricity costs and hinder the competitiveness of American AI and green tech industries.

Furthermore, their variable interest rates are advantageous in the current climate, as borrowers can benefit from anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts without needing to refinance. The flexibility of only paying interest on the amount drawn provides a significant advantage during a period of economic transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A leading expert on human physiology in extreme temperatures has suggested that FIFA should consider a 9 a.m. start time for next year's World Cup final in the U.S. if a heatwave occurs. Professor Mike Tipton pointed to the brutal conditions at the recent Club World Cup as a warning for the 2026 tournament. The health risks extend beyond players to officials and spectators, prompting calls from the players' union, Fifpro, for more flexible scheduling and enhanced safety measures. The concern is that afternoon kick-offs in cities like New York could be dangerously hot.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Wimbledon is using electronic line-calling on all courts, replacing the traditional human line judges and altering a long-standing tradition. While some players appreciate the accuracy and impartiality of the AI system, others have criticized it for being too quiet and removing the fan-engaging drama of player challenges. Players like Frances Tiafoe feel the change "kills" some of the fanfare, while others have noted difficulty hearing the automated calls over crowd noise.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security, in collaboration with the "department of government efficiency" (Doge), has created a national citizenship database by merging records from immigration agencies and the Social Security Administration. The centralized, searchable repository is designed to allow state and local election officials to verify the citizenship status of potential voters. This move is part of a broader administration effort to consolidate government data to, as they state, root out fraud. However, the creation of this unprecedented database has sparked significant concern and lawsuits from privacy and immigration advocates.</p>

          <p>Recent Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have resulted in numerous Palestinian casualties, including a strike on a seaside cafe that killed at least 20 people. In parallel, tensions are escalating between Iran and Western powers after Tehran rejected a UN request for inspectors to visit its recently bombed nuclear facilities, citing safety concerns. Meanwhile, a UK court ruled against a bid to halt military parts sales to Israel, and Israeli settlers reportedly attacked soldiers in the occupied West Bank. These events reflect the continued volatility and multifaceted conflicts across the Middle East.</p>
