          <p>Advocates and Medicaid recipients are expressing concerns about the potential impact of proposed work requirements for Medicaid, which could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance. They cite examples from states like Arkansas and Georgia, where similar requirements resulted in increased uninsurance rates and medical debt without boosting employment. Researchers estimate that cuts to health programs, including Medicaid, could lead to tens of thousands of lost lives annually. Opponents argue that many Medicaid enrollees are older adults, individuals with disabilities, or caregivers who would struggle to meet the reporting requirements. </p>

          <p>A new report from the European Environment Agency (EEA) reveals that more than one in five Europeans are exposed to unhealthy levels of noise pollution, primarily from road, rail, and air traffic. Long-term exposure to traffic noise is linked to cardiovascular disease, mental illness, and premature death, with children being particularly vulnerable. The report identifies road traffic as the main source of noise pollution, especially in urban areas, and highlights the need for measures to reduce traffic, promote public transport, and improve access to quiet, green spaces. The EEA emphasizes the urgency for EU member states to address noise pollution to achieve the EU's 2030 zero pollution target.</p>

          <p>A police watchdog report concludes that West Mercia Police did not adequately train front-line officers to identify child abuse in the case of Alfie Steele, a nine-year-old boy who was murdered by his mother and her partner. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) examined twenty cases where the police had contact with Alfie and his family, finding no misconduct but identifying areas for improvement. These include warning markers on police logs and better policies for referrals to children's services. Alfie's grandfather expressed disappointment, stating that the report had not changed anything and that nobody was being held accountable for his grandson's death. </p>
