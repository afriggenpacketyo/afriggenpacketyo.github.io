          <p>An evening with DBS Group CEO Tan Su Shan was auctioned for S$18,900 ($14,790) to benefit Singapore's National Gallery. The experience, which includes a private dinner and gallery tour, sold for more than double its estimate, highlighting a common fundraising practice of offering meals with high-profile business leaders. The funds raised from the gala event, totaling over S$2.8 million, will support the museum's mission to make art accessible through new exhibitions and community programs. This follows a trend of high-value charity auctions, such as one where a bidder paid $19 million to dine with Warren Buffett.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced £150 billion in new investment pledges from U.S. firms, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major contributions include £90 billion from Blackstone and significant commitments from Microsoft and Google, which are expected to create thousands of jobs. However, the announcement comes as some pharmaceutical companies halt UK investments, citing a challenging business environment, and domestic business investment appears to be slowing. Critics have described the investment as "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," arguing it doesn't solve the UK's issue of exporting its own tech start-ups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government plans to appeal a High Court decision that temporarily blocked the deportation of an Eritrean migrant to France under a new "one in, one out" agreement. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood criticized what she called "vexatious, last-minute claims," after the man argued he was a victim of modern slavery just hours before his flight. The injunction raises concerns about the viability of the new deal, which aims to curb small boat crossings by returning some asylum seekers to France. The UK's independent anti-slavery commissioner expressed concern over the Home Secretary's language, stating there is no evidence of the system being misused.</p>

After spending Wednesday with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, Trump is scheduled for talks on Thursday with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss economic deals. First Lady Melania Trump will remain at Windsor for separate engagements. The visit, initiated by an invitation from King Charles via Starmer, has been described as "unprecedented" and involves significant security and logistical arrangements, including the deployment of Air Force One.</p>

          <h2>Historic Italian Protest Song 'Bella Ciao' Gains Renewed Attention After Activist's Murder</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 04:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Italian protest anthem "Bella Ciao" is under a new spotlight after the phrase was found etched on a bullet casing linked to the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The song, with debated origins but widely known as an anti-fascist hymn in post-war Italy, has a long history of being adapted by global resistance movements.

          <p>European Union environment ministers are struggling to agree on an updated emissions-cutting plan ahead of a major UN climate summit in Brazil. A European Commission proposal to cut emissions by 90% by 2040 is supported by nations like Denmark and Spain but faces opposition from others, including Hungary and Poland, who fear economic damage. Due to the deadlock, a decision on the 2040 target has been postponed, meaning the EU will likely attend the summit without a finalized plan. The delay reflects a broader shift in focus as security concerns and economic pressures are currently sidelining ambitious climate action.</p>

          <p>A former high-ranking Chinese military officer, Lieutenant General He Lei, has stated that mainland China would not need its most advanced weaponry to "resolve the Taiwan issue" by force.

He emphasized that the People's Liberation Army's priority is on achieving victory with minimal cost and casualties through joint operations and system-based warfare. This rhetoric underscores Beijing's continued assertion of its claims over Taiwan, framing any potential conflict in terms of overwhelming conventional capability.</p>

Huawei's rotating chairman, Eric Xu, asserted that the new system would deliver significantly more computing power than Nvidia's upcoming products.

The article condemns those who celebrated Kirk's death on social media, questioning the heartlessness of such reactions and linking the current climate of rage to the erosion of civil discourse.

          <p>Police in Mississippi are awaiting autopsy results for a 21-year-old Black student who was found hanging from a tree at Delta State University. While campus police have stated there is no initial evidence of foul play, the student's family has hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump and is demanding a thorough investigation, including an independent autopsy. The death has stirred significant emotion and concern, evoking the state's dark history of racist violence and lynchings. University and police officials are calling for patience as the investigation proceeds, but the community is pressing for transparency and answers.</p>

          <p>Abu Agila Mas'ud, the Libyan man accused of building the bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, claims he was forced to make a false confession. His lawyers have filed a motion in a U.S. federal court arguing that while in Libyan custody in 2012, Mas'ud was threatened by masked men and ordered to memorize details about the attack. He alleges he repeated this information to a Libyan official under duress, fearing for his family's safety in the volatile post-Gaddafi era. The defense is seeking to have this alleged confession ruled inadmissible ahead of his trial.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, intend to submit "scientific and photographic evidence" to a U.S. court to disprove claims that Mrs. Macron was born male. The couple has filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has repeatedly promoted the conspiracy theory. Their lawyer stated that while the process is "incredibly upsetting," Mrs. Macron is resolved to do what is necessary to set the record straight and combat the false allegations. Owens' legal team has responded with a motion to dismiss the case, setting the stage for a contentious and unusual legal battle.</p>

          <p>Fraud investigators are warning about a significant increase in the misuse of Blue Badge disability parking permits in the UK, including the use of fakes, stolen badges, and permits belonging to deceased individuals. An agency that assists local councils reports confiscating "more fake badges than ever before," as people seek to illegally obtain free parking. This abuse directly impacts disabled individuals who rely on the designated bays for accessibility, often finding them occupied by ineligible drivers. While the government has strengthened enforcement powers, advocates are calling for more resources to combat the fraud that makes disabled drivers feel like "a target."</p>

          <p>Edward Enninful, the former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, has expressed concern that the fashion industry risks backsliding on diversity. He stated that "anti-woke" rhetoric is having a cultural moment, leading to a potential return to an era where being "super-thin and European" is considered the primary beauty standard. Enninful, who championed inclusivity during his tenure at Vogue, recently launched a new media platform to continue promoting a broader representation of beauty. He believes the industry is at a crossroads and must decide what it stands for, pushing back against the idea that inclusivity is a "dirty word."</p>

          <p>The unemployment rate for young people in China has reached a two-year peak, exacerbating concerns about the country's job market for recent graduates. According to official data, the jobless rate for individuals aged 16 to 24, not including students, increased to 18.9 percent in August. This statistic reflects the real-world struggles of graduates who have been searching for jobs for months, with some having previously secured offers rescinded. The rising unemployment figure points to a deepening job crunch for China's youth, posing a significant economic and social challenge for the nation's leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A union representing CDC employees reports that the agency has paused approvals for remote work as a reasonable accommodation for staff with disabilities. This follows a new policy from the parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, which no longer explicitly lists telework as such an accommodation. The American Federation of Government Employees states the change has caused confusion and anxiety among disabled workers who rely on remote arrangements. An internal CDC memo indicates the agency is awaiting further clarification, but in the interim, all pending requests are on hold, potentially jeopardizing critical accommodations.</p>

The planned session, which aims to become a biannual exchange, signals a move by both sides to re-engage diplomatically.

          <p>This analysis piece argues that the assassination of Charlie Kirk has exposed and deepened the dangerous political divisions within the United States, fueled by a media and political ecosystem that rewards extremism. The author notes that unlike past tragedies, there is little appetite for national unity, with political incentives and social media algorithms amplifying outrage rather than promoting reconciliation. While some leaders have called for de-escalation, President Trump has framed the killing in partisan terms, potentially worsening the spiral of hatred. The article concludes that America's internal divisions represent a significant national security threat.</p>
