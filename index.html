        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new record high, exceeding $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. The rise comes amid easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which has highlighted alternative stores of value. James Butterfill of CoinShares notes that the price surge is due to positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This movement is diverging from U.S. equities, potentially signaling investors are seeking alternative stores of value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of public sector workers in England, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay raises ranging from 3.6% to 4.5%. This decision follows the government's acceptance of recommendations from pay review bodies that exceeded the previously budgeted 2.8%. Unions had threatened action if pay awards were not increased, deeming 2.8% too low, however, the Treasury stated that any rises above this would need to be funded through savings from existing budgets. The education department has announced Â£615m in additional funding to help cover the cost of pay rises this year.</p>

          <p>Taiwanâ€™s newly inaugurated President William Lai delivered an address on Tuesday omitting any direct mentions of mainland China or cross-strait relations, a stark contrast to his previous assertive rhetoric. This shift is seen as a calculated effort to ease tensions and extend an olive branch to opposition parties, including the Beijing-friendly Kuomintang. Since taking office last year, Lai has consistently asserted Taiwan's independence and labeled Beijing a hostile force, but his recent tone suggests a move towards reconciliation and dialogue. He only mentioned Beijing when asked by reporters.</p>

Trump repeatedly pushed a right-wing conspiracy theory about the persecution of white South Africans, misrepresenting video footage and presenting unsubstantiated articles as evidence. While some wished Ramaphosa had responded more forcefully, many lauded his ability to remain calm and polite during the contentious exchange.</p>

          <p>Eastern Kern County, California, is becoming a renewable energy hub with the rise of a renewable energy corridor featuring wind turbines, solar panels, and giant batteries. Tesla workers are actively involved in the Eland solar and storage project, developed by Arevon Energy. These large-scale batteries, resembling shipping containers, are essential for storing and distributing renewable energy, demonstrating California's leadership in energy storage solutions.</p>

          <p>America is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in 30 years, with over 800 cases reported across several states, and possibly more unreported. The outbreak has already resulted in three deaths. Public-health experts are concerned that this situation could worsen due to declining vaccination rates and cuts to public-health services. This could lead to more frequent outbreaks and the potential for measles to become endemic in the country again.</p>

He and other senior staff were ultimately forced out of the building at the behest of three different police agencies. Then a DOGE staffer handed over the keys to the building to the federal government.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump's tax bill out of the chamber on a narrow vote. The passage was a major victory for Republican leaders, who spent the past two months crafting the bill and the past two days making last-minute changes to it. The package, comprised of tax cuts paired with cuts to the social safety net, still faces a complicated path through the Senate. The upper chamber will consider the legislation under a set of rules called budget reconciliation, which requires only a simple majority to pass instead of the typical 60 votes required to move bills through the Senate.</p>
