        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Italian luxury brand Prada is at the center of a cultural appropriation controversy after showcasing sandals that critics say are direct copies of traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals. Following a significant social media outcry and an official complaint from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, a Prada executive formally acknowledged the design's inspiration from the historic Indian footwear, which dates back to the 12th century. This incident, which echoes a similar case involving designer Paul Smith a decade ago, has now spurred Indian officials to seek a patent for the Kolhapuri chappal design to protect it from future global copyright infringement and ensure recognition of its cultural legacy.</p>

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a deal to acquire TSB from its current owner, Sabadell, in a move that would create the UK's third-largest bank. Santander has indicated its intention to integrate TSB into its UK group, which likely means the TSB brand name will be retired, following the pattern of past acquisitions like Abbey and Alliance & Leicester. The deal is expected to result in operational efficiencies and cost savings, but also raises concerns about potential job losses and branch closures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS, has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Trump over the editing of a '60 Minutes' interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The lawsuit alleged election interference, a claim widely seen by legal experts as spurious, but the settlement avoids a prolonged legal battle. This deal, struck by corporate executives over the objections of news division leaders, is viewed as a significant blow to journalistic independence and has raised concerns about media outlets settling lawsuits to avoid political pressure.</p>

          <p>In a major NBA free agency surprise, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To accommodate the deal, the Bucks have waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now be a free agent. The move significantly reshapes the rosters of two Eastern Conference contenders, with the Pacers losing a franchise cornerstone and the Bucks adding a premier defender to play alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo, signaling an aggressive push for another championship.</p>
