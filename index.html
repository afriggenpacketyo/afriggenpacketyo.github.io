          <p>As the nation celebrates Independence Day, this article provides a practical guide on which businesses and services are open or closed. While major banks, post offices, and the stock market are closed for the federal holiday, many retail and grocery stores like Walmart and Kroger remain open, some with modified hours. Establishments such as Trader Joe's and Home Depot are operating on a reduced schedule, while Costco is closed entirely. Many popular fast-food chains and restaurants are also open, though it is recommended to check local hours.</p>

          <p>Following the narrow passage of a significant Republican tax and spending package, the political focus now shifts to the campaign trail. Democrats are criticizing the bill for its cuts to social safety nets like Medicaid and food stamps, citing polls that suggest public disapproval and potential negative impacts on healthcare and insurance premiums. Conversely, Republicans are championing the extension of the 2017 tax cuts and the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime, framing the legislation as a fulfillment of campaign promises that will benefit working families and businesses. The bill is projected to increase the national debt while also funding border security and defense. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly denied claims of abuse made by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was mistakenly deported from the U.S. and held in a Salvadoran prison. Abrego Garcia alleged in a legal filing that he endured severe beatings and psychological torture during his detention at the Terrorism Confinement Center. President Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos, asserting that Abrego Garcia was not tortured and appears well. This dispute adds another layer to the ongoing legal case against the Trump administration for the wrongful deportation.</p>

          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England's Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out, leading a significant recovery after an early collapse against India. Smith, alongside Harry Brook who made 158, forged a 303-run partnership that pulled England back into the match from a precarious position. Despite their efforts, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, struck back with the new ball, dismissing England for 407 and securing a 180-run first-innings lead. India extended their overall advantage to 244 by the end of day three, remaining in a commanding position.</p>

          <p>High-profile MP Zarah Sultana has announced her departure from the Labour Party with the intention of launching a new political party alongside former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn acknowledged her decision, he indicated that discussions about a new party are still in the early stages, suggesting Sultana's announcement was premature. The potential new party aims to capture voters to the left of Keir Starmer's Labour, with polling suggesting it could gain up to 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters. However, key figures from Labour's left, like John McDonnell, have shown no intention of leaving the party.</p>

He also advises against sugary cereals, drinks, and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and train taste buds to crave unhealthy options.

This development signals a significant potential shake-up for the team under manager Ruben Amorim, who had previously sidelined Rashford and indicated Garnacho could depart.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As competitive eaters consume vast quantities of food in short periods, health experts detail the potential physiological consequences, though long-term effects remain largely unknown. A 2007 study showed that a competitive eater's stomach can expand massively to accommodate food, appearing like a "distended, food-filled sac" with minimal digestive contractions. Potential health risks include a permanently stretched stomach, impaired gastric emptying, and gastrointestinal distress. The high sodium and fat content of foods like hot dogs can also spike blood pressure and impact kidney function, while the act of speed-eating carries a risk of choking and other immediate dangers.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California, named the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 52,500 acres, establishing it as the largest blaze in the state so far this year. Originating in the Los Padres National Forest, the fire has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With the fire currently at 10% containment, state and federal agencies are working in unified command, deploying extensive air and ground resources to combat the blaze. The fire's rapid, exponential growth has been fueled by current weather, terrain, and fuel conditions, serving as a stark reminder of wildfire dangers.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has drawn condemnation from Jewish advocacy groups after using the antisemitic term "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes in his new spending bill, Trump used the slur, which originates from a Shakespearean character and evokes harmful stereotypes about Jewish people and greed. The Anti-Defamation League called the president's language "extremely offensive and dangerous," emphasizing that words from leaders have significant impact. When questioned, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations, stating he understood it to mean a moneylender who charges high rates.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint detailing a scam where perpetrators impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee to steal over $250,000 in cryptocurrency. The scammers used fraudulent email addresses, cleverly mimicking the official domain, to trick a victim into believing they were donating to the committee. The funds, sent as USDT stablecoin, were quickly transferred to numerous other crypto addresses. The U.S. government is now seeking to permanently seize a portion of the recovered funds, which were traced to a Binance account with an address in Nigeria, to deter further criminal activity and potentially compensate victims.</p>

          <p>The UK's Attorney General's Office has referred the sentence of a 15-year-old boy, convicted of manslaughter for killing an 80-year-old man, to the Court of Appeal for being potentially unduly lenient. The boy was sentenced to seven years in custody for the attack on Bhim Kohli in a Leicestershire park, which was filmed by a 13-year-old girl. The victim's family expressed disappointment with the initial sentence, arguing it did not reflect the crime's severity. The Solicitor General expressed deep sympathy for the family and concluded that the boy's sentence met the threshold for a review by a higher court.</p>

Air raid sirens sounded for eight hours as approximately 550 drones and 11 missiles struck the Ukrainian capital, killing at least one person and injuring over 20. Zelenskyy stated the attack proves Russia has no intention of ending the war and called for more air defense systems, a request he discussed with Trump, who had previously paused critical weapons shipments to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU alleges that U.S. immigration agents in Southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling, targeting individuals based on their appearance as Latino. The suit claims that agents are conducting indiscriminate raids in known hubs for Latino workers, such as hardware store parking lots and street vendor corners, often detaining people without establishing reasonable suspicion. Advocates argue that the Trump administration's ambitious daily arrest quotas are pressuring agents to cut corners and violate constitutional protections. The Department of Homeland Security has denied the claims, stating that its enforcement operations are highly targeted.</p>

          <p>In a hopeful effort to combat the effects of climate change, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a Miami reef that was devastated by bleaching. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other partners, involves corals that are a hybrid of Florida's native Elkhorn coral and a more heat-tolerant variety from a warm reef in Honduras. The goal is to introduce genetic diversity that will help the iconic reefs better survive rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time internationally crossbred corals have been permitted for planting in the wild, offering a potential blueprint for reef conservation across the Caribbean.</p>

          <p>In a private meeting with the EU's top diplomat, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly stated that Beijing cannot accept Russia losing its war against Ukraine, according to an official briefed on the talks. The rationale provided was that a Russian defeat could allow the United States to shift its full focus toward its rivalry with China, contradicting Beijing's public stance of neutrality. This admission suggests a preference for a prolonged conflict that occupies U.S. attention. When asked about the report, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson reiterated the country's official position, calling for a negotiated peace and stating that a protracted war serves no one's interests.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at a gas station in a southeastern Rome neighborhood has injured at least 25 people, including ten first responders who were investigating a reported gas leak. The blast, which was heard across the city, sent a massive plume of fire and smoke into the air and caused widespread damage to nearby vehicles and buildings. Authorities believe a swift evacuation of a nearby sports center, where dozens of children were expected for a summer camp, prevented a much greater tragedy. Rome's prosecutors have opened an investigation into the cause, which may be related to a leak during a gas delivery.</p>
