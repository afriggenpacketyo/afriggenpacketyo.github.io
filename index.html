          <p>U.S. Attorney Alina Habba dismissed a federal trespassing charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested during an ICE protest, citing the need to move forward. However, Congresswoman LaMonica McIver has been charged with assaulting, impeding, and interfering with law enforcement during the same incident at Delaney Hall, an ICE facility. Habba stated that McIver's conduct could not be overlooked, while McIver claims the charges are politically motivated and a mischaracterization of her actions during oversight of the ICE facility. Baraka expressed support for McIver and criticized the ICE facility, while Habba invited him to tour Delaney Hall to ensure humane treatment of detainees.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating an incident where the Cuauht√©moc, a Mexican naval training ship, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to others. Preliminary findings indicate the ship accelerated unexpectedly in reverse shortly after departing from a Manhattan pier, causing its masts to strike the bridge. The NTSB is working with Mexican authorities to inspect the ship, interview crew members, and recover data recorders, with a preliminary report expected within 30 days. The investigation will focus on the crew, the vessel's mechanics, and environmental conditions at the time of the collision, while expressing condolences for the deceased sailors.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating, signaling a shift in global investment dynamics. Analysts suggest investors are moving away from U.S. dollar assets due to President Trump's trade war. Bank of America analysts noted that China's economic recovery and weaker U.S. dollar are favoring emerging markets, contributing to the capital inflow.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, saw its shares jump over 10% in its Hong Kong Stock Exchange debut, marking the biggest IPO of the year. The company, which supplies major carmakers like Tesla and Toyota, raised almost HK$35.7bn ($4.55bn) from the listing, with funds earmarked for building a factory in Hungary. Despite U.S. lawmakers' concerns over potential national security risks, CATL is investing heavily in new technology, including fast-charging batteries.

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose as much as 14% during their Hong Kong trading debut on Tuesday, with the IPO raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion).

Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.

The rate cuts came as state-backed commercial lenders reduced deposit rates to protect their net interest margin.

          <p>The Justice Department charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center, while also dropping a trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated that McIver was charged for "assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement" and that she had sought a resolution without bringing criminal charges. In contrast, the charge against Baraka was dismissed "for the sake of moving forward." Both sides have presented conflicting narratives and video footage of the incident, leading to partisan reactions.</p>

The plan involves secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role. The proposed deal, characterized by Trump as a "gift, free of charge," raises ethical concerns and questions about the financial sense of refitting the plane. The aircraft, previously owned by the Qatari royal family, features opulent interiors, but significant modifications would be necessary to meet presidential security and communication requirements.</p>
