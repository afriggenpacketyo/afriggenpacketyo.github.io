          <p>President Trump overturned a Biden administration proposal to include pricey obesity drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro in Medicare coverage.  This decision would deny millions of obese Americans access to these medications, citing the substantial billions of dollars in government costs.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services indicated potential future reconsideration of coverage, leaving the matter unresolved.  The high cost of these drugs, approximately $1000 before insurance, remains a significant barrier to access.</p>

          <p>President Trump granted TikTok a second extension, delaying the enforcement of a law requiring the app's sale or ban in the US.  This follows a failed attempt to finalize a deal due to Chinese government objections related to Trump's new tariffs.  The extension provides more time to negotiate a sale to an American entity and keeps the popular app operational in the US.  However, the ongoing negotiations face challenges and uncertainties, with the potential for further delays or a complete ban.</p>
