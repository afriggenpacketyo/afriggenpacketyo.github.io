          <p>This article summarizes the current state of U.S.-China relations, highlighting a recent breakthrough in trade talks in Geneva where both countries agreed to cut back on most new tariffs for 90 days while negotiating economic and trade policy. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized a sense of mutual respect during the talks, a stark contrast to previous high-level meetings. Despite the tariff reprieve, businesses are still mitigating tariff uncertainty by diversifying supply chains, and China is forging ahead on self-sufficiency by strengthening export controls on critical minerals. The article suggests that while the U.S. remains on the offensive, China is learning to adapt and dig in for future challenges.</p>

          <p>To address its declining birthrate, Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket payments for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026. The proposed policy involves covering normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes them as they are not considered medical conditions. While the government provides a lump-sum payment for each childbirth, costs have been rising and varying among prefectures. The article notes that obstetricians have expressed concerns about the potential financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

          <p>Five months after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, Syria is struggling with sectarian clashes and a weak central government. The new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, faces challenges from Sunni Islamist gangs, Druze separatists, and external interference from Israel and Turkey. Despite President Trump dropping sanctions, Sharaa's dependence on former jihadists and a centralized state structure hinder his ability to unify the country.

He contends that providing basic healthcare encourages people to work and strengthens the economy.

          <p>The injury suffered by Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi has raised questions about the application of the offside law. Awoniyi was placed in an induced coma after colliding with the post during a Premier League match, sustaining an abdominal injury. Replays showed that his teammate was offside in the build-up to the incident, but the assistant referee followed protocol by allowing play to continue. The article explores whether the 'late flag' rule contributed to the severity of Awoniyi's injury.</p>

          <p>A court ruled that the European Union should not have denied a journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The court found that the commission did not adequately explain its refusal to provide the messages or why it thought they lacked important information. The ruling underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in the EU, particularly regarding negotiations that involve taxpayer money and shape public policy.

          <p>Beijing's moderate relaxation of export controls on some rare earth minerals as part of a trade agreement with the US reflects China's goodwill in de-escalating tensions. These minerals are essential in hi-tech and aerospace hardware, giving China significant leverage. The article suggests that China is adopting a kite-flying strategy, loosening restrictions moderately to avoid provoking the US into desperate measures. Following China’s curbs on April 4, prices of some “medium and heavy” rare earth elements surged by more than 200 per cent in the overseas market, according to a research note by Zhongtai Securities on May 11.</p>

          <p>The article argues that President Trump is employing a 'court-baiting' strategy, similar to tactics used by authoritarians globally, to weaken the judiciary by challenging courts on popular but potentially illegal policies, particularly on immigration. This approach aims to erode public support for the courts, enabling the executive to expand power. The article draws parallels with cases in Turkey and Mexico, where leaders used popular policies to undermine judicial constraints. It also suggests ways to counter this strategy by reframing the executive's policies and emphasizing the importance of constitutional limits.</p>

          <p>Israel tried to kill Muhammad Sinwar, a key Hamas leader in Gaza, an action that would deprive the group of another top commander, but it is unclear if it would lead to a strategic shift. The group has survived for decades despite Israel’s systematic assassination of its leaders. Mr. Sinwar, whose fate is still unknown, is considered one of Hamas’s leading military commanders in Gaza. While his death would undermine Hamas, it might not change the group’s strategic outlook or soften Israel’s approach to cease-fire negotiations.
