          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters currently expect the system to remain over open water and pose no immediate threat to land, though it may strengthen into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The storm's projected path shows it moving north of the Caribbean, potentially approaching Bermuda by next week as it continues to intensify. The formation comes after the historical peak of the hurricane season, which has so far been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>A man is in federal custody after allegedly ramming his car into the entrance gate of the FBI's Pittsburgh Field Office in what authorities initially called a "targeted attack." The suspect, identified as Donald Henson, reportedly has a history of mental health issues and had previously visited the office to make a complaint. After the crash, he threw an American flag over the gate before leaving the scene on foot; he was later arrested without injury to any personnel. Henson has been charged with damaging government property and assaulting or interfering with a federal officer.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic defense agreement, formalizing a pact where an attack on one nation will be considered an aggression against both. This move deepens a long-standing security relationship and comes as Gulf states express growing concerns about the reliability of the United States as a security guarantor. The agreement was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during a state visit. This development follows a period of heightened military tension between nuclear powers Pakistan and India earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>ABC has suspended its late-night program "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" indefinitely after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial comments regarding the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel asserted that the "MAGA gang" was attempting to politicize the tragedy and characterize the suspect as something other than one of their own. The decision followed pressure from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and a move by Nexstar Media, a major operator of ABC affiliates, to stop airing the show. President Trump celebrated the suspension, calling it "great news for America."</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record, gaining over 1% following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The rally was led by technology and real estate sectors, while other Asian markets showed mixed results as investors processed the Fed's move. The Fed's action, described as a "risk management cut," also included indications of two additional cuts by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Asian chip stocks saw gains after reports of China banning certain Nvidia AI chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Struggling carrier Spirit Airlines is preparing for more job cuts and plans to significantly reduce its flight schedule to cut costs, weeks after its second bankruptcy declaration in under a year. In a memo to employees, CEO Dave Davis announced a 25% capacity cut for November compared to the previous year, focusing on the airline's strongest markets. As the company negotiates with vendors and evaluates its fleet size, Davis warned that these adjustments will inevitably impact the size of their teams. The airline has already furloughed hundreds of pilots, with flight attendants also taking voluntary unpaid leave.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, analysts predict that China’s central bank will likely adopt a moderate easing policy for the remainder of the year. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan's midpoint rate slightly lower after the Fed's announcement, which caused the offshore yuan to strengthen overnight. Economists suggest that the PBOC's rate cuts will be smaller than the Fed's, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap between the two countries. This could ease capital outflow pressures and provide support for the yuan's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to designate the decentralized, far-left activist movement known as antifa as a "major terrorist organization." The move raises legal questions, as the U.S. currently lacks a domestic terrorism statute equivalent to the one for foreign entities, partly due to First Amendment protections. Trump's announcement followed his celebration of ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show over comments about the killing of a conservative activist. FBI Director Christopher Wray has previously described antifa as an ideology rather than a structured organization, complicating any formal designation.</p>

Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was arrested by ICE in March and detained for over three months before a district judge ordered his release.

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend has issued a sincere apology after facing backlash for social media posts criticizing food offered at a tournament in China.

In a subsequent video, she apologized from the "bottom of my heart," acknowledging her privilege to travel and experience different cultures. She stated that her comments were not representative of her overall positive experience in the country and promised that she would be better in the future.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, Kamala Harris reveals that her first choice for a running mate in her presidential campaign was Pete Buttigieg, but she ultimately decided against it, believing it was "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run with a gay man. Harris writes that while she felt Buttigieg would have been an ideal partner, she was concerned about asking too much of America at once, given her own historic characteristics. She instead selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and the ticket went on to lose to Donald Trump, highlighting a debate within the Democratic party about electability versus identity.</p>

          <p>The University of California's governing board has approved requests from five campuses to purchase additional military-grade weapons and equipment, including drones, rifle rounds, and thousands of pepper-ball projectiles. The approval comes amid heightened scrutiny of UC's handling of campus protests. Campuses like UC San Diego and UC Irvine made the largest requests to replenish supplies used in training, while UCLA requested items like pepper-ball launchers. A UC spokesperson stated the items are essential for operational readiness and enable de-escalation, but some faculty expressed concern that the weapons will be used against students and staff.</p>

          <p>Frank Somerville, a former longtime news anchor for KTVU in Oakland, was arrested on suspicion of assault following a physical altercation with his daughter. In a since-deleted social media post, Somerville claimed the fight occurred after his daughter arrived at his home unannounced and demanded money. This marks Somerville's fourth arrest in four years, following previous incidents including DUI charges and an altercation at a family home. His attorney described the situation as a delicate family issue and expressed hope that the matter could be resolved outside of the criminal justice system.</p>

          <p>The suspect accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fearful of being shot by law enforcement and negotiated a peaceful surrender with the help of his family and a retired detective. Washington County Sheriff Nate Brooksby revealed that Tyler Robinson, 22, did not want a SWAT team raiding his parents' home and agreed to turn himself in under relaxed conditions. The sheriff credited a retired colleague, who knew the family, for using community ties to facilitate the calm surrender. Robinson has since been charged with aggravated murder, and prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fruit with a low alcohol content, adding up to a daily intake equivalent to nearly two human cocktails. Scientists tested the figs and plum-like fruits that are staples of the chimps' diets and found an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While this low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests our own attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our primate ancestors seeking calories.</p>

In a new report, the Education Select Committee also called for new national minimum standards of support in schools and increased training for all teachers. The government, which is expected to announce reforms to the special needs system this autumn, had previously not ruled out scrapping the legally binding plans. Parent campaign groups have voiced strong opposition to removing EHCPs, valuing the legal protections they provide for children's educational support.</p>

          <p>According to a new report, California continues to have the highest poverty rate in the nation, a position it shares with Louisiana, with 17.7% of residents unable to afford basic needs in 2024. The research from the California Budget and Policy Center found that rates have remained largely unchanged since 2023, after surging when pandemic-era aid programs expired. Child poverty in the state has more than doubled since 2021. The report highlights that poverty is a "policy choice," arguing that the expiration of effective policies like the federal child tax credit reversed historic progress.</p>
