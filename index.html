        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Oxford Economics study reveals a record surge in Chinese-made solar panel imports to Africa, with 9,516 megawatts imported in the first seven months of this year, up from 6,625MW previously. This increase, largely driven by major energy plants developed by Chinese firms in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, signifies Africa's rapidly expanding solar capacity. The falling costs of this technology are accelerating the continent's transition to renewable energy sources. This article underscores China's significant role in global solar production and Africa's sustainable energy future.</p>

          <p>Faced with declining cranberry prices and rising costs, Massachusetts cranberry farmers are participating in a state program to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands. This initiative, part of the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration's Cranberry Bog Program, pays farmers to convert their land, promoting environmental benefits like water filtration and carbon storage. Over 500 acres have been restored in 15 years, with another 500 planned, offering farmers a way to preserve their land as a natural habitat. The program provides an economic alternative for farmers while enhancing ecological resilience.</p>

          <p>US lawmakers from Midwest states have formally complained to the EPA, urging Canada to be held accountable for wildfire smoke drifting south, which they claim harms millions of Americans. Manitoba's premier dismissed the complaints as a "timber tantrum," as 2025 is projected to be Canada's second-worst wildfire season on record. A study indicates 2023 Canadian wildfires caused over 87,500 acute and premature deaths worldwide. Experts from both countries largely agree that climate change is the root cause, advocating for collaboration over blame to address the global impact of worsening fires.</p>

          <p>Leaked documents expose England's Environment Agency (EA) for failing to investigate nearly a third of serious water industry pollution incidents in 2024, often relying on self-reporting from the polluting companies. The data indicates the EA attended only 13% of all reported incidents, with internal guidelines stating all potentially serious events should be attended. Critics argue this lack of oversight allows polluters to act with impunity, especially given staff shortages that led to thousands of cancelled water quality tests.
