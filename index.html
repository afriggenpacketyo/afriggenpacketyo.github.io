        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increased tariffs on Indian goods to 50 percent, citing India's continued oil trade with Russia as the primary justification for the hike. While this affects only a small portion of India's overall GDP, specific industries such as gems, jewelry, and textiles face significant disruption, with an estimated $8 billion in exports at risk. However, major export sectors like IT services and pharmaceuticals are notably exempt from these new duties. Economists suggest the most immediate financial impact might stem from currency volatility and market uncertainty rather than direct trade losses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's broad new tariffs, ranging from 10% to 41%, have officially taken effect, impacting goods from nearly 70 countries and raising concerns about potential price increases for consumers. The highest rates are applied to Laos, Myanmar, and Syria, while key partners like Canada face a 35% tariff. India's rate is set to climb to 50% later in the month due to its oil purchases from Russia. The White House states the rates are based on trade deficits, and economists estimate the tariffs could cost the average American household an additional $2,400 this year.</p>

          <p>Climate experts have confirmed that July 2025 was the third-hottest July globally since record-keeping began, with an average surface air temperature of 16.68 degrees Celsius. This temperature was 0.45 degrees Celsius above the 1991-2020 average and 1.25 degrees above the pre-industrial baseline. Although the streak of record-breaking monthly temperatures has paused, scientists emphasize that climate change continues, pointing to extreme heatwaves and catastrophic floods in places like Turkey, China, and Pakistan. Experts attribute the rising temperatures primarily to the burning of fossil fuels and warn of worsening impacts without rapid stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor reported an 11% year-on-year drop in its June-quarter operating profit, attributing a significant 450 billion yen loss directly to the impact of U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. Despite the profit decline, the company's revenue and operating profit still surpassed market expectations, driven by strong global demand and record worldwide sales in the first half of the year. In response to the tariffs, Japanese automakers have been reducing prices to maintain market share in the U.S. Consequently, Toyota has revised its full-year operating income forecast downward by 600 billion yen.

Wilmore is one of the few astronauts to have flown on four different spacecraft: the Space Shuttle, Roscosmos Soyuz, Boeing Starliner, and SpaceX Dragon. His final mission was the challenging first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner, which involved an extended stay on the International Space Station due to technical issues. NASA officials praised his technical excellence and steadfast commitment, highlighting his significant contributions to advancing human spaceflight across multiple eras of exploration.</p>

          <p>Moldova is facing an unprecedented level of Russian interference ahead of its September 28 election, as Moscow employs a hybrid warfare strategy to destabilize the nation and pull it back into its sphere of influence. Tactics include massive vote-buying schemes, paid protests, social media disinformation campaigns using AI, and hacker attacks on government systems. President Maia Sandu's pro-European government is working to counter these efforts, which are reportedly orchestrated by figures like fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor from within Russia. The election is seen as a critical moment determining whether Moldova continues its path toward European integration or succumbs to pro-Russian political forces.</p>

          <p>British athlete Jonathan Edwards reflects on his triple jump world record of 18.29 meters, which has now stood for 30 years since being set at the 1995 World Championships. Edwards expresses mixed feelings, suggesting the record's longevity might indicate a lack of growth and investment in track and field, making it less appealing to young talent compared to more lucrative sports. Experts note that while shoe technology has advanced, the extreme forces in jumping events may negate the benefits seen in running. Despite a decade passing since the last serious challenge to the record, it remains a celebrated and seemingly untouchable mark in athletics history.</p>

These makeshift pyrolysis plants, which can cause severe health and environmental damage, were found to be processing a significant portion of tyres exported from the UK. While the new rules require exporters to provide better verification of environmentally sound disposal, critics argue the measures are insufficient. Campaigners and the Tyre Recycling Association are pushing for a complete ban on whole-tyre exports, a move the agency has so far dismissed.</p>

The study also found that the expression of these unique genes was significantly higher in tumors. Furthermore, experiments showed that deactivating some of these genes could inhibit the growth of tumor cells, suggesting a fundamental link between human-specific evolution and susceptibility to certain cancers.</p>

The analysis of 2022-2024 models found that powerful and expensive vehicles, particularly muscle cars and pickup trucks, are prime targets for thieves. The Camaro's vulnerability is heightened by an on-board data port that can be exploited to steal the vehicle. In contrast, electric vehicles are among the least stolen, likely because they are often parked in secure garages and their connected features make them easier to track.</p>

Researchers found that depleting lithium in mice accelerated brain inflammation and the development of Alzheimer's-like changes, including memory loss. Conversely, maintaining normal lithium levels protected their brains from these effects, as the element appears crucial for clearing the sticky amyloid plaques characteristic of the disease. If these findings are replicated in humans, they could pave the way for new diagnostic tests and low-dose lithium treatments for Alzheimer's.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Questions Lack of Male Outrage Over Microplastics Found in Human Testicles</h2>

          <p>A recent scientific study that found microplastic particles in every human testicle examined has prompted questions about the public and political response to widespread plastic pollution. A commentary in The Guardian highlights the irony that a society seemingly obsessed with protecting male genitalia has shown little alarm over evidence that plastics are infiltrating these organs and potentially affecting fertility and sperm counts. The article points to the failure of international treaty negotiations, often stymied by petrochemical interests, as a key obstacle. It urges men to recognize the direct threat plastic pollution poses to their own bodies and to demand more aggressive global action.</p>

          <p>Louisiana officials have canceled a major $3 billion coastal restoration project, the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, which was designed to rebuild the state's rapidly disappearing wetlands. The project aimed to divert sediment from the Mississippi River to naturally create 17,000 acres of new land over 30 years, providing a critical buffer against hurricanes. Despite years of planning and the expenditure of $600 million, the project was scrapped by Governor Jeff Landry's administration following strong opposition from local fishing communities. They feared the diversion would destroy their oyster beds and negatively impact their livelihoods, creating a difficult conflict between economic and environmental priorities.</p>

The deployment is a demonstration of the U.S. Army's ability to rapidly project advanced capabilities in support of key allies.

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has given China two weeks to provide unredacted plans for its proposed new mega-embassy in London, a project that has sparked espionage and security fears. The Ministry of Housing is scrutinizing the plans after taking the decision away from the local council. Concerns have been raised that the embassy's location near London's financial district could enable spying on sensitive data, and that it could be used to harass political opponents. The government's intervention comes amid attempts to re-engage with Beijing after a period of cooler relations, with a final decision on the controversial plans expected by September 9.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by World Weather Attribution scientists has found that climate change likely intensified the monsoon rains that caused deadly flooding in Pakistan. The research indicates that rainfall was 10% to 15% heavier due to global warming, as a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture. Between June and August, the floods and heavy rains resulted in at least 300 deaths, with many victims crushed by collapsing buildings in fragile urban settlements. The report underscores Pakistan's extreme vulnerability to climate change, coming after catastrophic floods in 2022 killed over 1,700 people and highlighting the urgent need for flood-resilient infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) predicts that councils in inner London will be the biggest losers under a government plan to overhaul local authority funding. Some London boroughs, including Camden and Westminster, could see their funding drop by up to 12% after accounting for inflation. The new system, set to be phased in from 2026, aims to reallocate funds to more deprived areas and those with lower council tax bases. While some urban areas outside the capital are set to benefit, the proposed changes are expected to create significant financial challenges for the affected inner London councils.
