          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly stated his intention to pardon reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted of tax evasion and bank fraud in 2022. Trump communicated his plans to the Chrisleys' daughter, Savannah, expressing hope to finalize the pardon quickly. The Chrisleys, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," were found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks and the IRS. White House spokesman Harrison Fields emphasized Trump's desire to give deserving Americans a second chance, especially those unfairly targeted by the justice system. The Chrisleys were sentenced to 12 and 7 years respectively.</p>

          <p>Experts recommend homeowners carefully consider their financial situation before borrowing from their home equity this June, particularly in the current high-interest rate environment. They advise ensuring affordability, having a clear purpose for the funds, and choosing the right home equity option, whether a home equity loan or a HELOC. It's important to limit risk by borrowing less than the approved amount and confirming stable income. Borrowing against your home carries substantial risks since it's secured by your home, so homeowners should shop and compare rates before applying. (not investment advice)</p>

This finding underscores the importance of preparedness for unexpected expenses, as the median cost of an emergency is about $2,000.

          <p>Relations between Czechia and Slovakia have soured since Robert Fico became Prime Minister of Slovakia. Fico's pro-Russian government has clashed with the pro-Ukrainian Czech government, leading to the cancellation of joint governmental meetings. Differences over Ukraine, domestic developments in Slovakia, and growing distance between the two populations have contributed to the strained relationship. A recent survey indicates a decline in Czech citizens' favorability towards Slovakia, reflecting the impact of political tensions on societal attitudes.</p>

          <p>A former French surgeon, Joël Le Scouarnec, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after confessing to sexually abusing 299 people, mostly children. The trial revealed failures in legal and health administrative systems, as Le Scouarnec was allowed to continue practicing despite a prior conviction for downloading child abuse imagery. Victims testified about the lasting impact of the abuse, including psychological trauma and difficulties in trusting doctors. The case has sparked outrage and calls for greater protection of children from predatory medical practitioners. The doctor was also barred from ever practicing medicine or having contact with minors and said he must serve two-thirds of his sentence before being eligible for parole.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest rocket ever built, reached space but failed to complete its return to Earth, marking another setback for the program. The upper-stage vehicle experienced a propellant leak, causing it to spin out of control and break up during reentry. Debris fell into the Indian Ocean, away from populated areas. Despite the failure, the flight achieved progress, including fixing issues from previous test flights. The mission's goal was to test the heat protection system, but the data was not collected due to the spacecraft's uncontrolled spin.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas permitted four DOGE employees to access the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which serves as the checkbook for the federal government. The ruling marks a win for the Trump administration and DOGE, which had previously faced legal challenges to its access. The judge cited the establishment of a system to train employees and prevent improper disclosures as justification for the decision.</p>
