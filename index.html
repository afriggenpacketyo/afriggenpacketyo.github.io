          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company anticipates a reduction in its corporate workforce over the next few years due to the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence tools. Jassy emphasized the need for employees to adapt and learn how to leverage AI to enhance efficiency and streamline teamwork. This announcement follows Amazon's layoff of over 27,000 employees since 2022, with further cuts made this year in its North America stores and devices and services units. Amazon is currently deploying generative AI across its internal operations, including its fulfillment network, to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and warehouse robot efficiency. </p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller and mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested by ICE agents at an immigration court in Manhattan while observing proceedings and requesting a judicial warrant in a particular case. Department of Homeland Security claimed Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, but Lander's wife and other observers dispute this account, stating that he was merely asking for a warrant. The arrest has drawn condemnation from fellow politicians and civil rights organizations, who view it as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy. Lander's wife described seeing multiple cases where individuals were told their case was dismissed, only to be met by ICE agents upon leaving the courtroom.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating that he is an "easy target" and demanding Iran's "unconditional surrender" in its escalating conflict with Israel. Trump asserted that the U.S. has "total control" over Iran's airspace and cautioned against missiles being fired at civilians or American soldiers. These comments suggest a willingness to consider direct military intervention in support of Israel, though the administration maintains it was not directly involved in Israel's recent strike against Iran. The heightened geopolitical tensions have impacted financial markets, with U.S. stocks declining and crude oil prices rising.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mike Lee is facing backlash for his social media posts regarding the assassination of Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband. Lee's initial posts, which have since been deleted, appeared to blame Marxists and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the shootings. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin condemned Lee's posts as "reprehensible" and accused him of politicizing the tragedy and inciting violence. The attacks have prompted calls for elected officials to reduce heated rhetoric, with Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar emphasizing the need to lower the tone in the current political environment.</p>

This vote allows MPs to vote according to their personal beliefs on this issue of conscience. Abortion remains legal up to 24 weeks in Great Britain with the approval of two doctors, a regulation that will remain in effect.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, also known as "Nimbus," is estimated to account for a significant portion of recent cases in the U.S., with a hallmark symptom being a severe sore throat described as "razor blade throat." While Nimbus appears more transmissible, it is not considered more virulent than other variants, according to medical experts. Patients report experiencing excruciating throat pain, comparing the sensation to swallowing razor blades or glass. Doctors recommend consulting a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment, suggesting remedies such as honey, anti-inflammatory medications, and salt water gargles.</p>

This decision follows federal health officials' plans to voluntarily phase out petroleum-based food dyes, addressing concerns about their potential negative effects on children's behavior and mental health.

Despite claiming to be a "peacemaker," Trump has also labeled Khamenei an "easy target," creating uncertainty about his true intentions. Experts suggest that Israel may have influenced the U.S. to believe that military action against Iran could advance nuclear talks, while Trump's own MAGA base is divided on military deployments in the Middle East.

          <p>A review by House Judiciary Democrats reveals that President Trump's recent pardons have cost crime victims and taxpayers approximately $1.3 billion in restitution and payments. The pardons absolved convicted criminals from having to pay for damages and restitution caused by their crimes, leaving victims uncompensated. Among those pardoned were corporate fraudsters, tax evaders, and other white-collar criminals, allowing them to retain ill-gotten gains. The report also highlights the cancellation of restitution payments for individuals convicted in connection with the January 6th Capitol riot. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The June CNBC Fed Survey reveals that investors anticipate weaker economic growth and higher inflation, indicating a stagflationary outlook. The probability of a recession in the next year has decreased but remains elevated compared to earlier in the year. Respondents express uncertainty over trade policy, with a majority expecting the U.S. to strike a new trade deal with China within five months. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain interest rates at the June meeting and implement only two rate reductions this year. (not investment advice)</p>
