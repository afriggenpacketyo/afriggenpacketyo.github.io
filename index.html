        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators unveiled comprehensive measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduced reserve requirement ratio, to bolster the economy amid ongoing trade concerns. These actions aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, and establish a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care. The move signals increased urgency from Beijing to counteract the economic impact of tariffs, as Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to engage in trade talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland. This comes after heightened trade tensions, with the U.S. imposing tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with levies on U.S. imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan surged after India conducted strikes on Pakistani territory, responding to a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. The Indian government asserted that its forces targeted terrorist camps and that their actions were measured and non-escalatory, while Pakistan condemned the strikes as an unprovoked act of war and vowed retaliation. The attacks have raised concerns internationally, with global leaders urging de-escalation to prevent further conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations. This military action follows a recent terrorist attack on civilians in Kashmir, which India attributed to Pakistan-based terrorists, though Pakistan denies involvement.</p>

          <p>Despite economic headwinds, China's tourism sector is experiencing a surge, with domestic trips far exceeding pre-pandemic levels. This growth is fueled by increased interest in cultural experiences, enhanced transportation infrastructure connecting smaller cities, and strategic investments in tourism by local governments. The article highlights Datong's Yungang Buddhist grottoes as a prime example, with popularity soaring after being featured in a video game, while cities like Chengdu are leveraging drones and robotics to enhance the visitor experience. This trend suggests a shift in consumer spending priorities toward travel and experiences, presenting opportunities for brands to connect with consumers through cultural collaborations.</p>

The decision could inflame tensions with Iran, which views the name as a matter of national pride.

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson and his wife are facing a lawsuit filed by four women alleging sexual battery and assault, with the plaintiffs seeking $50 million in damages. The women, who worked as housekeepers for the Robinsons, claim they were repeatedly sexually assaulted by the singer and that his wife failed to take action to prevent the alleged acts. The lawsuit also includes allegations of workplace violations, with the women claiming they were not given proper rest periods and were not properly compensated for working overtime hours. None of the women brought the allegations to law enforcement for fear of loss of livelihood and the possible adverse effect on their immigration status.</p>

          <p>Long Beach has partnered with Washington, D.C.-based Throne Labs to place four “smart” public restrooms throughout the city. The 7-by-8-foot restrooms cost $6,200 apiece per month, which amounts to a total price tag of just under $100,000 for the four-month trial, Kurtzman said. A digital sign alerts users on whether the bathroom is available, in use, being cleaned or closed. But those with a penchant for leisurely loo visits should take note: The Thrones come with a time limit. After 10 minutes, ready or not, the doors are opening.</p>

          <p>Two Trump administration officials, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, will meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss trade and economic issues. The meetings come amid a tense tariff standoff between the U.S. and China, with President Trump imposing steep tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with tariffs on U.S. imports. While Bessent indicated the initial discussions will likely focus on de-escalation, he also emphasized that "everything's on the table." The meetings are seen as a potentially key moment in resolving the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with Canada's new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, after months of criticizing the country and suggesting it become the 51st state. Despite his previous rhetoric, Trump expressed his love for Canada and emphasized the strong relationship between the two nations. The meeting covered a wide range of topics, and Trump appeared to avoid addressing the complications his previous remarks had created. Carney firmly asserted Canada's independence, stating that it is not for sale, and the meeting concluded with both leaders expressing a commitment to friendship.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to President Trump's tariffs, which have significantly increased the cost of importing bikes and bike parts.

The company has canceled new orders from China and finds fully manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. to be financially untenable.

In 2023, IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to switch over to the technology, which could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia.</p>

In recent years, the statue has become a regular target for demonstrators. The statue was infamously sprayed with red paint and adorned with a green turf Mohican during May Day protests in 2000, for which the perpetrator received a 30-day jail sentence.</p>

Despite the efforts, the city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk lost an appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property.

          <p>Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has launched a series of strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian defence ministry said the strikes - named "Operation Sindoor" - were part of a "commitment" to hold those responsible for the 22 April attack which left 25 Indians and one Nepali national dead "accountable". But Pakistan, which has denied any involvement in last month's attack, has described the strikes as "unprovoked", with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the "heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished". Delhi said in the early hours of Wednesday morning that nine different locations had been targeted in both Pakistan-administered Kashmir and Pakistan.</p>
