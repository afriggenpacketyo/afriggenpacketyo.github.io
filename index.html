          <p>Kim Kardashian testified in a Paris court concerning the 2016 armed robbery where $10 million in jewelry was stolen. Kardashian recounted being bound and gagged at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week, detailing the trauma she experienced when masked men broke into her residence. Her friend Simone Harouche testified earlier, recalling Kardashian's pleas for her life during the incident. The trial involves ten individuals accused of robbery and kidnapping, with some admitting involvement and expressing regret, while Kardashian's lawyers emphasize her respect for the French judicial system and her desire for an orderly trial, and the defense worries about the impact of her celebrity on the case. </p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" in a speech outlining plans to cut immigration, rejecting accusations of divisive language. Starmer aimed to highlight the impact of rising migration and the need for integration, including English language tests. Cooper dismissed comparisons to Enoch Powell's rhetoric, emphasizing Starmer's acknowledgment of the UK's diverse strengths. Robert Jenrick, Conservative shadow justice secretary, supported Starmer's sentiment, while others, like Sadiq Khan, expressed discomfort with the phrasing. </p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car fire. The first fire occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, followed by a fire at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, north London. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to the previous connections of the property with a high-profile public figure, and are treating the fires as suspicious. The car fire, which took place on the same street as the Kentish Town property, is also being investigated as part of the inquiry. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ever-changing tariff policies, shopping expert Trae Bodge recommends consumers look for sales events like Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day to secure discounted prices. She also advises checking the origin of products, as goods from Canada and Mexico might be subject to tariffs, but goods under the USMCA are exempt if primarily made in North America. Shoppers should consider purchasing domestic products to avoid price hikes on imported produce and prioritize planned purchases of big-ticket items like dishwashers or laptops before further price increases. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs, so consumers should be strategic rather than panic shopping. </p>

The move aims to simplify the name and distance the updated model from its predecessor, which received poor reviews and faced a recall due to wheel detachment issues. The 2026 bZ will feature a 25% increase in EV range, up to a 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities, addressing previous concerns.

          <p>The article explores whether attending stadium concerts with massive crowds provides a fulfilling experience for fans, or if the inconveniences outweigh the benefits. Social media fuels the fear of missing out, driving Gen Z to spend impulsively on live events, despite the high costs and potential for lackluster views or chaotic VIP sections. Stadium tours are lucrative for artists and offer a sense of community, but often lack optimal acoustics and can be physically demanding. Complaints about obstructed views, crowd crushes, and high prices raise questions about the future of concertgoing and whether the stadium tour bubble will burst. </p>

SoftBank's finance chief acknowledged potential obstacles from other stakeholders but remains optimistic that the reorganization will proceed by the end of the year. The original plan to remove the non-profit's control drew criticism, including from Elon Musk, so the restructure is an attempt to balance investor interests with ethical concerns. </p>

The author explores the role of personal passion in finding meaningful work and how moral ambition differs from effective altruism. It emphasizes that moral ambition should not dominate one's life, and it's important to maintain a grounded perspective and surround oneself with critical thinkers. </p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a bill that would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, marking the third time such proposals have been considered. The legislation would allow patients with a terminal illness and mental capacity to request medical assistance to end their lives, subject to approval by two doctors. The vote is expected to be close, with MSPs holding a free vote. Supporters say the bill would ease suffering, while opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals. </p>

The mutually beneficial trade relationship was disrupted by high tariffs, leading to price hikes and potential shortages, which weakened Trump's negotiating position.
