          <p>Award-winning rapper Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill, was arrested in Los Angeles following an altercation with police. Officers responded to reports of a man in his underwear on Ventura Boulevard, and allege the singer "charged" at them, leading to his arrest on suspicion of battery. He was then transported to a local hospital for treatment for a possible overdose. This event comes as the artist prepares to release his much-anticipated second studio album, "Dreamboy," later this year. His career has often courted controversy, notably for his hit single "Montero (Call Me By Your Name)," while also breaking barriers as the first openly gay man to receive a Country Music Association award.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed component suppliers to cease production of its China-specific H20 general processing units, following reports of a Chinese government crackdown on purchases due to alleged security concerns. This development casts doubt on the chip's return to the Chinese market, despite previous U.S. export license approvals. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged Beijing's queries about security "backdoors," asserting their absence and expressing hope for a swift resolution. The ongoing scrutiny highlights the significant challenges Nvidia faces navigating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, impacting its operations in a crucial market and potentially bolstering China's drive for domestic chip independence.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:08:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after moving abroad, expecting to save £350 million over five years. A new specialist team will utilize travel data to identify claimants residing outside the UK for more than eight weeks, making them ineligible under standard rules. This initiative follows a successful pilot program that stopped £17 million in incorrect payments to 2,600 people. The government plans to expand these efforts to other benefits claimed overseas, aiming to tackle rising benefit overpayments, which reached an estimated £6.5 billion in fraud during 2024/25.</p>

          <p>The UK's third-largest steelworks, Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), a division of Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel empire, has entered government control after insolvency courts granted a compulsory winding-up order. Creditors, owed hundreds of millions, sought the order, with the judge deeming SSUK "hopelessly insolvent." This decision places the company in the hands of the official receiver, impacting nearly 1,500 workers in Rotherham and Sheffield. The government has pledged to cover operational costs and wages while a buyer is sought, emphasizing the strategic importance of maintaining UK steel production for national security, including nuclear submarines.</p>

          <h2>Aid Workers Allege NGOs are 'Whitewashing' Gaza War Due to Israeli Registration Demands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aid workers from various international organizations accuse their leadership of "whitewashing" the situation in Gaza by toning down criticism of Israel's war. This alleged self-censorship stems from a new Israeli registration process requiring NGOs to provide sensitive data, including Palestinian staff information, by September 2025. Workers report internal directives to avoid terms like "occupation" or "accountability," fearing permit denials. The controversy highlights a dilemma for NGOs: speak out and risk losing access, or restrict language to maintain operations. Critics argue this process aims to silence independent observers and impede impartial aid delivery.</p>

          <p>Millions of people across the UK are preparing for significant travel disruption this bank holiday weekend, stemming from a combination of rail strikes, extensive engineering works, and anticipated heavy road traffic. The RMT union's industrial action will lead to major cancellations and alterations on the CrossCountry rail network, with no direct services on Saturday. Network Rail strongly advises all passengers to verify their travel plans before departing. Concurrently, the RAC warns of approximately three million getaway journeys, forecasting particularly severe congestion on routes like the M5. Despite these travel challenges, the weather outlook for central and southern England is largely warm and dry.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Friday as investors awaited U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the central bank's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined after reaching a record high, and mainland China and Hong Kong indices showed modest increases. Overnight, U.S. stocks broadly fell, with Fed funds futures pricing in a high likelihood of a September rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, initially a Category 5 and currently a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward away from the North Carolina coast, though it continues to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the U.S. East Coast. Evacuation orders were issued for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks, and a tropical storm warning remains for Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center cautioned against swimming at most East Coast beaches, with dangerous conditions expected to persist for days. Erin is forecast to become post-tropical on Saturday, but its large system size means its effects are still widely felt.</p>

          <p>European leaders' unified presence at the White House to support Ukraine is seen as a positive, yet a fair peace remains a distant dream, according to this article. This show of unity aimed to overshadow the earlier, unproductive Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska. While Ukrainians are cautiously satisfied by the visible support, they acknowledge that Russia has made no concessions and Putin is unlikely to meet President Zelenskyy. The article highlights the ongoing challenge of achieving a just peace, defined as the liberation of Russian-occupied territories, amidst persistent Russian aggression and uncertain diplomatic pathways.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study has revealed that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing linalool, a gas that prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. This newly discovered mechanism offers crucial insights into how corn adapts to its environment and defends against pests. Researchers found that densely planted corn in inner rows experienced less herbivore damage but also exhibited reduced growth, suggesting complex interactions. Optimizing the release of this gas could potentially lead to improved pest control strategies and increased crop yields, marking a significant advancement in agricultural science and plant communication understanding.</p>

          <p>Colombia is facing its most severe security crisis in decades following two separate deadly attacks that killed at least 18 people and injured dozens. A car bomb exploded in Cali, killing six and wounding over 60, while a drone attack on a police helicopter near Medellin killed 12 officers. Authorities attribute both incidents to dissident factions of the defunct FARC group, posing significant challenges to ongoing peace processes. President Gustavo Petro and the military leadership announced a security council meeting to define additional protection measures, vowing to pursue and punish those responsible for these "terrorist attacks."</p>

          <p>Court filings reveal Elon Musk approached Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in early 2025 to help finance a $97.4 billion bid to acquire OpenAI. This request is part of an ongoing legal battle between Musk and OpenAI, which he co-founded. Musk, who later launched xAI as a competitor, was reportedly incensed by OpenAI's transition to a for-profit entity. OpenAI, in its counter claims, alleges Musk's "sham bid" harmed its business and accused him of harassment. Neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent, as Meta is heavily investing in its own AI capabilities and attempting to poach OpenAI employees.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company X (formerly Twitter) have reached a tentative settlement with former employees who sued for $500 million in severance pay. The agreement, reported in a court filing, aims to resolve claims from approximately 6,000 staff members who were laid off after Musk's 2022 takeover and allegedly denied promised benefits. The lawsuit contended that many received at most one month's severance, or nothing at all, instead of the stipulated six months' worth of salaries. Details of the settlement are not yet public but await court approval, marking a step towards resolving the mass layoff dispute.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has immediately halted the issuance of worker visas for commercial truck drivers, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced. This decision stems from concerns that an increasing number of foreign drivers pose risks to American lives and undercut the livelihoods of U.S. truckers. The State Department confirmed a comprehensive review of screening and vetting protocols for visa qualifications. The Trump administration has also emphasized English proficiency requirements for safety reasons. This move comes amidst a reported shortage of about 60,000 truck drivers in the U.S. and a broader review of all U.S. visa holders for potential deportation violations.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March but still exceeding economists' expectations of 3%. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, the 40th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. A notable factor was the easing of rice inflation to 90.7% after two months of prices more than doubling. Despite the slight cooling, experts like Jesper Koll argue the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates, suggesting policy rates need to climb higher to reach a neutral level.
