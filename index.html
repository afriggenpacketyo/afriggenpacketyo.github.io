          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan has confirmed he will attend the upcoming peace ceremony in Nagasaki, marking the 80th anniversary of the 1945 atomic bombing. This decision follows last year's event, from which Israel was not invited due to the conflict in Gaza, prompting a boycott from other G7 ambassadors. The city of Nagasaki has adopted a more inclusive approach for this year's ceremony, extending invitations to all diplomatic missions in Japan. Russia's ambassador is also expected to attend for the first time since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, signaling a shift in diplomatic participation.</p>

          <p>Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have resulted in at least 60 Palestinian fatalities over a 24-hour period, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory. The attacks occurred as U.S. President Trump expressed optimism about a potential ceasefire agreement with Hamas being reached within the next week. Negotiations have been ongoing, with a recent proposal involving the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners, though Hamas has requested amendments. The conflict, now in its 21st month, has created a catastrophic humanitarian crisis and resulted in over 56,000 Palestinian deaths.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated new phishing scam is targeting individuals by using PayPal's own system to send legitimate-looking emails, making them difficult to detect. Scammers exploit features like "add address" or "money request" to trigger official alerts from the service@paypal.com domain, which bypasses spam filters. These emails often create a sense of panic by claiming unauthorized account activity and provide a phone number to a fake support line. Once contacted, the scammers attempt to trick victims into downloading remote access software, giving them full control of the user's device and sensitive information.</p>

          <p>British authorities have successfully intercepted one of the country's largest drug shipments in years, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The drugs, with an estimated street value of $132 million, were discovered hidden under containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The seizure was the result of an intelligence-led operation involving the UK Border Force. This bust highlights the ongoing efforts to combat large-scale drug trafficking into Britain, which is considered one of Europe's largest markets for cocaine, amid rising cocaine-related deaths in the region.</p>

          <p>President Trump is concluding a highly successful week marked by significant achievements both domestically and internationally. Key victories include brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after a successful U.S. strike, securing a commitment from NATO allies to increase defense spending, and a major Supreme Court ruling that curtails the power of lower courts to block his executive orders nationwide. The week was capped by a peace deal signed between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which also secured U.S. access to critical mineral rights.

          <p>Americans may see significant relief at the pump this summer, with one petroleum analyst forecasting the cheapest fuel prices since 2021. The national average price for a gallon of gasoline is projected to continue a slow decline, potentially dropping below $3 by September. While a recent spike was attributed to the conflict in the Middle East, the situation's de-escalation is expected to allow prices to fall again. Factors contributing to the decrease include stabilized production costs and increased oil supply from OPEC+ nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite claiming a significant military victory over Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not seen a major boost in public approval, according to recent polling. Many Israelis remain critical of his leadership, particularly concerning the ongoing war in Gaza, with 59% wanting the conflict to end in exchange for hostages. The polls also suggest that nearly half of Israelis believe Netanyahu is prolonging the war for his own political survival. His low trust ratings and an upcoming trial on corruption charges present significant obstacles, complicating any potential plans for calling early elections.</p>

Despite the government's stance, the march received support from EU officials and the liberal mayor of Budapest, who co-organized the event to grant it municipal protection.

          <p>Through a series of intense military actions against Iran and its proxies, Israel has significantly reasserted its dominance and reshaped the strategic landscape of the Middle East. Following the initial Hamas attack in 2023, Israel has systematically degraded the capabilities of Hamas, Hezbollah, and most recently, Iran's nuclear and military facilities. This has effectively decimated Iran's "axis of resistance," altering the regional balance of power. However, while Israel's military strength is clear, these successes have not resolved underlying political issues, particularly the Palestinian conflict, and have tarnished Israel's international reputation due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Despite earning nearly $49 million during his NFL career, legendary quarterback Steve Young continues to drive a 2011 Toyota Sienna with 132,000 miles on it. He attributes this frugal habit to his father's advice to "get the most out of it," a principle he has taken to heart. The article notes that this behavior is not uncommon among the wealthy, with many millionaires preferring modest, reliable cars over flashy luxury vehicles. This contrasts with the growing trend of average consumers taking on significant auto loan debt, highlighting a potential lesson in financial prudence and avoiding lifestyle inflation.</p>

          <p>Renowned Chinese-American mathematician Yitang Zhang has left his professorship at the University of California, Santa Barbara, to take a full-time position at Sun Yat-sen University in China. Zhang is celebrated for his 2013 breakthrough on the twin prime conjecture, a major unsolved problem in number theory. His career is notable for its perseverance; after earning his PhD from Purdue in 1991, he struggled for years to find an academic job, working in various roles and even living in his car at one point. His move represents a significant talent acquisition for China's academic institutions.</p>

          <p>British sportscar manufacturer Lotus has issued a statement confirming it has "no plans to close any factory," following reports that it was considering ending production at its UK headquarters in Hethel. The speculation arose after it was revealed the company is exploring options for a new plant in the United States, which put 1,300 jobs at its Norfolk facility at potential risk. The company acknowledged it is actively exploring global market options but reiterated its commitment to its UK operations and British heritage. The move is partly influenced by US tariffs on imported cars, a significant market for Lotus.</p>

          <p>As record heatwaves affect the U.S., child safety advocates are issuing urgent warnings about the dangers of leaving children unattended in vehicles. So far this year, nine children have died from heatstroke in hot cars, with five of those deaths occurring in June. A car's interior can heat up by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes, and a child's body temperature can rise three to five times faster than an adult's, making them extremely vulnerable. Experts stress that such tragedies can happen to anyone due to distractions and urge caregivers to create reminders, like leaving a personal item in the backseat.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that federal courts do not have the authority to issue nationwide injunctions, which block government policies from applying to anyone in the country. The ruling, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett in a case concerning a Trump administration birthright citizenship order, fundamentally changes judicial practice. Barrett argued the practice was a modern invention with no historical basis.

          <p>Advocates argue the Trump administration is employing a "divide and conquer" strategy by focusing its anti-LGBTQ policies primarily on the transgender community. This approach is evident in executive orders restricting gender markers on passports, banning certain books from military schools, and eliminating DEI initiatives, all of which disproportionately affect transgender individuals. Critics say this tactic aims to weaken the broader LGBTQ coalition by suggesting that only one part of the community is being targeted. While some gay conservatives support the administration, rights groups warn that these policies create a hostile environment and signal a desire to roll back rights for all.</p>
