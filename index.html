          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen and Tufts University student, was released from federal custody after a federal judge ordered her immediate release, marking the end of a six-week ordeal that sparked outrage over immigration policies. Ozturk, whose student visa was canceled amid the Trump administration's crackdown on higher education, was arrested in March and accused of supporting Hamas due to an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Judge William K. Sessions III stated that her detention could chill free speech and that the government lacked sufficient evidence against her. Despite her release, deportation proceedings are expected to continue in immigration court.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has suggested holding "direct talks" with Ukraine starting on May 15th to address the conflict's root causes and work toward a lasting peace. This announcement followed a visit by European leaders, including the UK Prime Minister and French President, to Ukraine, where they urged Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. While the Kremlin initially responded cautiously to the ceasefire proposal, Putin's call for direct talks signals a potential shift in diplomatic engagement amidst ongoing international pressure.</p>

          <p>Livestock farmer David Thornley is planning legal action against East Midlands Airport, alleging that a leaking pipe polluted Diseworth Brook, resulting in the loss of 25 valuable pedigree lambs in 2022. Thornley noticed a foul smell and brown substance in the brook, later finding "black sludge" from an airport outlet pipe, after a high percentage of his ewes ceased carrying lambs. While the airport acknowledged a small leak, they deny any link between the discharge and bacterial pollution in the brook. The Environment Agency is pursuing charges against the airport for discharging contaminated wastewater into the River Trent, but Thornley's specific claims were not included in the case.</p>

Trump suggested he might lower tariffs to 80%, while Chinese officials have stated they are open to negotiation if the U.S. drops its "unilateral" tariffs first.</p>

          <p>China's strategy in the trade war with the U.S. involves imposing export controls on rare earth elements, essential for manufacturing military equipment and space technology. As the world's largest producer and consumer of these elements, China's restrictions have stirred anxiety in the US defense industry. These export controls, effective since April, are in retaliation for the Trump administration's increased tariffs on Chinese goods, leading to potential disruptions in the supply chain for critical components used in jet engines, radar, avionics, and other electronic systems.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott suffered a fractured jaw following what manager Andoni Iraola described as a "very violent" elbow by Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings during a Premier League match. Scott went down early in the game after the incident with Mings, and after another collision, was replaced at halftime. While Aston Villa's Jacob Ramsey received a second yellow card, Mings did not receive any caution for the elbow, which Iraola considered dangerous and potentially season-ending for Scott.</p>
