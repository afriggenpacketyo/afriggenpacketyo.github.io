          <p>This article provides a comprehensive guide for consumers regarding business operations on the July 4th holiday. While essential services like banks and post offices will be closed, and the stock market will not be trading, many retail and grocery stores are set to remain open. Major retailers such as Walmart will operate on a normal schedule, whereas others like Costco will be closed for the day. Many other establishments, including Trader Joe's, Home Depot, and various fast-food chains, will have modified or limited hours. Consumers are advised to check the specific hours for their local stores before heading out for any last-minute holiday needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations report by Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese has generated significant backlash for its strong criticisms of Israel and its call for sanctions and boycotts. Critics, including NGO Monitor, contend that Albanese has overstepped her mandate, potentially giving the impression of UN support for the BDS movement. In response, the UN Human Rights office clarified that special rapporteurs are independent experts whose views do not officially represent the United Nations. The report has nonetheless been condemned by Israeli and U.S. officials, who have accused the author of a pattern of antisemitism and of distorting international law to pressure companies operating in the region.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has publicly refuted claims of torture and abuse made by Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported from the U.S. and held in the country's CECOT supermax prison. Abrego Garcia alleged in a legal filing that he endured severe beatings and psychological torture, including being forced to kneel all night in an overcrowded, brightly lit cell. President Bukele responded on social media with photos and videos, claiming Abrego Garcia appeared well and was not starved or tortured. This dispute occurs within the context of Bukele's widespread crackdown on gangs, which has led to mass incarcerations and accusations of human rights violations from various groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to host an Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event on the White House lawn as part of the nation's 250th birthday celebrations in 2026. During a rally in Iowa, Trump stated that UFC President Dana White, a friend and supporter, would organize the fight, which could accommodate up to 25,000 spectators. The White House press secretary confirmed the president was serious about the plan. This proposed event is one of many special activities planned for the America250 celebration, which will culminate on July 4, 2026, with a large festival on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, England staged a remarkable recovery led by Jamie Smith's incredible unbeaten 184 and Harry Brook's 158. The pair formed a massive 303-run partnership for the sixth wicket after England had collapsed to 85-5 early on the third day. Their efforts propelled England to a total of 407. However, India's bowlers, particularly Mohammed Siraj who took six wickets, fought back to dismiss the lower order quickly. This gave India a substantial first-innings lead of 180, and they extended their overall advantage to 244 by the close of play, leaving them in a dominant position heading into the final two days.</p>

          <p>A multi-story residential building collapsed in Lyari, a densely populated neighborhood in Karachi, Pakistan, resulting in several deaths and injuries. Rescue operations are ongoing, though they are hampered by narrow streets that prevent heavy machinery from accessing the site.

The building was reportedly home to as many as 100 people.

          <p>Members of the UK's House of Lords have forcefully called on the government to address the issue of prisoners held under the abolished Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentences. These open-ended jail terms were scrapped in 2012, but the change was not retroactive, leaving over 2,500 individuals incarcerated indefinitely without a resentencing process. Peers described the situation as a "no hope" sentence and an "industrial-scale miscarriage of justice," highlighting cases where individuals have served over a decade beyond their original minimum tariff for relatively minor crimes. Despite the pressure, the prisons minister maintained the government's focus on public protection and its existing action plan, rather than committing to a full resentencing initiative.</p>

The performance was notable as both McLaren and Red Bull introduced upgrades for the Silverstone race. Hamilton, who has a record nine wins at his home race, stated he feels more comfortable with the car and believes he can dream of a strong weekend, though he acknowledged the challenge of potential rain on Saturday and Sunday.</p>

          <p>The prospect of a new left-wing political party in the UK is gaining attention after MP Zarah Sultana announced she was leaving Labour to launch a new movement with former leader Jeremy Corbyn. While Corbyn expressed support, he indicated that discussions are still ongoing and the foundations are not yet set. Polling suggests such a party could capture around 10% of the vote, primarily drawing support from the Green Party and young voters, potentially impacting Labour's standing. While some key figures from Corbyn's past leadership have stated they will remain with Labour, the move reflects a perceived gap to the left of Keir Starmer's current platform.</p>

The government moved to ban the group following activism that caused an estimated £7 million in damages. Lawyers for Palestine Action argued the ban was an "authoritarian abuse" of power against a civil disobedience group, but the judge ruled the public interest in the order outweighed potential harm.</p>

He also advises against sugary cereals, drinks, and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical experts explain the significant physiological toll that competitive eating contests, like the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, take on the human body. The stomach of a trained eater can expand massively, potentially leading to permanent stretching and impaired gastric emptying. Ingesting dozens of hot dogs and buns in minutes introduces an extreme load of calories, fat, and sodium, which can spike blood pressure, strain the kidneys, and cause severe gastrointestinal distress. While the long-term health consequences are not well-studied, immediate risks include choking, esophageal tears from vomiting, and potential cardiac events due to the sudden systemic stress.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 52,500 acres, making it the largest blaze in the state so far this year. The fire originated in the Los Padres National Forest and has since spread, prompting evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. With the fire currently at 10% containment, state and federal agencies have deployed a major response, including air tankers, helicopters, and hundreds of ground personnel. Officials have warned that the current weather and fuel conditions contributed to the fire's exponential growth, serving as a stark reminder of wildfire dangers approaching the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has been widely condemned by Jewish advocacy groups for using the antisemitic slur "Shylocks" during a speech in Iowa. While discussing tax changes in his new spending bill, Trump used the term, which originates from a villainous Jewish character in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," to describe certain bankers. The Anti-Defamation League called the language "extremely offensive and dangerous," and other groups noted it perpetuates harmful stereotypes. When questioned, the president claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations. This incident follows a similar controversy in 2014 when then-Vice President Joe Biden used the same term and later apologized.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have filed a complaint alleging that scammers impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee to steal over $250,000 in cryptocurrency from donors. According to the filing, the perpetrators used fraudulent email addresses, cleverly designed to mimic the official committee's domain, to trick a victim into sending funds. The emails, purportedly from committee co-chair Steve Witkoff, solicited donations that were sent as USDT stablecoin. The U.S. government is now seeking to seize a portion of the stolen funds that were recovered from a Binance cryptocurrency exchange account traced to an individual in Nigeria.</p>

Zelenskyy described his conversation with Trump as "important and useful," focusing on Ukraine's air defense needs, especially after the U.S. paused critical weapons shipments.

The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami, the Florida Aquarium, and Tela Coral, involves crossbreeding resilient Elkhorn corals from the warmer waters of Honduras with local Florida corals. The goal is to create a more thermally tolerant coral population capable of surviving rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time international crossbreeding of corals has been permitted for restoration on wild reefs, offering a potential blueprint for reef conservation across the Caribbean.</p>

While the defense industry, including major contractor Rheinmetall, is experiencing a surge in orders and stock value, some studies suggest the overall economic stimulus will be moderate. Research indicates that for every euro of government spending on defense, the economy may only see a 50-cent return, far less than investments in infrastructure or education. Critics warn that the spending spree could primarily inflate arms companies' profits rather than significantly boosting Germany's defense capabilities or overall GDP. (not investment advice)</p>
