          <p>One year after being convicted of falsifying business records related to a hush money scheme, Donald Trump is continuing his legal fight. A federal appeals court is set to hear oral arguments regarding moving the case from state to federal court, a move opposed by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump's lawyers argue the case belongs in federal court due to the unprecedented nature of prosecuting a former and current president, claiming his conviction relied on evidence related to his official acts as president. Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing, characterizing the prosecutors as politically motivated and touting his electoral victory as a political acquittal.</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Dallas, won the Scripps National Spelling Bee after finishing as runner-up the previous year. Zaki nearly jeopardized his chances with an incorrect start to spelling "commelina," but he recovered to spell the winning word, "eclaircissement." The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and the finals featured a high level of competition, with several spellers achieving perfect rounds. Faizan is the fifth runner-up in a century to come back and win the bee, increasing his total earnings from the competition to $77,500, and he plans to donate a large portion of his winnings to charity.</p>

          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered safeguard, referred to as a "diamond ring," to prevent catastrophic collapses. The device, designed by a team from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, uses nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors to detect grid instability in real time. This initiative follows incidents in Europe and China where grid oscillations and renewable energy fluctuations caused widespread outages. The "diamond ring" acts as a high-precision sentinel for power lines, addressing the challenges posed by the increasing reliance on weather-dependent renewable energy sources.</p>

Miao previously headed the CMC's political work department, responsible for ideological control and personnel management within the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army.

          <p>A U.S. foreign tax bill, known as Section 899, is causing concern on Wall Street as investment banks and law firms warn it could weaponize the American tax system. The bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives, includes significant changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. The legislation targets entities from "discriminatory foreign countries" that impose levies disproportionately affecting U.S. companies, such as digital services taxes. Deutsche Bank's global head of FX research suggests this bill could transform a trade war into a capital war, challenging the open nature of U.S. capital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion columnist argues that Elon Musk's tenure overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has resulted in significant harm, particularly through the decimation of U.S.A.I.D. grants. The columnist cites estimates that these cuts have already led to approximately 300,000 deaths, primarily among children, and anticipates further fatalities by year's end. Despite White House denials, reports from the field indicate a major increase in patients with advanced H.I.V. symptoms due to loss of access to antiretroviral medication and severe malnutrition in refugee camps due to food aid cuts. Musk is leaving his role, disillusioned with Washington, but his impact on U.S.A.I.D. has been devastating, according to the author.</p>

          <p>Proposed Medicaid cuts could lead to more children taking on unpaid caregiving roles for adults with disabilities or chronic conditions. Researchers estimate that at least 5.4 million U.S. children already provide care to an adult in their home, and that number is expected to rise if Medicaid funding is reduced. Studies show that young caregivers often experience declines in their health and academic outcomes, while their loved ones receive untrained care. Some schools are taking notice and implementing policies to support caregiving students, recognizing the challenges they face in balancing school and family responsibilities.</p>

The author suggests that emotional and relational struggles, once considered unavoidable, are now viewed as forms of harm. This shift has led to a new, nearly impossible standard for parenting, where children expect parents to ensure their mental health and happiness well into adulthood. The essay posits that this cultural shift, along with other factors like financial concerns and climate change, contributes to the rising rate of childlessness among millennials.</p>

          <p>New AI tools are enabling individuals without formal software training to write software through a process called "vibe coding." Chloe Samaha, co-founder of BOND, created a functional online productivity manager and website in less than a day using AI chatbots. This approach is lowering the barrier to entry for software development and opening up possibilities for creators, though it also raises questions about the future of software engineering. While some experts predict AI coders will eventually replace human coders, others believe AI will augment developers' capabilities, allowing them to explore more ideas and automate simple tasks.</p>

          <p>Andrew and Tristan Tate have been charged in Britain with sexual assault and other crimes, with charges authorized in January of last year. Andrew Tate faces 10 charges related to three women, including sexual assault, actual bodily harm, human trafficking, and controlling prostitution for gain, while Tristan Tate faces 11 charges related to one woman, including sexual assault, human trafficking, and actual bodily harm. The brothers, who were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges of participating in a criminal ring that allegedly sexually exploited women, have denied all allegations. The Tates briefly returned to the U.S. earlier this year, but have since returned to Romania, and Romanian courts have issued an order to extradite them to the U.K. once their court case is concluded there.</p>

          <p>Gold prices edged lower as traders positioned themselves ahead of the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserveâ€™s preferred measure of inflation. Technical dynamics also contributed to the pullback, as the price action in gold twice failed to break above the key near-term resistance level of $3,328. The precious metalâ€™s haven appeal was boosted by renewed uncertainty over Donald Trumpâ€™s trade agenda, after a US federal appeals court temporarily reinstated tariffs introduced by Trump. Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its view that bullion remains a key inflation hedge for long-term portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase rice exports in response to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production in its annual white paper on food and agriculture. China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have been identified as target markets for exports. The government aims to boost rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030, focusing on sales at Japanese restaurants and stores abroad, and also seeks to reduce production costs to better compete with foreign-grown rice.</p>

Fernandes' representatives are said to have met with Al-Hilal officials for discussions about a move that would allow him to take part in the forthcoming Club World Cup. While Fernandes has remained focused and continues to take his responsibilities as captain seriously, he has offered no guarantees about his future, which has led to some thinking he is ready to leave. Manchester United are said to be relaxed about the situation, knowing a rumored Â£80m transfer fee might be the best way of being able to reshape their squad.</p>

          <p>Despite record levels of global tourism, bigotry, prejudice, and narrow-mindedness remain prevalent, according to a columnist. The piece challenges Mark Twain's assertion that travel is fatal to prejudice, citing rising nationalism, opposition to immigration, and protectionism as evidence to the contrary. The author argues that many international tourists are poor ambassadors against prejudice, often failing to notice or acknowledge poverty and inequality in the places they visit. This suggests that increased travel alone is insufficient to foster greater understanding and tolerance.</p>

          <p>Alpine communities in Switzerland's LÃ¶tschental valley have been asked to prepare for evacuation following a massive landslide caused by the collapse of the Birch Glacier. The collapse sent millions of cubic meters of ice, mud, and rock into the valley, blocking the River Lonza and causing a lake to form, which has heightened fears of further impacts downstream. Authorities have suspended the search for a 64-year-old man who has been missing since the collapse, as conditions remain too dangerous with warnings of additional rockfalls.

Trump criticized the judges behind the ruling and suggested it was made because they hate him, then turned his attention to Leo and the Federalist Society. Despite relying on the Federalist Society for judicial recommendations during his first term, Trump now claims they gave him bad advice on numerous judicial nominations. Trump's attacks are notable due to his long-standing alliance with Leo and the Federalist Society, which played a key role in shaping the conservative composition of the Supreme Court.</p>

The hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," was blamed for dive-bombing attacks on about 50 people, with one man requiring hospital treatment. Falconer Wayne Housden, who captured and trained the hawk, said the bird has "calmed right down" and is likely a captive-bred bird that lost its owner. Housden plans to keep the hawk full-time and hopes to let it fly loose in the autumn, after building a aviary for the bird.</p>
