        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from two toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, to expedite their challenge to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese products. The companies argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the president to impose these tariffs. The court's decision means the Trump administration has the standard 30-day period to respond to the challenge, delaying any potential resolution. The companies sought to bypass a federal appeals court due to the tariffs' significant impact on businesses and consumers, but the Supreme Court's ruling means the case will proceed through the regular legal channels. The author's tone is relatively neutral, reflecting the factual nature of the court's decision and its implications for the companies involved.</p>

          <p>Tesla is preparing to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with initial rides expected to begin on June 22. The initial rollout will feature a limited number of Model Y vehicles operating within a geofenced area, monitored by remote drivers as a backup. Elon Musk has stated that the robotaxis will operate in the safest parts of Austin and will be closely watched from remote operations centers. Analysts believe that robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, potentially reaching over $2 trillion, though setbacks are expected during the rollout. The tone of the article is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging the potential of robotaxis while also recognizing the challenges and the need for careful implementation.</p>

          <p>President Trump and the Justice Department have requested a delay in oral arguments for his appeal of the $83 million defamation case filed by E. Jean Carroll. Trump is appealing the 2024 verdict that ordered him to pay Carroll for defaming her in 2019 when he denied her sexual assault accusation. The request for delay comes after a three-judge panel rejected Trump's attempt to have the government substitute for him as a party in the case, with his attorneys now seeking to appeal that decision before oral arguments take place. The Justice Department argues that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within the scope of his role as president, justifying their defense in court.</p>

The 57-year-old Serbian basketball legend now has an artificial hip after the procedure, according to a hospital spokesperson. Divac, who was drafted by the Lakers in 1989, became a fan favorite during his seven seasons with the team before being traded to the Charlotte Hornets. He later played for the Sacramento Kings, where he had his No. 21 jersey retired, and was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the projected monthly payments for a $100,000 annuity if purchased at age 65, noting that retirement planning in 2025 requires dependable sources of income. According to an analysis of Cannex data, a 65-year-old male can expect about $652 per month, while a 65-year-old female can expect about $627 per month. These figures depend on factors such as gender, the interest rate environment, the type of annuity, payout structure, and optional features. The article concludes that a $100,000 annuity won't replace a full salary in retirement, but it can offer meaningful supplemental income, especially when paired with Social Security and other savings.

          <p>President Vladimir Putin stated that Russians and Ukrainians are one people, implying that "the whole of Ukraine is ours," and suggested Russia may take control of the Ukrainian city of Sumy. Speaking at an international economic forum in St Petersburg, Putin said Russia has never doubted Ukraine's right to sovereignty, but noted Ukraine declared its independence in 1991 as a "neutral state." He added that Russian forces were creating a buffer zone in Ukraine's Sumy region to protect Russian territory. Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected Moscow's claims to Ukrainian regions and Crimea as illegal.</p>

          <h2>FDA Proposes Plan to Expedite Some Drug Reviews</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 12:04:03 EDT</div>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan to expedite drug reviews for companies supporting "U.S. national interests." The plan aims to reduce drug review times to one-to-two months, significantly faster than the current 10-month deadline. The FDA plans to give a limited number of vouchers to companies aligned with "national health priorities," including addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. The Trump administration encourages pharmaceutical companies to reshore drug manufacturing through executive orders and potential tariffs on imported medicines.</p>
