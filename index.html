            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to form a task force to change the CDC's guidance, potentially halting recommendations for adding fluoride to public water. This follows Utah's recent ban on fluoride in drinking water systems. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the EPA is also reviewing fluoride science, citing a report linking higher fluoride levels to lower IQ in children. The American Dental Association opposes these changes, asserting fluoride's necessity for oral health and denying negative IQ impacts at recommended levels.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to impose an additional 50% tariff on imports from China if it does not withdraw its retaliatory 34% import fee on American products. This escalates the ongoing trade war between the two nations. If implemented, U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports would reach a combined 104%. Economists warn that the conflict could negatively impact economic growth and potentially trigger a recession. Trump also plans to begin negotiations with other nations immediately.</p>

            <p>Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has raised concerns that President Trump’s decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok’s US assets may violate the law. Warner also stated that the reported likely deal under consideration would not meet legal requirements for eliminating ByteDance’s influence over TikTok’s US operations under a 2024 law. The deal would spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new company based in the US and majority-owned and operated by US investors.</p>

            <p>This article discusses the potential impact of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, arguing that time may not be on his side. The author notes that Trump's imposition of reciprocal tariffs caught financial markets off guard despite his campaign promises. From Trump’s perspective, these actions are necessary to pull the US back from the precipice of decline.

            <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to resume deportations of migrants claimed to be members of a Venezuelan gang, under a wartime authority. The Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is "improper" in the District of Columbia. Going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law "must receive notice" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.</p>
