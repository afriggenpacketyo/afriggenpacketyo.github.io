          <p>President Trump intensified his attacks on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, blaming him for not lowering interest rates and potentially causing an economic slowdown. This criticism, coupled with Trump's tariff policies, has contributed to significant market volatility, with US stocks and the dollar experiencing declines. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets like gold, which has reached record highs, as geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty persist. The IMF and World Bank are meeting to discuss these economic challenges, with concerns rising about a potential US downturn impacting the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese solar manufacturers are exploring factory options in other regions to circumvent US tariffs on solar cell imports from Southeast Asia. The US Department of Commerce finalized steep tariffs on solar cells and modules from Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, impacting Chinese firms that had transferred production capacity to these countries. The erratic tariff policies of the Trump administration have added uncertainty to long-term investment plans. Southeast Asia had become a major destination for Chinese solar firms attempting to bypass US tariffs on direct imports from China.</p>

          <p>Despite oscillating opinions on the effectiveness of protests, they remain crucial for building morale and long-term movement power. While protests rarely lead to immediate policy changes, they serve as morale boosters and allow citizens to experience each other's presence and commitment. The recent large and diverse crowds at protests demonstrate that resistance is alive and well, even in the face of a defeatist elite stance. The key is to stay engaged and build on the connections made during spontaneous encounters at protests to create lasting change.</p>

          <p>The deportation of two German teenagers from Hawaii highlights the increasing authoritarianism in the US, making travel there a moral dilemma. Marco Rubio's statement suggests that anyone who doesn't align with the administration's politics may face issues at the border. This creates a situation where visiting the US for leisure becomes questionable, especially given reports of people being deported without due process. As a result, alternative destinations like Canada, with its vastness and affordability, are becoming more appealing.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice as part of negotiations over higher levies imposed by Washington.

Japan currently imports approximately 770,000 tons globally every year tariff-free. This move comes as President Trump's trade policies continue to create uncertainty in global markets.</p>

          <p>Home battery technology is booming, offering solutions for power outages and energy efficiency. Companies are developing batteries that can power essential appliances during blackouts and store energy from solar panels. These batteries can also be used to take advantage of time-of-use pricing, saving on utility bills. While the initial investment can be significant, the long-term benefits of battery-powered living are becoming more appealing, especially as electric vehicles with bidirectional charging capabilities emerge. Despite potential setbacks from the Trump administration, the home battery revolution is gaining momentum.</p>

          <p>Clean energy is becoming the dominant way to add electricity to the grid, driven by affordability and the need for more energy. However, political, market, and technological forces could slow down this shift, including tariffs, economic uncertainty, regulations, an aging power grid, and competition from dirty energy. The Trump administration's tariffs and potential cuts to clean energy support could make clean energy less affordable and hinder its growth. Despite these challenges, the tools for building a net-zero economy are improving, and the US has advantages to play, particularly in battery technology.</p>

This system would differ significantly from Israel's Iron Dome, as it aims to counter long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. The concept involves using satellites to detect and intercept missiles early in their flight, but experts warn that a large constellation of satellites would be required, making the project costly and potentially sparking a new arms race with Russia and China.</p>

          <p>An Israeli drone strike south of Beirut killed Hussein Atawi, a leading commander from the Sunni Islamist group Jama'a Islamiya's armed branch, the Fajr Forces. The Fajr Forces had fired rockets at Israel during the previous year's war. This strike is part of a series of ongoing strikes by Israel on Lebanese territory, primarily targeting fighters from Hezbollah or its arms depots, despite a ceasefire agreement. Lebanon, Hezbollah, and Jama'a Islamiya have condemned these strikes as violations of the truce and Lebanese sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A swimmer is missing following an extremely rare shark attack off the coast of northern Israel. The attack occurred near Hadera, where sharks are known to gather due to warm water discharged by a local power plant. While sharks are common in the area, fatal attacks are extremely rare, with no recorded fatalities since 1948. Police have closed the beach and are conducting a search for the missing man.</p>

          <p>German beer exports have decreased by 6% in the last decade, mirroring a more significant drop in domestic consumption, which has fallen by 15.1%. Despite the decline in sales, the number of breweries in Germany has increased over the same period. The Federal Statistical Office released these figures ahead of German Beer Day. While the reasons for the sinking demand are not explicitly stated, it aligns with a broader trend of decreasing alcohol consumption and growing health consciousness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar briefly fell below 140 yen for the first time since last September after President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not reducing interest rates. This decline was fueled by concerns that the central bank's independence would be undermined. The yen was also bought on speculation that the U.S. administration will urge Japan to address the yen's weakness against the dollar during upcoming finance minister meetings. The price of gold also hit an all-time high in yen terms, reflecting investor caution and a shift towards safe-haven assets.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been ordered to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after a federal judge granted temporary restraining orders in a case filed by the ACLU and other groups. The lawsuit alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), effectively ending students' statuses and making them deportable. Some of the students represented in the lawsuit were nearing graduation or were enrolled in work programs, and the judge ordered the administration to notify the court when it has complied.</p>

          <p>A survey of political scientists reveals widespread concern that the U.S. is moving towards authoritarianism. Experts point to Trump's attempts to expand executive power, attacks on the media and universities, and appointments of loyalists to key positions. While some disagree, many see parallels with countries like Hungary and Turkey, where leaders have eroded checks and balances. The concerns include the potential for biased elections and suppression of dissent, although some believe the American system is resilient enough to withstand these trends.</p>
