          <p>President Trump has suggested reopening and expanding the Alcatraz prison, emphasizing the need for judges who won't demand trials for every illegal immigrant due to the overwhelming number of cases. Trump views immigration policy overhaul as a top priority, citing delays caused by judges as a hindrance to deportations. He argues that lengthy trials for every criminal, including murderers, entering the country illegally are unsustainable and threaten national security. Trump believes the Supreme Court should support his stance to prevent the country's collapse, stressing the urgency of addressing immigration issues.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate skeptical of EU support for Ukraine, secured a significant victory in the first round of Romania's presidential election rerun. Simion, an admirer of Donald Trump, advocates for a strong NATO presence in Romania but opposes further financial aid to Ukrainian refugees, reflecting public resentment. His rise is causing unease in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow due to Romania's crucial role in weapon transit to Ukraine and NATO's air policing missions. The Trump administration had previously criticized Romania for annulling the initial election, adding further complexity to the political landscape.</p>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, Pakistan‚Äôs army chief, Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has taken a more assertive stance, shaping Pakistan's response with tough rhetoric. Munir's comments, including a reference to Kashmir as Pakistan's ‚Äújugular vein,‚Äù are seen as a reflection of his hard-line views shaped by his leadership roles in Pakistan's intelligence agencies and his belief in the religious nature of the conflict with India. As pressure mounts in India for a forceful response, the United States and the United Nations have urged de-escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbors, with India's Prime Minister Modi promising to pursue terrorists and their backers relentlessly. The article highlights the risk of escalation and the importance of international diplomacy in managing the crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice is suing Colorado and Denver, alleging that their "sanctuary laws" interfere with federal immigration enforcement, violating the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. The lawsuit argues that these policies protect migrants without legal status and limit cooperation with federal officials. The DOJ contends that Colorado's policies enabled the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA) to gain control in Aurora, though local officials dispute the extent of the gang's influence. Republicans in Congress have pressured Democratic-led cities to align with the Trump administration's immigration policies, including mass deportations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the United States, claiming that the American movie industry is dying and that foreign incentives for filmmakers pose a national security threat. He argues that these films carry messaging and propaganda, and that the US needs to prioritize movies made in America. While details remain unclear, the proposal has sparked concern in the global film industry, with countries like Australia and New Zealand vowing to defend their screen industries. The move follows Trump's broader trade disputes, which have already impacted the US movie industry through reduced access to the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to labor disputes and a debt crisis, forcing some pilots to seek alternative employment in the gig economy as food delivery drivers. The airline, backed by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs using Chinese-made aircraft. Analysts attribute the suspension to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed railway networks increasingly replace internal flights within Shaanxi, impacting Joy Air's cash flow and overall financial stability. The airline's struggles reflect broader challenges in the regional aviation sector amidst growing competition from alternative transportation options.</p>

          <h2>NYT Op-Ed: China Tech Is Starting to Pull Ahead in AI</h2>

          <p>Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu argue that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in various technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence, and has developed an edge in disseminating, commercializing, and manufacturing tech. They note that while the U.S. initially led in AI development with models like ChatGPT, China has swiftly developed cheap yet state-of-the-art competitors, with some Chinese models now surpassing U.S. versions in certain benchmarks. The authors emphasize the importance of the U.S. openly sharing more of its AI technologies and research, innovating faster, and doubling down on diffusing AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge in the AI race.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation revealed that three Bulgarians convicted of spying for Russia attended an event in the Palace of Westminster in May 2016. Orlin Roussev, Biser Dzhambazov, and Katrin Ivanova were present at a Brexit debate, photographed with representatives of European political parties. The spies, directed from Russia by Jan Marsalek, conducted surveillance operations across Europe targeting enemies of Vladimir Putin's regime. Email exchanges show Roussev was already in contact with Marsalek by the time of the event in Parliament. The incident raises concerns about security protocols and the potential for foreign interference within the UK's political system.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has likely fallen to the fourth-largest provider of official development assistance (ODA) among OECD members, with Britain reclaiming the third position, according to preliminary data. The United States remains the top donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations is attributed mainly to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with sharp increases in previous years when development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence, although it faces fiscal constraints due to its high public debt.</p>
